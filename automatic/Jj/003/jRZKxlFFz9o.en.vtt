here<00:00:06.359> is<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.569> 2005<00:00:07.410> Silverado<00:00:08.059> 5.3<00:00:09.059> liter

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
here is the 2005 Silverado 5.3 liter

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.949 
here is the 2005 Silverado 5.3 liter
engine<00:00:10.440> with<00:00:10.590> just<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.340> little<00:00:11.520> bit<00:00:11.760> over

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:11.959 
engine with just a little bit over

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.359 
engine with just a little bit over
42,000<00:00:12.959> miles<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.469> it

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:14.369 
42,000 miles on it

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.210 
42,000 miles on it
we<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.910> Auto<00:00:15.449> Check<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.110> so<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:16.770> verify<00:00:17.160> it

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
we have Auto Check and so we verify it

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.640 
we have Auto Check and so we verify it
by<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.520> VIN<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.109> fact<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.440> true

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
by the VIN that that is in fact the true

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.980 
by the VIN that that is in fact the true
mileage<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.460> find<00:00:20.669> very<00:00:20.849> few<00:00:21.029> low<00:00:21.660> mileage

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
mileage we find very few low mileage

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109 
mileage we find very few low mileage
engines<00:00:22.349> but<00:00:22.529> when<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:22.919> we<00:00:23.099> pick<00:00:23.849> them<00:00:23.999> up

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
engines but when we do we pick them up

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.359 
engines but when we do we pick them up
and<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.509> to<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.810> things<00:00:25.259> with<00:00:25.499> them<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:26.189> one

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and like to do things with them this one

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.359 
and like to do things with them this one
has<00:00:26.490> been<00:00:26.609> converted<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.029> an<00:00:27.210> ls1<00:00:27.779> style<00:00:28.710> it

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
has been converted to an ls1 style it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.770 
has been converted to an ls1 style it
uses<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.999> ls1<00:00:30.240> intake<00:00:30.810> fuel<00:00:31.380> rails<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
uses the ls1 intake fuel rails and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.600 
uses the ls1 intake fuel rails and
injectors<00:00:33.780> also<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> manual<00:00:34.890> throttle<00:00:35.460> body

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
injectors also a manual throttle body

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.690 
injectors also a manual throttle body
yes<00:00:36.290> 2005<00:00:37.290> came<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> electronic<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.340> one

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
yes 2005 came of the electronic this one

yes 2005 came of the electronic this one
has<00:00:38.820> been<00:00:39.000> converted<00:00:39.240> to<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> manual<00:00:39.960> which

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
has been converted to a manual which

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
has been converted to a manual which
means<00:00:40.830> it<00:00:40.950> has<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> new<00:00:41.310> harness<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
means it has a new harness on it and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.710 
means it has a new harness on it and
uses<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:43.830> red<00:00:44.010> blue<00:00:44.310> green<00:00:44.610> connector<00:00:45.540> type

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.300 
passenger side and move the tensioner up
top<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.450> have<00:01:06.450> an<00:01:06.600> idler<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.979> we

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
top here and have an idler there and we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310 
top here and have an idler there and we
have<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> short<00:01:08.789> belt<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.149> there<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:10.170> don't

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
have a short belt on there so we don't

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.770 
have a short belt on there so we don't
spend<00:01:10.679> the<00:01:10.920> power<00:01:11.789> string<00:01:12.060> pump<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> test

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
spend the power string pump on a test

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.359 
spend the power string pump on a test
and<00:01:13.020> we've<00:01:14.009> also<00:01:14.189> modified<00:01:16.310> its<00:01:17.310> oil<00:01:19.369> passage

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and we've also modified its oil passage

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.630 
and we've also modified its oil passage
here<00:01:20.749> to<00:01:21.749> an<00:01:21.929> adapted<00:01:22.649> 8<00:01:22.770> inch<00:01:22.950> pipe<00:01:23.189> hole<00:01:23.429> in

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
here to an adapted 8 inch pipe hole in

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.550 
here to an adapted 8 inch pipe hole in
there<00:01:23.789> so<00:01:23.999> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.299> Leon<00:01:24.569> a<00:01:24.630> manual<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.380> we

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there so you can Leon a manual like we

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.370 
there so you can Leon a manual like we
are<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.100> manual<00:01:27.060> gauge<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.689> electronic

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
are here manual gauge or electronic

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.120 
are here manual gauge or electronic
gauge<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.520> has<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> Corvette<00:01:30.329> c5<00:01:31.140> PAMP

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
gauge and this has the Corvette c5 PAMP

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.149 
gauge and this has the Corvette c5 PAMP
so<00:01:33.229> we'll<00:01:34.229> talk<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.439> about<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.920> after<00:01:35.130> we

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
so we'll talk more about it after we

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.679 
so we'll talk more about it after we
hear<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.490> rascal<00:01:35.850> run<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.270> sure<00:01:36.479> that's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
hear this rascal run I'm sure that's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
hear this rascal run I'm sure that's
what<00:01:36.810> y'all<00:01:37.020> won<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> check<00:01:38.880> engine

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
what y'all won here and the check engine

00:01:38.909 --> 00:02:20.240 
what y'all won here and the check engine
light<00:01:39.359> start<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> up

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.130 

you

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.070 

so<00:02:25.140> as<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.910> are<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.870> watch

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
so as you can see it are here and watch

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.199 
so as you can see it are here and watch
it<00:02:28.380> runs<00:02:28.590> pretty<00:02:28.770> good<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.000> fuel

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
it runs pretty good we have the fuel

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.760 
it runs pretty good we have the fuel
pump<00:02:30.420> relay<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.910> fuse<00:02:32.910> panel<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:34.230> data<00:02:34.440> port

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
pump relay the fuse panel the data port

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.559 
pump relay the fuse panel the data port
so<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.069> can<00:02:35.160> plug<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.670> use<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.910> tuner<00:02:36.360> or

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
so you can plug in use a tuner or

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.320 
so you can plug in use a tuner or
scanner<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.590> check<00:02:37.800> engine<00:02:37.980> soon<00:02:38.880> light<00:02:38.940> as

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
scanner the check engine soon light as

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.050 
scanner the check engine soon light as
you<00:02:39.480> saw<00:02:39.660> was<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.560> then<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.739> went<00:02:40.890> off<00:02:41.069> PCM

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
you saw was on and then it went off PCM
