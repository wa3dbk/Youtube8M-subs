00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
and they are their innovations will be

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.750 
and they are their innovations will be
so<00:04:03.810> spiffy<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.260> look<00:04:04.400> at<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.489> he<00:04:05.580> will<00:04:05.670> take

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
so spiffy I look at this he will take

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.680 
so spiffy I look at this he will take
you<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:05.940> even<00:04:06.180> if<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.300> like<00:04:06.420> something<00:04:06.570> on

you that even if you like something on

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.520 
you that even if you like something on
the<00:04:06.750> ground<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.050> technology<00:04:07.290> doesn't

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
the ground but the technology doesn't

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.509 
the ground but the technology doesn't
allow<00:04:07.680> for<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.040> what<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.250> hell<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.489> this

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
allow for that so what the hell is this

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.360 
allow for that so what the hell is this
shot<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:10.140> again<00:04:10.350> ashen<00:04:10.709> shots<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.040> guns<00:04:11.220> that
