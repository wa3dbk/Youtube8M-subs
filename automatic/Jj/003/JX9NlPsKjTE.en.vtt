 look pretentious and blatantly such 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 Headphones are bought for several years 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080
 forward because essentially wear 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.460
 extraneous noise 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.619
 however, much depends on 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.409
 anatomical features remote 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.140

 twisted wire suitable for any 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.070
 devices and much less confused 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.350
 as for the sound quality of the headphones then 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.479
 they despite professional breed 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.629

 weston w50 dima 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.350
 before cool but very detailed and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.120
 incredibly clear sound with a little 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.370
 emphasis on bass but sufficient 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.680
 development of medium and high frequencies 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.260
 This applies to uncompressed tracks. 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.050
 formats and purchases and let us go in order 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.490
 less paired with player sony walkman zx1 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.960
 everything is completely different 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.420
 the sound is much more deaf 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.460
 inexpressive not clean enough but 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.010
 this is already a problem player what you will learn 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.170
 from his review there is no doubt that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.000
 these headphones are great to play with 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.190
 more advanced audiophiles 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.860
 players are more than suitable for 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.570
 use of modern smartphones 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.820
 I donâ€™t like headphones 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.400
 for those who are looking for a warmer sound with 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.490
 less bass 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.140
 Is weston w50 worth its money for 28000 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.630
 rubles you can order various 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.150
 custom headphones created by cast 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.340
 of your ear entirely by this 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.930
 great convenience can be achieved but hardly 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.510
 whether these headphones can boast 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.250
 comparable and versatile they can 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.860
 to be much more fastidious to 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.570
 sound source and file is similar 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.420
 can be said about more expensive 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.040
 reinforcement and hybrid headphones here 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.010
 we have a very universal solution 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.200
 Perfectly contemporary 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.330
 smartphones even with compressed formats 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.800
 audio they fit even quite 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.780
 demanding users 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.610
 But for beginners in this business headphones 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.980
 definitely open up a brave new world 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.690
 pure music come back from which 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.690
 I don't want to go back
