cooker so here is my version of it

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.850 
cooker so here is my version of it
here's<00:00:11.570> where<00:00:11.869> the<00:00:12.080> chicken<00:00:12.379> is<00:00:12.530> going<00:00:12.680> to<00:00:12.740> go

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
here's where the chicken is going to go

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.699 
here's where the chicken is going to go
so<00:00:13.190> you<00:00:13.250> simply<00:00:13.549> may<00:00:14.299> be<00:00:14.360> added<00:00:14.809> dispenser<00:00:15.379> one

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
show you guys how to build this simple

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.770 
show you guys how to build this simple
machine<00:00:36.280> so<00:00:37.280> first<00:00:37.909> what<00:00:38.149> you<00:00:38.210> need<00:00:38.359> to<00:00:38.600> do<00:00:38.749> is

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
machine so first what you need to do is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.250 
machine so first what you need to do is
make<00:00:39.379> an<00:00:39.409> area<00:00:40.539> encasing<00:00:41.539> where<00:00:41.749> the<00:00:41.899> chicken

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
make an area encasing where the chicken

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.649 
make an area encasing where the chicken
is<00:00:42.350> going<00:00:42.499> to<00:00:42.559> go<00:00:42.679> and<00:00:42.999> what<00:00:43.999> you<00:00:44.179> need<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.390> do

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
is going to go and what you need to do

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.009 
is going to go and what you need to do
is<00:00:45.050> add<00:00:45.489> glass<00:00:46.489> panes<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.269> can<00:00:47.510> walk<00:00:47.809> up

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
is add glass panes so you can walk up

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.169 
is add glass panes so you can walk up
and<00:00:48.199> collect<00:00:48.499> off<00:00:48.679> the<00:00:48.890> item<00:00:49.219> while<00:00:49.819> still

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
and collect off the item while still

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.750 
and collect off the item while still
seeing<00:00:50.479> the<00:00:50.659> chicken<00:00:51.019> get<00:00:51.199> burned<00:00:51.499> and<00:00:51.800> this

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
seeing the chicken get burned and this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.869 
seeing the chicken get burned and this
is<00:00:52.940> also<00:00:53.679> another<00:00:54.679> reason<00:00:54.979> is<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:55.609> you<00:00:55.670> can

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
is also another reason is so you can

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.579 
is also another reason is so you can
actually<00:00:56.120> flint<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:56.839> steel<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.350> block<00:00:57.559> right

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
actually flint and steel the block right

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.729 
actually flint and steel the block right
here<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.510> then<00:00:59.510> what<00:00:59.780> you<00:00:59.899> want<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.139> do<00:01:00.289> is<00:01:00.499> dig

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
here and then what you want to do is dig

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.390 
here and then what you want to do is dig
down<00:01:00.979> three<00:01:01.339> one<00:01:01.940> two<00:01:02.269> three<00:01:02.870> add<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.920> sticky

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
down three one two three add a sticky

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.840 
down three one two three add a sticky
piston<00:01:04.580> with<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.089> block<00:01:05.390> on<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:06.100> now<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:07.640> have

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
piston with a block on it now you have

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.840 
piston with a block on it now you have
to<00:01:08.000> break<00:01:08.150> out<00:01:08.360> this<00:01:08.600> block<00:01:08.900> add<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:10.280> sticky

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
to break out this block add a sticky

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.930 
to break out this block add a sticky
piston<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.190> break<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.370> block<00:01:13.580> right<00:01:13.610> in

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
piston and break the block right in

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.470 
piston and break the block right in
front<00:01:14.120> of<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.770> adding<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.920> redstone<00:01:16.310> torch<00:01:16.480> now

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
front of it adding a redstone torch now

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.410 
front of it adding a redstone torch now
block<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.430> this<00:01:19.430> will<00:01:19.640> create<00:01:19.850> your<00:01:20.120> butt
