and<00:00:05.400> here's<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.580> space-age<00:00:06.299> crystal<00:00:06.870> set<00:00:07.109> it's

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
and here's a space-age crystal set it's

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.770 
and here's a space-age crystal set it's
a<00:00:07.319> crystal<00:00:07.770> growing<00:00:08.010> kit<00:00:08.400> it's<00:00:09.120> an<00:00:09.300> older<00:00:09.599> one

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
a crystal growing kit it's an older one

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.749 
a crystal growing kit it's an older one
we<00:00:09.929> found<00:00:10.170> at<00:00:10.349> an<00:00:10.440> estate<00:00:10.740> sale<00:00:10.980> says<00:00:11.280> shuttle

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
we found at an estate sale says shuttle

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.570 
we found at an estate sale says shuttle
and<00:00:11.940> Space<00:00:12.450> Lab<00:00:12.719> astronauts<00:00:13.530> let<00:00:14.190> me<00:00:14.280> flip<00:00:14.549> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and Space Lab astronauts let me flip it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.010 
and Space Lab astronauts let me flip it
around<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> back<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.000> says<00:00:18.119> ages<00:00:18.390> 12

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
around so on the back it says ages 12

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.450 
around so on the back it says ages 12
and<00:00:19.140> above<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:19.890> actually<00:00:20.010> not<00:00:20.340> gonna

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
and above now we're actually not gonna

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.070 
and above now we're actually not gonna
grow<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.000> crystals<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.600> kit<00:00:21.779> someone

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
grow the crystals in this kit someone

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.870 
grow the crystals in this kit someone
already<00:00:22.170> started<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.010> most<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.730> its

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
already started some of it most of its

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.269 
already started some of it most of its
pretty<00:00:24.119> intact<00:00:24.590> actually<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> tubes<00:00:26.099> are

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
pretty intact actually all the tubes are

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.710 
pretty intact actually all the tubes are
filled<00:00:26.460> except<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> blue<00:00:27.240> one<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.599> our

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
filled except for the blue one in our

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.800 
filled except for the blue one in our
set<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:29.550> says<00:00:29.789> shuttle<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.480> Space

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
set here so it says shuttle and Space

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.560

among<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> numerous<00:00:37.140> technical

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
among the numerous technical

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.410 
among the numerous technical
applications<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.460> such<00:00:38.640> crystals<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:39.210> even

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
applications for such crystals are even

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.780 
applications for such crystals are even
faster<00:00:39.660> computers<00:00:40.410> more<00:00:40.860> powerful<00:00:41.460> lasers

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
faster computers more powerful lasers

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.540 
faster computers more powerful lasers
and<00:00:41.969> better<00:00:42.510> solar<00:00:42.899> cells<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.190> let's<00:00:44.370> see

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and better solar cells so let's see

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.510 
and better solar cells so let's see
what's<00:00:44.730> inside<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.329> box<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.370> can

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
what's inside this box so we can

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.860 
what's inside this box so we can
actually<00:00:50.670> show<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> someone<00:00:51.719> already

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
actually show you that someone already

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
actually show you that someone already
started<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> crystals<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.789> kind<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
started the crystals which is kind of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.439 
started the crystals which is kind of
neat<00:00:55.670> first<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.820> got<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> get<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
neat first we got to get it out of the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.400 
neat first we got to get it out of the
box<00:00:58.250> there<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.370> go<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> basically<00:01:01.050> yeah<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
box there we go so basically yeah this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.470 
box there we go so basically yeah this
tube<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.280> tube<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.300> was

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
tube this tube here was the one that was

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.539 
tube this tube here was the one that was
empty<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:04.350> seems<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.830> everything<00:01:05.220> else<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
empty it seems like everything else is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.380 
empty it seems like everything else is
pretty<00:01:05.790> intact

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
pretty intact

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
pretty intact
there's<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> starters<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.460> I'll<00:01:08.549> do

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
there's the starters in here and I'll do

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
there's the starters in here and I'll do
the<00:01:08.909> other<00:01:08.939> tubes<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.900> rocks<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.380> don't

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the other tubes there's rocks that don't

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
the other tubes there's rocks that don't
have<00:01:10.710> any<00:01:10.860> crystals<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.270> here

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
have any crystals on it and then up here

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.300 
have any crystals on it and then up here
in<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.780> section<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:13.740> where<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.130> found

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
in this section that's where we found

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.600 
in this section that's where we found
some<00:01:14.610> crystals<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.150> were<00:01:15.270> already<00:01:15.479> started

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
some crystals that were already started

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
some crystals that were already started
let's<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:18.659> kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
let's see this one here kind of has a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730 
let's see this one here kind of has a
white<00:01:20.390> I'll<00:01:21.390> show<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> these<00:01:21.750> closer<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
white I'll show you these closer this

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
white I'll show you these closer this
one<00:01:22.950> has<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.340> blue<00:01:24.560> this<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:26.960> it's<00:01:27.960> like

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
one has the blue this one here it's like

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.039 
one has the blue this one here it's like
the<00:01:28.380> larger<00:01:28.860> yellow<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the larger yellow and then the one on

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.200 
the larger yellow and then the one on
the<00:01:31.170> end<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.030> that's

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the end here it's the one that's

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
the end here it's the one that's
probably<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.720> most<00:01:33.930> advanced<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.130> like

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
probably the most advanced and it's like

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
probably the most advanced and it's like
a<00:01:35.280> purplish<00:01:36.000> hue<00:01:36.650> let<00:01:37.650> me<00:01:37.710> show<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> those

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
a purplish hue let me show you those

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.850 
a purplish hue let me show you those
closer<00:01:38.479> okay<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.540> there's<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.290> starter

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
closer okay so there's the for starter

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.420 
closer okay so there's the for starter
crystals<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.240> has<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> white

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
crystals there this one has a white

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.569 
crystals there this one has a white
crystal<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> blue<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:47.280> one<00:01:47.430> has

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
crystal this is the blue this one has

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.859 
crystal this is the blue this one has
these<00:01:47.759> larger<00:01:48.390> yellowish<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:50.390> larger<00:01:51.390> chunks

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
these larger yellowish and larger chunks

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.800 
these larger yellowish and larger chunks
on<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.430> here<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.970> almost<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
on it and this one here is almost like a
