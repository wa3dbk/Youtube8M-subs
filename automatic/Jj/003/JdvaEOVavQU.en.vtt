a lot of people usually say comes on
replicas<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:58.750> that's<00:00:58.960> because<00:00:59.230> these<00:00:59.380> are

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
replicas now that's because these are

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.720 
replicas now that's because these are
actually<00:01:00.270> high<00:01:01.270> quality<00:01:01.780> replicas<00:01:02.260> um<00:01:02.700> that<00:01:03.700> I

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
actually high quality replicas um that I

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.190 
actually high quality replicas um that I
get<00:01:04.089> from<00:01:04.119> my<00:01:04.420> uncle<00:01:07.500> yeah<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:10.079> there<00:01:11.079> we<00:01:11.170> go

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
explain the differences between the

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.360 
explain the differences between the
boxes<00:01:18.490> now<00:01:19.300> some<00:01:19.720> people<00:01:19.840> say<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:20.440> the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
boxes now some people say that the

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.399 
boxes now some people say that the
replicas<00:01:22.150> come<00:01:22.300> in<00:01:22.390> grey<00:01:22.540> boxes<00:01:22.990> as<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:23.290> can

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
replicas come in grey boxes as you can

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.610 
replicas come in grey boxes as you can
see<00:01:23.590> this<00:01:23.740> one<00:01:23.950> is<00:01:24.070> great<00:01:24.250> but<00:01:25.260> what<00:01:26.260> I<00:01:26.290> really
