00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.959 
really I reckon she does a lot of work
for<00:00:08.010> them<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.309> have<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.610> say<00:00:10.370> they<00:00:11.370> were<00:00:11.400> finding

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
for them I have to say they were finding

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.110 
for them I have to say they were finding
out<00:00:12.120> finding<00:00:12.690> Nikolas<00:00:13.049> from<00:00:13.259> now<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.190> doing

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
out finding Nikolas from now and doing

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.599 
out finding Nikolas from now and doing
all<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.360> kind<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.750> thing<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:17.100> reckon<00:00:17.490> she

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
all that kind of thing so I reckon she

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.490 
all that kind of thing so I reckon she
does<00:00:17.789> most<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> work<00:00:18.270> oh<00:00:20.840> I<00:00:21.840> thought<00:00:22.170> she

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
does most of the work oh I thought she

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.700 
does most of the work oh I thought she
was<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:23.010> great<00:00:23.460> character<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.470> think<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
was a great character I think that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.419 
was a great character I think that
always<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.699> books<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.210> heroes<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.840> always

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
always in books the heroes are always

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.170 
always in books the heroes are always
perfect<00:00:29.429> always<00:00:29.910> seems<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:31.910> always<00:00:32.910> seem

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
perfect always seems to be always seem

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.770 
perfect always seems to be always seem
to<00:00:33.380> never<00:00:34.380> trip<00:00:34.770> up<00:00:34.950> when<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:35.940> anything<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
to never trip up when they do anything I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.560 
to never trip up when they do anything I
think<00:00:37.530> Hermione<00:00:37.890> has<00:00:38.190> something<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.940> she's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
think Hermione has something that she's

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.840 
think Hermione has something that she's
not<00:00:39.719> perfect<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.559> us<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.550> only<00:00:41.670> thing

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
not perfect with us and the only thing

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.930 
not perfect with us and the only thing
she<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.360> dances<00:00:42.930> read<00:00:43.649> books<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.280> this

stood there looking blank at them for

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.920 
stood there looking blank at them for
about<00:00:55.530> five<00:00:55.890> minutes<00:00:56.210> until<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.629> sunk

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
about five minutes until it really sunk

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.610 
about five minutes until it really sunk
in<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.010> oh<00:00:59.750> my<00:01:00.750> god<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.170> stood

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
in I was like oh my god I just stood

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.759 
in I was like oh my god I just stood
there<00:01:01.680> thought<00:01:02.609> no<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> dream<00:01:04.350> pinch

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
there thought no it's not a dream pinch

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.890 
there thought no it's not a dream pinch
me<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:07.890> started<00:01:08.220> happening

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
me and then it all started happening

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.640 
me and then it all started happening
that<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.670> very<00:01:11.670> scary

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
that was really it very scary

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.950 
that was really it very scary
it's<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.830> easy<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.400> thought<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> would<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.750> so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's not easy I thought it would be so

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
it's not easy I thought it would be so
much<00:01:16.170> easier<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.590> thought<00:01:16.799> it'd<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.340> know

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
much easier I thought it'd be you know

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.020 
much easier I thought it'd be you know
sort<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.590> couple<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.650> takes<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> days

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
sort of a couple of takes but the days

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
sort of a couple of takes but the days
along<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.930> hard<00:01:22.229> work<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.340> learn

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
along it's hard work you have to learn

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
along it's hard work you have to learn
lines<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.689> there<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:24.930> fifty<00:01:25.200> billion

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
lines and there are fifty billion

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
lines and there are fifty billion
trillion<00:01:26.040> million<00:01:26.610> things<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
trillion million things going on at the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359 
trillion million things going on at the
same<00:01:27.600> time<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> think<00:01:29.220> about

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
same time that you have to think about

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.969 
same time that you have to think about
like<00:01:30.119> hitting<00:01:30.450> your<00:01:30.570> marks<00:01:30.990> getting<00:01:31.770> your

like hitting your marks getting your

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
like hitting your marks getting your
line<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:32.729> time<00:01:33.000> making<00:01:33.659> sure

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
line right at the right time making sure

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.510 
line right at the right time making sure
you<00:01:34.079> step<00:01:34.320> into<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> light<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.369> face

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you step into the light so that the face

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.850 
you step into the light so that the face
doesn't<00:01:36.210> shadow<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.689> all<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.590> kind<00:01:37.829> of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
doesn't shadow you all that kind of

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
doesn't shadow you all that kind of
stuff<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.610> lot<00:01:38.759> harder<00:01:38.939> than<00:01:39.180> ever<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
stuff so it's a lot harder than ever and
