00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
a lot of good players we just don't

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.190 
a lot of good players we just don't
really<00:04:53.669> see<00:04:54.030> them<00:04:54.210> perform<00:04:54.600> well<00:04:54.930> enough

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
really see them perform well enough

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.870 
really see them perform well enough
every<00:04:55.590> single<00:04:55.770> week<00:04:56.040> yeah<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.730> is<00:04:56.850> really

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
every single week yeah it is really

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.490 
every single week yeah it is really
strange<00:04:57.419> that<00:04:57.630> we<00:04:57.750> can<00:04:57.870> see<00:04:58.020> them<00:04:58.140> make<00:04:58.320> so

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
strange that we can see them make so

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.110 
strange that we can see them make so
many<00:04:58.650> master<00:04:59.130> performances<00:04:59.760> and<00:04:59.850> then<00:04:59.970> just

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
many master performances and then just

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.400 
many master performances and then just
kind<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.419> next<00:05:00.600> week<00:05:00.750> fall<00:05:00.960> flat<00:05:01.169> it

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
kind of the next week fall flat it

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.780 
kind of the next week fall flat it
sometimes<00:05:01.860> depends<00:05:02.250> on<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.430> teams<00:05:02.610> they're

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
sometimes depends on the teams they're

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.520 
sometimes depends on the teams they're
playing<00:05:03.000> against<00:05:03.330> I<00:05:03.390> suppose<00:05:03.720> but<00:05:04.169> just<00:05:04.380> when

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
playing against I suppose but just when

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.650 
playing against I suppose but just when
you<00:05:04.590> have<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.770> night<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.250> day<00:05:05.490> it's<00:05:06.180> really

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
you have a night and day it's really

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.200 
you have a night and day it's really
really<00:05:06.990> weird<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:08.010> you<00:05:08.520> would<00:05:08.640> expect<00:05:08.850> them

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
really weird that you would expect them

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.730 
really weird that you would expect them
to<00:05:09.300> be<00:05:09.419> a<00:05:09.450> little<00:05:09.660> bit<00:05:09.750> closer<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.320> eat<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.710> the
