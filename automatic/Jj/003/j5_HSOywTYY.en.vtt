place them however you want to I'm just

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.920 
place them however you want to I'm just
placing<00:02:24.270> them<00:02:24.570> in<00:02:24.780> three<00:02:25.020> different<00:02:25.290> sections

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.640 

only<00:02:30.470> us

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
only us

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.280 
only us
and<00:02:32.069> then<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.730> glued<00:02:33.000> down<00:02:33.239> this<00:02:33.420> felt<00:02:33.780> bottom

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
and then I glued down this felt bottom

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.690 
and then I glued down this felt bottom
just<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.709> would<00:02:34.830> look<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:35.129> bit<00:02:35.370> cuter

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
just so it would look a little bit cuter

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.820 
just so it would look a little bit cuter
and<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.239> also<00:02:36.450> made<00:02:37.019> these<00:02:37.349> sides<00:02:37.590> more

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
and I also made these sides more

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.039 
and I also made these sides more
colorful<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.610> put<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.819> some<00:02:39.000> color<00:02:39.239> paper<00:02:39.569> so

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
colorful and put on some color paper so

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.970 
colorful and put on some color paper so
that<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.560> would<00:02:40.680> look<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.950> lot<00:02:41.099> cuter<00:02:41.310> again

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.190 

and<00:02:46.280> just<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:46.940> secure<00:02:47.270> everything<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.840> taped

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
and just to secure everything I taped

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.020 
and just to secure everything I taped
these<00:02:48.470> sides<00:02:48.740> down<00:02:49.040> with<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.580> really<00:02:49.730> cute

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
these sides down with this really cute

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.150 
these sides down with this really cute
washi<00:02:50.270> tape<00:02:50.630> just<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.230> once<00:02:51.410> again<00:02:51.530> make<00:02:52.010> it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
washi tape just to once again make it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.140 
washi tape just to once again make it
look<00:02:52.370> even<00:02:52.610> cuter

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.240 

and<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:58.930> just<00:02:59.110> stuck<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.590> sides<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.070> it

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
and then I just stuck the sides in it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.500 
and then I just stuck the sides in it
didn't<00:03:00.430> glue<00:03:00.550> them<00:03:00.730> down<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:01.120> because<00:03:01.390> they

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
didn't glue them down just because they

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.750 
didn't glue them down just because they
were<00:03:01.600> pretty<00:03:01.750> secure<00:03:02.200> on<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> felt<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:06.280> then

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
were pretty secure on the felt and then

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.520 
were pretty secure on the felt and then
I<00:03:06.820> took<00:03:06.880> pink<00:03:07.300> color<00:03:07.570> paper<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.050> cover<00:03:08.200> up<00:03:08.410> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
I took pink color paper to cover up the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.200 
I took pink color paper to cover up the
rest<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.860> sides<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:09.820> realized<00:03:09.970> I

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
rest of the sides and I just realized I

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.700 
rest of the sides and I just realized I
should<00:03:10.390> have<00:03:10.480> also<00:03:10.660> put<00:03:10.960> that<00:03:11.050> tape<00:03:11.380> around

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
should have also put that tape around

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.500 
should have also put that tape around
the<00:03:12.100> edges<00:03:12.460> of<00:03:12.490> the<00:03:12.640> box<00:03:12.850> because<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.390> would

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the edges of the box because it would

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.850 
the edges of the box because it would
have<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:13.750> tied<00:03:13.930> together<00:03:14.140> but<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.530> didn't

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
have just tied together but I didn't

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.470 
have just tied together but I didn't
realize<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.280> at<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.400> time<00:03:15.640> but<00:03:16.030> of<00:03:16.150> course<00:03:16.360> if

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
realize it at the time but of course if

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.790 
realize it at the time but of course if
you<00:03:16.570> want<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:16.780> can<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.020> that<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:17.380> not<00:03:17.530> do<00:03:17.680> that

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
you want you can do that or not do that

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.930 
you want you can do that or not do that
