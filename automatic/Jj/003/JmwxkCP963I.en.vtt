1.2<00:00:24.539> k<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.289> believe<00:00:25.710> /<00:00:26.039> drop<00:00:26.340> off<00:00:26.640> /<00:00:27.090> kill<00:00:27.500> and

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
1.2 k I believe / drop off / kill and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.370 
1.2 k I believe / drop off / kill and
they're<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:29.550> easy<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:30.779> things<00:00:31.050> really

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
they're really easy so all things really

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.139 
they're really easy so all things really
easy<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:33.829> basically<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> chaotic

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
easy so basically if you have a chaotic

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.420 
easy so basically if you have a chaotic
maul<00:00:36.450> that's<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.050> best<00:00:37.500> thing<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.829> use<00:00:38.040> on

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
maul that's the best thing you use on

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.959 
maul that's the best thing you use on
him<00:00:38.640> because<00:00:39.180> he<00:00:39.329> has<00:00:39.780> no<00:00:39.989> weakness<00:00:40.379> um<00:00:40.620> if<00:00:41.550> you

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
him because he has no weakness um if you

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.779 
him because he has no weakness um if you
do<00:00:42.420> dry<00:00:42.840> wars<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> really<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
do dry wars and if you really want to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.389 
do dry wars and if you really want to
waste<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:45.149> dry<00:00:45.510> boars<00:00:45.780> head<00:00:45.960> I'm<00:00:46.739> sure<00:00:47.129> they

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
waste your dry boars head I'm sure they

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.459 
waste your dry boars head I'm sure they
would<00:00:47.550> work<00:00:47.760> out<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.960> were<00:00:49.140> even

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
would work out just as they were even

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.600 
would work out just as they were even
there<00:00:49.620> than<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> mall<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.250> they<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
there than the mall because they have a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.069 
there than the mall because they have a
better<00:00:51.860> accuracy<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.699> other<00:00:54.449> than<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
better accuracy but other than that you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.680 
better accuracy but other than that you
could<00:00:55.289> range<00:00:55.559> him<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.129> prefer<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
could range him if you prefer on the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.209 
could range him if you prefer on the
only<00:00:57.899> thing<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.649> hit<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.100> this

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
only thing you all not hit you with this

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.060 
only thing you all not hit you with this
is<00:00:59.460> his<00:00:59.699> melee<00:01:00.059> attack<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.920> will

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
is his melee attack then so you will

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.010 
is his melee attack then so you will
take<00:01:02.250> less<00:01:02.460> damage<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:05.280> use<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.750> soul<00:01:06.750> split

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
take less damage I just use a soul split

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.780 
take less damage I just use a soul split
and<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.920> completely<00:01:08.369> fills<00:01:09.330> me<00:01:09.540> back<00:01:09.720> up<00:01:09.960> now

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
and that completely fills me back up now

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
and that completely fills me back up now
for<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.290> be

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
for this for right now I will not be

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.060 
for this for right now I will not be
hopping<00:01:13.860> worlds<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.869> best<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.530> have

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
hopping worlds but it is best to have

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.390 
hopping worlds but it is best to have
two<00:01:17.939> or<00:01:18.479> three<00:01:18.509> designated<00:01:18.990> worlds<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.159> you

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
two or three designated worlds that you

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.649 
two or three designated worlds that you
hop<00:01:20.700> back<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.360> forth<00:01:22.220> 24<00:01:23.220> kills<00:01:23.490> because<00:01:24.090> his

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
hop back and forth 24 kills because his

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.290 
hop back and forth 24 kills because his
spawn<00:01:25.049> rate<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.820> slow

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
spawn rate is a little bit slow

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.090 
spawn rate is a little bit slow
you<00:01:29.300> waste<00:01:29.660> quite<00:01:30.200> a<00:01:30.230> bit<00:01:30.410> of<00:01:30.500> time<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.920> between

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
you waste quite a bit of time in between

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.930 
you waste quite a bit of time in between
kills<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.540> right<00:01:32.840> now<00:01:33.100> what<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.160> do<00:01:34.280> is<00:01:34.430> I'd<00:01:34.700> hop

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
kills so right now what I do is I'd hop

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.410 
kills so right now what I do is I'd hop
to<00:01:35.210> another<00:01:35.240> world<00:01:35.750> I'll<00:01:36.500> show<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.800> app<00:01:37.520> after
