00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.390
 hi of the money 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.720
 then finally crochet video that b 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.240
 and that I failed to load it and a 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.220
 very simple video I show you how 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.950
 make an amigurumi letter 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.320
 of course there are many on the web 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.050
 there is no scheme for making letters 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.419
 there are no schemes as easy as I have it 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.520
 I then realized this scheme vi 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.280
 it will also allow others to be created 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.060
 letters with the way I realized 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.880
 this letter 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.430
 first I show you this in mine 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.329
 is the letter v that I made with 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.239
 my scheme is a friend rumi 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.399
 very tender look at how cute and here 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.820
 I show you how to make the letter f 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.670
 that I dedicate to my sister my 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.780
 little sister she also knows this two 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.969
 different colors 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.609
 the only thing I didn't put here 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.650
 little eyes and the ciocchetto because me 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.310
 like it more so I have to tell you the truth 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.100
 like sense I leave you to video tutorial 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.670
 I hope there is inspiration to the 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.280
 next tau design is uphill or begin 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.610
 I work with 14 chains 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.560
 I started going there right now we have to 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.320
 work in the third indigo chain i 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.649
 readers we have the thread 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.060
 we count the first the second and the third 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:36.640
 we count crochet and work 12 stitches 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.479
 low we have to work 12 low meshes 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.759
 of the first lap finished the first lap of 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.250
 12 low jerseys now let's do one 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.969
 chain and we also do a second 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.219
 always round 12 low and 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.460
 we continue also with the third and last one 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:58.000
 around then three rounds of 12 low stitches 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.149
 always remember to start a chain 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.869
 new ride 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.370
 once realized ii three rounds of 12 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.030
 low meshes 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:14.110
 nor see we have to make 3 shirts 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:19.510
 low then dear in I have already turned the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:24.160
 work first jersey low second jersey 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.160
 low third low jersey we must 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.540
 repeat this step to create the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.600
 letter f 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.180
 ps ge for seven genes and then for seven 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.040
 turn the work again 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:43.180
 falls into the first second low shirt 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:47.410
 low mesh third low meshes the 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.830
 see it for seven and seven laps and then vi 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.840
 I show how many letters you can 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.950
 do with this scheme of the letter f 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.060
 in fact I made seven laps 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.850
 of 3 low meshes as you can see 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.950
 now I will try to show up close 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.500
 not only will the letter f be formed 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.959
 you can form the letter c naturally 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.880
 creating three more laps for this other 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:19.060
 always side 67 laps of low meyer 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.630
 then 3 low meshes for seven rounds 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.820
 also from this side you will have the letter c 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.459
 you can have the rules letter and the 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.160
 letter i play this my scheme you can 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.459
 create these letters 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.140
 so I tried to make it 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.180
 the simplest possible emblem now 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.220
 cut a long thread I recommend 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.280
 quite long because it will then serve for 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.970
 sew the two parts together now 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.730
 let's go create on the other side of the 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.380
 letter this final part because 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.090
 realize the complete effect now I do n't 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.620
 safety pin because I am 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.640
 Forgot 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:08.500
 we must count on this other side 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:12.670
 from the final part 123456789 in the ninth 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.769
 jersey we have to work in the junta 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.230
 of the thread or to pick up the thread 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.989
 that we have cut and I do not do it 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.949
 see how I do it because maybe 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.960
 remains complicated because my way of 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:28.380
 add the thread and we work again 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.449
 at 3 to 3 3 stitches as low as 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.710
 we did this on the other side for 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.599
 five laps then I'll show you how to make one 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.729
 once the new low meshes have been counted 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.349
 we must add the thread I do not 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.419
 I showed how I do it because 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.930
 maybe it stays more complicated here 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:50.460
 once of all the site the beginning 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:57.900
 the first low jersey the second jersey 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:05:01.110
 low and the third low jersey I hope that 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.199
 you see let's see if I can 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.460
 get a little closer 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:12.750
 I make a chain around the work and 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:18.569
 I make a low shirt the second 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:20.699
 low jersey and the third low jersey io 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.409
 here with this kind of grandma I don't 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.599
 I find it not at all good 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.270
 how can you see if it is forming the 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:30.719
 letter f so we have to make 3 shirts 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.520
 low for five turns while the part 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.520
 above we worked for more laps 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.960
 we work this for five rounds and 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.820
 we must have this turn out therefore 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:49.169
 Once completed tell you that 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:50.969
 we have to finish the 5 let's see if 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.259
 I can show the five laps of 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:56.880
 low meshes and 3 low meshes for five 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.130
 laps we find a letter f 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.650
 of course remember to cut the threads 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.710
 it is quite long because we will need it 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:08.580
 to cook it also prepared the second one 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.800
 equal part without obviously here you can 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.909
 cut the wires I left these 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.680
 bits of and then I'll take off the last one 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:19.949
 overlay the two letters to create 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.229
 the romy friend and here we have to cook it myself 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:24.569
 I will not show you how I use why not 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:28.350
 I recommend it 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:32.650
 so we have to get out the letters 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.389
 between them, however, once sewn before 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.610
 completely close the job 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:40.080
 we have to stuff colored padding 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:43.210
 and then we go to decorate the letter f 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.449
 completed and I'll show you the 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.030
 second part here the output of which 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.139
 I wanted to decorate my home for fabiola 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.940
 little sister 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.820
 but then I said to myself why I owe it 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.710
 decorate so too pretty and so 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.500
 I left it so I didn't put it 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:02.919
 decorations committed on the letter v io 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:06.280
 I hope that it is clear that there is 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.229
 especially liked because I dedicate it to 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.840
 all of you all my writings of mine 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.700
 channel and even non-members because it is not 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.550
 a nice thing I wanted to share 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.550
 with you next video I don't say anything 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.620
 no surprises I won't even tell you if 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.870
 crochet beads I say nothing 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:27.090
 let us make a kiss in a year 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.090
 at the next hello of salts treasures hello
