interesting<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.610> for

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
interesting but I think that's also for

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.530 
interesting but I think that's also for
multiple<00:01:51.990> players<00:01:52.470> anyway<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.579> will<00:01:54.060> take<00:01:54.299> some

time and look through the rest of these
I'm<00:01:56.549> sure<00:01:56.579> there's<00:01:56.939> some<00:01:57.149> other<00:01:57.210> good<00:01:57.479> things

progress tokens I think I think these

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.900 
progress tokens I think I think these
are<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.930> pieces<00:02:52.170> Nessus<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:53.519> put<00:02:53.730> together

the<00:02:54.390> threat<00:02:54.780> tracker<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:56.569> then<00:02:57.569> these<00:02:57.870> must

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the threat tracker and then these must

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:06.580 
the threat tracker and then these must
be<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.319> cards<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:02.840> we<00:03:03.840> will<00:03:04.110> open<00:03:05.099> this<00:03:05.250> up
