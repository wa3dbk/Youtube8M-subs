and everything on its functional every

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.080 
and everything on its functional every
every<00:04:32.620> SRT<00:04:33.040> even<00:04:33.250> though<00:04:33.310> it<00:04:33.460> may<00:04:33.580> look<00:04:33.790> like<00:04:33.850> a

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
every SRT even though it may look like a

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.060 
every SRT even though it may look like a
spoiler<00:04:34.450> ad<00:04:34.690> on<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.960> all<00:04:35.080> this<00:04:35.290> these<00:04:35.740> cars<00:04:35.980> are

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
spoiler ad on it all this these cars are

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.190 
spoiler ad on it all this these cars are
not<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.370> be<00:04:36.460> limited<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:36.970> they<00:04:37.570> can<00:04:37.960> go<00:04:38.050> up<00:04:38.140> to

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
not to be limited so they can go up to

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.280 
not to be limited so they can go up to
174<00:04:38.860> miles<00:04:39.070> per<00:04:39.280> hour<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:39.790> we<00:04:40.780> tune<00:04:40.960> forero

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
174 miles per hour so we tune forero

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.720 
174 miles per hour so we tune forero
first<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.860> then<00:04:42.010> we<00:04:42.160> added<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.550> little

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
first and then we added a little

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.460 
first and then we added a little
distinction<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.390> make<00:04:43.510> them<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.050> know<00:04:44.080> so

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
distinction to make them you know so

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.660 
distinction to make them you know so
someone<00:04:44.710> who's<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.830> car<00:04:45.070> guy<00:04:45.220> can<00:04:45.400> look<00:04:45.520> at<00:04:45.610> the

someone who's a car guy can look at the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.340 
someone who's a car guy can look at the
car<00:04:45.880> 100<00:04:46.270> feet<00:04:46.420> away<00:04:46.510> go<00:04:46.720> that's<00:04:46.930> necessary

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350
