still doing our 24-hour watertight test

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.439 
still doing our 24-hour watertight test
but<00:00:17.369> we're<00:00:17.520> nearly<00:00:17.730> done<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.420> now

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
working on preparing the rest of the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.429 
working on preparing the rest of the
system<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> install<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.779> blocks<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
system for the install of the blocks and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:40.040 
system for the install of the blocks and
so<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:33.230> what<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:36.410> gtx<00:00:37.820> 285<00:00:39.050> bfg

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so on what we have here is a gtx 285 bfg

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.569 
so on what we have here is a gtx 285 bfg
that<00:00:40.350> we've<00:00:40.530> taken<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.219> air<00:00:41.489> cooler<00:00:42.120> off<00:00:43.579> and

that we've taken the air cooler off and
here's<00:00:45.300> your<00:00:45.510> actual<00:00:45.899> card<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> the

business end as you can see this is a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.160 
business end as you can see this is a
copper<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.850> aluminum<00:00:51.329> block<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.870> did

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
copper and aluminum block what we did

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.420 
copper and aluminum block what we did
was<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.820> back<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.500> bunch<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
was on the back of this is a bunch of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.389 
was on the back of this is a bunch of
screws<00:00:59.789> there's<00:01:00.149> 12<00:01:00.510> screws<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.100> see

screws there's 12 screws as you can see

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
screws there's 12 screws as you can see
they<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:02.820> spring<00:01:03.570> loaded<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.860> you're

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
they are spring loaded so if you're

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.980 
they are spring loaded so if you're
doing<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> 280<00:01:05.850> 285<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:09.479> careful<00:01:09.659> they

necessary in addition at the end where

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.030 
necessary in addition at the end where
the<00:01:26.400> bracket<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.330> there's<00:01:27.960> two<00:01:28.229> screws<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
end that you have to go to do before you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
end that you have to go to do before you
can<00:01:30.869> separate<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:32.100> cooling<00:01:32.610> vote<00:01:32.850> air

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
can separate the cooling vote air

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.920 
can separate the cooling vote air
cooling<00:01:33.420> block<00:01:33.720> from<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> card<00:01:35.630> now<00:01:36.630> we're

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
cooling block from the card now we're

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
cooling block from the card now we're
going<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> go<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> single<00:01:38.420> bracket<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.600> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
going to go with a single bracket so I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
going to go with a single bracket so I
decided<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.229> take<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.590> double<00:01:40.979> bracket<00:01:41.340> off<00:01:41.520> I

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
decided to take the double bracket off I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.050 
decided to take the double bracket off I
got<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> single<00:01:42.869> bracket<00:01:43.320> from<00:01:43.470> danger<00:01:43.920> down<00:01:44.100> so

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
got a single bracket from danger down so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
got a single bracket from danger down so
I<00:01:45.090> took<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.509> hex<00:01:45.810> screws<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> then

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
I took these hex screws out and then

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.490 
I took these hex screws out and then
there's<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.490> little<00:01:47.640> side<00:01:48.149> tiny<00:01:48.810> screw<00:01:49.320> in

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
there's one little side tiny screw in

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
there's one little side tiny screw in
the<00:01:49.649> side<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> take<00:01:51.000> off

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.170 
bit this isn't a paste it's actually
thermal<00:02:20.010> tape<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.730> has<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.940> be

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
thermal tape and that all has to be

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.430 
thermal tape and that all has to be
cleaned<00:02:24.569> cleaned<00:02:25.410> off<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.280> end<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.760> then

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
cleaned cleaned off on this end and then

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.770 
cleaned cleaned off on this end and then
when<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.650> put<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.190> in<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:30.060> water<00:02:30.390> block

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
when we put this in the water block

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.720 
when we put this in the water block
we'll<00:02:31.140> put<00:02:31.380> our<00:02:31.530> own<00:02:31.560> thermal<00:02:32.280> tape<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
we'll put our own thermal tape the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.400 
we'll put our own thermal tape the
reason<00:02:33.030> they<00:02:33.150> use<00:02:33.299> thermal<00:02:33.569> tape<00:02:33.930> instead<00:02:34.230> a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
reason they use thermal tape instead a

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.979 
reason they use thermal tape instead a
thermal<00:02:34.860> paste<00:02:35.160> is<00:02:38.120> basically<00:02:39.120> because<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
thermal paste is basically because the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.350 
thermal paste is basically because the
the<00:02:42.989> accuracy<00:02:43.830> with<00:02:44.100> which<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:44.640> place<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the accuracy with which they place the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.699 
the accuracy with which they place the
height<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:46.140> these<00:02:46.620> RAM<00:02:47.220> blocks<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:48.440> not<00:02:49.440> that

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
height of these RAM blocks is not that

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.509 
height of these RAM blocks is not that
precise<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.780> they<00:02:52.049> use<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.590> tape<00:02:53.130> which

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
precise and so they use this tape which

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.720 
precise and so they use this tape which
is<00:02:53.730> thicker<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.750> make<00:02:54.959> up<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.319> difference

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
is thicker to make up the difference

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.729 
is thicker to make up the difference
between<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.940> distance<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.080> block<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
between the distance of the block and

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.460 
between the distance of the block and
where<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.820> or<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.660> RAM<00:03:00.840> blocks<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.380> these

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
where the or the RAM blocks and these

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.479 
where the or the RAM blocks and these
other<00:03:01.680> heads<00:03:01.980> are<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:04.410> pretty<00:03:04.799> damn<00:03:05.070> sloppy

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
other heads are it's pretty damn sloppy

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.759 
other heads are it's pretty damn sloppy
oh<00:03:05.910> one<00:03:06.420> other<00:03:06.540> note<00:03:06.810> when<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.140> take<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.530> off

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
oh one other note when you take this off

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.970 
oh one other note when you take this off
you'll<00:03:08.519> also<00:03:08.730> need<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.180> unplug<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.079> little

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
you'll also need to unplug the little

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.130 
you'll also need to unplug the little
fan<00:03:11.220> gizmo<00:03:11.760> right<00:03:12.000> here<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.630> little<00:03:12.900> stiff

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
fan gizmo right here it's a little stiff

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.210 
fan gizmo right here it's a little stiff
but<00:03:13.170> will<00:03:13.470> come<00:03:13.650> off<00:03:13.799> fairly<00:03:14.040> readily<00:03:14.400> um<00:03:16.220> this

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
but will come off fairly readily um this

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.420 
but will come off fairly readily um this

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
design that bfg uses and you should be

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.470 
design that bfg uses and you should be
warned<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.459> there<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.299> version<00:03:30.870> two<00:03:31.440> gtx

of 285 gtx out there and you'll need to

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.050 
of 285 gtx out there and you'll need to

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
get a different block for that danger

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.879 
get a different block for that danger
den<00:03:39.239> does<00:03:39.450> make<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> second<00:03:40.139> block<00:03:40.290> for<00:03:40.560> version

two so make sure that you know which
you've<00:03:43.650> got<00:03:44.359> version<00:03:45.359> twos<00:03:45.540> are<00:03:45.750> just<00:03:46.049> coming

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
you've got version twos are just coming

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.809 
you've got version twos are just coming
out<00:03:46.500> right<00:03:46.709> now<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:48.299> PNY<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:51.170> EVGA

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
out right now I think PNY and EVGA

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.220 
out right now I think PNY and EVGA
and<00:03:53.799> bfg<00:03:54.799> just<00:03:55.069> got<00:03:55.249> there's<00:03:56.170> pretty<00:03:57.170> much

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
and bfg just got there's pretty much

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.899 
and bfg just got there's pretty much
everything<00:03:57.650> else<00:03:57.739> should<00:03:57.889> be<00:03:58.040> virgin<00:03:58.489> one<00:03:58.670> but

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
everything else should be virgin one but

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.819 
everything else should be virgin one but
you<00:03:58.999> want<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.299> verify<00:03:59.599> that<00:04:00.139> first<00:04:00.499> before<00:04:00.620> you

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
you want to verify that first before you

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:07.509 
you want to verify that first before you
go<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.069> get<00:04:01.159> your<00:04:01.310> blog<00:04:05.290> once<00:04:06.290> we're<00:04:06.650> done

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
go and get your blog once we're done

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.099 
go and get your blog once we're done
cleaning<00:04:07.999> this<00:04:08.299> up<00:04:08.650> we'll<00:04:09.650> apply<00:04:10.010> some<00:04:10.609> new

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
cleaning this up we'll apply some new

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:17.319 
cleaning this up we'll apply some new
Arctic<00:04:12.250> ceramic<00:04:14.079> and<00:04:15.220> in<00:04:16.220> some<00:04:16.759> new<00:04:16.910> thermal

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
Arctic ceramic and in some new thermal

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.969 
Arctic ceramic and in some new thermal
tape<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.720> then<00:04:17.810> we'll<00:04:17.989> show<00:04:18.199> a<00:04:18.229> picture<00:04:18.650> of

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
tape and then we'll show a picture of

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.339 
tape and then we'll show a picture of
that<00:04:20.739> but<00:04:21.739> this<00:04:22.190> is<00:04:22.370> just<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.699> still<00:04:23.000> life<00:04:23.349> for

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
that but this is just a still life for

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.540 
that but this is just a still life for
right<00:04:24.500> now<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:24.860> can<00:04:24.979> see<00:04:25.160> what<00:04:25.370> we're

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
right now so you can see what we're

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.460 
right now so you can see what we're
doing<00:04:25.880> hopefully<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:26.870> would<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.110> ready<00:04:27.320> to

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
doing hopefully that would be ready to

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.499 
doing hopefully that would be ready to
go<00:04:27.650> by<00:04:27.680> tomorrow<00:04:28.310> when<00:04:28.880> we're<00:04:29.060> done<00:04:29.210> with<00:04:29.419> our
