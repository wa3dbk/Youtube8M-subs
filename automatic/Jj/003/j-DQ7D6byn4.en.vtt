zombies<00:00:44.340> before<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.789> got<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.360> still<00:00:45.570> there

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
zombies before I got it it's still there

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.000 
zombies before I got it it's still there
it's<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.379> going<00:00:46.649> anywhere

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it's not going anywhere

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 
it's not going anywhere
kill<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> few<00:00:47.700> zombies<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.780> ended<00:00:49.079> up

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
kill a few zombies and that ended up

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.220 
kill a few zombies and that ended up
getting<00:00:49.860> me<00:00:49.950> an<00:00:50.250> additional<00:00:50.969> 500<00:00:51.660> points<00:00:52.079> or

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.760 
getting me an additional 500 points or
so<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.550> course<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.770> rebuild

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so and then of course just rebuild

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.520 
so and then of course just rebuild
whenever<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.910> wherever<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.780> one

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
whenever you can wherever you can one

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
whenever you can wherever you can one
because<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.520> gets<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.850> points<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.359> two<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
because it gets you points and two it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.139 
because it gets you points and two it
helps<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.260> live<00:01:01.500> longer<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.699> die<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
helps you live longer and if you die you

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.840 
helps you live longer and if you die you
can't<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:04.080> points<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.460> lose<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:05.820> your

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
can't get points so you lose all your

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.980 
can't get points so you lose all your
points<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.360> you're<00:01:06.479> dead

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
points when you're dead

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.649 
points when you're dead
you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.560> take<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> grave<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.090> just

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you can take them to the grave so just

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.969 
you can take them to the grave so just
rebuild<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.350> when<00:01:10.590> you're<00:01:10.710> rebuilding

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
rebuild and when you're rebuilding

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.700 
rebuild and when you're rebuilding
always<00:01:11.580> face<00:01:11.880> outward<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
always face outward and this is the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.580 
always face outward and this is the
easiest<00:01:14.340> way<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.909> points<00:01:15.150> wreck<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.350> whole

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
one-shot kill but if you hit some

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.990 
one-shot kill but if you hit some
zombies<00:02:45.470> in<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.950> upper<00:02:46.220> face<00:02:46.459> it's<00:02:46.850> a

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.370 
one-shot kill for some of the later
rounds<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:49.940> that's<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.600> little<00:02:50.780> weird<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.170> never

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
rounds so that's a little weird I never

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.199 
rounds so that's a little weird I never
saw<00:02:51.709> that<00:02:51.739> before<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.640> like<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:53.060> they're

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
saw that before but I like that they're

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.080 
saw that before but I like that they're
doing<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:54.350> can<00:02:54.530> kind<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.830> aim<00:02:55.070> when<00:02:55.940> you

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
doing that you can kind of aim when you

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.710 
doing that you can kind of aim when you
punch<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.450> zombie<00:02:56.480> in<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.530> face<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:59.090> that's

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
punch a zombie in a face so that that's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.440

another<00:03:23.030> little<00:03:23.989> tip<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:24.620> I'm<00:03:25.459> fighting<00:03:25.820> off

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
another little tip so I'm fighting off

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.490 
another little tip so I'm fighting off
the<00:03:26.030> zombies<00:03:26.390> trying<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.750> save<00:03:26.930> some<00:03:27.140> points

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
the zombies trying to save some points

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.050 
the zombies trying to save some points
and<00:03:27.620> punching<00:03:28.070> them<00:03:28.190> I'm<00:03:28.549> shooting<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.910> ray<00:03:29.030> gun

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
and punching them I'm shooting a ray gun

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.140 
and punching them I'm shooting a ray gun
so<00:03:29.420> they're<00:03:29.570> too<00:03:29.720> powerful<00:03:30.070> just<00:03:31.070> to<00:03:31.220> get<00:03:31.370> down

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
so they're too powerful just to get down

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.440 
so they're too powerful just to get down
by<00:03:32.570> one<00:03:32.780> ray<00:03:32.989> gun<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.860> would<00:03:34.519> punch<00:03:34.850> them<00:03:35.180> too

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
by one ray gun so I would punch them too

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.600 
by one ray gun so I would punch them too
to<00:03:36.079> save<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.320> little<00:03:36.500> bit<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.769> ammo<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.190> when
