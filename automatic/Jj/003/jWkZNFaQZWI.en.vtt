00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello everyone today we will drink beer 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.360
 so what is the belgian beer different 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.940
 from all any other probably only 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.900
 belgium beer felled double triple and 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.369
 even quadruple imagination is my choice 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.279
 fell on beer 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.590
 I thought that means devil 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.349
 really having drunk 34 bottles of it 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.679
 a drink 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.690
 here you no longer need this beer 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.380
 pretty and strong eight with 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.879
 half the degrees and it's bright 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.640
 unfiltered 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.260
 so for those who love 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.039
 unfiltered beers this drink 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.890
 hundred percent your if you drink beer in 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.410
 the bar then do not worry you must file 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.800
 beer because it requires etiquette 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.820
 if you bought a beer home store then 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.160
 be sure to pay attention to 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.250
 the label 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.070
 what is written on this beer just put on 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.010
 it is written that this beer is best to drink 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.729
 at six degrees then there is a beer 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:19.439
 at this temperature reveal your 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.780
 the most flavor bouquet and you will get 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.119
 real pleasure of use 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.640
 this drink also says here that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.630
 this beer is a hundred percent natural so 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:37.650
 that no preservatives are present 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:41.659
 beer you are finishing in the basement two months and 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.409
 brewed at the family brewery so 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:49.259
 try not recommend you a bottle 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 shake because the beer is very foamy 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.590
 and pouring is recommended to tilting 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.170
 a little glass and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.170
 dismissing this drink 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 wineglass 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.460
 that if you quickly pour it 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:23.830
 immediately fit but 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.830
 it's awesome
