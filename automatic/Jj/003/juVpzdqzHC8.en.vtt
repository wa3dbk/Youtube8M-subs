00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.020 
now a couple different things
after<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.900> defrost<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.439> pipe<00:01:31.759> okay<00:01:32.759> what

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
after you defrost the pipe okay what

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.859 
after you defrost the pipe okay what
you're<00:01:33.150> gonna<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> prevent<00:01:33.689> them<00:01:33.840> from

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you're gonna do to prevent them from

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.600 
you're gonna do to prevent them from
freezing<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.590> happen<00:01:34.950> by<00:01:35.070> heat<00:01:35.400> tape

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
freezing is you can happen by heat tape

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.429 
freezing is you can happen by heat tape
heat<00:01:36.150> tape<00:01:36.390> looks<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.720> an<00:01:36.810> extension<00:01:37.140> cord

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
heat tape looks like an extension cord

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.440 
heat tape looks like an extension cord
and<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:38.040> wrapped<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.640> around<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.210> pipe

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and you wrapped that around the pipe

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.450 
and you wrapped that around the pipe
okay<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.500> part<00:01:40.710> four<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
okay that will be in part four and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
okay that will be in part four and
you're<00:01:41.610> right<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.180> wrap<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> heat<00:01:42.810> tape

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you're right you wrap the heat tape

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.330 
you're right you wrap the heat tape
around<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> pipe<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.740> think<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.040> plug<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
around the pipe I think you just plug it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.219 
around the pipe I think you just plug it
in<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.460> keeps<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> pipe<00:01:45.119> warmer<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.930> after

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
in and keeps the pipe warmer so after

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.690

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you get done for defrosting in the pipe

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.730
