00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.950 
I kind of began shooting dslr's
but<00:00:20.400> I've<00:00:20.490> had<00:00:20.609> Hasselblad<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.600> had<00:00:21.750> faced

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
but I've had Hasselblad so I had faced

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.009 
but I've had Hasselblad so I had faced
ones<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:23.100> now<00:00:23.640> we're<00:00:24.150> into<00:00:24.359> mirrorless<00:00:24.689> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
ones and now we're into mirrorless and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.290 
ones and now we're into mirrorless and
that's<00:00:25.230> where<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.470> kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> ended<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.240> part<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
that's where we kind of ended up part of

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.500 
that's where we kind of ended up part of
the<00:00:27.359> reason<00:00:27.689> why<00:00:28.429> I've<00:00:29.429> stopped<00:00:29.789> using<00:00:29.939> DSLR

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that's a lie but I travel around and I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.540 
that's a lie but I travel around and I
like<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.149> light<00:00:48.510> kit<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.739> mirrorless<00:00:50.160> for

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
like a light kit and so mirrorless for

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
like a light kit and so mirrorless for
me<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> huge<00:00:51.600> benefit<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.350> only

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
me is a huge benefit and it was only

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.850 
me is a huge benefit and it was only
when<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.370> quality<00:00:53.910> threshold<00:00:54.510> came<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.410> Tory

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
when the quality threshold came up Tory

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.200 
when the quality threshold came up Tory
wanted<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.430> where<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:57.030> used

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
wanted to be where it actually used

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.240 
wanted to be where it actually used
happy<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.600> use<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> job<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.559> actually

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
happy to use it on a job that actually

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
happy to use it on a job that actually
they<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.399> made<00:00:59.760> sense<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> way<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> got

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
they really made sense so the way I got

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.340 
they really made sense so the way I got
into<00:01:01.620> Fuji<00:01:01.949> products<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.359> 2010<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350

Focus which is a UK trade show in the UK
I<00:01:07.680> went<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> Fuji<00:01:08.670> stand<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.390> had<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
I went to the Fuji stand and they had a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.469 
I went to the Fuji stand and they had a
thing<00:01:09.780> called<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> x100<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.939> thought<00:01:12.180> wow

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
thing called the x100 and I thought wow

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.450 
thing called the x100 and I thought wow
this<00:01:13.080> looks<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.560> Leica<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.130> actually

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this looks like a Leica that actually

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.730 
this looks like a Leica that actually
works<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.900> how<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.439> got<00:01:16.590> into

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
works so that's how I kind of got into

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.300 
works so that's how I kind of got into
it<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.759> then<00:01:17.880> I've<00:01:18.000> used<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> x10<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
it and then I've used the x10 and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.010 
it and then I've used the x10 and
recently<00:01:20.310> I've<00:01:20.700> been<00:01:20.880> using<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> x20<00:01:21.720> which

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
recently I've been using the x20 which

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
recently I've been using the x20 which
is<00:01:22.229> fabulous<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:23.159> camera<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:24.390> was

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
is fabulous little camera what was

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240 
is fabulous little camera what was
really<00:01:24.869> easy<00:01:25.049> about<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> fact<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
really easy about this was the fact that

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.910 
really easy about this was the fact that
you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.689> pick<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.259> focal<00:01:28.680> length

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you know you just pick your focal length

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
you know you just pick your focal length
for<00:01:29.729> me<00:01:29.880> personally<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.540> tend<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> wide

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
for me personally I tend to have it wide

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.130 
for me personally I tend to have it wide
open<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:32.070> eight<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> get<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.630> drop<00:01:33.960> I

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
open to eight just so I get that drop I

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.249 
open to eight just so I get that drop I
don't<00:01:34.380> want<00:01:34.560> everything<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.979> focus<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.840> then

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
don't want everything in focus and then

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.590 
don't want everything in focus and then
actually<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.250> time<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.790> look<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
actually you have time to look as a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
actually you have time to look as a
photographer<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.100> look<00:01:41.280> at

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
photographer you actually get to look at

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.499 
photographer you actually get to look at
the<00:01:41.520> light<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.060> don't<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.420> it's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the light and I don't think it's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
the light and I don't think it's
photographers<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.140> enough<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.610> we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
photographers we do enough of that we

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.370 
photographers we do enough of that we
get<00:01:44.700> very<00:01:45.000> much<00:01:45.180> carried<00:01:45.600> away<00:01:45.750> sometimes<00:01:45.960> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
get very much carried away sometimes in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.920 
get very much carried away sometimes in
