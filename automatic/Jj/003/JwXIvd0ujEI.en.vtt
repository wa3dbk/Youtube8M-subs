can see in there and they're sneezing
but<00:00:27.779> um<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.580> guess<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> real<00:00:29.820> reason<00:00:30.119> I'm

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
but um I guess the real reason I'm

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.319 
but um I guess the real reason I'm
posting<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.489> review<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.910> cage<00:00:33.149> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
posting this review for this cage is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.340 
posting this review for this cage is
that<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.809> don't<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.380> um<00:00:36.260> it's<00:00:37.260> not

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that I really don't like it um it's not

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.080 
that I really don't like it um it's not
necessarily<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> size<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.370> guess<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:39.000> just

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
necessarily the size I guess it's just

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
necessarily the size I guess it's just
the<00:00:40.370> no<00:00:42.680> it's<00:00:43.680> just<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> way<00:00:43.950> they<00:00:44.160> have

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340

the no it's just the way they have
everything<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> laid<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.809> guess<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
everything kind of laid out I guess I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
everything kind of laid out I guess I
don't<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.010> um<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.059> does<00:00:48.210> have

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
things get stuck together a lot so then

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
things get stuck together a lot so then
the<00:01:13.530> cage<00:01:13.710> won't<00:01:13.979> stay<00:01:14.369> locked<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> there's

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.740 
part up and when you do that all of this
binding<00:04:18.139> right<00:04:18.349> here<00:04:18.530> comes<00:04:18.799> apart<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:20.329> then

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
binding right here comes apart so then

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.959 
binding right here comes apart so then
it<00:04:20.840> kind<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:21.109> collapses<00:04:21.739> so<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.400> definitely

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:22.969 
it kind of collapses so you definitely

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:24.370 
it kind of collapses so you definitely
would<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.389> have<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.750> rats<00:04:23.960> out<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.260> the

in<00:05:37.680> this<00:05:37.800> cage<00:05:38.039> for<00:05:38.069> a<00:05:38.340> little<00:05:38.550> bit<00:05:38.699> I<00:05:38.880> actually

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
in this cage for a little bit I actually

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.969 
in this cage for a little bit I actually
got<00:05:39.419> this<00:05:39.569> cage<00:05:39.810> for<00:05:39.840> them<00:05:40.229> because<00:05:40.530> they<00:05:40.800> had

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
got this cage for them because they had

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.279 
got this cage for them because they had
dumb<00:05:41.159> some<00:05:42.150> lights<00:05:42.389> when<00:05:42.569> I<00:05:42.630> first<00:05:42.840> got<00:05:43.020> them

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
dumb some lights when I first got them

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.230 
dumb some lights when I first got them
and<00:05:43.860> so<00:05:44.099> I<00:05:44.159> kept<00:05:44.340> them<00:05:44.490> in<00:05:44.639> a<00:05:44.669> separate<00:05:44.969> room<00:05:45.060> in

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
and so I kept them in a separate room in

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.189 
and so I kept them in a separate room in
this<00:05:45.300> cage<00:05:45.599> but<00:05:46.080> this<00:05:46.949> these<00:05:47.400> ramps<00:05:47.849> are

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
this cage but this these ramps are

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.939 
this cage but this these ramps are
plastic<00:05:49.199> and<00:05:49.259> they<00:05:49.380> have<00:05:49.529> these<00:05:49.680> little

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
plastic and they have these little

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.820 
plastic and they have these little
ridges<00:05:50.099> in<00:05:50.370> them<00:05:50.659> but<00:05:51.659> they're<00:05:52.440> fine<00:05:52.590> for<00:05:52.770> the

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
ridges in them but they're fine for the

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.260 
ridges in them but they're fine for the
babies<00:05:53.159> because<00:05:53.400> they're<00:05:53.520> light<00:05:53.729> but<00:05:53.969> when<00:05:54.210> I

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
babies because they're light but when I

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.909 
babies because they're light but when I
had<00:05:54.509> the<00:05:54.599> adults<00:05:55.080> they<00:05:55.199> would<00:05:55.349> like<00:05:55.529> slide

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
had the adults they would like slide

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.800 
had the adults they would like slide
down<00:05:56.279> and<00:05:56.490> crash<00:05:56.759> into<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.180> bottom<00:05:57.539> of<00:05:57.659> each

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
down and crash into the bottom of each

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.010 
down and crash into the bottom of each
level<00:05:58.819> so<00:05:59.819> I<00:06:00.180> didn't<00:06:00.479> really<00:06:00.659> like<00:06:00.779> that<00:06:00.840> but<00:06:01.440> I

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
level so I didn't really like that but I

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.809 
level so I didn't really like that but I
guess<00:06:04.020> altogether<00:06:04.590> it's<00:06:05.279> not<00:06:05.490> like<00:06:05.669> a

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
guess altogether it's not like a

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.749 
guess altogether it's not like a
horrible<00:06:06.240> horrible<00:06:06.569> cage<00:06:06.990> but<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.979> just<00:06:08.190> I<00:06:08.610> just

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
horrible horrible cage but I just I just

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.240 
horrible horrible cage but I just I just
don't<00:06:09.120> like<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.479> and<00:06:09.719> I<00:06:10.050> just<00:06:10.800> feel<00:06:10.919> like<00:06:11.069> it's

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
don't like it and I just feel like it's

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.800 
don't like it and I just feel like it's
super<00:06:11.729> awkward<00:06:11.909> and<00:06:12.330> inconvenient<00:06:13.139> but<00:06:14.069> I

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
super awkward and inconvenient but I

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.930 
super awkward and inconvenient but I
think<00:06:15.860> it's<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:16.949> pretty<00:06:17.099> common<00:06:17.370> cage<00:06:17.639> cuz<00:06:17.849> you

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
think it's a pretty common cage cuz you

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.399 
think it's a pretty common cage cuz you
can<00:06:18.060> buy<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.240> at<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.449> pet<00:06:18.599> store<00:06:18.840> it's<00:06:19.050> almost
