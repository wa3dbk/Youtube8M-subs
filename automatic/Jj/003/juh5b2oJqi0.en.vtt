get<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.379> cords

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
get into the cords

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.899 
get into the cords
first<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:06.080> six-foot<00:01:07.080> new<00:01:07.950> style<00:01:08.340> dryer

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
first we have a six-foot new style dryer

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.719 
first we have a six-foot new style dryer
cord

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.690 

next<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.960> three<00:01:14.350> wires<00:01:14.590> six<00:01:15.040> foot<00:01:15.280> dryer

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
next is the three wires six foot dryer

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.330 
next is the three wires six foot dryer
cord<00:01:16.060> yeah<00:01:16.390> all<00:01:17.080> these<00:01:17.290> cords<00:01:17.680> fit<00:01:17.890> inside<00:01:18.159> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
cord yeah all these cords fit inside the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.830 
cord yeah all these cords fit inside the
case<00:01:19.590> next<00:01:20.590> is<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.710> three<00:01:21.220> wire<00:01:21.840> old-style

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
case next is a three wire old-style

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.929 
case next is a three wire old-style
range<00:01:23.290> cord<00:01:23.740> this<00:01:24.040> course<00:01:24.280> three<00:01:24.490> feet<00:01:24.729> long

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
range cord this course three feet long

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.730 
range cord this course three feet long
reason<00:01:25.360> we<00:01:25.420> made<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:26.110> courts<00:01:26.380> different

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
reason we made the the courts different

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.800 
reason we made the the courts different
lengths<00:01:27.009> usually<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.909> dryer<00:01:28.180> plug<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.630> up

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
lengths usually the dryer plug is up

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.630 
lengths usually the dryer plug is up
higher<00:01:28.990> on<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.380> wall<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:30.250> we<00:01:30.310> want<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.549> make

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
higher on the wall so we want to make

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.039 
higher on the wall so we want to make
that<00:01:30.789> cord<00:01:31.060> long<00:01:31.240> enough<00:01:31.539> so<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.690> we<00:01:31.869> reach

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
that cord long enough so that we reach

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.090 
that cord long enough so that we reach
the<00:01:32.229> floor<00:01:33.659> last<00:01:34.659> one<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.080> here<00:01:35.439> is<00:01:35.619> your<00:01:35.920> new

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
the floor last one in here is your new

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.810 
the floor last one in here is your new
style<00:01:36.340> range<00:01:37.270> for<00:01:38.110> wire<00:01:38.320> plug<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:39.610> then<00:01:39.729> we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
style range for wire plug and then we

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.910 
style range for wire plug and then we
also<00:01:39.970> have<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> 30<00:01:40.930> foot<00:01:41.140> extension<00:01:41.619> cord<00:01:41.860> for
