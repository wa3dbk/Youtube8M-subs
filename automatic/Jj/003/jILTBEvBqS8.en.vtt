what about rotation you can do it or

skip it why the rotation the magazine is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
skip it why the rotation the magazine is
bulky<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> as<00:00:49.289> you're<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> plane<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> the

floor it can hinder you sometimes in
this<00:00:55.530> case<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.039> rotate<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> gun<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this case you rotate the gun so that you

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.250 
this case you rotate the gun so that you
could<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.510> close<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> floor<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.260> possible

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
could be close to the floor as possible

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.740 
could be close to the floor as possible
of<00:01:01.260> course<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.789> retain<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> overcoming<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
of course you retain it overcoming the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.750 
of course you retain it overcoming the
obstacle<00:01:06.409> that's<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> use<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.549> as

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
obstacle that's the use of it not as

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.429 
obstacle that's the use of it not as
it's<00:01:08.909> shown<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> movies<00:01:09.510> till<00:01:09.960> call<00:01:10.290> or

it's shown in the movies till call or
more<00:01:10.619> intimidating<00:01:13.640> use<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:14.880> scenes

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
more intimidating use these scenes

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.340 
more intimidating use these scenes
depending<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> situation

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
depending on the situation

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.810 
depending on the situation
not<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> allegedly<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.610> shoot

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
not because it allegedly will shoot

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
not because it allegedly will shoot
better<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:21.049> it<00:01:22.049> won't<00:01:22.259> shoot<00:01:22.500> better

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
better like this it won't shoot better

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.070 
better like this it won't shoot better
it<00:01:23.520> shoots<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> same<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:27.570> problem<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:27.960> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
it shoots the same the problem is that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.469 
it shoots the same the problem is that
you<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.290> shoot<00:01:28.500> worse<00:01:32.030> change<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> position

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
you will shoot worse change the position

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.670 
you will shoot worse change the position
of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.630> arm<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.110> change<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> movement

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of the arm you can change the movement

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.170 
of the arm you can change the movement
of<00:01:34.829> your<00:01:34.950> fingers<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.460> pressure<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
of your fingers the pressure on the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.780 
of your fingers the pressure on the
trigger<00:01:39.619> as<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.829> changes<00:01:41.159> everything<00:01:41.520> else

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
trigger as it changes everything else

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.330
