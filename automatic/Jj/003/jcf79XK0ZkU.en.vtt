hi I'm Michael from admin controls and

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.100 
hi I'm Michael from admin controls and
today<00:00:03.149> we're<00:00:03.270> going<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.449> be<00:00:03.510> taking<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.840> look<00:00:03.959> at

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
today we're going to be taking a look at

today we're going to be taking a look at
spin<00:00:04.529> output<00:00:04.920> GSM<00:00:05.490> boards<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:06.390> is<00:00:06.450> great<00:00:06.720> for

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
spin output GSM boards this is great for

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.360 
spin output GSM boards this is great for
things<00:00:07.020> like<00:00:07.170> roller<00:00:07.470> shutters<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.069> gown

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
things like roller shutters and gown

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.100

close<00:00:10.290> control<00:00:11.450> in<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.660> example<00:00:13.019> were

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
close control in this example were

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.049 
close control in this example were
controlling<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.160> roller<00:00:14.340> shutter<00:00:14.610> with

to have the board alternate between open
and<00:00:38.149> closed<00:00:38.390> we<00:00:38.720> set<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.410> call<00:00:39.590> channel<00:00:39.860> to

and closed we set the call channel to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.880 
and closed we set the call channel to
alt<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:41.750> keep<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.050> relay<00:00:42.320> active<00:00:42.650> while

alt and to keep the relay active while
stringing<00:00:43.370> we<00:00:43.970> set<00:00:44.150> the<00:00:44.270> relay<00:00:44.570> mode<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:45.320> ring

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
stringing we set the relay mode to ring

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.270 
stringing we set the relay mode to ring

gate controller board here we've

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.389 
gate controller board here we've

connected the blue LED to the close or

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.510 
connected the blue LED to the close or

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
phone rings I would the relay stays lit

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.800 
phone rings I would the relay stays lit
and<00:01:28.850> when<00:01:29.000> we<00:01:29.119> call<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.420> number<00:01:29.630> for<00:01:29.780> the

and when we call the number for the
second<00:01:30.170> time<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.009> other<00:01:31.220> relay<00:01:31.610> stays<00:01:31.880> lit

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
second time the other relay stays lit

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.640 
second time the other relay stays lit
again<00:01:32.690> whilst<00:01:33.200> the<00:01:33.380> line<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.800> ringing

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.920 

we<00:01:38.650> can<00:01:38.799> also<00:01:39.010> operate<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.670> relays<00:01:40.030> using<00:01:40.780> the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
we can also operate the relays using the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.580 
we can also operate the relays using the
DTMF<00:01:41.409> keys<00:01:41.710> on<00:01:42.010> your<00:01:42.310> phone's<00:01:42.640> keypad

unfortunately with most mobile phones
you<00:01:46.479> can't<00:01:46.750> send<00:01:46.960> long<00:01:47.200> Tong<00:01:47.440> bears<00:01:47.710> so<00:01:48.130> they

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
you can't send long Tong bears so they

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.120 
you can't send long Tong bears so they
can't<00:01:48.460> really<00:01:48.640> be<00:01:48.760> used<00:01:48.970> for<00:01:49.119> this<00:01:49.180> operation

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
can't really be used for this operation

sending with a connect enable command we
then<00:01:56.530> add<00:01:56.680> our<00:01:56.860> office<00:01:57.159> telephone<00:01:57.580> number<00:01:57.940> to
