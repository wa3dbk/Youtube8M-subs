 good afternoon people of I'm going to 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.489
 talk this afternoon about something saramago and 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.809
 his book the essay on lucidity but 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.490
 before I want to do I wanted to make them a 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.620
 semblance of who is joseph saramago and 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.390
 why it's so important is one of the 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.760
 most important writers of the 21st century 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.670
 not only for its literature but for its 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.600
 political and social activity in the sre 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.820
 1922 in Portugal and died recently in the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.340
 2010 is also winner of the Nobel Prize 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.960
 of literature he is so important for 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.450
 his controversy not so much religious as 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.640
 politics and that can be proven 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.799
 this sequel to the book that is called the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 essay on lucidity but before 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.700
 read the lucidity essay one has 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.890
 than having read the essay on 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.189
 blindness then the essay on the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.630
 Lucidity is about a city 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.549
 unknown does not really have any 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.700
 name where there is an election 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.770
 municipal but people decide to leave 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.420
 all the votes blank and this was very 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.880
 important because if I left the votes in 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.760
 white there would be no one left in the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.920
 governor's position 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.510
 people like everything gets on 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.900
 agreement to leave the votes blank 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.970
 and they create a social chaos completely 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.010
 no one can be elected if people do not 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.320
 choose a very strange type of democracy 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.940
 the governors get hysterical the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.160
 governors begin to repress the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.400
 people and start looking for who 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.500
 are the culprits for having made the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.450
 people will vote blank 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.890
 when they find the culprits are given 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.540
 account that they are new characters of the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.610
 previous book that is the essay on the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.240
 blindness and they begin to repress the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.160
 people start to act in a way 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.140
 and just with people starting to 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.520
 put a state of siege and begin to 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.470
 make the elections again and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.910
 again and again until they are given 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.990
 mind that they can not do 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.120
 elections and they call on the government to 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.240
 military and you know the whole area and can 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.010
 suppress people then they 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.930
 find that who had been 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.900
 actually the culprits or the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.010
 inventors of the white vote had been 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.870
 the same people who had stayed 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.440
 blind in the previous book 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.440
 Y 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.740
 as they had been blind in the book 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.670
 previous and the government had not 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.410
 stopped a lot of ball then this person 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.569
 decides to vote blank to be able to take 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.180
 the government discovers who the 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.520
 people who had done this and the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.170
 repressed and sent to kill all and 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.660
 the end of the book for example is 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.620
 wonderful as a dog after 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.560
 a sniper 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.000
 for a woman in the head finished the 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.620
 honey where the tears and end 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.620
 licking him in the blood is because he 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.170
 it comes out through the skull now talking about 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.430
 the structure of writing 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.930
 disarmed that for me it seems very 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.989
 important the structure of a book 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.840
 when he is going to read he uses paragraphs 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.220
 very long for example or describes very 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.860
 little things 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.580
 It gives a lot more action I have a book that 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.580
 anything 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.630
 he also tries to be very expressive in what 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.050
 what does it say 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.570
 that's why he won the Nobel prize because 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.650
 the ex-run is quick to narrate his 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.210
 stories he does not describe too much and it's 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.400
 the importance of the book and also it 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.360
 I could read the essay on blindness 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.090
 not that you have about blindness treats 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.530
 about in this same fictional town that 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.680
 suddenly people start to 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.360
 go blind and it's like an epidemic that 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.800
 he is watering me he asks me to leave 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.300
 watering if I was not in contact with 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.910
 a person who had gone blind 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.710
 is blind instantly but it was not 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.350
 a normal blindness but a blindness 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.390
 white 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.790
 to understand then these books 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.340
 one has to be immersed in all the 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.840
 political environment of europe one has 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.260
 to be immersed in the whole environment 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.820
 political of this fictional city and one 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.280
 it has to be immersed in the 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.140
 Saramago time then do not just read 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.830
 in stages on lucidity 'but the 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.830
 essay on blindness
