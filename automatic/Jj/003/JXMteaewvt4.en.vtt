00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790
 chapter 3 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.790
 we start again to recommend ourselves 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.490
 or we need like some letters of recommendation for you or 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.909
 of recommendation of you 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:17.769
 our letters are you written in our familiar hearts and 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.730
 read by all men 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.670
 being manifest that solÃ­s letter of christ dismissed by us written no 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 with ink but with the spirit of the living god 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.470
 not on stone tablets but on tables of flesh of the heart 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.120
 and such confidence we have through Christ to God 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.030
 not that we are competent by ourselves to think something like ourselves 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.310
 themselves but that our competition comes from God 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.020
 which also made us competent ministers of a new covenant 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.220
 not of the letter but of the spirit 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.400
 because the letter kills more the spirit vivifies 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 and if the ministry of death engraved with letters on stones was with glory 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.260
 so much that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.460
 Moses because of the glory of his face which was to perish 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.020
 as the ministry of the spirit will not be with glory 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.160
 because if the ministry of condemnation was with glory much more will abound 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.890
 in glory the ministry of justification 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.800
 because even what was diorio so is not glorious in this respect in 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.200
 comparison with the most eminent glory 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.350
 because if what perishes had much more glorious glory was what 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.420
 it remains 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.320
 so having such hope we use a lot of frankness and not like bassinet that 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.020
 he put a veil over his face so that the children of israel will not fix the sight 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.860
 in the end of that which was to be abolished 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.500
 but their understanding in vote 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.800
 because to this day when they read the old covenant they want the same 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.890
 hair not discovered which by Christ is removed 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.650
 and even to this day when he was called that baby is placed on 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.430
 the heart of them 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.799
 but when they turn to the sr the hair will be removed 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.970
 because gentlemen the spirit and where is the spirit of the Lord there is 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.479
 freedom 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.839
 so we all looking at the face bare as in a mirror the glory 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:20.369
 of the Lord we are transformed from glory to glory in the same image as by the 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.889
 spirit of
