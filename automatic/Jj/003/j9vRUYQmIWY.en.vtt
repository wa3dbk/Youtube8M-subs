00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.869
 yea 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.869
 when putting the course of interpersonal relationship 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.949
 national leaders 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.690
 best for this need within a company 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.840
 then we pay the survey the research within itself with which the world is 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.700
 then we will elaborate the text between the costs that come from that 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.489
 House 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.030
 to the adolescent but also 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.870
 ideas that are within the goals 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 near the end of the off-season 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.250
 check your own recipe 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.870
 he is getting stronger 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.470
 and www can be controlled with br 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.290
 when he enters the page he has to be announced registered 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.480
 the student who does not 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.030
 while canasta 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.510
 Veronica Dantas 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.540
 on e3 these girls confirm 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.400
 and this practice 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.310
 it will put all the information 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.540
 until you get to the end of the fucking melinda gates 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.050
 an access password 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.410
 will stay in distance courses 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.750
 the replacement 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.750
 it has been like this 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.160
 in this case the expense not through the portal said 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.340
 the student who is interested in participating in these home programs 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.290
 these 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.400
 the launch of the cooperation to be provided today 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.740
 participate in the public hearing and popular action that said they did not feel 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.120
 especially among them the program helps 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.520
 living story 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.570
 value that encompasses several competences is an attitude 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.310
 enterprising speech 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.900
 selection curriculum we already have 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.100
 I think that the public always uses 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 a survey made by the company the deputy child 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.300
 the distance course 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.150
 it has a very distant visibility can do according to the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.340
 availability are things 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.810
 twenty-five supposed highly illustrated killers 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.710
 this things 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.950
 we are very well worked out details 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.149
 any other maintenance service and Ricardo 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.080
 is wanting we create in progress 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.589
 the German 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:17.219
 on the scoreboard and why we did a survey with the students 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:19.959
 I was not aware that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.140
 a show of what is important to you right now we are facing a 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:25.989
 selective process 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.030
 the starting player for the match will be a final 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.939
 today we have 15 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.639
 we use grammatical update 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:35.639
 translation of business writing texts 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.129
 guidance and professional information 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.059
 curriculum be secret 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:43.449
 in interview start rolling 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.569
 and dynamics and tests 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.929
 he has a need 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.929
 so it goes against the need that the person has 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.659
 it was fatal 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.299
 legal basis 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.299
 we have training workshops 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.299
 adecom on and security of information 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:05.889
 was also positive if you can visualize the vacancies we offer to 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:11.009
 weekly we have classes in the morning in the afternoon possible 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.680
 partnership with 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.789
 with the loan you must create 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.909
 this partnership that offers free courses wants to give an initial basic course 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.549
 this vision of the left eye we still do not know the costs 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.019
 additional 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.259
 concentrated attention active sexual relationship 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:28.339
 wisdom 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:30.229
 and in transition through 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.449
 the logic creativity and awarded in the fantasporto 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.889
 this directive void of a good start of proof 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.519
 Mrs. Santa 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.519
 is such a bad thing represents a breakthrough 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.599
 goals difference too 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.519
 the tie in 1 to 1 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.049
 although it was a simple thing 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.779
 It's something that you develop. 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.149
 Paulo 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.959
 and that's when it's a scourge portugal 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.279
 it's very positive 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.129
 is a program that deals specifically with the filmmaker 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.609
 have a speech that means nothing 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.389
 for example the situation of a classroom and do it in a way 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:13.239
 It's not all the step-by-step of incomplete completion to get to 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.829
 the ends 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.029
 the more investors do not rule out 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.719
 but the clouds form but it does not rain 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:22.770
 companies are looking for 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.240
 able to solve the problem 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.469
 creative people 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.689
 people who deal with projects 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.800
 of course we'll get 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.530
 then we all left with seven policemen sometimes 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.370
 the answer also in front of you 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.499
 and you do not know 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.460
 - You have to seek a career. 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.760
 it develops with this more and so without suffering and tico that you do not need 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.640
 decorate millions of content if before the decoration you learn 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.899
 ideli if you learned the site gets the years we can repeat it from your 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:05.289
 apply this anywhere today is not enough just the knowledge 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.689
 the attitude is very valued 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.839
 64% 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:17.609
 are small
