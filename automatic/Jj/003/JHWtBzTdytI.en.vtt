00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
description for that as well so here is

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
description for that as well so here is
brain<00:02:05.690> age<00:02:05.900> two<00:02:10.120> windows<00:02:11.120> can't<00:02:11.570> open<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.230> by

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
brain age two windows can't open it by

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.930 
brain age two windows can't open it by
itself<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.760> we're<00:02:14.270> going<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.480> need<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.690> program

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
itself so we're going to need a program

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:25.040 
itself so we're going to need a program
that<00:02:16.940> program<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.510> called<00:02:17.720> desmond

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
emulator this is brain h2 as you notice

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.760 
emulator this is brain h2 as you notice
brain<00:03:42.660> h2<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.590> sideways<00:03:45.140> because<00:03:46.140> that's<00:03:46.560> how

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
brain h2 is sideways because that's how

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.390 
brain h2 is sideways because that's how
it<00:03:46.950> was<00:03:47.100> designed<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.920> I'm<00:03:49.920> going<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.220> rotate

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
it was designed so I'm going to rotate

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:59.309 
it was designed so I'm going to rotate
the<00:03:51.230> view<00:03:52.820> and

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.920
