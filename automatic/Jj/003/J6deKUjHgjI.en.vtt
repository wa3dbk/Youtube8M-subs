 hello youtubers friends today I will teach you to 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.120
 how to create a partition that can be 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:13.570
 of your local disk or disk of 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.140
 an easy way but you 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.360
 will ask what this can serve me 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.210
 Well, I'll give you an example in case 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.059
 want to format your pc all your 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.880
 files that you have on disk c can 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:30.550
 save it in the partition they created or 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.340
 also when they want to install two 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.880
 different operating systems can 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:40.540
 install in different units well 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.940
 let's start for this we need a 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.090
 program the link will be in the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.970
 video description 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.580
 once downloaded the program we 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.090
 leave a rar file we copy it to 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.910
 desk 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.920
 we give you a right click and select the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.140
 option to extract here 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.820
 we will have a folder with the name 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.320
 windows partitions 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.520
 inside this folder there is or is not 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.520
 we execute it 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.700
 we select the language and we give it 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.590
 following 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.159
 We accept the agreement and we click on 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.890
 following 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.130
 then we click on next up 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.119
 that everything is installed and ready is already 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.119
 installed the program 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.810
 well here as you see it shows me my disk 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.570
 ce and my disk d 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.450
 Now what I will do is create a new 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 partition from my local disk then 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.240
 here I have more memory available 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.870
 I will click on the iu disk for the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.750
 left side shows us two paintings 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.240
 one that is the assistant and the other that is 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.940
 partition operations 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.610
 I will go to partition operations and 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.340
 to click on Create Partition 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.590
 I opened a window where he asks me 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.350
 that choose which letter I want to put to my 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.170
 disk I create and what capacity you 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.290
 I want to put in this case I will put 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.349
 20 gigabytes and the letter m as an example 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.640
 and we go to where it says apply and we give 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.489
 click there attention there is an option that 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.349
 will ask us to restart the pc to 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.769
 we must close all the 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.230
 windows that we have open but if 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.480
 do not want to restart the simply because 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.480
 do not mark it I will not mark it 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.660
 this process may take several minutes 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.660
 so pause the video 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.080
 there as you see, I created the local disk 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.900
 m 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.700
 now I will show you how to remove it 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.190
 we enter the program and select the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.890
 unit that you think would be the disk 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.410
 we go to partition operations and 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.710
 we simply give it in joining partitions 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.120
 and ready 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.780
 and that have been all 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.620
