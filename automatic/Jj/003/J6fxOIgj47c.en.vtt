00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 good 

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.710
 here we are with him 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.849
 this is our gift I tell you for 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:22.660
 for the pichugin for the end of the year 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:27.669
 Christmas 00 sewing is to say is the 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.289
 easier garment I think it exists as 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.529
 they liked it so much what we did the other 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.529
 time 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.570
 and apart from the birthday let's say the premises 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.680
 for the gorditas because it is a pledge 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.670
 garment that only thinned we said 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.170
 that the gorditas have to have 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:52.930
 simple forearms to can with the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:54.820
 Ideal bracelets for the chubby woman 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.180
 then it does not look so so ours of the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.950
 figure is so complete and those that 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.690
 they ask for long things 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.460
 can take advantage of this same mobile what 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.950
 they close ahead because they also ask 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:14.860
 things t-shirts and so on but it's on base 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:19.960
 to the same model as a premise of the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.770
 season are the kimonos and 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:28.380
 patterned prints so learn 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.380
 okay to sublimate because the clothes 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.530
 let's make a mold but easy easy 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.140
 easy easy this is for those who do not know 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.130
 no milling or anything usual 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.900
 let's start first with a 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.640
 rectangle of course that 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.750
 rectangle is going to have the length that it has 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.400
 that garment that is 65 long is that 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.900
 just the length that reaches half of 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.970
 the tail because afterwards it's still going to 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.320
 have the fringes of course if 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.050
 you can do it longer 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.910
 type exit of beach that is to say there are 20 thousand 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.119
 variants of this is not true but 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.460
 let's make a classic one and measure 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.800
 of the fourth this is a quarter of a garment 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.370
 it is not true the measure that we are going 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.680
 is the hip room with four 

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.420
 centimeters more slack and already they 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.130
 I would say that when we expose those four 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.500
 of slack and after I do not add 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.150
 Short stitching like this for sewing 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.550
 as well as that I'm going to have the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.040
 centimeter of that extra for the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.430
 seam let's suppose that they have 104 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.350
 of hip the fourth part are 26 26 more 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.840
 4 30 centimeters 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.240
 This is the width that I give to 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.500
 rectangle and let's start drawing it 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.000
 so look how easy 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.420
 10 11 centimeters and 10 or 11 centimeters 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.540
 in the horizontal sense 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.690
 and two centimeters up and look 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.760
 I'm going to draw what would be the neckline of 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.430
 the back 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.310
 to 10 centimeters 2 up I have the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.530
 point of the neckline of the shoulder let's say 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.110
 where the shoulder starts and how are we going to 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.409
 pull the shoulder line from that tip to 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.940
 the other end with that inclination and 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.220
 He wore the sleeve 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.850
 so much centimeters I 'm going to give you two 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.950
 one more versions to peck and it's 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.500
 the one that we are going to draw with a long 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.270
 pledge the truth that I do not have to go 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.500
 with a very long sleeve because if not 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.020
 he enters me later I'll show him how 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.270
 place the molds this too what 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.190
 we can make a sleeve longer than 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.110
 get right up to the elbow is not true 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.600
 but let's civilize I do not feel that it's going 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.780
 to enter the length of the garment and I 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.910
 how am I going to fold the fabric to the medium that 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.960
 they are 75 centimeters with a fabric has 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.060
 about 50 I have to have 30 plus 30 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.370
 of the other that will come face to face are 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.640
 60 I have 15 centimeters left for the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.120
 sleeves that is 30 plus 30 the 15 are the 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.740
 the 75 centimeters and there I have a sleeve 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.840
 medium short nor sta cord lace 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.390
 but it 's the manga that's going to go into a 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.750
 long 30 then look after 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.990
 took in half of the 65 or 32 and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.850
 half would be here I have to come 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.160
 get to 32 and a half and there 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.290
 start and go around the sleeve 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.959
 size can be wide because it is not a 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.690
 Japanese manga that is going to be used alone 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.340
 let's say or about a bodice is to say a 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.350
 Japanese manga that will generally go 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.320
 above a remerita or other garment 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.110
 and I have my butt look how easy 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.480
 the forward all the same nothing more than here 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.790
 in the front I'm going to make a neckline like this 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.310
 in v and larguito 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.260
 and I finish it down without crosses without 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.000
 nothing look how easy and the only thing that yes 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.670
 let's do in the front a 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.430
 small little piece of 4 centimeters in the 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.860
 center because if not the taste raises and 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.650
 it's like shorter all forward 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.020
 we have rear and front in the same 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.810
 Mobile now I'll show you how 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.110
 place it on the cloth 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.000
 I have just one fabric in scale 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.230
 I did it all in half a fabric that 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.010
 it would be 150 not true wide he doubled it 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.940
 in the middle I have 75 extension giorgi 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.240
 natural color and I put where is the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:22.210
 fold I'll put the butt of the 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.710
 pay attention and where is the other 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:29.920
 we're going to take it out facing like this 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.630
 Look how it goes, that's why the sleeve said 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.310
 it does not have to be very long because if a 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.310
 manga is very long I do not get the other 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.610
 part in this way I with 65 with 70 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.990
 centimeters I take a garment this if I 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.230
 I would have liked a longer sleeve already 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.550
 not because it does not fit me that way anymore 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.250
 so yes, if I want the longest sleeve 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.460
 I do this mine, I have to move it 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.460
 sightly and that will have a long 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.930
 garment plus the width of the sleeve and 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.900
 surely there will be more or 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.970
 minus one meter of fabric and that way 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.190
 achieve because the kimonos sometimes have 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.220
 that sleeve a little bit longer 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.230
 the wave of the kimono then if they have it 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.480
 with the longer sleeve they're going to have to 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.390
 move the molds and calculate a meter 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.960
 with a meter they will be perfect 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.610
 the other way with 65 or 70 centimeters 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.800
 which is the length that we put on the garment 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.240
 I get out there is no problem in facing the 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.430
 molds notice that they face the 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.140
 molds in the Georgia is the gauze there is no 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.940
 problem and if I'm going to show you how 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.360
 sew because the stitching is two seams 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.539
 of the shoulder and sewing down here 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.150
 look is the French culture norm that 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.849
 it is known by the right of course 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.259
 those who have or see us if they pass the work 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.560
 it means a lot of work 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:46.680
 pass it or see it and from the right side and 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.580
 then for the reverse not in the bag if you do 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.009
 a very easy miracle look how it is 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.539
 in what has the French culture of 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:59.539
 This way you will never get 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:02.129
 mustache is the trick because it is 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.080
 perfect then it 's a way of 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:06.330
 know something on the shoulder that 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.599
 get the bottom part the rest is 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:19.919
 finished with a satin ribbon 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:23.009
 aha to do it in a little while is now 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:25.409
 if it comes from adriana that really is 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:27.100
 a beautiful technique because the stamping 

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:32.130
 like raising the 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:32.130
 tampa do is divine divine super fine 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.140
 good thank you 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.250
 sure yes now we continue with 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.480
 adriana d'adamo and sublimation on this 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.480
 beautiful kimono
