in black bean and I'm just going to
apply<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:04.379> bit<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:08.180> inside

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
apply a little bit of that to the inside

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.050 
apply a little bit of that to the inside
corner<00:01:09.900> kind<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:10.979> staying<00:01:11.400> off<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
corner kind of but staying off the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
corner kind of but staying off the
actual<00:01:12.600> inner<00:01:12.869> corner<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.400> little

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
actual inner corner and then a little

actual inner corner and then a little
bit<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.360> outer<00:01:15.630> corner<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> basically

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
bit to the outer corner so basically

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.260 
bit to the outer corner so basically
you're<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> take<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.970> from<00:01:21.090> either

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you're going to take it from either

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.740 
you're going to take it from either
corner<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.049> draw<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.680> towards<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
corner and then draw it in towards the

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.020 
corner and then draw it in towards the
iris<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.770> want<00:01:25.950> even<00:01:26.430> coat<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
iris and I just want even coat of that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.210 
iris and I just want even coat of that
but<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> big<00:01:27.750> deal<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.200> messy<00:01:28.710> so

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
but it's not a big deal if it's messy so

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.679 
but it's not a big deal if it's messy so
if<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> nice<00:01:29.759> even<00:01:30.060> base<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.450> I'm

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
if I have a nice even base of that I'm

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
if I have a nice even base of that I'm
going<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> take<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.650> Real<00:01:32.400> Techniques

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
going to take this Real Techniques

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.969 
going to take this Real Techniques
shading<00:01:33.000> brush<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.990> I'm<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.680> to

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
shading brush and I'm just going to

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.630 
shading brush and I'm just going to
blend<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.130> basically<00:01:38.340> just

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
blend that in so I'm basically just

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.030 
blend that in so I'm basically just
going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.150> smudge<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.810> edges<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.439> I'm<00:01:40.590> trying

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
going to smudge the edges but I'm trying

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.969 
going to smudge the edges but I'm trying
to<00:01:41.189> keep<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.790> away<00:01:42.090> from<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.290> inner<00:01:43.439> corner

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
to keep it away from the inner corner

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
to keep it away from the inner corner
and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> center<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> lid<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.149> much<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.600> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and the center of the lid as much as I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.980 
and the center of the lid as much as I
