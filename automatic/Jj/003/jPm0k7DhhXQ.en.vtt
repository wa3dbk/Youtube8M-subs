00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello friends of all welcome to me 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 channel is perhaps the gamer with the rajah of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.649
 today I'm sorry if it's not going to be a video 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.320
 It's very much like mine, but 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.450
 is that really you and I am to die 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.920
 I've been trying to record the five hours 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 video 5 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.540
 is that I have a lage over fuck 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.640
 if I'm a little more exalted is that 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.950
 after 5 hours 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.420
 in three computer failures 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.420
 and talcum powder 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.480
 well I do not know sandwich and carpe diem this 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.699
 vote before between a game for 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.010
 comment and half for the hair I do not know if 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.190
 I already said it using a greeting 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.129
 from moreira and fuck I see that the young woman was 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.739
 so you can not really play what 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.839
 I feel it 's a moment this is a match 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.960
 Decent without the step as it is wrong 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.449
 that last but without the if I lose that 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.430
 be for me but it will also be for me 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.809
 because I am frankly wrong while 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.189
 game that takes the opportunity to comment a 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.540
 little thing on twitter I have twitter to me 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.369
 can you follow me if you want out there 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.509
 He said he would not lower the plane that 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.290
 right now he wants to kill everything 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.090
 the world and why should you follow me if 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.409
 you like clear besides to see how 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.030
 my dog eats me sneakers not that 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 Do not fuck fuck fuck fuck 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.159
 because I put meta case of games that 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.759
 It can be interesting like the Chivas 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.340
 to the rhythm 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.090
 medieval warfare on the ground upload them 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.530
 then of course for that because I think 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.000
 that we all like to try 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.320
 new games 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.420
 so I always try to get hold of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.990
 several to be able to give to different 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.240
 relatives 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.530
 all that I think that can be 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.510
 interesting 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.760
 the facebook I have to create the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.080
 2.0 seconds of trailers because I was 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.520
 a little bit wrong and you will understand that we 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.009
 pose that you see me with distemper 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.090
 out not and with a red nose like rudos 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.090
 the kingdom of santa claus 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.800
 wow that yes the dumps I was alone 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.800
 God did not want him to die and wii 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.890
 how nice it would have been riding eggs 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.300
 a little bit with the nonsense 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.650
 I know that this is not going to be or not 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.540
 they will make really splendid because it is that 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.540
 what's said another five hours imagine 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.810
 they tend to throw when it's best to be 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.810
 how a croquette threw me to the ground 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.310
 what was said 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.330
 to see that I'm winning I want to try 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.620

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.879

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.160

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.990

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.990
 I was coughing that gentlemanly thank you 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.570
