00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
be to installation there are two

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
be to installation there are two

versions or two different installation

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.940 
versions or two different installation
methods<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.670> steam<00:01:08.939> OS<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.950> recommended

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
methods of steam OS the recommended

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.370 
methods of steam OS the recommended
method<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.540> default<00:01:12.960> installation

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
method is the default installation

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
method is the default installation
method<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> pre-configured<00:01:14.670> aiming

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
method which is a pre-configured aiming

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
method which is a pre-configured aiming
space<00:01:15.810> install<00:01:16.290> using<00:01:16.500> clonezilla<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.909> other

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
space install using clonezilla the other

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
space install using clonezilla the other
method<00:01:18.240> uses<00:01:18.750> Debian<00:01:19.140> installer<00:01:19.170> which

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
method uses Debian installer which

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.770 
method uses Debian installer which
allows<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.369> customization<00:01:20.729> after<00:01:21.720> an

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
allows for customization after an

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.950 
allows for customization after an
automated<00:01:22.080> install<00:01:22.439> setup<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.659> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.780> use

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
automated install setup and you can use

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
automated install setup and you can use
either<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.470> these<00:01:25.560> methods<00:01:25.979> however<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
either of these methods however the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.740 
either of these methods however the
default<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.900> much<00:01:28.890> easier<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.369> use<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
default is much easier to use so this

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.940 
default is much easier to use so this
video's<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.320> showing<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> how<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> use

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
video's can be showing you how to use

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.580 
video's can be showing you how to use
the<00:01:32.250> default<00:01:32.640> installation<00:01:32.970> method<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.659> will

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the default installation method I will

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
the default installation method I will
do<00:01:34.740> another<00:01:35.070> custom<00:01:35.460> installation<00:01:35.909> method

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
do another custom installation method

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.950 
do another custom installation method
afterwards<00:01:36.920> however<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:39.420> terms<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
afterwards however for now in terms of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
afterwards however for now in terms of
simplicity<00:01:40.290> will<00:01:40.680> use<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.220> default

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
simplicity will use the default

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.389 
simplicity will use the default
installation<00:01:42.020> which<00:01:43.020> uses<00:01:43.740> basically<00:01:44.340> an

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
installation which uses basically an

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.819 
installation which uses basically an
image<00:01:44.869> there<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.110> restore<00:01:46.439> onto<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
image there it will restore onto the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.800 
image there it will restore onto the
hard<00:01:46.979> disk<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.030> by<00:01:48.119> clicking<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.540> link<00:01:48.570> on

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
and then if we download the file to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.320 
and then if we download the file to
allocation<00:02:17.600> on<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.960> hard<00:02:18.170> disk<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.210> is

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
allocation on the hard disk and this is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.980 
allocation on the hard disk and this is
simply<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:21.010> zip<00:02:22.010> file<00:02:22.280> with<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.270> file<00:02:23.840> name
