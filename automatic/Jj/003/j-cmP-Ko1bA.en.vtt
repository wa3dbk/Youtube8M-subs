00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
that question but I have noticed that

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.220 
that question but I have noticed that
there<00:04:48.650> are<00:04:48.680> big<00:04:49.669> women<00:04:50.030> who<00:04:51.040> exclusively

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
there are big women who exclusively

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.120 
there are big women who exclusively
prefer<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.770> thin<00:04:55.130> fit<00:04:55.669> and<00:04:55.880> men<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:57.590> don't

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
prefer the thin fit and men and I don't

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.560 
prefer the thin fit and men and I don't
want<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.340> make<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.490> lot<00:04:58.669> of<00:04:58.790> judgments<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.389> feel

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
want to make a lot of judgments I feel

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.990 
want to make a lot of judgments I feel
again<00:04:59.840> it<00:05:00.110> would<00:05:00.770> be<00:05:00.800> like<00:05:01.010> attacking<00:05:01.430> my<00:05:01.850> own

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
again it would be like attacking my own

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.350 
again it would be like attacking my own
kind<00:05:02.390> here<00:05:02.990> but<00:05:03.490> let<00:05:04.490> me<00:05:04.610> just<00:05:04.820> say<00:05:04.940> this

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
kind here but let me just say this

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.430 
kind here but let me just say this
I<00:05:06.100> find<00:05:07.100> it<00:05:07.220> unfair<00:05:07.700> to<00:05:08.000> demand<00:05:08.810> something<00:05:09.110> out

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.840 
I find it unfair to demand something out
of<00:05:09.470> your<00:05:09.680> partner<00:05:10.210> that<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.270> aren't<00:05:11.870> willing

to provide yourself and women aren't the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.730 
to provide yourself and women aren't the
only<00:05:17.660> people<00:05:17.930> who<00:05:18.410> are<00:05:18.440> guilty<00:05:18.950> of<00:05:18.979> this<00:05:19.250> I
