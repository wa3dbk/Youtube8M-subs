00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.010
 hey people crime xi and yesterday has 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.019
 rockstar games again a few 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.730
 really cool info for the gta 5 next 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 version publishes this information 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.789
 However, they only offer themselves to the people 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.930
 it already is now playing the movie 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.789
 and then to the next version 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.230
 change and that just really right 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.180
 cool things and I will 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.789
 just present it first 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 there would be the import djf and the logo 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.849
 plane this one can pass both through 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.679
 get missions 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.759
 You also have to have one with Michael 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.930
 Clarify murder case and I think so 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.460
 really cool that a few more 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.480
 singleplayer mission there and the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.890
 Murder hears in any case right 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.270
 I'll definitely be cool too 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.620
 all the stuff and in the video 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.030
 linking so that you can 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.399
 that also can read through 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.500
 and then there are two new ones 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.090
 weapons that would be the railgun and once 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.920
 the hatchet and I think so too 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.180
 really money because there is also here 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.710
 that the religion has its own ammunition 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.840
 I need to be there first 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.649
 curious how that will be with the parents and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 I would be correct in any case 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.309
 annoy if I'm not a player of the old 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.600
 console would be and then just not this 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.670
 would get cool weapon 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.350
 Furthermore, there is a new dive boat 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 the kraken dive boat and now you can 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.159
 Unlock by franklin with new 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.100
 animal species are photographed on one 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.049
 new single emission then there is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 but karen and these stalkers 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.740
 they can just be sponsored 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.869
 unlock stockcars so how to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 example at the party with advertising for 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.560
 on it and that 's it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.270
 with the stalkers and then there are still 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 a really cool further thing and that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 monkeys would be complete in the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.100
 city â€‹â€‹distributed by the artist so that 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.140
 Any artworks are currently on in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.549
 which one should apply and this one should 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.259
 all find when did you do that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.259
 then you switch the special blister 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.579
 compact free in gogo space monkey praise there 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.900
 Unfortunately, there was no picture here I am 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.530
 In any case , you are really curious 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.450
 how it will be 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.070
 I think that we mediate as with 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.570
 So tell the spaceship that you have to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.130
 example is to find all muslims and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.009
 then just get this pista compact 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.390
 in gogol's base you are wise for the space 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.040
 Talker where to put the room 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.110
 yes, the principle is only synonymous 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.159
 a jota giving the space stalker look 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.240
 so that we definitely 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.500
 really cool because I'm looking forward to it too 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.450
 this is a new one 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.189
 sigrid k there are still others 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.899
 a new airship sponsored by 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.000
 Clairvaux Gas and a new monster 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.469
 truck with the name travel marshall as 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.729
 In any case, everything is really cool 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.410
 new features and I 'm really looking forward to it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.630
 that rockstar games so many 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 features has built for the people 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.240
 have already played gta and with it 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.710
 make them definitely some back 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.150
 good with the bank robberies at least at 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.350
 I will not be your opinion to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.550
 you are interested in all the new ones 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.140
 I definitely think of features 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.220
 really strong and that's where I want to say 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.570
 next time, pure people yours 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.990

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.990
 assess
