so<00:00:00.989> welcome<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.469> part<00:00:01.500> 3<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.250> how<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.669> solve<00:00:02.970> the

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
so welcome to part 3 of how to solve the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.530 
so welcome to part 3 of how to solve the
5x5<00:00:03.389> Rubik's<00:00:04.080> cube<00:00:04.319> in<00:00:04.430> my<00:00:05.430> previous<00:00:06.029> videos<00:00:06.390> I

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
5x5 Rubik's cube in my previous videos I

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.330 
5x5 Rubik's cube in my previous videos I
explained<00:00:06.930> how<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.200> solve<00:00:07.830> all<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.099> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
explained how to solve all of the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.799 
explained how to solve all of the
centers<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.940> cube<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.570> should<00:00:09.780> have

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
centers of the cube so you should have

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.900 
centers of the cube so you should have
this<00:00:10.110> done<00:00:10.349> already<00:00:10.559> all<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.490> centers<00:00:11.790> of

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
this done already all of the centers of

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.419 
this done already all of the centers of
the<00:00:11.969> cube<00:00:12.240> should<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:13.019> solved<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:14.280> this

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
the cube should be solved and in this

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.550 
the cube should be solved and in this
video<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.089> am<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.900> teach<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.230> how<00:00:16.500> to

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
video I am going to teach you how to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.150 
video I am going to teach you how to
match<00:00:16.890> all<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.970> edges<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.680> cube<00:00:19.859> all

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
match all of the edges of the cube all

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.950 
match all of the edges of the cube all
right<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.400> are<00:00:20.520> going<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.789> match<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
right we are going to match all of the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.679 
right we are going to match all of the
edges<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.529> cube<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.980> notice<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> 5x5

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
edges of the cube and notice for a 5x5

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.429 
edges of the cube and notice for a 5x5
cube<00:00:25.050> each<00:00:25.740> edge<00:00:26.039> has<00:00:26.340> has<00:00:27.180> three<00:00:27.480> pieces<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
cube each edge has has three pieces this

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.380 
cube each edge has has three pieces this
edge<00:00:28.619> has<00:00:28.830> three<00:00:29.039> pieces<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.609> edge<00:00:29.820> has<00:00:30.000> one

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
edge has three pieces this edge has one

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.130 
edge has three pieces this edge has one
two<00:00:30.599> three<00:00:30.900> pieces<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> 4x4<00:00:33.270> cube<00:00:33.540> each

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
two three pieces and for a 4x4 cube each

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.400 
two three pieces and for a 4x4 cube each
edge<00:00:34.500> only<00:00:34.950> has<00:00:35.309> two<00:00:35.550> pieces<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.809> does

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
edge only has two pieces but that does

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
edge only has two pieces but that does
not<00:00:37.620> really<00:00:37.829> matter<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.969> matching

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
not really matter because so matching

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.560 
not really matter because so matching
the<00:00:39.629> edges<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> 5x5<00:00:41.340> cube<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.879> still<00:00:42.390> pretty

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the edges for a 5x5 cube is still pretty

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.130 
the edges for a 5x5 cube is still pretty
much<00:00:43.160> identical<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.340> matching<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.539> edges<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
much identical to matching the edges of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.220 
much identical to matching the edges of
a<00:00:46.559> 4x4<00:00:47.399> cube<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.910> let's<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:48.989> get<00:00:49.170> started

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a 4x4 cube so let's just get started

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.850 
a 4x4 cube so let's just get started
right<00:00:50.190> away<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.469> think<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.590> will<00:00:52.739> make

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
right away and I think this will make

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.189 
right away and I think this will make
more<00:00:53.010> sense<00:00:53.070> once<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.789> started<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
more sense once we get started so the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.799 
more sense once we get started so the
first<00:00:55.410> thing<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:56.039> want<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.850> we

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
first thing that we want to do is we

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.700 
first thing that we want to do is we
want<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.109> match<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.500> middle<00:00:58.980> edge<00:00:59.160> piece<00:00:59.489> with<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
want to match a middle edge piece with a

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.959 
want to match a middle edge piece with a
non<00:01:01.710> middle<00:01:02.039> edge<00:01:02.160> piece<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.940> mean

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
non middle edge piece so what do I mean

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.179 
non middle edge piece so what do I mean
by<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.390> let's<00:01:03.930> take<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.589> orange<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> white

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
by that let's take this orange and white

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.460 
by that let's take this orange and white
color<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.700> example<00:01:05.780> notice<00:01:06.780> how<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> middle

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
color for example notice how the middle

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.120 
color for example notice how the middle
of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.369> orange<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.729> white<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.680> right<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
of the orange and white is right here so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859 
of the orange and white is right here so
this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> middle<00:01:12.000> edge<00:01:12.119> piece<00:01:12.420> for<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
this is the middle edge piece for the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.260 
this is the middle edge piece for the
orange<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.229> white<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:15.090> that's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
orange and white and we have one that's

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.850 
orange and white and we have one that's
not<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> middle<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.380> orange<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.770> white

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
not the middle that's orange and white

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.740 
not the middle that's orange and white
right<00:01:17.070> here<00:01:17.100> alright<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.420> first

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
right here alright so I'm going first

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.380 
right here alright so I'm going first
thing<00:01:18.930> I'm<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> do<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
position<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.560> orientation<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
position it so the orientation is the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.920 
position it so the orientation is the
opposite<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:25.259> either<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:26.509> so<00:01:27.509> notice<00:01:27.810> how

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
opposite for either one so notice how

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
opposite for either one so notice how
this<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.770> has<00:01:28.920> white<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> top<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.880> this

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
this one has white on the top and this

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.499 
this one has white on the top and this
one<00:01:30.479> has<00:01:31.460> orange<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> top<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.210> right<00:01:33.329> so

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
one has orange on the top all right so

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
one has orange on the top all right so
you<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> position<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:35.369> they

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
you want to position them so that they

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.990 
you want to position them so that they
have<00:01:35.610> opposite<00:01:36.240> orientation<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.040> at

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
have opposite orientation right and at

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.510 
have opposite orientation right and at
this<00:01:39.270> point<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.990> want<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.890> want<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.310> side

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this point you want you want this side

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
this point you want you want this side
to<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.000> front<00:01:42.270> side<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> cube<00:01:43.369> all

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
to be the front side of the cube all

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.789 
to be the front side of the cube all
right<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:45.060> we're<00:01:45.180> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.079> we

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
right and what we're going to do is we

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.749 
right and what we're going to do is we
are<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> bring<00:01:48.049> this<00:01:49.049> origin<00:01:49.500> white

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
are going to bring this origin white

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.429 
are going to bring this origin white
edge<00:01:50.759> piece<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> bring<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
edge piece and we're going to bring it

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.639 
edge piece and we're going to bring it
over<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.680> match<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> center

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
over and match it with the center

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.920 
over and match it with the center
all<00:01:55.649> right<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> notice<00:01:57.180> how<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.479> these<00:01:57.659> orange

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
all right so notice how now these orange

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.590 
all right so notice how now these orange
and<00:01:58.049> white<00:01:58.110> edge<00:01:58.290> pieces<00:01:58.590> are<00:01:59.040> matched<00:01:59.520> we<00:02:00.420> did

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and white edge pieces are matched we did

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
and white edge pieces are matched we did
screw<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> center<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.009> we're<00:02:02.159> going<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
screw up the center so we're going to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.999 
screw up the center so we're going to
fix<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.729> later<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:04.020> after<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.829> match

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
fix that later on but after you match

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.940 
fix that later on but after you match
the<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.149> orange<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:07.079> after<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.619> match<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the the orange or after you match the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.100 
the the orange or after you match the
edge<00:02:08.039> pieces<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:09.000> want<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.239> bring<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.660> from

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
edge pieces you want to bring them from

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.449

the front to the top side of the cube

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.720 
the front to the top side of the cube
all<00:02:14.459> right<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.930> no<00:02:16.200> now<00:02:16.620> notice<00:02:17.099> how<00:02:17.340> these

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
all right so no now notice how these

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.309 
all right so no now notice how these
orange<00:02:18.180> or<00:02:18.239> white<00:02:18.299> edge<00:02:18.480> pieces<00:02:18.750> they're

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
orange or white edge pieces they're

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.649 
orange or white edge pieces they're
matched<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.340> are<00:02:20.400> on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.970> top<00:02:21.209> side<00:02:21.510> of

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
matched and they are on the top side of

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.229 
matched and they are on the top side of
the<00:02:21.689> cube<00:02:21.989> after<00:02:22.439> you<00:02:23.280> bring<00:02:23.430> them<00:02:23.579> to<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:23.879> top

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
the cube after you bring them to the top

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.059 
the cube after you bring them to the top
side<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.780> cube<00:02:25.019> you<00:02:25.409> want<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.680> replace

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
side of the cube you want to replace

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.690 
side of the cube you want to replace
these<00:02:26.610> pieces<00:02:26.970> with<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> unmatched<00:02:28.620> pair<00:02:29.040> so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
these pieces with a unmatched pair so

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.250 
these pieces with a unmatched pair so
these<00:02:29.819> two<00:02:30.060> pieces<00:02:30.269> need<00:02:30.629> to<00:02:30.659> be<00:02:30.750> replaced

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
these two pieces need to be replaced

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.559 
these two pieces need to be replaced
with<00:02:31.950> an<00:02:32.069> unmatched<00:02:32.489> pair<00:02:32.760> by<00:02:32.940> rotating<00:02:33.360> the

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
with an unmatched pair by rotating the

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.630 
with an unmatched pair by rotating the
top<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.709> rotate<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.129> top<00:02:35.310> as<00:02:35.459> many

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
top so you can rotate the top as many

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640 
top so you can rotate the top as many
times<00:02:35.849> as<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.090> want<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.110> an<00:02:37.200> unmatched

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
times as you want so that an unmatched

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.000 
times as you want so that an unmatched
pair<00:02:38.010> takes<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.790> place<00:02:39.379> so<00:02:40.379> I<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.829> need<00:02:40.950> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
pair takes this place so I just need to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.580 
pair takes this place so I just need to
rotate<00:02:41.129> it<00:02:41.400> one<00:02:41.519> time<00:02:41.959> because<00:02:42.959> notice<00:02:43.439> how

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
rotate it one time because notice how

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.619 
rotate it one time because notice how
these<00:02:44.340> two<00:02:44.400> pieces<00:02:44.939> that<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.329> took<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
these two pieces that just took the

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.009 
these two pieces that just took the
place<00:02:45.840> are<00:02:46.620> unmatched<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.909> one<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.329> red<00:02:48.659> and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
place are unmatched this one is red and

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.770 
place are unmatched this one is red and
blue<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.739> one's<00:02:50.040> white<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.609> green<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.540> these

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
blue this one's white and green so these

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.809 
blue this one's white and green so these
two<00:02:52.019> pieces<00:02:52.290> unmatched<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.370> took<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.609> place

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
two pieces unmatched just took the place

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.610 
two pieces unmatched just took the place
of<00:02:54.060> our<00:02:54.299> matched<00:02:54.720> pair<00:02:54.989> which<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.290> now<00:02:55.409> back

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
of our matched pair which is now back

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.020 
of our matched pair which is now back
here<00:02:56.690> all<00:02:57.690> right<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.260> after<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:59.250> replace<00:02:59.819> them

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
here all right so after you replace them

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.879 
here all right so after you replace them
with<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.420> unmatched<00:03:00.870> pair<00:03:01.200> which<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.620> right

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
with the unmatched pair which is right

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.289 
with the unmatched pair which is right
here<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.340> want<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.519> bring<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.879> unmatched

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
here you want to bring that unmatched

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.479 
here you want to bring that unmatched
pair<00:03:03.599> back<00:03:04.470> down<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.159> front<00:03:05.400> side<00:03:05.609> and

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
pair back down to the front side and

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.309 
pair back down to the front side and
after<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.609> bring<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:09.420> unmatched<00:03:09.750> pair<00:03:10.049> back

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
after you bring the unmatched pair back

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.280 
after you bring the unmatched pair back
down<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.829> down<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.879> front<00:03:12.090> side<00:03:12.299> now

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
down to the down to the front side now

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.890 
down to the down to the front side now
you<00:03:13.349> can<00:03:13.799> fix<00:03:14.040> your<00:03:14.190> centers<00:03:14.519> all<00:03:15.420> right<00:03:15.599> so

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
you can fix your centers all right so

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.339 
you can fix your centers all right so
since<00:03:16.409> our<00:03:16.799> blue<00:03:17.400> Center<00:03:17.819> is<00:03:18.090> over<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.169> I

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
since our blue Center is over here I

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.520 
since our blue Center is over here I
just<00:03:19.680> want<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:19.919> bring<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.190> Center<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.530> bring

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
just want to bring that Center and bring

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.920 
just want to bring that Center and bring
it<00:03:22.680> back<00:03:23.660> all<00:03:24.660> right<00:03:24.889> so<00:03:25.889> now<00:03:26.480> notice<00:03:27.480> how<00:03:27.750> all

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
it back all right so now notice how all

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.770 
it back all right so now notice how all
our<00:03:27.959> centers<00:03:28.470> are<00:03:28.680> still<00:03:29.160> intact<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.819> we<00:03:30.629> also

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
our centers are still intact and we also

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.939 
our centers are still intact and we also
have<00:03:31.139> matched<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:32.340> orange<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.209> white<00:03:33.949> at

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
have matched this orange and white at

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.470 
have matched this orange and white at
these<00:03:35.370> edges<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:35.910> that's<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.049> basic<00:03:37.410> idea<00:03:37.590> of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
these edges so that's the basic idea of

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.470 
these edges so that's the basic idea of
matching<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:40.290> edges<00:03:40.709> for<00:03:41.310> for<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.269> 5x5

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
matching the edges for for the 5x5

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.050 
matching the edges for for the 5x5
rubik's<00:03:43.139> cube<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.799> want<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.069> do<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:44.579> many

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
rubik's cube you want to do that as many

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.990 
rubik's cube you want to do that as many
times<00:03:45.239> as<00:03:46.129> possible<00:03:47.419> so<00:03:48.419> so<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.790> all

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
times as possible so so that so that all

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.030 
times as possible so so that so that all
the<00:03:51.150> match<00:03:51.269> all<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> edges<00:03:51.989> are<00:03:52.109> matched<00:03:52.290> but

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
the match all the edges are matched but

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.199 
the match all the edges are matched but
I'm<00:03:53.190> going<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.400> go<00:03:53.489> over<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.760> couple<00:03:54.060> more

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
I'm going to go over a couple more

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.390 
I'm going to go over a couple more
examples<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:55.079> some<00:03:55.470> problems<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:56.099> you<00:03:56.250> might

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
examples of some problems that you might

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.610 
examples of some problems that you might
run<00:03:56.579> into<00:03:56.900> now<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.989> first<00:03:58.169> thing<00:03:58.290> I'll<00:03:58.409> do<00:03:58.530> I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
run into now the first thing I'll do I

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.640 
run into now the first thing I'll do I
guess<00:03:58.829> is<00:03:58.859> just<00:03:59.069> complete<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.989> white<00:04:01.319> and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
guess is just complete this white and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.520 
guess is just complete this white and
orange<00:04:02.129> edge<00:04:02.780> all<00:04:03.780> right<00:04:03.930> notice<00:04:04.379> how<00:04:04.470> the

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
orange edge all right notice how the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.559 
orange edge all right notice how the
other<00:04:04.709> piece<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.639> already<00:04:05.909> in<00:04:06.090> perfect

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
other piece for it is already in perfect

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.990 
other piece for it is already in perfect
position<00:04:06.959> for<00:04:06.989> us<00:04:07.290> because<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.519> needs<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.849> go

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
position for us because it needs to go

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.599 
position for us because it needs to go
into<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.329> bottom<00:04:09.870> into<00:04:10.229> the<00:04:10.319> bottom<00:04:10.680> layer

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
into this bottom into the bottom layer

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.879 
into this bottom into the bottom layer
of<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.419> edge<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.900> it's<00:04:13.470> already<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.769> the

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
of the edge and it's already in the

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.099 
of the edge and it's already in the
bottom<00:04:14.159> layer<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.579> also<00:04:15.209> to<00:04:15.449> has<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:15.930> have

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
bottom layer and also to has to have

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.469 
bottom layer and also to has to have
opposite<00:04:16.620> orientation<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.489> notice<00:04:18.299> how<00:04:18.419> the

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
opposite orientation and notice how the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.319 
opposite orientation and notice how the
middle<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:19.079> white<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:20.400> one<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.880> orange

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
middle is white and this one is orange

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.990 
middle is white and this one is orange
on<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:22.169> on<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.740> top<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.250> they<00:04:23.639> already<00:04:23.820> have

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
on the on the top so they already have

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.640 
on the on the top so they already have
opposite<00:04:24.330> orientation<00:04:24.900> it's<00:04:25.050> in<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.289> correct

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
opposite orientation it's in the correct

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.370 
opposite orientation it's in the correct
layer<00:04:25.940> so<00:04:26.940> we<00:04:26.969> can<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.330> do<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.599> same<00:04:27.870> process

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
layer so we can just do the same process

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.850 
layer so we can just do the same process
that<00:04:28.620> we<00:04:29.099> just<00:04:29.250> did<00:04:29.930> for<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.960> for<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.680> last

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
that we just did for the for the last

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.920 
that we just did for the for the last
time<00:04:32.039> we<00:04:32.190> match<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:33.419> orange<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:33.780> white

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
time we match that the orange and white

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.540 
time we match that the orange and white
so<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.469> first<00:04:34.650> thing<00:04:34.800> I'm<00:04:34.889> going<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.159> do<00:04:35.340> is

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.610 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:35.639> going<00:04:35.729> to<00:04:35.789> bring<00:04:35.969> this<00:04:36.270> edge<00:04:36.630> piece<00:04:36.659> and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
I'm going to bring this edge piece and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.830 
I'm going to bring this edge piece and
bring<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.460> over<00:04:38.700> and<00:04:38.729> match<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.300> with<00:04:39.419> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
bring it over and match it with the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.610 
bring it over and match it with the
white<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.320> orange<00:04:40.469> edges<00:04:42.200> all<00:04:43.200> right<00:04:43.349> so<00:04:43.500> now

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
white and orange edges all right so now

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.430 
white and orange edges all right so now
notice<00:04:43.800> how<00:04:44.010> we<00:04:44.070> have<00:04:44.159> all<00:04:44.400> three<00:04:45.229> edges<00:04:46.229> that

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
notice how we have all three edges that

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.870 
notice how we have all three edges that
are<00:04:46.500> matched<00:04:46.800> but<00:04:47.190> we<00:04:47.279> just<00:04:47.460> screwed<00:04:47.639> up<00:04:47.760> the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
are matched but we just screwed up the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.330 
are matched but we just screwed up the
center<00:04:48.710> which<00:04:49.710> we're<00:04:49.889> going<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.070> fix<00:04:50.219> that

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
center which we're going to fix that

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.149 
center which we're going to fix that
later<00:04:50.639> on<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:51.120> our<00:04:52.020> next<00:04:52.320> step<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.800> we're

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
later on and our next step is we're

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.879 
later on and our next step is we're
going<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.370> bring<00:04:53.490> all<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.940> match<00:04:54.060> pieces

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
going to bring all of the match pieces

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.040 
going to bring all of the match pieces
to<00:04:55.889> the<00:04:56.010> top<00:04:56.190> side<00:04:56.400> of<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.550> cube<00:04:58.550> all<00:04:59.550> right

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
to the top side of the cube all right

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.709 
to the top side of the cube all right
since<00:05:01.050> we<00:05:01.229> just<00:05:01.529> matched<00:05:02.240> these<00:05:03.240> two<00:05:03.570> edge

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
since we just matched these two edge

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:09.589 
since we just matched these two edge
pieces<00:05:05.479> right<00:05:06.479> here<00:05:07.130> these<00:05:08.130> two<00:05:08.550> pieces<00:05:09.210> need

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
pieces right here these two pieces need

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.250 
pieces right here these two pieces need
to<00:05:09.659> be<00:05:09.750> replaced<00:05:10.139> by<00:05:10.529> an<00:05:10.740> unmatched<00:05:11.340> pair<00:05:12.260> all

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
to be replaced by an unmatched pair all

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.490 
to be replaced by an unmatched pair all
right<00:05:14.090> so<00:05:15.090> what<00:05:15.450> I'm<00:05:15.659> going<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.050> do<00:05:16.229> is<00:05:16.380> just

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
right so what I'm going to do is just

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.000 
right so what I'm going to do is just
rotate<00:05:16.889> it<00:05:16.919> one<00:05:17.219> time<00:05:18.000> clockwise<00:05:18.889> notice<00:05:19.889> how

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
rotate it one time clockwise notice how

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.040 
rotate it one time clockwise notice how
these<00:05:20.219> two<00:05:20.279> pieces<00:05:20.669> just<00:05:21.090> took<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.479> place<00:05:21.690> of

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
these two pieces just took the place of

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.129 
these two pieces just took the place of
the<00:05:22.169> pieces<00:05:22.919> that<00:05:23.099> were<00:05:23.279> matched<00:05:24.020> all<00:05:25.020> right

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
the pieces that were matched all right

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.959 
the pieces that were matched all right
and<00:05:25.320> these<00:05:25.680> are<00:05:25.740> unmatched<00:05:26.219> so<00:05:26.580> that's<00:05:26.729> good

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
and these are unmatched so that's good

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:28.879 
and these are unmatched so that's good
we<00:05:27.150> replace<00:05:27.659> the<00:05:27.840> matched<00:05:28.020> pair<00:05:28.320> with<00:05:28.860> a

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
we replace the matched pair with a

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.540 
we replace the matched pair with a
unmatched<00:05:29.520> pair<00:05:30.830> once<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:31.950> do<00:05:32.070> that<00:05:32.219> you<00:05:32.400> can

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
unmatched pair once you do that you can

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.140 
unmatched pair once you do that you can
bring<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.849> unmatched<00:05:33.180> pair<00:05:33.539> down<00:05:33.990> to<00:05:34.590> the

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
bring the unmatched pair down to the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.420 
bring the unmatched pair down to the
front<00:05:36.150> side<00:05:36.779> of<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:37.080> cube<00:05:37.320> sorry<00:05:37.860> I'm<00:05:38.190> having

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
front side of the cube sorry I'm having

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.129 
front side of the cube sorry I'm having
a<00:05:38.520> trouble<00:05:38.820> twisting<00:05:41.659> all<00:05:42.659> right<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:42.930> once

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
a trouble twisting all right and once

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.990 
a trouble twisting all right and once
you<00:05:43.260> bring<00:05:43.409> this<00:05:43.650> unmatched<00:05:44.070> pair<00:05:44.430> to<00:05:44.789> the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
you bring this unmatched pair to the

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.140 
you bring this unmatched pair to the
front<00:05:45.500> now<00:05:46.500> we<00:05:46.560> can<00:05:46.800> fix<00:05:46.979> our<00:05:47.250> centers<00:05:47.700> all

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
front now we can fix our centers all

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.420 
front now we can fix our centers all
right<00:05:48.360> since<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:48.779> yellow<00:05:49.110> is<00:05:49.289> over<00:05:49.560> here<00:05:49.830> and

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
right since the yellow is over here and

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.830 
right since the yellow is over here and
bring<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.760> yellow<00:05:50.849> back<00:05:53.060> so<00:05:54.060> now<00:05:54.210> notice<00:05:54.479> our

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
bring the yellow back so now notice our

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.060 
bring the yellow back so now notice our
centers<00:05:55.260> are<00:05:55.500> still<00:05:56.159> intact<00:05:56.760> and<00:05:57.750> we<00:05:58.590> have<00:05:58.800> all

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
centers are still intact and we have all

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.990 
centers are still intact and we have all
of<00:05:59.460> our<00:06:00.409> white<00:06:01.409> and<00:06:01.590> orange<00:06:01.800> edge<00:06:02.219> pieces<00:06:02.580> are

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
of our white and orange edge pieces are

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.110 
of our white and orange edge pieces are
matched<00:06:03.330> so<00:06:03.990> this<00:06:04.650> is<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:04.919> basic<00:06:05.340> idea<00:06:05.490> of

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
matched so this is the basic idea of

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.430 
matched so this is the basic idea of
matching<00:06:06.900> your<00:06:07.380> edges<00:06:08.419> in<00:06:09.419> my<00:06:09.599> next<00:06:09.900> video<00:06:10.169> I

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
matching your edges in my next video I

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.810 
matching your edges in my next video I
am<00:06:10.770> going<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:12.620> go<00:06:13.620> into<00:06:13.800> further<00:06:14.130> detail<00:06:14.580> on

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
am going to go into further detail on

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.510 
am going to go into further detail on
how<00:06:15.779> to<00:06:15.810> match<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.409> edges<00:06:16.740> when<00:06:17.190> you<00:06:17.279> get<00:06:17.430> to

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
how to match the edges when you get to

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.399 
how to match the edges when you get to
the<00:06:17.639> end<00:06:17.820> you<00:06:18.270> do<00:06:18.419> run<00:06:18.659> into<00:06:18.719> some<00:06:19.020> more

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
the end you do run into some more

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.610 
the end you do run into some more
problems<00:06:19.650> so<00:06:20.580> in<00:06:21.360> my<00:06:21.449> next<00:06:21.630> video<00:06:21.900> I<00:06:21.930> will<00:06:22.380> be

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
problems so in my next video I will be

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.240 
problems so in my next video I will be
going<00:06:22.740> over<00:06:22.979> all<00:06:23.400> of<00:06:23.849> the<00:06:24.300> of<00:06:25.260> the<00:06:25.500> last<00:06:25.710> edges

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
going over all of the of the last edges

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.670 
going over all of the of the last edges
that<00:06:26.490> we<00:06:26.580> match<00:06:26.729> up<00:06:27.139> sometimes<00:06:28.139> you<00:06:28.349> run<00:06:28.469> into

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
that we match up sometimes you run into

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.440 
that we match up sometimes you run into
parity<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.279> sometimes<00:06:29.729> it's<00:06:30.180> a<00:06:30.240> little<00:06:30.330> bit

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
parity and sometimes it's a little bit

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.589 
parity and sometimes it's a little bit
more<00:06:30.659> difficult<00:06:31.019> so<00:06:31.729> until<00:06:32.729> my<00:06:32.820> next<00:06:32.880> video<00:06:33.209> I

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
more difficult so until my next video I

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:36.860 
more difficult so until my next video I
will<00:06:34.409> see<00:06:34.589> you<00:06:34.680> later
