00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.300 
on to the hollow again the hollows going
to<00:00:39.900> ride<00:00:40.050> upon<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:40.500> two<00:00:40.740> edges<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.220> the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
to ride upon the two edges of the

00:00:41.310 --> 00:01:09.200 
to ride upon the two edges of the
chamfer<00:01:07.220> not<00:01:08.220> only<00:01:08.520> am<00:01:08.610> i<00:01:08.700> watching<00:01:08.910> the

chamfer not only am i watching the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
chamfer not only am i watching the
chamfer<00:01:09.600> disappear<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.800> I<00:01:10.860> also<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
chamfer disappear but I also want to

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
chamfer disappear but I also want to
make<00:01:11.550> sure<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> vertical<00:01:12.420> face<00:01:12.900> along

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
make sure that the vertical face along

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.859 
make sure that the vertical face along
the<00:01:13.440> edge<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.640> horizontal<00:01:14.970> fill<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> up

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the edge and the horizontal fill it up

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.260 
the edge and the horizontal fill it up
top<00:01:16.200> or<00:01:16.470> disappearing<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.220> uniformly<00:01:17.850> along

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
top or disappearing a uniformly along

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:33.620 
top or disappearing a uniformly along
the<00:01:18.479> entire<00:01:18.810> length<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.790> we're<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.420> about

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the entire length and we're just about

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:44.300 
the entire length and we're just about
there<00:01:42.229> I'll<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.410> back<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.920> rabbet<00:01:44.280> plane

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
there I'll go back with the rabbet plane

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.150 
there I'll go back with the rabbet plane
now<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.690> clean<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.350> vertical<00:01:46.890> fill

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
now and just clean up that vertical fill

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:58.219 
now and just clean up that vertical fill
it<00:01:47.340> along<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.270> edge

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.810 

there's<00:01:59.229> no<00:01:59.409> plain<00:01:59.740> tracks<00:02:00.070> in<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.369> profile

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
there's no plain tracks in the profile

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.130 
there's no plain tracks in the profile
now<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.979> I'd<00:02:02.979> say<00:02:03.310> at<00:02:03.460> this<00:02:03.670> stage<00:02:04.140> it's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
now and I'd say at this stage it's

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:17.970 
now and I'd say at this stage it's
complete

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.040
