00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
never know what it's going to happen and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.260 
never know what it's going to happen and
lo<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.129> behold<00:01:01.250> I<00:01:01.520> figured<00:01:01.850> it<00:01:01.910> out<00:01:01.969> about<00:01:02.210> a

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
lo and behold I figured it out about a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.570 
lo and behold I figured it out about a
couple<00:01:02.600> months<00:01:02.719> ago<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.320> I<00:01:04.009> haven't<00:01:04.190> hit<00:01:04.430> one

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
couple months ago and I haven't hit one

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.580 
couple months ago and I haven't hit one
and<00:01:04.790> at<00:01:05.570> least<00:01:05.750> that<00:01:05.960> couple<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.289> months<00:01:06.470> or

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
and at least that couple of months or

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.320 
and at least that couple of months or
more<00:01:06.710> since<00:01:06.920> I<00:01:07.070> figured<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:07.460> out<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:08.210> all

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
more since I figured it out and it all

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.510 
more since I figured it out and it all
comes<00:01:08.539> down<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.780> posture<00:01:09.320> now<00:01:10.039> again<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.399> know

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
comes down to posture now again you know

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.920 
comes down to posture now again you know
the<00:01:10.550> statement<00:01:11.000> for<00:01:11.119> posture<00:01:11.300> is<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.690> setup

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
the statement for posture is the setup

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.560 
the statement for posture is the setup
determines<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.680> motion<00:01:13.009> all<00:01:13.729> right<00:01:13.910> and<00:01:14.119> so

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
determines the motion all right and so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.420 
determines the motion all right and so
the<00:01:15.080> definition<00:01:15.259> of<00:01:15.619> posture<00:01:16.009> is<00:01:16.100> we<00:01:16.220> have<00:01:16.340> to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
the definition of posture is we have to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.430 
the definition of posture is we have to
get<00:01:16.550> into<00:01:16.850> an<00:01:16.970> athletically<00:01:17.570> ready<00:01:17.960> position

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
hill where it catches the hosel and you

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.310 
hill where it catches the hosel and you
got<00:03:45.450> enough<00:03:45.630> fazal<00:03:45.960> like<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.170> have<00:03:46.290> with

wedges 2 through 7 irons and six signs

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.320 
wedges 2 through 7 irons and six signs
that<00:03:49.350> thing<00:03:49.560> could<00:03:49.710> just<00:03:49.860> go<00:03:50.010> lock<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.240> the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
that thing could just go lock it to the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.510 
that thing could just go lock it to the
right<00:03:51.480> for<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.020> right-hander<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.620> those

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
right for a right-hander and those

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.400 
right for a right-hander and those
aren't<00:03:53.730> very<00:03:53.910> nice<00:03:54.090> shot

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
aren't very nice shot

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.460 
aren't very nice shot
so<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:58.170> key<00:03:58.350> is<00:03:58.380> posture<00:03:59.310> now<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.470> found

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
so the key is posture now I found

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.620 
so the key is posture now I found
everything<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:02.880> finally<00:04:03.120> figured<00:04:03.390> this

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
everything so and I finally figured this

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.420 
everything so and I finally figured this
out<00:04:03.780> part<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.530> what<00:04:04.680> would<00:04:04.770> I<00:04:04.830> was<00:04:04.950> having<00:04:05.280> what

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.090 
middle of my foot so when i get a ditch
I'm<00:04:26.970> up<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.390> I<00:04:27.450> got<00:04:27.720> beautifully<00:04:28.620> pure<00:04:28.830> lift

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
I'm up the I got beautifully pure lift

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.070 
I'm up the I got beautifully pure lift
here<00:04:29.670> I<00:04:29.970> couldn't<00:04:30.600> really<00:04:30.690> lift<00:04:30.960> that

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
here I couldn't really lift that

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.050 
here I couldn't really lift that
goodness<00:04:31.440> because<00:04:31.950> if<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.340> lifted<00:04:32.610> too<00:04:32.760> much<00:04:32.910> I

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
goodness because if I lifted too much I

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.340 
goodness because if I lifted too much I
would<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:33.240> was<00:04:33.480> in<00:04:33.600> trouble<00:04:33.720> losing<00:04:34.080> my<00:04:34.170> balance

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
would I was in trouble losing my balance

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.140 
would I was in trouble losing my balance
so<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.040> had<00:04:35.220> problems<00:04:35.640> with<00:04:35.700> balance<00:04:35.850> and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
so I had problems with balance and

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.360 
so I had problems with balance and
everything<00:04:36.480> once<00:04:37.230> I<00:04:37.350> get<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:37.650> this<00:04:37.740> position<00:04:38.220> I

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
everything once I get in this position I

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.690 
everything once I get in this position I
can<00:04:38.580> just<00:04:38.670> lift<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:38.940> straight<00:04:39.210> up<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:40.610> as<00:04:41.610> I

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
can just lift it straight up and as I

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.400 
can just lift it straight up and as I
come<00:04:41.880> back<00:04:42.030> down<00:04:42.300> my<00:04:42.750> hands<00:04:42.990> are<00:04:43.110> coming<00:04:43.230> down

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
come back down my hands are coming down

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.590 
come back down my hands are coming down
more<00:04:43.650> under<00:04:43.890> my<00:04:44.010> neck<00:04:44.220> it's<00:04:44.760> giving<00:04:45.000> me<00:04:45.030> give

more under my neck it's giving me give

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.090 
more under my neck it's giving me give
me<00:04:45.720> much<00:04:45.900> more<00:04:45.930> solid<00:04:46.320> contacts<00:04:46.860> better

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
me much more solid contacts better

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.250 
me much more solid contacts better
trajectories<00:04:47.670> in<00:04:47.820> naturally<00:04:48.510> I'm<00:04:48.780> hitting

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
trajectories in naturally I'm hitting

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260 
trajectories in naturally I'm hitting
the<00:04:49.350> ball<00:04:49.530> with<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.160> better<00:04:50.490> launch<00:04:50.700> angle<00:04:51.090> and
