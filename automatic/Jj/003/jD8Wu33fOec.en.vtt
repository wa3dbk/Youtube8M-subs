few<00:00:27.810> years<00:00:28.020> now<00:00:28.110> and<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> far<00:00:30.439> Manjaro<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.800> my

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
few years now and so far Manjaro is my

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.229

favorite which is the one that I'm using
right<00:00:33.510> now<00:00:34.129> and<00:00:35.129> a<00:00:35.220> lot<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.460> people<00:00:35.960> think<00:00:36.960> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
right now and a lot of people think the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.320 
right now and a lot of people think the
same<00:00:37.410> thing<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.339> my<00:00:38.519> djaro<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:39.150> I

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
same thing they like my djaro a lot I

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.369 
same thing they like my djaro a lot I
understand<00:00:39.750> why<00:00:40.220> but<00:00:41.839> there<00:00:42.839> have<00:00:43.230> been

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
understand why but there have been

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
understand why but there have been
several<00:00:43.860> people<00:00:44.129> including<00:00:44.789> myself<00:00:44.940> that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
several people including myself that

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.319 
several people including myself that
I've<00:00:45.510> seen<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.780> issue<00:00:45.930> online<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.329> several

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I've seen this issue online and several

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.290 
I've seen this issue online and several
other<00:00:48.480> places<00:00:48.750> where<00:00:49.910> they've<00:00:50.910> been<00:00:50.940> trying

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
other places where they've been trying

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.420 
other places where they've been trying
to<00:00:51.480> use<00:00:51.570> majare<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.230> multiple<00:00:52.649> displays<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
to use majare with multiple displays and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.700 
to use majare with multiple displays and
it<00:00:53.640> doesn't<00:00:53.940> work<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.690> the

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
it doesn't work and this is because the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.740 
it doesn't work and this is because the
support<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.160> multiple<00:00:59.760> displays<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.359> Manjaro

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
support for multiple displays in Manjaro

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500 
support for multiple displays in Manjaro
by<00:01:01.109> default<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.850> non-existent<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:03.300> not

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
by default is non-existent it's not

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.460 
by default is non-existent it's not
there<00:01:04.160> so<00:01:05.160> you<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.149> have<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.390> use<00:01:06.660> some<00:01:07.200> code

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
there so you you have to use some code

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.830 
there so you you have to use some code
to<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> work<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.570> anything

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
to get that to work it's not anything

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.139 
to get that to work it's not anything
difficult<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> figured<00:01:11.340> I'd<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.640> run<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
difficult so I figured I'd just run you

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.440 
difficult so I figured I'd just run you
guys<00:01:12.300> through<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:14.119> even<00:01:15.119> show<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.300> how<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
guys through it and even show you how to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320 
guys through it and even show you how to
make<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.960> shortcut<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> don't<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.180> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
make a shortcut so you don't have to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.080 
make a shortcut so you don't have to
worry<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> worry

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
worry about so you don't have to worry

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.120 
worry about so you don't have to worry
about<00:01:21.240> typing<00:01:22.080> command<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> every<00:01:22.770> time<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
about typing command and every time you

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.069 
about typing command and every time you
log<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.890> let's<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.460> started<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.450> the

shraeger - q that gives me my - displays

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.319 
shraeger - q that gives me my - displays
that<00:01:54.539> i<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.840> plugged<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.289> here<00:01:55.439> now<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:57.119> can

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
that i have plugged in here now you can

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.099 
that i have plugged in here now you can
see<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:58.579> my<00:01:59.579> wallpaper<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> little<00:02:00.929> messed

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
see here my wallpaper is a little messed

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.980 
see here my wallpaper is a little messed
up<00:02:01.319> here<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.390> two

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
up here and that's because the two

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
up here and that's because the two
displays<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.649> using<00:02:04.829> are<00:02:05.219> different

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
displays that I'm using are different

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.930 
displays that I'm using are different
sizes<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.569> it's<00:02:07.319> trying<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.489> make<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
sizes and it's trying to make the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.979 
sizes and it's trying to make the
wallpaper<00:02:09.330> fit<00:02:09.629> both<00:02:09.840> at<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.110> same<00:02:10.289> time<00:02:10.670> so

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
wallpaper fit both at the same time so

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.750 
wallpaper fit both at the same time so
because<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:14.010> dual<00:02:14.280> support<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:16.760> basically

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
because the dual support is basically

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
because the dual support is basically
just<00:02:17.879> mirroring<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.870> displays<00:02:20.959> it's<00:02:21.959> it's

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
just mirroring the displays it's it's

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.979 
just mirroring the displays it's it's
messing<00:02:22.739> up<00:02:22.890> my<00:02:22.920> my<00:02:23.819> resolution<00:02:24.420> my<00:02:24.540> wallpaper

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
messing up my my resolution my wallpaper

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.140 
messing up my my resolution my wallpaper
and<00:02:25.200> everything<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:26.099> really<00:02:26.459> useful

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
and everything it's not really useful

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.089 
and everything it's not really useful
unless<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:28.079> trying<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.590> plug<00:02:28.799> into<00:02:28.950> a

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
unless I'm trying to like plug into a

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.259 
unless I'm trying to like plug into a
projector<00:02:29.640> or<00:02:29.670> something<00:02:30.349> so<00:02:32.000> let<00:02:33.000> me<00:02:33.090> show

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
projector or something so let me show

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.319 
projector or something so let me show
you<00:02:33.329> here<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:36.019> LVDS<00:02:37.019> one<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.970> will<00:02:39.209> be

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
you here the LVDS one that will be

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.460 
you here the LVDS one that will be
probably<00:02:39.840> different<00:02:40.260> for<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:41.959> these<00:02:42.959> these

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
probably different for you these these
