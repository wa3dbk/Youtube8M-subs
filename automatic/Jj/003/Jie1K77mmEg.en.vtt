00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
last tutorial I showed you a little bit

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.849 
last tutorial I showed you a little bit
about<00:00:02.939> particles<00:00:03.840> that's<00:00:04.470> time<00:00:04.620> going<00:00:04.770> to

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
about particles that's time going to

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.380 
about particles that's time going to
show<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:05.040> how<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.220> superimpose<00:00:05.819> those

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
show you how to superimpose those

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.940 
show you how to superimpose those
particles<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.230> created<00:00:07.529> last<00:00:07.770> tutorial

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
particles that you created last tutorial

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.070 
particles that you created last tutorial
over<00:00:08.880> some<00:00:09.059> real<00:00:09.240> video<00:00:09.540> so<00:00:09.750> let's<00:00:09.809> get

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
over some real video so let's get

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.350 
over some real video so let's get
started<00:00:10.340> let's<00:00:11.570> click<00:00:12.570> here<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.019> add<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:14.360> UV

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
started let's click here and add a UV

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.109 
started let's click here and add a UV
sphere<00:00:15.980> ok<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.400> front<00:00:17.640> view<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:18.029> i'm

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
sphere ok and the front view here i'm

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.140 
sphere ok and the front view here i'm
gonna<00:00:18.210> hit<00:00:18.330> shift<00:00:18.630> 0<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.770> move<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> camera<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
gonna hit shift 0 to move the camera and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.269 
gonna hit shift 0 to move the camera and
i'll<00:00:21.240> make<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.689> front<00:00:21.960> view<00:00:22.020> again<00:00:22.410> will

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
i'll make this the front view again will

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.570 
i'll make this the front view again will
scale<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.300> down<00:00:24.439> that<00:00:25.439> sphere<00:00:25.920> down<00:00:26.130> which

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
scale that down that sphere down which

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
scale that down that sphere down which
is<00:00:26.609> going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:27.000> our<00:00:27.150> particle<00:00:27.599> emitter<00:00:28.220> in

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
is going to be our particle emitter in

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.529 
is going to be our particle emitter in
the<00:00:29.400> camera<00:00:29.670> view<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:30.000> we're<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> add

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the camera view here we're going to add

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.860 
the camera view here we're going to add
a<00:00:30.960> background<00:00:31.500> image<00:00:32.390> we're<00:00:33.390> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> load

going to tell that it's a movie I wanted
to<00:00:42.660> auto<00:00:42.870> refresh<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.640> frames

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
to auto refresh and then this frames

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.610 
to auto refresh and then this frames
you're<00:00:45.210> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> click<00:00:45.600> here<00:00:45.809> once<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.350> adds

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you're going to click here once it adds

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.380 
you're going to click here once it adds
one<00:00:46.890> frame<00:00:47.160> click<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.550> again<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> adds<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
one frame click it again it adds the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.119 
one frame click it again it adds the
number<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.840> frames<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> video<00:00:49.710> clip<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
number of frames in the video clip and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.049 
number of frames in the video clip and
there<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.730> am<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:52.260> move<00:00:52.559> through<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.670> frames

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
there I am as we move through the frames

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.540 
there I am as we move through the frames
of<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> video<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.590> me<00:00:55.800> moving<00:00:56.430> my

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
of the video you can see me moving my

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.510 
of the video you can see me moving my
hand<00:00:56.910> around<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:58.949> right<00:00:58.980> here

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
hand around and you can see right here

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.470 
hand around and you can see right here
that<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> number<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> frames<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.329> video

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that the number of frames in that video

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.060 
that the number of frames in that video
clip<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:04.129> 169<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.640> let's<00:01:05.850> make<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:06.270> project

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
clip are 169 so let's make our project

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.200 
clip are 169 so let's make our project
169<00:01:08.070> frames<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.650> now<00:01:10.650> let's<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.939> still

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
169 frames and now let's go we still

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
169 frames and now let's go we still
have<00:01:12.390> our<00:01:12.420> sphere<00:01:12.900> selected<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.650> we'll<00:01:14.280> go

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
have our sphere selected here we'll go

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390 
have our sphere selected here we'll go
to<00:01:14.490> object<00:01:15.000> window<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.869> f7<00:01:16.500> particles

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to object window which is f7 particles

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.109 
to object window which is f7 particles
new<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.450> an<00:01:18.630> emitter<00:01:19.670> let's<00:01:20.670> set<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> amount

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
new it's an emitter let's set the amount

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
new it's an emitter let's set the amount
to<00:01:21.810> about<00:01:22.350> 350<00:01:23.070> would<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.610> good<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:25.320> scroll

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
to about 350 would be good if we scroll

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.760 
to about 350 would be good if we scroll
up<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.280> frames<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.600> my<00:01:28.290> fingers<00:01:28.590> start

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
up in frames we can see my fingers start

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.370 
up in frames we can see my fingers start
to<00:01:28.860> come<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.159> frame<00:01:29.490> around<00:01:30.049> 50<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.200> let's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to come into frame around 50 so let's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.770 
to come into frame around 50 so let's
our<00:01:31.650> 25<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.670> we'll<00:01:32.790> set<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.479> start

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
our 25 so we'll set this to start

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.280 
our 25 so we'll set this to start
evening<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.820> 25<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.180> will<00:01:36.450> say<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> finish

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
evening at 25 and will say to finish

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.450 
evening at 25 and will say to finish
emitting<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:38.659> 169<00:01:39.659> which<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.759> frame

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
emitting at 169 which is the the frame

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.100 
emitting at 169 which is the the frame
total<00:01:44.460> frames<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.060> our<00:01:45.210> project<00:01:45.659> might<00:01:45.869> change

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
total frames of our project might change

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.249 
total frames of our project might change
that<00:01:46.380> later<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:47.329> want<00:01:48.329> my<00:01:48.390> particles<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> be

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that later I want my particles to be

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.109 
that later I want my particles to be
random<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:51.320> I'm<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> bake<00:01:52.799> from<00:01:53.280> 1<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.939> 1

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
random and I'm going to bake from 1 to 1

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.830 
random and I'm going to bake from 1 to 1
69<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.600> far<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:58.880> and<00:01:59.880> actually<00:02:00.360> we

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
69 and so far so good and actually we

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.090 
69 and so far so good and actually we
can<00:02:01.170> now<00:02:01.950> start<00:02:02.340> animating<00:02:02.759> our<00:02:03.119> ball<00:02:03.360> here<00:02:04.100> so

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
can now start animating our ball here so

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.620 
can now start animating our ball here so
what<00:02:05.310> I'm<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
what I'm going to do and you want to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.600 
what I'm going to do and you want to
make<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.079> full<00:02:07.530> screen<00:02:07.860> make<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> easier<00:02:08.399> for

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
make this full screen make it easier for

frame 25 my finger starts coming in and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.230 
frame 25 my finger starts coming in and
we're<00:02:23.130> just<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.550> track<00:02:23.940> my<00:02:24.180> finger

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
we're just going to track my finger

we're just going to track my finger
every<00:02:24.980> 5<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.010> 10<00:02:26.400> frames<00:02:26.760> I'm<00:02:27.330> going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.840> move

every 5 to 10 frames I'm going to move

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.380 
every 5 to 10 frames I'm going to move
the<00:02:28.200> sphere<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:29.180> add<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.210> keyframe<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:33.620> and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
the sphere and add a keyframe in and

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.640 
the sphere and add a keyframe in and
this<00:02:36.390> will<00:02:36.450> take<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.810> little<00:02:36.990> while<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.500> do

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
this will take a little while to do

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:46.930 
this will take a little while to do
doesn't<00:02:38.520> have<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.820> exact<00:02:39.270> for<00:02:39.420> this

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.130 

everyone's<00:02:47.940> file<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.390> back<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.810> seeing

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
everyone's file going back and seeing

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.240 
everyone's file going back and seeing
the<00:02:49.320> last<00:02:49.530> few<00:02:49.740> frames<00:02:50.040> we<00:02:50.370> did<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:55.530> just<00:02:55.560> get

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the last few frames we did and just get

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:08.960 
the last few frames we did and just get
in<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> basic<00:02:56.880> movement<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:58.190> my<00:02:59.190> finger<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.910> it

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
in the basic movement of my finger so it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.910 
in the basic movement of my finger so it
doesn't<00:03:09.210> have<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.420> be<00:03:09.480> exact<00:03:09.990> for<00:03:10.140> this<00:03:10.590> its

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
doesn't have to be exact for this its

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.580 
doesn't have to be exact for this its
particles<00:03:11.850> aren't<00:03:12.090> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> be<00:03:12.660> they're

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
particles aren't going to be they're

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.020 
particles aren't going to be they're
going<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:13.770> be<00:03:13.860> trailing<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.670> they're<00:03:14.910> going

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
going to be trailing and they're going

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.300 
going to be trailing and they're going
to<00:03:15.090> be<00:03:15.180> bouncing<00:03:15.720> off<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.900> sphere<00:03:16.650> randomly

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
to be bouncing off the sphere randomly

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.490 
to be bouncing off the sphere randomly
the<00:03:17.400> admitir<00:03:17.670> randomly<00:03:18.240> so<00:03:18.630> they<00:03:19.170> don't<00:03:19.320> have

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
the admitir randomly so they don't have

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:30.260 
the admitir randomly so they don't have
to<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.820> right<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:21.020> just<00:03:22.020> pretty<00:03:22.410> close<00:03:22.770> I<00:03:29.270> said

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
to be right on just pretty close I said

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.670 
to be right on just pretty close I said
every<00:03:30.540> five<00:03:30.780> or<00:03:30.830> ten<00:03:31.830> frames<00:03:33.260> we're<00:03:34.260> setting

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
every five or ten frames we're setting

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.560 
every five or ten frames we're setting
the<00:03:34.740> keyframes<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.700> blender<00:03:36.690> will<00:03:37.430> obviously

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
the keyframes and blender will obviously

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:51.410 
the keyframes and blender will obviously
do<00:03:39.570> all<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.020> frames<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.890> between

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:12.520 

looking<00:03:52.420> good<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:52.660> far

okay<00:04:13.400> that's<00:04:13.610> about<00:04:13.700> as<00:04:13.880> far<00:04:13.940> as<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.270> go<00:04:14.800> so<00:04:15.800> now

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
okay that's about as far as I go so now

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.370 
okay that's about as far as I go so now
that<00:04:15.950> we<00:04:16.100> got<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:16.280> we<00:04:16.519> can<00:04:16.880> press<00:04:17.420> alt<00:04:17.690> a<00:04:17.930> and

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
that we got that we can press alt a and

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.120 
that we got that we can press alt a and
see<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.160> animation<00:04:19.549> and<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:21.709> can<00:04:21.829> see<00:04:22.040> the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
see the animation and you can see the

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.280 
see the animation and you can see the
particles<00:04:22.550> being<00:04:22.730> admitted<00:04:23.060> we<00:04:23.750> still<00:04:24.080> have

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
particles being admitted we still have

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.250 
particles being admitted we still have
to<00:04:25.000> make<00:04:26.000> sure<00:04:26.030> we<00:04:26.660> bake<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.410> out<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:29.720> we'll

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
to make sure we bake this out and we'll

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.700 
to make sure we bake this out and we'll
render<00:04:30.500> this<00:04:30.710> last<00:04:30.980> little<00:04:31.100> frame<00:04:31.400> here

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
render this last little frame here

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.050 
render this last little frame here
looking<00:04:33.710> good<00:04:34.120> let's<00:04:35.120> add<00:04:35.510> some<00:04:36.880> material<00:04:37.880> to

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
looking good let's add some material to

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.470 
looking good let's add some material to
this<00:04:38.380> let's<00:04:39.380> try<00:04:39.740> maybe<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.340> yellowish<00:04:41.180> color

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
this let's try maybe a yellowish color

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.270 
this let's try maybe a yellowish color
it's<00:04:42.020> kind<00:04:42.230> of<00:04:42.260> a<00:04:42.380> yellowish<00:04:42.620> green<00:04:43.010> you<00:04:43.160> pick

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
it's kind of a yellowish green you pick

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.430 
it's kind of a yellowish green you pick
the<00:04:43.400> color<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.639> want<00:04:43.910> we'll<00:04:44.480> choose<00:04:44.690> halo<00:04:45.169> and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
the color you want we'll choose halo and

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.010 
the color you want we'll choose halo and
under<00:04:45.620> shaders<00:04:46.010> will<00:04:46.310> choose<00:04:46.550> lines<00:04:46.940> see<00:04:47.930> how

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
under shaders will choose lines see how

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.020 
under shaders will choose lines see how
that<00:04:48.080> looks<00:04:48.230> it's<00:04:48.800> all<00:04:48.919> glittery<00:04:49.160> how<00:04:49.760> nice

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
that looks it's all glittery how nice

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.400 
that looks it's all glittery how nice
and<00:04:51.280> so<00:04:52.280> now<00:04:52.430> we<00:04:52.490> have<00:04:52.690> me<00:04:53.690> in<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.930> background

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
and so now we have me in the background

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.080 
and so now we have me in the background
there<00:04:54.650> or<00:04:54.980> we<00:04:55.460> don't<00:04:55.580> have<00:04:55.820> me<00:04:55.970> in<00:04:56.030> the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
there or we don't have me in the

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.700 
there or we don't have me in the
background<00:04:56.419> when<00:04:56.510> we<00:04:56.630> render<00:04:56.840> how<00:04:57.500> do<00:04:57.560> we

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
background when we render how do we

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.890 
background when we render how do we
render<00:04:58.160> if<00:04:58.310> you've<00:04:58.490> watched<00:04:58.730> other<00:04:59.000> tutorials

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
render if you've watched other tutorials

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.250 
render if you've watched other tutorials
I've<00:05:00.020> done<00:05:00.320> you'll<00:05:01.070> see<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:01.640> we<00:05:02.180> have<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.540> now

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
I've done you'll see that we have to now

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.640 
I've done you'll see that we have to now

an image if we click here you already
see<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.470> video<00:05:21.710> because<00:05:21.890> we<00:05:22.010> have<00:05:22.130> it

see the video because we have it

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.710 
see the video because we have it
imported<00:05:22.700> as<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:22.850> background<00:05:23.090> view<00:05:23.950> let's<00:05:25.720> tell

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
imported as a background view let's tell

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.610 
imported as a background view let's tell
it<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:26.900> it<00:05:27.140> is<00:05:28.000> 169<00:05:29.000> frames<00:05:29.600> and<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:33.050> far<00:05:33.320> so

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
it that it is 169 frames and so far so

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.659 
it that it is 169 frames and so far so
good<00:05:34.000> now<00:05:35.000> we<00:05:35.060> need<00:05:35.479> to<00:05:35.510> add<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:36.340> go<00:05:37.340> down<00:05:37.520> to

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
good now we need to add a go down to

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.740 
good now we need to add a go down to
color<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.240> choose<00:05:38.539> alpha<00:05:38.870> over<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:40.570> we<00:05:41.570> will

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
color and choose alpha over and we will

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.210 
color and choose alpha over and we will
connect<00:05:42.260> our<00:05:42.560> scene<00:05:43.460> to<00:05:44.300> the<00:05:44.330> bottom<00:05:44.720> here<00:05:44.990> and

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
connect our scene to the bottom here and

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.210 
connect our scene to the bottom here and
we'll<00:05:46.220> add<00:05:46.400> an<00:05:46.580> output<00:05:47.030> of<00:05:47.289> view<00:05:48.289> and<00:05:48.530> there

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
we'll add an output of view and there

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.400 
we'll add an output of view and there
you<00:05:49.340> go<00:05:49.370> but<00:05:49.729> you<00:05:49.820> can<00:05:49.940> see<00:05:50.090> there's<00:05:50.410> blue

you go but you can see there's blue

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.279 
you go but you can see there's blue
around<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.310> particles<00:05:52.789> let's<00:05:53.630> try<00:05:53.870> turning

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
around the particles let's try turning

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.790 
around the particles let's try turning
this<00:05:54.680> up<00:05:54.950> to<00:05:55.580> one<00:05:55.820> there<00:05:56.630> we<00:05:56.810> go<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.260> far<00:05:57.500> so

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
this up to one there we go so far so

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.630 
this up to one there we go so far so
good<00:05:58.330> okay<00:05:59.330> now<00:05:59.539> all<00:05:59.690> we<00:05:59.780> have<00:05:59.870> to<00:05:59.930> do<00:06:00.140> is

good okay now all we have to do is

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.100 
good okay now all we have to do is
connect<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.940> output<00:06:01.970> of<00:06:02.300> that<00:06:02.390> to<00:06:02.960> our

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
connect the output of that to our

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.090 
connect the output of that to our
composite<00:06:03.560> window<00:06:04.010> here<00:06:05.200> choose<00:06:06.200> our<00:06:06.500> options

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
composite window here choose our options

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.500 
composite window here choose our options
in<00:06:07.430> here<00:06:08.210> for<00:06:08.390> compositing<00:06:10.300> mpeg-2<00:06:11.300> would<00:06:11.419> be

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
in here for compositing mpeg-2 would be

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.790 
in here for compositing mpeg-2 would be
good<00:06:11.630> for<00:06:11.900> this<00:06:12.050> don't<00:06:12.410> have<00:06:12.530> to<00:06:12.590> worry<00:06:12.710> about

audio and 169 frames and we have to make

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.710 
audio and 169 frames and we have to make
sure<00:06:17.180> we<00:06:17.510> select<00:06:18.050> do<00:06:18.740> composite<00:06:19.340> so<00:06:20.300> let's

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
sure we select do composite so let's

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.880 
sure we select do composite so let's
render<00:06:21.560> out<00:06:21.770> a<00:06:21.800> frame<00:06:23.140> there<00:06:24.140> we<00:06:24.320> go<00:06:24.500> looking

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
render out a frame there we go looking

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.550
