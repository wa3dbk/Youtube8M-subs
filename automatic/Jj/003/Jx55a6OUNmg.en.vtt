00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.960 
stock which I never ever knew before and
I<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.070> looks<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:26.340> crazy<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.849> like

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

do someone run a little bit harder than
others<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.229> ahead<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:14.520> start

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

peel the wilted leaves off and then cut

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
peel the wilted leaves off and then cut
them<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.110> half<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.250> add<00:01:32.400> them<00:01:32.579> to
