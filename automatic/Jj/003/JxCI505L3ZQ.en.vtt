hole with my seal thing that will that's

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.959 
hole with my seal thing that will that's
what<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.260> called<00:00:57.500> then<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.370> make<00:00:58.550> sure<00:00:58.579> all<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
what is called then I make sure all the

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.029 
what is called then I make sure all the
airs<00:00:59.120> out<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.660> then<00:00:59.870> I<00:00:59.899> test<00:01:00.350> it<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.649> few<00:01:00.829> times

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
airs out and then I test it a few times

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.759 
airs out and then I test it a few times
to<00:01:01.280> make<00:01:01.489> sure<00:01:01.699> that<00:01:01.940> I<00:01:02.019> twisted<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:03.289> bow<00:01:03.440> on

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
to make sure that I twisted the bow on

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.500 
to make sure that I twisted the bow on
correctly<00:01:04.370> so<00:01:04.550> I<00:01:04.610> don't<00:01:04.790> lose<00:01:04.910> air<00:01:05.269> in<00:01:05.390> it

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
correctly so I don't lose air in it

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.360 
correctly so I don't lose air in it
because<00:01:05.780> if<00:01:05.900> I<00:01:05.990> lose<00:01:06.140> air<00:01:06.440> my<00:01:06.830> leg<00:01:07.010> will<00:01:07.160> pop<00:01:07.340> up

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
because if I lose air my leg will pop up

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.120 
because if I lose air my leg will pop up
as<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:07.790> walk<00:01:08.200> taking<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:09.470> off<00:01:09.650> is<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:09.980> much

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
as I walk taking it off is so much

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.570 
as I walk taking it off is so much
easier<00:01:10.550> I<00:01:10.730> just<00:01:11.020> unscrew<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.380> bow<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.400> just

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
easier I just unscrew the bow and I just

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.820 
easier I just unscrew the bow and I just
pull<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:13.850> off<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:14.960> I<00:01:15.049> plug<00:01:15.320> it<00:01:15.500> right<00:01:15.619> in
