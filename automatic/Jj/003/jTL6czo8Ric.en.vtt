00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.480
 Yes Hi Ume-chan This time I talk about PC security 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:12.240
 I will 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.870
 And I had seen and are not sure listen well do you say that talk of you is please But 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 Or 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.539
 When I put in program freeware which I do not understand well after that, a hard-to-find program appears 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.039
 New paper or strange paper comes out 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.650
 Listen to the story 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.030
 All So you pre-error went so 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.510
 Singer site or suspicious program will be affected 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:38.550
 But it is security of this PC 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 If it's your own personal computer, it's okay that it has no data 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:50.050
 Even better to the agent to talk Tteyuu I do not mind separately even if there is to say any chance so 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.630
 There are a lot of people but 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.400
 There is a bad thing 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.400
 You say whether it it is is what it 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.519
 It sounds too good that there has been this kind of net 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.230
 Yeah it is at the time was the Internet 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.610
 My professional computer 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.890
 Well this is 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:18.240
 Even if I have no data , I have a separate card medical card number . 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.070
 I do not have an email address, so I'm fine 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.900
 In particular, the security software has not been put in place and it is made to work because it is working 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.490
 When many people have a personal computer in there 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.140
 But yeah 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.979
 It is a public safety site 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.979
 Against 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.760
 People who are said to be hackers with mac 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.760
 It is people who are said to hackers 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:51.020
 These people are 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:53.060
 It was a government site, and it was the size of a company anywhere and children's services 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.890
 For the company that offers 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.910
 I 'm attacking 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.000
 In the attack of I mean is punctured it is a place to put the feed I'm put pretend the data number 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.860
 I can not see the size 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:12.010
 Or there was an intrusion there is a fact that would change back 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:15.230
 In the case of what to do with these packers after paying for such things 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.090
 I will tell you a story like you'll stop if you 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.170
 I also did good feelings with that purpose 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.480
 There are also many cases to go 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.250
 I say in here 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:35.250
 People say Datte of your own computer okay you want to talk about is that we said that was saying, 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.250
 It says so kind of a personal computer is actually the most dangerous 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.200
 If you were in the world in mind 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.890
 As I said earlier, this practice for this hacky is 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:52.340
 I do not do this directly 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:57.170
 What common in Toka whether say when the previous ordinary program that went way around the world to 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:02.550
 I only robot I there I say bot I'd not if 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:06.900
 The more of a personal computer full I'd report to the robot Village 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.880
 It might be better to fit tens of thousands of people all over the world to make it 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.160
 Put it in such a personal computer 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.160
 Instead of giving a hand directly 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:24.590
 Not directly, but on the world 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:29.380
 A program for 12 attacks was put in the program for attack 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.380
 By that I hit the skeleton is from a personal computer 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.500
 Your hands don't get dirty 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.360
 It will be said 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:44.410
 Though I say more net in this bot a lot of man 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:46.120
 Oh Warp Any PC who is using a PC connected to all over the world 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.500
 No matter how 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:58.610
 Such an attack is only a program and I will make a lot of buses. 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.610
 Another earth shadow Bulls in here would like to talk today 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:10.030
 The sp of windows will be the support center this spring 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 Support cautions because such a program can not help coming in 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.380
 You say 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:21.329
 So at any time any way and continue to use the windows xp indefinitely 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.590
 I would say that do not know what that contains these programs for the attack 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.810
 Because 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.300
 in the form of windows do not use even one as much as possible and say for xp 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.680
 I would like to receive 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.200
 Then I think it 's going to be telling you that you have to throw away your PC 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.169
 But 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.540
 t 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.200
 not windows 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.220
 Not this 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.750
 Another one 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.750
 For example, a typical part 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.620
 I like the part 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.710
 Bird 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.490
 It is os that has been chased songs but it is free 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.310
 this 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.620
 install 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.640
 Oh I understood had been checked on the net, but you can use for free to enter the hand for free but in 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.610
 Or Storr 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.750
 It will not be able to start in cd 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.750
 cd starts 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:26.509
 You can also start with cd eh 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.139
 'M against the windows I'm being told os to say this part 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.980
 is not it 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:36.240
 I'm relaxing but I will be there for the time being 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.240
 Some of the buildings here are often used with a PC windows 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.750
 Hey email software 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.750
 web software 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:52.169
 It is completely okay to use the Internet to have a entered into the ordinary 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.430
 So old 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:59.440
 excel word powerpoint and the software with the last rape 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:03.040
 Saying, Because I 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:06.070
 with windows not free os 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.840
 It is also possible to use an old PC 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.990
 The 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.569
 That's it this time 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:18.110
 PC security then got old 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:22.550
 Very dangerous spy to expand flights if it can not be used 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:26.229
 We talked about the use of a PC that contains 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.229
 Thank you for being more than this time
