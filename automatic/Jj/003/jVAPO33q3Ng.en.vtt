d<00:03:47.840> with<00:03:48.530> G<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:48.859> then<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.280> D<00:03:49.579> with<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.730> B<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:52.310> then

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
d with G and then a D with a B and then

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.759 
d with G and then a D with a B and then
I<00:03:53.299> have<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.659> D<00:03:53.840> on<00:03:53.870> top<00:03:54.170> of<00:03:54.349> that<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:57.560> then

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
I have the D on top of that and then

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
tired because they don't make as much

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.540
