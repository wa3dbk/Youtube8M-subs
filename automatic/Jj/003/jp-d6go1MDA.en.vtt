to<00:00:21.330> get<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> RAM<00:00:21.810> overclocked<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
to get the RAM overclocked with the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.310 
to get the RAM overclocked with the
processor<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:24.119> did<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.600> underclock<00:00:25.109> the

processor we did have to underclock the
RAM<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.800> get<00:00:25.949> its<00:00:26.130> label

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
RAM to get its label

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.429 
RAM to get its label
we've<00:00:27.720> been<00:00:27.869> running<00:00:28.019> prime95<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:29.490> all<00:00:30.449> 45

we've been running prime95 for all 45
minutes<00:00:31.859> or<00:00:31.980> so

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
minutes or so

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
twenty one timings on it so pretty tight

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.550 
twenty one timings on it so pretty tight
timings<00:01:15.729> even<00:01:16.659> though<00:01:16.780> we<00:01:16.899> did<00:01:17.049> have<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.380> back

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
timings even though we did have to back

the<00:01:17.740> speed<00:01:18.009> of<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.220> RAM<00:01:18.430> down<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.790> little<00:01:19.090> bit

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the speed of the RAM down a little bit

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.219 
the speed of the RAM down a little bit
but<00:01:20.799> so<00:01:21.009> far<00:01:21.250> it's<00:01:21.460> been<00:01:21.549> rock<00:01:22.450> stable<00:01:23.020> we

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
but so far it's been rock stable we

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.260 
but so far it's been rock stable we
brand<00:01:23.590> prime<00:01:23.920> on<00:01:24.130> it<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.340> couple<00:01:24.550> of<00:01:24.700> times

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
brand prime on it a couple of times

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.590 
brand prime on it a couple of times
tweak<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.990> voltages<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.590> little<00:01:26.979> bit<00:01:27.160> but<00:01:27.600> for

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
tweak the voltages a little bit but for

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.029 
tweak the voltages a little bit but for
the<00:01:28.660> most<00:01:28.840> part<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.289> think<00:01:29.500> we're<00:01:29.649> right<00:01:29.800> about

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
the most part I think we're right about

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.190 
the most part I think we're right about
where<00:01:30.280> we<00:01:30.429> want<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.729> stay<00:01:30.940> so<00:01:31.000> I'm<00:01:31.780> gonna<00:01:31.929> run<00:01:32.140> a

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
where we want to stay so I'm gonna run a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.590 
where we want to stay so I'm gonna run a
few<00:01:32.440> more<00:01:32.619> tests<00:01:33.039> on<00:01:33.190> it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.760 

okay<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:38.810> have<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:38.990> Cinebench<00:01:40.960> 11.5<00:01:41.960> we're

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
okay we have a Cinebench 11.5 we're

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.249 
okay we have a Cinebench 11.5 we're
gonna<00:01:42.860> run<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.340> cpu<00:01:44.090> test<00:01:44.390> on<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.110> see

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
gonna run the cpu test on that and see

00:01:45.259 --> 00:02:02.000 
gonna run the cpu test on that and see
how<00:01:45.409> it<00:01:45.530> fares

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.310 

okay<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.660> there<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.110> is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
okay if you can see that there this is

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.490 
okay if you can see that there this is
the<00:02:04.470> second<00:02:04.860> time<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.070> we've<00:02:05.520> ran<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.500> five

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the second time that we've ran it five

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:16.080 
the second time that we've ran it five
point<00:02:07.860> three<00:02:07.950> one<00:02:08.190> is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:33.090 

okay<00:02:17.090> time<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:17.420> our<00:02:17.690> super<00:02:18.410> pie<00:02:18.650> one<00:02:19.160> Meg<00:02:19.430> test

10.40<00:02:34.100> six<00:02:34.459> seconds<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.090> that

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.580 

okay<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.709> we're<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.069> run

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
okay now we're going to run

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.360 
okay now we're going to run
3d<00:02:48.190> Vantage<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.940> performance<00:02:49.930> preset

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.290 

okay<00:02:55.090> here's<00:02:55.390> our<00:02:55.569> test<00:02:55.780> results<00:02:56.050> for<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:57.300> 3d

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
okay here's our test results for the 3d

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.880 
okay here's our test results for the 3d
Vantage<00:02:58.840> 15<00:02:59.680> 649<00:03:00.670> was<00:03:00.940> our<00:03:01.090> total<00:03:01.239> score<00:03:01.890> GPU

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
Vantage 15 649 was our total score GPU

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.759
