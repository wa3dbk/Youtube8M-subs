two cos as our nails so yeah so in my

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.420 
two cos as our nails so yeah so in my
experiment<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.019> independent<00:00:25.680> variable<00:00:26.130> is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
experiment the independent variable is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.370 
experiment the independent variable is
the<00:00:26.789> variable<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.240> I'm<00:00:27.359> changing<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.140> it's

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the variable that I'm changing so it's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.710 
the variable that I'm changing so it's
the<00:00:28.560> different<00:00:28.920> brands<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.400> nail<00:00:29.609> polish<00:00:30.000> my

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the different brands of nail polish my

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.799 
the different brands of nail polish my
dependent<00:00:31.590> variable<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
dependent variable is the time or the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.860 
dependent variable is the time or the
rate<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.100> takes<00:00:35.309> for<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.969> nail<00:00:36.510> polish

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
rate that it takes for the nail polish

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.299 
rate that it takes for the nail polish
to<00:00:37.079> dry<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.579> my<00:00:38.850> experiment<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.680> order<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to dry so in my experiment in order to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.299 
to dry so in my experiment in order to
get<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.820> most<00:00:42.000> accurate<00:00:42.300> time<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:44.010> can't

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
get the most accurate time you can't

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.110 
get the most accurate time you can't
apply<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.780> three<00:00:46.530> brands<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.309> nail<00:00:47.460> polish<00:00:47.910> at

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
apply all three brands of nail polish at

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
apply all three brands of nail polish at
the<00:00:48.239> same<00:00:48.420> time<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.230> they<00:00:49.800> would<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.070> be

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the same time because they would all be

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.540 
the same time because they would all be
applied<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.730> different<00:00:51.059> times<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:52.430> because<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
applied at different times so because of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.369 
applied at different times so because of
that<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.600> applying<00:00:55.850> okay<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.379> nail
