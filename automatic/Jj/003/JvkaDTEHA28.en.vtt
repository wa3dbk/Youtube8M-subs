00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
when we truly used a fullback and I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
when we truly used a fullback and I
think<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:25.979> made<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> difference<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
think really made a difference in the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.429 
think really made a difference in the
kid's<00:01:27.060> life<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.479> mean<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.840> probably<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> kid

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
kid's life I mean it was probably a kid

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.140 
kid's life I mean it was probably a kid
that<00:01:28.590> wouldn't<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.579> been<00:01:29.610> where<00:01:29.939> he<00:01:29.970> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
that wouldn't have been where he is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.210 
that wouldn't have been where he is
today<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> whole<00:01:30.990> staff<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.009> just

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
today if the whole staff you know just

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
today if the whole staff you know just
different<00:01:32.430> styles<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.119> he's<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> fullback<00:01:34.170> gets

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
different styles so he's a fullback gets

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.899 
different styles so he's a fullback gets
drafted<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.159> goes<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> Seattle<00:01:35.759> Seahawks

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
drafted and goes the Seattle Seahawks

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.319 
drafted and goes the Seattle Seahawks
and<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:37.740> had<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> feeling<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.270> to

take through the progression on every

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.710 
take through the progression on every
play<00:02:24.489> not<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:24.970> every<00:02:25.239> other<00:02:25.269> not<00:02:25.690> just

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
play not just every other not just

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.199

certain<00:02:26.620> every<00:02:27.040> play<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.400> practice<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.060> it's

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
certain every play of practice and it's

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.930

it's<00:02:29.019> why<00:02:29.230> he<00:02:29.590> had<00:02:29.739> success<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:30.489> now<00:02:30.610> hero

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
it's why he had success and but now hero

now<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.180> think<00:02:31.300> has<00:02:31.540> come<00:02:31.720> back<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.019> told<00:02:32.140> that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
now I think has come back and told that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.110 
now I think has come back and told that
story<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.800> don't<00:02:33.250> know<00:02:33.310> how<00:02:33.430> many<00:02:33.459> times<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.030> our

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
story I don't know how many times to our

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.940 
story I don't know how many times to our
current<00:02:34.300> roster<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.590> has<00:02:35.739> an<00:02:35.860> effect<00:02:36.060> so

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
current roster and that has an effect so

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.470

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.430 
I've been outspoken on is player safety
that's<00:03:33.549> what<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.760> believe<00:03:33.819> in<00:03:34.290> however<00:03:35.290> it

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
that's what I believe in however it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.860 
that's what I believe in however it
comes<00:03:35.530> about<00:03:35.739> I<00:03:36.040> don't<00:03:36.220> care<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:37.329> want<00:03:37.690> the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
comes about I don't care I want the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.199 
comes about I don't care I want the
ability<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.410> be<00:03:38.560> able<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.799> substitute<00:03:39.209> every

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
ability to be able to substitute every

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.059 
ability to be able to substitute every
side<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.690> every<00:03:41.410> phase<00:03:41.799> of<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.040> game

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
side of the every phase of the game

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.759 
side of the every phase of the game
equally<00:03:42.700> that's<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.720> think<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.620> reason

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
equally that's it I think the reason

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.009 
equally that's it I think the reason
that<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.190> offensive<00:03:45.519> coaches<00:03:46.000> react<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:46.870> such

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
that the offensive coaches react in such

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.360 
that the offensive coaches react in such
a<00:03:47.079> strong<00:03:47.410> way<00:03:47.620> when<00:03:47.799> they<00:03:47.889> talk<00:03:48.069> about<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
a strong way when they talk about the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.039 
a strong way when they talk about the
ten<00:03:48.519> second<00:03:48.850> rule<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:49.150> there's<00:03:49.720> an<00:03:49.840> obvious

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
ten second rule is there's an obvious

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.069 
ten second rule is there's an obvious
advantage<00:03:50.739> it's<00:03:50.920> being<00:03:51.100> capitalized<00:03:51.639> on<00:03:51.790> if

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
advantage it's being capitalized on if

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.360 
advantage it's being capitalized on if
you<00:03:53.079> don't<00:03:53.260> see<00:03:53.319> that<00:03:53.470> you're<00:03:53.859> oblivious<00:03:54.069> to

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370
