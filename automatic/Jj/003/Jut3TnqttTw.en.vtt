00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.010
 a new informative video video about 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.769
 nba 2k 16 I would tire news during these 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.589
 days such as the soundtrack of the 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.509
 class game the most extensive of the 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.480
 history of the saga that's very good 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.439
 news will have up to 50 songs 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.119
 that have been chosen by three 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.770
 music producers such as shore 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.720
 and first dj khaled and dj new star 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.780
 there are going to be six exclusive songs 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.600
 for this mega 2016 that have not gone away 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.640
 so far the game is going to tell 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.730
 then with three different styles to the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.710
 be three dj's and you will see a list 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.480
 very broad musical with these 50 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.760
 songs will see a variety of 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.610
 genres like pop electronic hip hop 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.450
 rock alternative music theme nick sun 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.230
 70s and topical issues of the top 40 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.280
 David is no longer good songs like 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.629
 blitzkrieg pop 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.350
 the hierarch production building the 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.540
 ramones represent the nash ya when you 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.280
 now of set with scene collaboration 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.320
 gÃ³mez among other songs 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.050
 On the other hand medical talks talk 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.810
 of the subject of the corporal scan that has been 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.390
 confirmed something that had been rumored 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.280
 for a long time not that good anymore 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.810
 with the facial scan the following is going to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.060
 to be is that not corpo po effectively 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.740
 is what is being done and there is a 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.840
 lots of photos that prove it 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.670
 we could see for example anthony 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.350
 davis be a few players by 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.750
 example the lakers that has been analyzed 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.310
 it's body scan for the even more 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.990
 realism 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.790
 then I have another issue that has been 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.250
 confirmed the summer league that is something 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.710
 It's good that we missed that 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.590
 example in titles like nba 2k 11 is 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.289
 incorporated with another name was not like 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.759
 the draft theses with by was called no 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.310
 born in berlin as such but now 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.710
 practically something similar by that 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.439
 time if you remember us and you have seen 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.179
 the opportunity to play you will remember that 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.670
 Well, the opportunity to play 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.280
 like a little game with no against all 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.410
 the most important rookies that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.230
 presented in that draft and then then 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.620
 thanks to that I got a better 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.360
 choice to enter but not clear 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.760
 we know how it is going to be incorporates this 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.350
 exam reads what we do know that it is already 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.180
 because it is already official that it has already 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.510
 incorporated and will have to be more 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.190
 attentive or more attentive now that 300 more 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.569
 news regarding the subject because 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.330
 the poor has confirmed that they are the 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.239
 image and confirming that the 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.610
 summer league nba 2k 16 so they are very 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.290
 good news from kids starting with 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.700
 what about the theme of the songs that is something 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.739
 they have to be talking first of all this 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.540
 time not first of all these years it was 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.879
 the one that lacked variety 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.920
 nba 2k with respect to musical themes 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.650
 that for example something that in the alive 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.000
 because he was always well served 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.760
 different musical extras 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.680
 genres and many many great a great 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.599
 number of songs not then now 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.209
 already with 50 we will have to choose 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.069
 so nothing guys so he showed up 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.720
 this news has been so I ask myself 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.459
 like other comments 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.000
 in the following video after the 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.000
 emotional
