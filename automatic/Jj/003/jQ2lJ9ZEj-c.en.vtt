thing<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.269> think<00:02:47.359> people<00:02:47.569> get<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.440> a

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
thing that I think people get is a a

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.949 
thing that I think people get is a a
misnomer<00:02:49.370> about<00:02:50.000> with<00:02:50.209> coaching<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.810> that

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
misnomer about with coaching is that

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.509 
misnomer about with coaching is that
they<00:02:51.109> think<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.380> all<00:02:51.590> great<00:02:51.859> players<00:02:52.130> can<00:02:52.400> be

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
they think that all great players can be

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.030 
they think that all great players can be
great<00:02:52.760> coaches<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:54.079> not<00:02:54.260> necessarily<00:02:54.889> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
great coaches and is not necessarily the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.250 
great coaches and is not necessarily the
case<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.849> does<00:02:56.060> happen<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.599> is<00:02:56.720> true<00:02:57.079> it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
case that it does happen that is true it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.250 
case that it does happen that is true it
to<00:02:57.440> some<00:02:57.709> extent<00:02:58.160> but<00:02:58.480> sometimes<00:02:59.480> coaches<00:02:59.930> I

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
to some extent but sometimes coaches I

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.470 
to some extent but sometimes coaches I
believe<00:03:00.560> are<00:03:00.739> born<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:01.519> know<00:03:01.549> they<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:02.209> this

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
innate quality that they really don't

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.270 
innate quality that they really don't
really<00:03:04.579> realize<00:03:05.540> themselves<00:03:06.099> until<00:03:07.099> they're
