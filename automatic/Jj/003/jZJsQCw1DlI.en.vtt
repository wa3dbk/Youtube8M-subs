00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.049 
exactly what I've said that I'm gonna do
and<00:00:09.260> I<00:00:09.469> was<00:00:10.129> fighting<00:00:10.339> as<00:00:10.580> hard<00:00:10.610> as<00:00:10.910> i<00:00:10.999> could

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
and I was fighting as hard as i could

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.570 
and I was fighting as hard as i could
running<00:00:11.599> as<00:00:11.719> much<00:00:11.900> as<00:00:12.049> I<00:00:12.169> could<00:00:12.230> and<00:00:12.650> then<00:00:13.459> I

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
running as much as I could and then I

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.900 
running as much as I could and then I
one<00:00:13.820> so<00:00:14.030> it's<00:00:14.150> all<00:00:14.240> good<00:00:14.829> um<00:00:15.829> well<00:00:16.369> firstly<00:00:16.820> I

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
one so it's all good um well firstly I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.110 
one so it's all good um well firstly I
think<00:00:17.119> she<00:00:17.270> played<00:00:17.510> very<00:00:18.230> well<00:00:18.910> yeah<00:00:19.910> she

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.120 
think she played very well yeah she

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.940 
think she played very well yeah she
didn't<00:00:20.360> well<00:00:21.020> she<00:00:21.260> made<00:00:21.410> one<00:00:21.590> error<00:00:21.620> I<00:00:21.920> think

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950 
didn't well she made one error I think

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.820 
didn't well she made one error I think
in<00:00:22.280> the<00:00:22.370> first<00:00:22.580> set<00:00:22.790> hit<00:00:23.000> 12<00:00:23.240> winners<00:00:23.450> so<00:00:23.840> I

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
in the first set hit 12 winners so I

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.530 
in the first set hit 12 winners so I
think<00:00:25.190> no<00:00:25.400> matter<00:00:25.520> who<00:00:25.730> you<00:00:25.790> are<00:00:26.030> it's<00:00:26.180> hard<00:00:26.360> to

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
think no matter who you are it's hard to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.690 
think no matter who you are it's hard to
really<00:00:27.320> get<00:00:27.530> a<00:00:27.590> grip<00:00:27.830> on<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.040> match<00:00:28.220> if<00:00:28.490> that's

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
really get a grip on the match if that's

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.130 
really get a grip on the match if that's
what<00:00:28.820> your<00:00:28.940> opponent's<00:00:29.420> I<00:00:29.480> would<00:00:29.660> do<00:00:29.870> to<00:00:30.020> you

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
what your opponent's I would do to you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.679 
what your opponent's I would do to you
so<00:00:30.490> I<00:00:31.490> think<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:31.880> first<00:00:32.180> set<00:00:32.329> was<00:00:32.419> pretty

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
so I think that first set was pretty

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.569 
so I think that first set was pretty
important<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.379> then<00:00:33.499> I<00:00:33.769> had<00:00:33.949> my<00:00:33.980> chance<00:00:34.370> in

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
important and then I had my chance in

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.790 
important and then I had my chance in
that<00:00:34.699> second<00:00:35.120> at<00:00:35.210> 41<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:35.960> then<00:00:36.079> some<00:00:36.379> breads

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
that second at 41 and then some breads

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.239 
that second at 41 and then some breads
and<00:00:37.960> yeah<00:00:38.960> I<00:00:38.989> guess<00:00:39.260> you've<00:00:39.920> got<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:40.129> be<00:00:40.219> able

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249 
and yeah I guess you've got to be able

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.310 
and yeah I guess you've got to be able
to<00:00:40.429> take<00:00:40.550> those<00:00:40.789> and<00:00:41.089> she<00:00:41.570> started<00:00:41.870> cracking<00:00:42.260> a

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
to take those and she started cracking a

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.079 
to take those and she started cracking a
little<00:00:42.350> bit<00:00:42.679> and<00:00:42.890> then<00:00:43.010> got<00:00:43.609> herself<00:00:43.730> back

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
little bit and then got herself back

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.229 
little bit and then got herself back
into<00:00:44.269> it<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:44.570> then<00:00:44.719> held<00:00:44.929> on<00:00:45.109> for<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.499> end<00:00:45.679> and

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
into it and then held on for the end and

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.149 
into it and then held on for the end and
you<00:00:47.239> know<00:00:47.589> one<00:00:48.589> thing<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:48.920> get<00:00:49.039> the

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
you know one thing to get the

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.259 
you know one thing to get the
opportunity<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:49.670> then<00:00:49.879> you've<00:00:49.999> got<00:00:50.089> to<00:00:50.120> be

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
opportunity but then you've got to be

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.299 
opportunity but then you've got to be
able<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:50.449> take<00:00:50.600> it<00:00:50.659> to<00:00:50.960> um<00:00:51.499> well<00:00:51.559> I<00:00:51.980> was<00:00:52.039> still

matches<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:33.829> again<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.759> come<00:01:35.149> up<00:01:35.270> against<00:01:35.539> an

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
matches but again you come up against an

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.990 
matches but again you come up against an
opponent<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.229> it's<00:01:36.439> hard<00:01:36.649> and<00:01:37.000> I'll

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
opponent like that it's hard and I'll

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.730 
opponent like that it's hard and I'll
get<00:01:38.689> it<00:01:38.780> back<00:01:38.810> out<00:01:39.049> on<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.229> practice<00:01:39.380> court

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
get it back out on the practice court

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.469 
get it back out on the practice court
and<00:01:39.979> get<00:01:40.219> myself<00:01:40.399> ready<00:01:40.670> for<00:01:40.880> Sydney<00:01:41.210> and

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
and get myself ready for Sydney and

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.420 
and get myself ready for Sydney and
hopefully<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.200> can<00:01:42.259> play<00:01:42.590> some<00:01:43.009> more<00:01:43.130> matches

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
hopefully I can play some more matches

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.069 
hopefully I can play some more matches
down<00:01:43.579> there<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:43.969> then<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:44.299> guess<00:01:44.810> at<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.020> end

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
down there and then I guess at the end

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.419 
down there and then I guess at the end
of<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.289> day<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.439> want<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.679> be<00:01:45.799> peaking<00:01:46.130> frazee

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
of the day you want to be peaking frazee

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.580 
of the day you want to be peaking frazee

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
tournament it's always disappointing to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.990 
tournament it's always disappointing to
go<00:01:50.210> out<00:01:50.329> early<00:01:50.630> um<00:01:51.159> yeah<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:52.189> was<00:01:52.369> trying<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.789> mix

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
up the second serve so she doesn't get

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.919 
up the second serve so she doesn't get

enough<00:02:07.219> kind<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.270> away<00:02:08.570> from<00:02:08.630> her<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.379> make<00:02:09.830> a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
enough kind of away from her to make a

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.710 
enough kind of away from her to make a
point<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.610> that's<00:02:10.879> what<00:02:11.030> i<00:02:11.060> was<00:02:11.180> trying<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.480> do

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
point so that's what i was trying to do

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.800 
point so that's what i was trying to do
and<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.200> was<00:02:12.709> working<00:02:13.129> i<00:02:13.280> was

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
and it was working i was

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.900 
and it was working i was
away<00:02:14.080> with<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.349> were<00:02:14.530> standing<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.160> as<00:02:15.760> I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
away with you were standing and as I

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.490 
away with you were standing and as I
said<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.150> played<00:02:16.390> her<00:02:16.599> before<00:02:16.630> we<00:02:17.110> practice

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
said I played her before we practice

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.070 
said I played her before we practice
together<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.920> couple<00:02:18.130> days<00:02:18.370> ago<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:18.970> um<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:20.050> guess

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
together a couple days ago so um I guess

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.839 
together a couple days ago so um I guess
I<00:02:20.349> had<00:02:20.470> some<00:02:20.680> sort<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:20.980> idea<00:02:21.130> what<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.550> want<00:02:21.760> to

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
I had some sort of idea what I want to

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.970 
I had some sort of idea what I want to
do<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.270> tonight<00:02:22.870> was<00:02:23.290> working<00:02:23.680> well<00:02:23.800> well

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
do and tonight was working well well

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.949 
do and tonight was working well well
yeah<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.270> when<00:02:25.540> you're<00:02:25.630> getting<00:02:25.720> that

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
yeah I think when you're getting that

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.479 
yeah I think when you're getting that
many<00:02:26.140> chances<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.650> look<00:02:26.890> at<00:02:26.980> second<00:02:27.310> serves

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
many chances to look at second serves

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.430 
many chances to look at second serves
it's<00:02:27.730> easier<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.120> step<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.780> start

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
it's easier to step up and start

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.880 
it's easier to step up and start
whacking<00:02:29.770> them<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:31.269> think<00:02:31.930> I've<00:02:32.140> got<00:02:32.860> a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
whacking them and I think I've got a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.729 
whacking them and I think I've got a
good<00:02:33.069> second<00:02:33.430> serve<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:34.110> when<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.140> under

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
good second serve but when you under

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.800 
good second serve but when you under
pressure<00:02:35.920> all<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> time<00:02:36.550> with<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.120> yeah<00:02:37.510> she

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
pressure all the time with it yeah she

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.870 
pressure all the time with it yeah she
took<00:02:38.440> advantage<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.430> didn't

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
took advantage of that and I didn't

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.070 
took advantage of that and I didn't
serve<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.180> well<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.390> need<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.630> get<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.870> lot<00:02:41.050> more

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
serve as well I need to get a lot more

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.400 
serve as well I need to get a lot more
first<00:02:41.440> serves<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:43.660> know<00:02:43.780> when<00:02:44.080> when

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
first serves and you know when when

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.130 
first serves and you know when when
she's<00:02:44.650> attacking<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:46.269> point<00:02:46.540> right<00:02:46.870> from<00:02:47.019> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
she's attacking the point right from the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.320 
she's attacking the point right from the
first<00:02:47.319> shot<00:02:47.620> she<00:02:48.130> hits<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.549> ball<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:48.910> well<00:02:49.090> and

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
first shot she hits the ball so well and

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330 
first shot she hits the ball so well and
so<00:02:49.390> heavy<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:49.959> not<00:02:50.590> easy<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:50.950> turned<00:02:51.160> around

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
so heavy it's not easy to turned around

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.559 
so heavy it's not easy to turned around
and<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:52.810> know<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.760> like<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> said<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.060> started

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
and you know I like I said I started

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.059 
and you know I like I said I started
getting<00:02:55.660> myself<00:02:55.900> back<00:02:56.110> into<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.680> started

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
getting myself back into it started

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.800 
getting myself back into it started
dictating<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.640> play<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:57.850> little<00:02:58.060> bit<00:02:58.239> more<00:02:58.450> but

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
dictating the play a little bit more but

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.690 
dictating the play a little bit more but
didn't<00:02:59.349> do<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.590> enough<00:03:00.099> for<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.489> whole

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.160 
what two years now last time we played
match<00:03:06.010> against<00:03:06.310> each<00:03:06.459> other<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:06.880> if<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.930> held

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
match against each other so if it held

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.839 
match against each other so if it held
by<00:03:08.380> me<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.650> obviously<00:03:09.069> gives<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.459> some<00:03:09.700> sort

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
by me it obviously gives you some sort

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.059 
by me it obviously gives you some sort
of<00:03:10.000> gauge<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.510> what<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.019> expect<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.650> mean<00:03:11.860> it's

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
of gauge of what to expect I mean it's

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.309 
of gauge of what to expect I mean it's
the<00:03:12.400> practice<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.330> practiced<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:13.930> everybody

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
the practice is practiced so everybody

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.690 
the practice is practiced so everybody
with<00:03:14.560> somebody<00:03:14.830> play's<00:03:15.069> better<00:03:15.099> to<00:03:15.519> practice

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
with somebody play's better to practice

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.490 
with somebody play's better to practice
somebody<00:03:16.269> flash<00:03:16.480> worse<00:03:16.720> at<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.989> practice<00:03:17.170> day

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
somebody flash worse at the practice day

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.740 
somebody flash worse at the practice day
so<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:18.519> know<00:03:18.640> everything<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.150> different<00:03:19.420> when

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
so you know everything is different when

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.120 
so you know everything is different when
you<00:03:19.870> actually<00:03:20.019> step<00:03:20.410> on<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.680> court<00:03:20.829> in<00:03:21.010> front

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
you actually step on the court in front

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.860 
you actually step on the court in front
of<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> crowd<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:22.329> know<00:03:22.450> she's<00:03:22.660> number

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
of the crowd and you know she's number

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.690 
of the crowd and you know she's number
one<00:03:22.989> seed<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.590> everything<00:03:23.980> is<00:03:24.070> different<00:03:24.250> so

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
one seed and everything is different so

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.120 
one seed and everything is different so
you<00:03:25.480> know<00:03:25.600> at<00:03:25.720> least<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:26.019> knew<00:03:26.200> what<00:03:26.350> I'm<00:03:26.470> coming

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
you know at least I knew what I'm coming

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.729 
you know at least I knew what I'm coming
against<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.880> so<00:03:28.600> I<00:03:28.660> was<00:03:28.840> trying<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.590> more

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
against and so I was trying to more

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.559 
against and so I was trying to more
concentrate<00:03:30.250> myself<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.209> what<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.450> can

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
concentrate myself and to see what I can

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.180 
concentrate myself and to see what I can
do<00:03:32.500> about<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.859> and<00:03:33.220> apply<00:03:33.609> my<00:03:33.760> game<00:03:33.970> um<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:35.190> don't

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
do about it and apply my game um I don't

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.670 
do about it and apply my game um I don't
know<00:03:36.340> if<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:36.670> mean<00:03:36.940> it's<00:03:37.350> sometimes<00:03:38.350> practice

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
know if I mean it's sometimes practice

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.020 
know if I mean it's sometimes practice
sessions<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.069> look<00:03:39.250> at<00:03:39.340> your<00:03:39.459> opponent<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> lot

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
sessions you look at your opponent a lot

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.509 
sessions you look at your opponent a lot
than<00:03:40.239> other<00:03:40.390> times<00:03:40.660> for<00:03:40.870> me<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.200> probably<00:03:41.560> more

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
than other times for me I probably more

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.860 
than other times for me I probably more
concerned<00:03:42.880> about<00:03:42.940> what<00:03:43.209> I'm<00:03:43.329> doing<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:43.780> want

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
concerned about what I'm doing and want

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.449 
concerned about what I'm doing and want
to<00:03:43.989> work<00:03:44.139> on<00:03:44.290> things<00:03:44.470> in<00:03:44.650> my<00:03:44.799> game<00:03:44.829> rather<00:03:45.310> than

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
to work on things in my game rather than

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.430 
to work on things in my game rather than
worrying<00:03:46.269> about<00:03:46.389> all<00:03:46.630> my<00:03:46.720> opponents<00:03:47.170> doing<00:03:47.350> in

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
worrying about all my opponents doing in

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.930 
worrying about all my opponents doing in
a<00:03:47.500> practice<00:03:47.859> set<00:03:48.069> because<00:03:48.220> players<00:03:48.609> can<00:03:48.850> play

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
a practice set because players can play

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.059 
a practice set because players can play
very<00:03:49.239> different<00:03:49.690> in<00:03:49.780> practice<00:03:50.170> compared<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.739> a

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
very different in practice compared to a

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.000 
very different in practice compared to a
proper<00:03:51.579> match<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.650> yeah<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.680> mean<00:03:53.769> I<00:03:53.980> think

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
proper match but yeah I mean I think

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.420 
proper match but yeah I mean I think
it's<00:03:54.370> no<00:03:54.880> real<00:03:55.090> secret<00:03:55.600> how<00:03:55.720> we<00:03:55.780> both<00:03:56.019> play<00:03:56.350> so

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
it's no real secret how we both play so

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.229 
it's no real secret how we both play so
regardless<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.609> whether<00:03:57.790> we<00:03:57.880> played<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
regardless of whether we played the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.949 
regardless of whether we played the
other<00:03:58.359> day<00:03:58.569> or<00:03:58.690> night<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.380> think<00:04:00.069> we<00:04:00.130> both<00:04:00.310> had<00:04:00.549> a

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
other day or night I think we both had a

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.319 
other day or night I think we both had a
pretty<00:04:01.959> pretty<00:04:02.500> fair<00:04:02.709> idea<00:04:02.739> on<00:04:03.310> yeah<00:04:03.970> each

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
pretty pretty fair idea on yeah each

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.420 
pretty pretty fair idea on yeah each

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
a different expectation everybody knows

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.629 
a different expectation everybody knows
the<00:04:16.630> game<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.200> knows<00:04:17.950> how<00:04:18.190> they<00:04:18.340> are<00:04:18.400> playing

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
you know if I can play the way I've been

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.170 
you know if I can play the way I've been
playing<00:04:23.320> my<00:04:23.650> last<00:04:23.919> two<00:04:24.130> matches<00:04:24.520> in

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
playing my last two matches in

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.700 
playing my last two matches in
sternum<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:25.750> who<00:04:25.870> knows<00:04:26.020> where<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.350> can<00:04:26.530> get

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
sternum and who knows where you can get

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.520 
sternum and who knows where you can get
me<00:04:26.889> by<00:04:27.039> definitely<00:04:27.400> am<00:04:27.720> i'm<00:04:28.720> gonna<00:04:28.930> try<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.229> win

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
me by definitely am i'm gonna try to win

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.590 
me by definitely am i'm gonna try to win
if<00:04:29.740> it's<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.699> know<00:04:30.850> every<00:04:31.030> single<00:04:31.180> point

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
if it's the you know every single point

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.969 
if it's the you know every single point
and<00:04:31.810> every<00:04:31.930> single<00:04:32.110> mate<00:04:32.380> i'm<00:04:32.500> going<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.800> play

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
and every single mate i'm going to play

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.330 
and every single mate i'm going to play
so<00:04:33.300> i<00:04:34.300> guess<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:35.229> trimming<00:04:35.650> bed<00:04:35.860> it<00:04:36.009> will<00:04:36.160> be

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
so i guess the trimming bed it will be

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.010 
so i guess the trimming bed it will be
of<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.520> grand<00:04:36.729> slam<00:04:36.910> not<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.240> turban<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:37.840> guess

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
of a grand slam not a turban I guess

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.650 
of a grand slam not a turban I guess
anymore<00:04:38.289> i've<00:04:38.470> done<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.710> so<00:04:39.630> hopefully<00:04:40.630> i

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
anymore i've done that so hopefully i

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.409 
anymore i've done that so hopefully i
can<00:04:40.720> can<00:04:41.530> become<00:04:42.009> a<00:04:42.039> little<00:04:42.310> bit<00:04:42.340> more<00:04:42.610> normal

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
can can become a little bit more normal

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.230 
can can become a little bit more normal
thing<00:04:44.259> to<00:04:44.289> do<00:04:44.620> but<00:04:44.979> as<00:04:45.250> I<00:04:45.490> said<00:04:45.550> every<00:04:45.910> much<00:04:46.090> is

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
thing to do but as I said every much is

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.300 
thing to do but as I said every much is
different<00:04:46.660> every<00:04:46.870> play<00:04:47.080> is<00:04:47.289> different<00:04:47.770> so<00:04:48.039> I

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
different every play is different so I

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.370 
different every play is different so I
just<00:04:49.000> have<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.210> do<00:04:49.389> what<00:04:49.570> I've<00:04:49.690> been<00:04:49.810> doing<00:04:49.990> and

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
just have to do what I've been doing and

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.900 
just have to do what I've been doing and
hopefully<00:04:50.710> I'm<00:04:51.070> gonna<00:04:51.190> keep<00:04:51.460> winning<00:04:51.729> oh

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
hopefully I'm gonna keep winning oh

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.969 
hopefully I'm gonna keep winning oh
absolutely<00:04:52.479> yeah<00:04:53.320> if<00:04:53.380> she<00:04:53.590> can<00:04:53.710> play<00:04:53.860> like

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
absolutely yeah if she can play like

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.010 
absolutely yeah if she can play like
that<00:04:54.160> three<00:04:54.820> more<00:04:54.940> times<00:04:55.000> and<00:04:55.509> without<00:04:55.870> a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
that three more times and without a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.409 
that three more times and without a
doubt<00:04:56.229> she's<00:04:56.500> got<00:04:56.650> a<00:04:56.680> chance<00:04:56.949> so<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:58.180> think

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
doubt she's got a chance so I think

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.110 
doubt she's got a chance so I think
that's<00:04:59.099> part<00:05:00.099> of<00:05:00.220> her<00:05:00.340> problems<00:05:00.759> being<00:05:00.970> she

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
that's part of her problems being she

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.029 
that's part of her problems being she
hasn't<00:05:01.330> been<00:05:01.419> able<00:05:01.539> to<00:05:01.660> play<00:05:02.039> consistently

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
hasn't been able to play consistently

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.830 
hasn't been able to play consistently
well<00:05:03.729> enough<00:05:04.030> throughout<00:05:04.330> matches<00:05:04.720> in

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
well enough throughout matches in

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.080 
well enough throughout matches in
throughout<00:05:05.110> tournament<00:05:05.650> but<00:05:05.919> she<00:05:06.789> must<00:05:06.970> be

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
throughout tournament but she must be

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.969 
throughout tournament but she must be
doing<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.419> more<00:05:07.599> and<00:05:07.660> more<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:08.229> be<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.650> mean<00:05:08.919> I

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
doing it more and more to be I mean I

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.439 
doing it more and more to be I mean I
think<00:05:09.009> this<00:05:09.280> is<00:05:09.430> close<00:05:09.639> to<00:05:09.789> her<00:05:09.849> best<00:05:10.090> ranking

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
think this is close to her best ranking

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.300 
think this is close to her best ranking
so<00:05:10.720> she's<00:05:11.349> obviously<00:05:11.560> getting<00:05:11.830> better<00:05:12.070> at<00:05:12.280> it

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
so she's obviously getting better at it

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.730 
so she's obviously getting better at it
and<00:05:12.580> I<00:05:12.910> guess<00:05:13.210> today<00:05:13.419> is<00:05:13.570> a<00:05:13.690> kind<00:05:14.259> of<00:05:14.349> another

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
and I guess today is a kind of another

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.499 
and I guess today is a kind of another
step<00:05:15.009> forwards<00:05:15.430> towards<00:05:15.639> that<00:05:16.000> for<00:05:16.180> her<00:05:16.300> oh

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
step forwards towards that for her oh

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.900 
step forwards towards that for her oh
definitely<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.889> mean<00:05:17.949> we'll<00:05:18.280> go<00:05:18.400> ahead<00:05:18.460> first

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
definitely I mean we'll go ahead first

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.330 
definitely I mean we'll go ahead first
