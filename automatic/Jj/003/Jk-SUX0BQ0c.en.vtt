00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 good kid we are here one more day 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.299
 to review an application 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 that I think is the best application 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.940
 that proves my life is worth if you need a 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.179
 Being a root user is good and it's very 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.890
 easy what we are going to achieve with this 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.880
 great application is to get the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.070
 transparent status bar and get 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.390
 what is a navigation better is this 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.750
 application I will not leave it in the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.760
 description vale is called x part x box 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.400
 set 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.620
 When you have already downloaded you will have it 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.260
 which is to install and install 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.060
 updates once done this we 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.239
 we go here to downloads and we search here 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.900
 gravity box is worth this if we get the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.860
 First, you give this one 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.329
 once done this already downloaded what 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.270
 we will do is go 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.580
 where they put modules 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.100
 and activate it and then restart 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.740
 altered once rebooted we get 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 again on the set team and we give the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.840
 gravity box to practical modules 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.290
 and good to put the bar 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.660
 Transparent notifications we give to 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.700
 person fuck bar action and we give him 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.470
 to transparency procedures and we put 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.810
 is 100 this for the launcher 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.450
 default and this is for what 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.670
 Write good enough once this is done 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.400
 to put here have different options 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.310
 that if you want 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.500
 put it you can customize them a little 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.740
 you the enable control of billo 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.590
 of brightness is like that and then you do like that and 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.420
 control goes up brightness is worth what I 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.320
 I'm going to put a minimum because if I do not 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.950
 see correctly so you can see it well 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.230
 then in the second option in settings 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.600
 of notification bar is to put 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.700
 this varies and you have to give it to ignore 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.420
 and open a new vision bar and here 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.760
 you put 65 65 and 67 is worth once 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.950
 this we reset and well it has already been 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.610
 finished rebooting and the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.230
 sea navigation bar is worth and good 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.600
 then it has more personalization more 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.110
 more things that I 'm not going to name is worth and 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.110
 after 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.090
 this is a module it is worth and the truth is 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.290
 that is milk to me it seems a 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.060
 super super useful application because then 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.350
 it changes a little what is the appearance 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.840
 of our device works for 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.210
 bullet stock and for carm or heading for 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.600
 towards the listener, yes for what data 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.180
 we have to download in another other 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.450
 gravity box anyway of all 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.069
 ways here to download you search if we 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.260
 come out here gravity box 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.719
 I'm looking through the camera we put 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.470
 gravity box this is as I said 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:05.910
 cow poo kit kat 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.150
 one and the other here is worth it then it will be 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.900
 for what is the android kitkat and good 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.090
 As you can see here, there are more modules that 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.400
 I really do not 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.950
 I do not need it as you see I have a 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.670
 gravity box update 2.9 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.800
 Point 2 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.959
 I do not know what I have but good while 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.489
 I'm going to leave it like that 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.440
 download a module is worth now after 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.150
 when it's finished downloading 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.799

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.510
 then we will give it to you and it is already 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.930
 well, we're supposed to give it and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.629
 it would be installed, it would be reinstalled 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.330
 and good and nothing else I hope that I have 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.390

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:55.100

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.760

 0.4 only this is available for 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.569
 and the living is worth 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.069
 with a root user, it does not work 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.100
