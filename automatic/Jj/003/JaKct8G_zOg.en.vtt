00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.900
 Hello from her specifically for the attacks 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.960
 it opens next to the capital itself 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.460
 the main event in this profession and your 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.220
 Kiev birds took the seventh place and 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.049
 received 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.689
 in size 70 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.119
 two hundred and eighty dollars Spartak became 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.249
 sonata sedan 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.140
 but not very much 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.849
 did not start at all started 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:21.499
 arms 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.560
 c 1 pyrolysis dispersed the entire final table and 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.439
 and the eldest was to deliver 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.579
 which emotions from the hall 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.289
 in general, how would not really like it so much 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.170
 it came lucky a little less than 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.980
 to others 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.540
 but in general to play in the final 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.010
 tests were aggressively played by inventors 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.220
 but many 100 people who 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.500
 that this play there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.120
 about 500 write 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.750
 a couple of people therefore play who with 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.540
 kings even deal just cola and man 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.580
 they are with people who are more aggressive 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.120
 plays rearrange 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 but before the finale and as a herd of fear of shock 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.700
 wanted to let go 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.250
 all performances of repetitions 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.240
 the first day was very hard at all 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.100
 nothing came too 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.250
 there was no starter 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.370
 the second day was the number a couple happened 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.690
 once but 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.350
 paid nothing but everything 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.080
 big banks big won there 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.940
 overlapping someone just served well 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.480
 tight rope 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.030
 she won big ones 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.040
 banks 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.880
 teams are now in debt 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.570
 rewards and scores 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.910
 then won six max signed there 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.320
 all toms 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 got gastritis and ds3 man closed 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.040
 and the Serb jat passed languages 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.090
 but as if the principle is pleased at the same time 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.920
 the result is not very pleased because 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.240
 I would like a little better 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.960
 as it didnâ€™t go all these days 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.360
 finals will go better 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.760
 but did not go 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.350
 we are not very happy because 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.370
 always final table good prizes 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.920
 start with top 3 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.800
 that is, you are not in the top 3 ie 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.390
 it's pretty nothing to be here 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.460
 repeatedly dansko then following 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.929
 series 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.659
