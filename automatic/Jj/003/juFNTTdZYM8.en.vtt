00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.540 
use a mop brush really soft and it
really<00:02:45.600> gets<00:02:46.230> into<00:02:46.590> all<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.740> cracks<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
really gets into all the cracks and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.210 
really gets into all the cracks and
crevices<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.210> painting<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:49.920> here<00:02:50.160> we

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
crevices of the painting and so here we

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.960 
crevices of the painting and so here we
go<00:02:51.770> all<00:02:52.770> right<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:53.190> want<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.460> get<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> fairly

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
go all right you want to get a fairly

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.970 
go all right you want to get a fairly
decent<00:02:54.180> amount<00:02:54.750> saturate<00:02:55.290> your<00:02:55.470> brush<00:02:55.680> with

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
decent amount saturate your brush with

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.070 
decent amount saturate your brush with
the<00:02:56.730> mixture<00:02:57.740> you<00:02:58.740> want<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.180> put<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.300> all<00:03:00.480> over

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
the mixture you want to put it all over

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
right here I am putting it everywhere to

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.310 
right here I am putting it everywhere to
unify<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.900> painting<00:03:14.480> when<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.510> get<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.900> all<00:03:16.050> in

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
unify this painting when I get it all in

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.350 
unify this painting when I get it all in
the<00:03:16.440> black<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.360> Brown

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.630 

although<00:03:24.080> I<00:03:24.170> people<00:03:24.530> do<00:03:24.830> right<00:03:25.160> now<00:03:25.310> I'm<00:03:25.490> doing

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
although I people do right now I'm doing

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.940 
although I people do right now I'm doing
X<00:03:26.300> motion<00:03:26.780> motions<00:03:27.230> but<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.620> lot<00:03:27.770> of<00:03:27.800> people

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
X motion motions but a lot of people

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.040 
X motion motions but a lot of people
will<00:03:28.190> do<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.490> try<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.650> refile<00:03:30.650> their<00:03:31.040> old<00:03:32.050> brush

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
will do is try to refile their old brush

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.650 
will do is try to refile their old brush
strokes<00:03:33.470> and<00:03:35.440> that<00:03:36.440> helps<00:03:36.740> a<00:03:36.800> lot<00:03:36.950> too<00:03:37.660> but

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
strokes and that helps a lot too but

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.260 
strokes and that helps a lot too but
since<00:03:38.960> I'm<00:03:39.080> doing<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.350> whole<00:03:39.530> thing<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:40.270> don't

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
since I'm doing the whole thing I don't

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.930 
since I'm doing the whole thing I don't
really<00:03:41.390> care<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:41.900> much<00:03:42.050> about<00:03:42.110> that<00:03:42.560> I'm<00:03:43.340> just

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
really care so much about that I'm just

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.530 
really care so much about that I'm just
X<00:03:44.600> crossing<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.200> whole<00:03:45.410> thing<00:03:46.270> and<00:03:47.270> you<00:03:47.390> see

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
X crossing the whole thing and you see

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.690 
X crossing the whole thing and you see
how<00:03:47.630> everything's<00:03:48.020> getting<00:03:48.320> this<00:03:48.700> brownish

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
how everything's getting this brownish

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.350 
how everything's getting this brownish
red<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:51.290> it's<00:03:51.620> really<00:03:52.210> harmonizing<00:03:53.210> this

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
red and it's really harmonizing this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.930 
red and it's really harmonizing this
whole<00:03:53.600> painting<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.350> so<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.130> won't<00:03:55.370> have<00:03:55.580> one

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
whole painting and so you won't have one

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.480 
whole painting and so you won't have one
thing<00:03:56.090> that's<00:03:56.300> pure<00:03:56.930> black<00:03:57.260> black<00:03:57.560> with

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
thing that's pure black black with

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.300 
thing that's pure black black with
anything<00:03:58.940> that's<00:03:59.060> pure<00:03:59.360> white<00:03:59.600> white<00:03:59.810> and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
anything that's pure white white and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.910 
anything that's pure white white and
it's<00:04:01.310> really<00:04:01.730> just<00:04:01.850> white<00:04:02.360> would<00:04:02.600> go<00:04:03.560> really

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
it's really just white would go really

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.790 
it's really just white would go really
light<00:04:04.070> brown<00:04:04.430> in<00:04:04.760> there<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.810> then<00:04:05.959> black<00:04:06.590> with

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
light brown in there and then black with

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.449 
light brown in there and then black with
a<00:04:06.830> hint<00:04:07.100> of<00:04:07.310> brown<00:04:08.350> over<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.920> really<00:04:13.100> helps

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
a hint of brown over it it really helps

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.259 
a hint of brown over it it really helps
to<00:04:14.740> get<00:04:15.740> everything<00:04:16.340> in<00:04:16.640> sync<00:04:17.000> with<00:04:17.209> the

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
to get everything in sync with the

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.030 
to get everything in sync with the
painting<00:04:20.290> then<00:04:21.290> after<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.709> do<00:04:21.799> all<00:04:21.920> the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
painting then after you do all the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.800 
painting then after you do all the
crisscross<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.670> want<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.880> go<00:04:22.940> one<00:04:23.210> direction

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
crisscross you want to go one direction

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.770 
crisscross you want to go one direction
at<00:04:24.770> least<00:04:24.830> for<00:04:25.280> this<00:04:25.460> case<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:28.130> really<00:04:28.780> look

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
at least for this case and really look

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.659 
at least for this case and really look
at<00:04:29.900> it<00:04:30.020> from<00:04:30.140> different<00:04:30.200> angles<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.250> make

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
at it from different angles and make

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.620 
at it from different angles and make
sure<00:04:31.850> it's<00:04:32.000> nice<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.240> even<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:34.010> voila<00:04:34.630> so
