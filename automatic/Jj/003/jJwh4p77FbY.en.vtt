00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.830
 spider man or three days 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.190
 all overproduction around the world 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.630
 spider man 3 seems to have stayed only in the segment 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.359
 in the new generation 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.039
 the film does not do more than copy its predecessor said 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:17.839
 not worse 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:20.839
 at times he is a little son 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.679
 on the skin of man spider consortium identity 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.180
 at the end of the game the player patrols the neighborhoods by hand 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.630
 facing using 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.989
 Hero's enemies 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.280
 countless criminals 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.170
 the formula is the same as for magnitude 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.960
 I am in favor 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.809
 ro protagonist is endowed with superpowers do not have to be stealing 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.809
 cars to join au 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.000
 the graphics show a more populous city of the movie 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560
 traffic jams are common on major avenues 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.120
 only missing female passersby 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.640
 of intelligence after they continue to walk in colonizing better solutions 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.830
 and intrigues pedro v 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.050
 mass is by far the look looks great 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.090
 with the beauty of a postcard 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.520
 all my passage 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.230
 building construction seems to be here in crack box 360 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.030
 and Playstation 3 are able to do 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.880
 at least light effects pass this simplicity a little 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.770
 in relation to the modeling of the characters 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.770
 there is an abyss of a spider man and the coadjutants 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.649
 the hero looks great 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.220
 he is close to the movie version 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.350
 but the human figures train a little celebrated 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.890
 many seem to have bulging eyes 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.900
 just jj minsk subway dismissal the sim talk 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.250
 sound is just part of it 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.700
 but the intuitive track-sounding after regional viewing of the cinemark 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.009
 many of the stars in the movie also represent their turn no limits 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.920
 cases of glaucoma would act as spider man 23h 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.880
 bush as jj of injury 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
 but this does not affect the exceptional result 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.870
 again the best of the team we had air until going to walk in the morning 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.389
 nothing in the visual 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.240
 gives a sense of freedom has a bit of that little people 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.499
 and it's so peculiar in the movies 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.370
 as you used ugly to move from a building to a building 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.179
 ability to evolve more and more 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.810
 when you are accessing without compromise by the city 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.169
 the camera and the practice 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.879
 I'm not sure how to give 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.860
 but in races and fights 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.099
 many times you can not 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.649
 I will lazaro the target inside the screen 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.909
 it's easy to get disoriented rotate on the wall 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:44.690
 not near 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.019
 which makes it difficult to get where you want 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.499
 in a word, restrictions and activities 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.879
 was one of the icons that represent more than this 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.659
 whose focus is the fight against one of the Spider-Man's arch-enemies 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.900
 the villains though of the movie 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.089
 like green real estate elf 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.189
 while the comics 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.979
 Scorpio 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.009
 a video made for example 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.999
 and then also in the cauldron 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.040
 some original figures granted to someone 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.659
 are beautiful independent stories is a beautiful forty-two missions 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:24.119
 the missions are organized but in the vineyard it gets all broken 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.629
 without a master line 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.439
 but even worse is the content of the mission 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.909
 the repetitive 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.869
 basically an alternation of combats and daily activities of a hero 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:40.719
 How to save hostages avoid catastrophes and disarm bombs 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.829
 the fines are to be spoken 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.980
 just choose an attack button 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.750
 and use the spider sense 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.690
 That leaves are Vincent to end the May 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.199
 on the day of the game unless 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.289
 the sense also serves to automatically divert from the 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.289
 artists that makes it easier to face cfz 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.629
 prolonging has necessarily done something 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.629
 in the end the fighting is benedito 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:14.219
 the fear costume increases the power of the cearÃ¡ 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.219
 but could not save the sex scenes 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.409
 the balance of the buildings disarmament of bombs also does not occur the goal 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.800
 already the eradication or crisis is a little better 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.150
 there is also a series of hidden icons 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.889
 already the big rewards collection 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.610
 spider man 3 has practically the same qualities and defects as the predecessor 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.080
 a good liberators and come back faster 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.509
 most combative funrio 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.639
 the problem is that the missions got less interesting 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.389
 it's better but it's not that generation jump 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.490
 in the end 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.960
 more difficult still 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.449
 the deputy general 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.569
 Spider man 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.150
 who came closest 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.220
 then his own father
