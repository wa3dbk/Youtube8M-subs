00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
to look at the structure of RNA and then

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.109 
to look at the structure of RNA and then
you<00:01:47.500> will<00:01:47.649> see<00:01:47.829> that<00:01:48.009> there's<00:01:48.310> sugar<00:01:48.670> there<00:01:48.850> is

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
you will see that there's sugar there is

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.120 
you will see that there's sugar there is
something<00:01:49.539> totally<00:01:49.780> different<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:51.009> will

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
something totally different and you will

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.980 
something totally different and you will
not<00:01:51.340> be<00:01:51.549> allocated<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:52.390> mark<00:01:52.570> if<00:01:52.719> you<00:01:52.810> only

not be allocated and mark if you only

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.800 
not be allocated and mark if you only
say<00:01:53.320> sugar<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.979> then<00:01:54.700> we<00:01:54.909> have<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:55.420> these

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
say sugar and then we have this these

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.499 
say sugar and then we have this these
nitrogenous<00:01:56.799> bases<00:01:57.100> here<00:01:57.640> you<00:01:58.180> will<00:01:58.359> see

nitrogenous bases here you will see

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.060 
nitrogenous bases here you will see
there<00:01:58.719> are<00:01:58.750> four<00:01:59.109> different<00:01:59.409> nitrogenous

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
there are four different nitrogenous

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.179 
there are four different nitrogenous
bases<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.200> we'll<00:02:02.200> get<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.710> names<00:02:02.950> of

than the two smaller ones they have the
small<00:02:10.450> names<00:02:10.750> they<00:02:11.020> are<00:02:11.050> there<00:02:11.500> purine<00:02:12.370> but<00:02:12.550> a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
small names they are there purine but a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.330 
small names they are there purine but a
basis<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.330> these<00:02:13.930> are<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.470> pyrimidine<00:02:15.070> bases

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
basis and these are the pyrimidine bases

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.120 
basis and these are the pyrimidine bases
so<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.210> large<00:02:16.660> one<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.260> small<00:02:17.290> one<00:02:17.530> connect

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
so a large one and a small one connect

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.880 
so a large one and a small one connect
and<00:02:18.340> I'm<00:02:19.210> going<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.600> ask<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.080> Rangers<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.650> show

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
and I'm going to ask the Rangers to show

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.190 
and I'm going to ask the Rangers to show
you<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.220> connection<00:02:21.580> if<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.600> go<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.050> next
