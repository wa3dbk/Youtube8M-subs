00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
attack I'm just going to try to get an

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230 
attack I'm just going to try to get an
execute<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.710> his<00:00:19.859> toe<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.730> goal<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.090> obviously

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
execute on his toe the goal is obviously

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.150 
execute on his toe the goal is obviously
to<00:00:21.570> push<00:00:21.810> him<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> killing<00:00:22.289> blow<00:00:22.500> range<00:00:22.800> or

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
to push him to killing blow range or

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.439 
to push him to killing blow range or
approximately<00:00:23.789> 30%<00:00:25.340> I<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.730> believe<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
approximately 30% I do believe the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.359 
approximately 30% I do believe the
warrior<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.320> slagged<00:00:28.710> however<00:00:29.189> he

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
warrior can be slagged however he

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.759 
warrior can be slagged however he
doesn't<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> purple<00:00:30.330> slag<00:00:30.660> model<00:00:31.230> much

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
doesn't have a purple slag model much

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.280 
doesn't have a purple slag model much
like<00:00:32.030> Bunker<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.540> couple<00:00:33.750> other<00:00:34.020> bosses

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
like Bunker and a couple other bosses

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.069 
like Bunker and a couple other bosses
that<00:00:34.620> happen<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.070> do<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.610> well<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.719> will

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
that happen to do that as well so I will

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.799 
that happen to do that as well so I will
take<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.829> no<00:00:37.980> time<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.520> try<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> slag<00:00:39.570> him

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
take you no time to try to slag him

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
take you no time to try to slag him
though<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.079> can't<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.710> tell<00:00:40.950> if<00:00:40.980> he's

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
though you can't really tell if he's

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.639 
though you can't really tell if he's
lagged<00:00:41.640> from<00:00:42.420> his<00:00:42.600> appearance<00:00:45.320> that's<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
lagged from his appearance that's just a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.650 
lagged from his appearance that's just a
theory<00:00:46.920> too<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.520> entirely<00:00:47.940> sure<00:00:48.210> he<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
theory too I'm not entirely sure he to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.170 
theory too I'm not entirely sure he to
be<00:00:48.780> slack<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.260> haven't<00:00:49.500> really<00:00:49.710> tested<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.280> but

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
be slack I haven't really tested it but

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.580 
be slack I haven't really tested it but
I'm<00:00:51.390> pretty<00:00:51.480> sure<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> heard<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I'm pretty sure I heard that was the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
I'm pretty sure I heard that was the
case<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.280> anyway<00:00:53.640> looking<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.690> my<00:00:54.780> next

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
case so anyway looking for my next

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.139 
case so anyway looking for my next
execute<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:55.739> pushed<00:00:56.250> him<00:00:56.370> down<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:57.059> know

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
execute now pushed him down you know

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.560 
execute now pushed him down you know
pretty<00:00:57.390> far<00:00:57.949> down<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.129> about<00:00:59.309> 70%<00:00:59.820> health<00:01:00.329> I'd

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
pretty far down to about 70% health I'd

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.529 
pretty far down to about 70% health I'd
say<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.129> I'll<00:01:02.309> switch<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.699> slag<00:01:03.030> Pimpernel

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
say so I'll switch to my slag Pimpernel

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.929 
say so I'll switch to my slag Pimpernel
now<00:01:03.750> because<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.260> know<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.680> has<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> chance<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> do

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
now because I know it has a chance to do

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.410 
now because I know it has a chance to do
some<00:01:06.119> damage<00:01:06.479> while<00:01:06.750> he's<00:01:06.990> over<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:08.420> again

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
some damage while he's over here again

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.810 
some damage while he's over here again
just<00:01:09.659> trying<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.170> slag<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.650> him<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.040> any

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just trying to get slag on him and any

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.090 
just trying to get slag on him and any
more<00:01:12.240> shots<00:01:12.570> will<00:01:12.750> help<00:01:12.960> obviously<00:01:13.710> didn't

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
more shots will help obviously didn't

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.679 
more shots will help obviously didn't
look<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.520> did<00:01:14.640> too<00:01:14.850> much<00:01:15.000> damage<00:01:15.450> there

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
look like they did too much damage there

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.880 
look like they did too much damage there
though

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
though

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.460 
though
go<00:01:18.490> ahead<00:01:18.730> and<00:01:19.000> lower<00:01:19.510> his<00:01:19.750> health<00:01:19.930> again<00:01:20.260> with

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
go ahead and lower his health again with

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.530 
go ahead and lower his health again with
another<00:01:20.560> execute<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.580> actually<00:01:21.970> killed<00:01:22.360> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
another execute I actually killed the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.660 
another execute I actually killed the
warrior<00:01:22.900> it<00:01:23.140> was<00:01:23.260> at<00:01:23.380> level<00:01:23.530> 61<00:01:24.130> though<00:01:24.370> with

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
warrior it was at level 61 though with

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.600 
warrior it was at level 61 though with
an<00:01:24.850> level<00:01:25.420> 8<00:01:25.600> sniper<00:01:25.990> rifle<00:01:26.470> due<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.830> perfect

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
an level 8 sniper rifle due to a perfect

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.650 
an level 8 sniper rifle due to a perfect
for<00:01:27.850> once<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.960> was<00:01:29.050> pretty<00:01:29.200> cool<00:01:30.660> all

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
for once so that was pretty cool all

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.450 
for once so that was pretty cool all
right<00:01:31.720> now<00:01:32.230> we're<00:01:32.380> gonna<00:01:32.470> get<00:01:32.740> more<00:01:32.980> slag<00:01:33.280> on

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
right now we're gonna get more slag on

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.440 
right now we're gonna get more slag on
him<00:01:33.610> more<00:01:33.850> kunai

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
him more kunai

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.360 
him more kunai
this<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.900> obviously<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.440> boosted<00:01:35.770> kunai<00:01:36.100> that

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
this is obviously the boosted kunai that

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.020 
this is obviously the boosted kunai that
now<00:01:36.490> do<00:01:36.660> 80%<00:01:37.660> stacking<00:01:38.440> again<00:01:38.770> little<00:01:39.670> dangers

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
now do 80% stacking again little dangers

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.940 
now do 80% stacking again little dangers
there<00:01:40.300> as<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.600> was<00:01:40.750> in<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:40.900> lava<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.620> have<00:01:41.800> to

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
there as I was in the lava and I have to

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.890 
there as I was in the lava and I have to
use<00:01:42.130> my<00:01:42.280> chain<00:01:42.610> lightning<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.270> get<00:01:43.510> some<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.810> my

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
use my chain lightning to get some of my

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.350 
use my chain lightning to get some of my
health<00:01:44.140> back<00:01:44.410> but<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.400> was<00:01:45.580> able<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.850> tank<00:01:46.240> the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
health back but I was able to tank the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
damage over time and that's a good deal

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.950 
damage over time and that's a good deal

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
especially at op8 where that's a little

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.749 
especially at op8 where that's a little
more<00:01:50.140> difficult<00:01:52.020> use<00:01:53.020> my<00:01:53.200> kunai<00:01:53.530> again<00:01:53.920> when

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
more difficult use my kunai again when

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.550

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
actually do a fair amount of damage

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.450 
actually do a fair amount of damage
themselves<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:59.200> right<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.680> now<00:01:59.830> he's<00:02:00.070> really

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460
