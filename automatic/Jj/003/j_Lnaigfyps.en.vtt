all<00:00:04.020> right<00:00:04.230> I'm<00:00:04.440> gonna<00:00:05.480> move<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.870> splines<00:00:07.859> on

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
all right I'm gonna move the splines on

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.249 
all right I'm gonna move the splines on
my<00:00:08.460> final<00:00:09.389> drive<00:00:09.660> or<00:00:10.940> driveshaft<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
my final drive or driveshaft I have the

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.619 
my final drive or driveshaft I have the
advantage<00:00:13.459> that<00:00:14.459> I<00:00:14.490> have<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.940> engine<00:00:15.299> taken

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:15.629 
advantage that I have the engine taken

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.750 
advantage that I have the engine taken
out<00:00:15.749> so<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.500> put<00:00:16.620> the<00:00:16.740> propeller<00:00:17.070> shaft<00:00:17.430> in

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
out so I can put the propeller shaft in

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.290 
out so I can put the propeller shaft in
after<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> put<00:00:18.450> the<00:00:18.630> rear<00:00:18.900> drive<00:00:19.560> case<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.300> I

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
after I put the rear drive case on I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.210 
after I put the rear drive case on I
lubed<00:00:21.779> up<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.349> splines<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:24.560> this<00:00:25.560> drive<00:00:25.859> case

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
lubed up the splines on this drive case

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.370 
lubed up the splines on this drive case
with<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> little<00:00:26.939> Molly<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.449> got<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:27.929> spring<00:00:28.259> in

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
with a little Molly I got my spring in

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.519 
with a little Molly I got my spring in
place<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.910> new<00:00:30.119> o-ring<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:31.259> where<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
place so and a new o-ring for where the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.280 
place so and a new o-ring for where the
propeller<00:00:31.830> shaft<00:00:32.250> slides<00:00:32.850> over<00:00:33.060> top<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
propeller shaft slides over top so that

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
propeller shaft slides over top so that
the<00:00:34.560> grease<00:00:34.740> can't<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:35.310> so<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:35.940> gonna

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the grease can't get out so I'm gonna

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.680 
the grease can't get out so I'm gonna
just<00:00:36.390> slide<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.500> swing<00:00:37.830> arm<00:00:38.450> or<00:00:39.450> my

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
just slide that on to my swing arm or my

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
just slide that on to my swing arm or my
drive<00:00:40.230> shaft<00:00:40.260> tube<00:00:40.920> or<00:00:41.160> whatever<00:00:41.400> you<00:00:41.460> want<00:00:41.580> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
drive shaft tube or whatever you want to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:52.319 
drive shaft tube or whatever you want to
call<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.310> put<00:00:44.310> my<00:00:44.430> nuts<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.820> place

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.889 

I<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:53.620> torque<00:00:53.859> these<00:00:54.039> nuts<00:00:54.820> up<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.359> seventeen

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
I can torque these nuts up to seventeen

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:12.760 
I can torque these nuts up to seventeen
and<00:00:56.050> a<00:00:56.140> half<00:00:56.320> foot<00:00:56.739> pounds

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
okay so I got my propeller shaft lubed

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.770 
okay so I got my propeller shaft lubed
up<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.260> some<00:01:16.470> Molly<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.970> use<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
up with some Molly I just use a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.240 
up with some Molly I just use a
toothbrush<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.409> get<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.620> in<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> splines

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
toothbrush to get it in the splines

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
toothbrush to get it in the splines
really<00:01:20.580> well<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.940> then<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.320> stuck<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
really well and then I just stuck a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.000 
really well and then I just stuck a
bunch<00:01:22.650> more<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:24.110> lubed<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.560> u-joint

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
bunch more in there lubed up the u-joint

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.380 
bunch more in there lubed up the u-joint
with<00:01:26.190> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.430> silicone<00:01:28.250> lube<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.580> I<00:01:30.119> lubed

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
with a little silicone lube and I lubed

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.249 
with a little silicone lube and I lubed
up<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:31.410> splines<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> Molly<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.030> well

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
up these splines with the Molly as well

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
up these splines with the Molly as well
now<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.700> slide<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.880> down<00:01:35.940> into<00:01:36.300> tube

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
now I can just slide that down into tube

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.760 
now I can just slide that down into tube
and<00:01:36.930> feed<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> into<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.909> base<00:01:39.680> okay<00:01:40.680> I'll

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and feed it into the base okay I'll

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.890 
and feed it into the base okay I'll
spread<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> propeller<00:01:41.580> shaft<00:01:41.880> down<00:01:42.180> engine

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
spread the propeller shaft down engine

00:01:42.900 --> 00:02:16.300 
spread the propeller shaft down engine
let's<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.680> spline

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.520 

that<00:02:17.310> shock<00:02:17.670> mounted<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.750> Maggie<00:02:18.989> I'm<00:02:19.380> going

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
that shock mounted on Maggie I'm going

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.479 
that shock mounted on Maggie I'm going
to<00:02:19.620> torque<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:20.040> these<00:02:20.840> drug<00:02:21.840> nuts<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.489> 22

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
to torque up these drug nuts to 22

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:31.530 
to torque up these drug nuts to 22
foot-pounds

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.830

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.240 

okay<00:03:17.220> I've<00:03:17.459> lubed<00:03:17.790> these<00:03:18.060> splines<00:03:18.420> that

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
okay I've lubed these splines that

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.759 
okay I've lubed these splines that

grease just got after that with a little

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.309 
grease just got after that with a little
toothbrush<00:03:25.790> little<00:03:26.790> drive<00:03:27.480> in<00:03:27.689> there<00:03:27.930> when<00:03:28.290> I

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
toothbrush little drive in there when I

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
realize it just rear wheels easier to

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.110 
realize it just rear wheels easier to
engage<00:04:12.270> in<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:12.860> drive<00:04:13.860> when<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.490> axles<00:04:15.000> in

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
engage in this drive when the axles in

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.940 
engage in this drive when the axles in
there<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.510> want<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.870> put<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.230> in<00:04:16.410> it's<00:04:16.590> lit<00:04:16.830> in

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
a little easier I'll just put my spacer

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.460 
a little easier I'll just put my spacer
on<00:04:19.860> the<00:04:19.950> other<00:04:20.100> side<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.690> rear<00:04:21.690> axle<00:04:22.200> and
