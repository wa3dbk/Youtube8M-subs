00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.160
 hey people welcome back to wii play 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.780
 offs cool wants me max wood at the start too 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.980
 another follow tk five tips and 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.320
 Tricks and I thought so when I was 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.760
 once single chance then show 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.710
 I'll give you another easter egg 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.870
 this time here with Michael and indeed to 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:36.789
 film an allusion to the film back 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:38.199
 in any case in the future in allusion 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:44.140
 to the film back in the future 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:46.659
 movie classics the easter egg is located 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.170
 here below this transmission towers 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:53.280
 this yes what should that be rat his 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:02.620
 mast cottage on this power box 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:07.530
 once you look at 1.1 point 21 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:11.070
 gigawatt in the movie back to the future 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.170
 means 12 1 gigawatt 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.450
 the watt number is the time machine 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.560
 needs to get into the past or the 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.750
 future to jump 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.450
 practically the fly capacitor 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:28.299
 works with 12 1 gigawatt 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.649
 then a time jump comes to stand 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.250
 So the fly capacitor is yes 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:36.100
 he had virtually delorean in here so 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.780
 must be inserted in the back 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.939
 car will be built only then 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.869
 does the time machine or 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.899
 works as a time machine and 12 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.049
 1 gigawatt is roughly equivalent 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.130
 about the power of the watt number one 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.380
 lightning so when lightning strikes that 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.180
 are then 12 1 gigawatt 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.549
 was synonymous in the movie where the lightning 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.240
 but hit with the energy 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.210
 from lightning is it but the brown 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.209
 scientist the doctor in the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.470
 traveled past 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.360
 marty mcfly had then first 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.480
 asked hey doc brown what the devil 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.470
 are because 12 1 gigawatt because they had 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.140
 I think I also have a movie on the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.700
 Watched TV and there had the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.780
 Doctor I almost know he had become 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.019
 I think myself how he saw it 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.300
 said then the drops come 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.099
 that for the time machine for the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.069
 Fly capacitor exactly one power 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.260
 by umpire has power 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.290
 anyway, that's exactly 12 watts 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.599
 consumed to make time jumps yes 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.650
 now you know and the easter egg 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.690
 is not only there but 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.120
 also in many other places one 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.860
 StromkÃ¤sten I think the like 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.590
 appearance 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.940
 Everywhere 12 1 gigawatt put it on so 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.440
 The rock stars are up to date 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:03.730
 in any case, back to the future 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:07.140
 window and the clip I will still you 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.140
 link in the description 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.100
 this is europe so if you can look 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.600
 someone from you the movie yet 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.680
 knows absolute classic for me and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.470
 it was 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:42.680
 with the video to go back to the future 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:47.650
 is in and I'm out but I do 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.650
 yes tom reaction for the 1.21 gigabytes 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:58.540
 1.21 gigawatt what the devil is 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.540
 gigabyte
