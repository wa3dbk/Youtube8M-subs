 worthy of its capabilities this 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.869
 the place must exist and be 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.000

 management of science art and who not 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.229
 coped with duties supposedly in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.900
 Overnight to fall into place more modest 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.720
 clip in need you trash it 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450

 Named in supplies for the state defense order 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.810
 unacceptable you understand that in 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.659
 the times are half already 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.609
 present here would be engaged 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.079
 active physical labor in the fresh 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.340
 air must be accountable for taken 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.690
 liabilities 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.150
 contrary to legend arrest for failure in 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.270
 work happened quite rarely 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.420
 even in the midst of war but the sacking and 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.170
 demotion usual under comrade 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.479
 Dzhugashvili case it now 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.800

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.819
 repression 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.310
 but the Brezhnev time when the cabinet 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.420
 left in only to raise or retire 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.559
 deservedly named swollen stagnation 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.679
 Now there are not enough new jobs 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.399
 the army is liberated very reluctantly and then 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:30.539
 under tight control of the rest of the officials 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.679
 here and see if they succeed in 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.039
 once again shut up simple 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.689

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:40.909
