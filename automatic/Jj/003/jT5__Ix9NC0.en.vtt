00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:08.500
 hdblog friends welcome back today we have 

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:12.520
 another comparison in the windows world 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.240
 phone a comparison of a nokia is an htc 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.150
 respectively lumia 800 the rider two 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.550
 terminals although they have dimensions 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.670
 very similar have big differences 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:30.520
 inside a nokia processor first 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.900
 1.4 GB while radar has a processor 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.309
 from 1 gb 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.270
 then the first generation of snap 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.460
 dragon in addition the radar as titan has one 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.910
 front camera on screen instead 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.820
 as you can see on the nokia that a 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.450
 black amoled club is definitely 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.559
 higher 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:57.430
 the colors are much stronger in black is 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:59.820
 much more black and so this is already a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.379
 point in favor of one eye but 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.560
 also the price range of course 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.380
 days justifies scrolling 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.159
 the times is good on this htc 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:19.090
 also good on the nokia 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:21.790
 let's see what Nokia's performance is 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.080
 finished a few seconds later I finished 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.850
 even the radar as we imagined is not there 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.360
 however, a big difference is windows 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.560
 phone on this point of view has a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.659
 excellent optimization sorry for the game 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.220
 of words or to see the zoom 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.549
 there is some extra rendering point 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:49.570
 on the gigahertz profession but nothing 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:52.079
 in short, he had to download a 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.079
 page 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.870
 from a male window 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.610
 also in this case should do 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:13.140
 better nokia we see scrolling also in 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:19.740
 this case rendering on nokia and more 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:24.200
 efficient double as precise on 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.560
 both 9:30 finished while htc 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.560
 arseni thor 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.560
 let's see some screen rotation 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.270
 for better or worse we are not there 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.040
 differences 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:46.260
 let's load some more 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:47.910
 facebook application for example in 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.620
 in this case there was some management of the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.730
 processes and meant that nokia 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:00.920
 it charged slightly less quickly 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:05.100
 seesmic version 2.0 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:09.260
 let's see which is definitely better 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.220
 better if you post a few seconds nokia 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.930
 we also charge to foursquare for 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.930
 finish this comparison 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.739
 so nokia did a lot earlier 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.390
 here then to be president more but a 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:42.760
 bit the display of knowing how to make a comparison 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:46.350
 quality is here however the htc manages to 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.460
 make a good impression not even like 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.920
 manages to behave well even if it is 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.180
 however branch red 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.180
 the results satisfactory 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.880
 therefore this terminal costs 399 euros 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.400
 can be 499 euros 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.280
 the materials repeat those higher 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.310
 of the nokia as a htc camera is a 5 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.310
 megapixel 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.400
 an audio ie there is a bit of audio here 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:37.820
 light that htc we expect a little more 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:42.860
 nokia sin we listen to and david 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:47.530
 even beat the photos even if the bass 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:52.100
 they are not not much camera feel 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:55.130
 hd 5 megapixel with good shots but el 8 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.260
 nokia megapixels in our opinion is 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.780
 superior regardless of megapixels 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.620
 for the quality of the photos we have 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.900
 done and so if only this htc 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.280
 could cost a little less could 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.540
 going to occupy a market segment 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.400
 very interesting 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.850
 then maybe with enough htc price 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.550
 having seen the performance he has is not 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.520
 only from the currency market 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.150
 for today it's all a greeting 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.150
 simone
