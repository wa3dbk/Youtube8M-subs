00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.919 
boy or a girl and we took him to the vet
near<00:00:14.340> me<00:00:14.549> because<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.030> were<00:00:15.089> offering<00:00:15.360> free

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.230 
near me because they were offering free
checkups<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> thought<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:17.699> awesome

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240

checkups so I thought that was awesome
and<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.690> take<00:00:18.930> him<00:00:19.109> down<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.710> they<00:00:20.250> would<00:00:20.400> know

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and we take him down and they would know

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.179 
and we take him down and they would know
but<00:00:20.910> unfortunately<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.109> vet<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.710> pretty

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
but unfortunately the vet was pretty

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.140 
but unfortunately the vet was pretty
rubbish<00:00:23.519> when<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.000> came<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.300> rabbits<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:26.150> he

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
rubbish when it came to rabbits and he

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.320 
rubbish when it came to rabbits and he
didn't<00:00:27.420> even<00:00:27.510> check<00:00:27.779> his<00:00:27.990> teeth<00:00:28.760> I<00:00:29.760> asked<00:00:30.269> him

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you know how it was whether it was a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.220 
you know how it was whether it was a
good<00:00:32.610> way<00:00:32.790> all<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.300> sort<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.510> thing<00:00:33.600> had<00:00:34.140> he

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
good way all that sort of thing had he

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.380 
good way all that sort of thing had he
checked<00:00:34.469> his<00:00:34.620> teeth<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.100> he<00:00:35.190> said<00:00:35.430> no<00:00:35.640> he

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
checked his teeth and he said no he

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.030 
checked his teeth and he said no he
didn't<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:36.960> picked<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:37.829> he

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
didn't like to be picked up so he

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.430 
didn't like to be picked up so he
wouldn't<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.550> his<00:00:39.540> teeth<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.020> looked<00:00:40.230> at

wouldn't like his teeth to be looked at

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350 
wouldn't like his teeth to be looked at
which<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.160> thought<00:00:41.309> was<00:00:41.399> really<00:00:41.550> strange<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
which I thought was really strange for a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.450 
which I thought was really strange for a
bit<00:00:42.600> not<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.140> check<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.710> rabbit's<00:00:44.129> teeth

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
bit not to check a rabbit's teeth

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.369 
bit not to check a rabbit's teeth
especially<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.930> one<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.200> don't

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
especially if it's one that we don't

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.740 
especially if it's one that we don't
know<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> background<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.309> because<00:00:47.850> obviously

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
know the background of because obviously

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
know the background of because obviously
rabbits<00:00:49.370> their<00:00:50.370> teeth<00:00:50.610> are<00:00:50.760> open<00:00:51.030> rooted

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
rabbits their teeth are open rooted

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
rabbits their teeth are open rooted
they're<00:00:51.600> constantly<00:00:51.989> growing<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> if

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
they're constantly growing and if

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.260 
they're constantly growing and if
they're<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:53.550> diet<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.120> can

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
they're not on the right diet it can

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.660 
they're not on the right diet it can
lead<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> things<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.989> dental<00:00:55.410> disease<00:00:55.739> which

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
lead to things like dental disease which

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.139 
lead to things like dental disease which
can<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.480> huge<00:00:58.079> repercussions<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.090> kind<00:01:00.090> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
can have huge repercussions so kind of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.369 
can have huge repercussions so kind of
one<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> first<00:01:00.629> things<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.230> with

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
one of the first things you do with

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.359 
one of the first things you do with
small<00:01:01.680> animals<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.730> check<00:01:03.090> their<00:01:03.329> teeth<00:01:04.369> so

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
small animals is check their teeth so

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.310 
small animals is check their teeth so
that<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:05.790> bad<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.540> we're

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that was really bad so I think we're

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.620 
that was really bad so I think we're
going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> write<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.700> vet<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.420> we're

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
pretty hopeless so anyway I thought I'd

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.580

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.639 
because we're kind of was moving around
him<00:01:42.119> around<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> house<00:01:42.720> trying<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.259> find<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
him around the house trying to find a

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.920 
him around the house trying to find a
place<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:43.890> him<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> fit<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.600> we

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
place for him to fit in because we

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.859 
place for him to fit in because we
weren't<00:01:46.110> expecting<00:01:46.409> him<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.329> has<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> be

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
weren't expecting him so and I has to be

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
weren't expecting him so and I has to be
honest<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.290> pretty<00:01:49.560> full<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.979> cages<00:01:50.490> there's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
honest is pretty full of cages there's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.069 
honest is pretty full of cages there's
not<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.149> any<00:01:51.420> room<00:01:52.490> particularly<00:01:54.079> so

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
not really any room particularly so

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.209 
not really any room particularly so
we're<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.259> kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.619> moving<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:55.979> cage

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
we're just kind of moving this cage

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.120 
we're just kind of moving this cage
around<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.729> seeing<00:01:56.880> where<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.360> fit<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.719> in

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
around and seeing where we can fit it in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
around and seeing where we can fit it in
so<00:01:59.130> he's<00:01:59.310> now<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.729> three<00:01:59.969> by<00:02:00.119> three<00:02:00.149> instead

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so he's now in a three by three instead

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810 
so he's now in a three by three instead
of<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.020> two<00:02:01.200> by<00:02:01.380> four<00:02:01.409> which<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.280> same<00:02:02.460> size

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
of a two by four which is the same size

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.240 
of a two by four which is the same size
just<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.329> square<00:02:03.780> rather<00:02:04.140> than<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.560> rectangle

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
just to square rather than a rectangle

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.880 
just to square rather than a rectangle
and<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:06.750> seems<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.439> lot<00:02:07.619> bigger

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
and this one actually seems a lot bigger

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.850 
and this one actually seems a lot bigger
I<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:09.030> how<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.750> works<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.679> seems

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
I don't know how that works but it seems

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.330 
I don't know how that works but it seems
like<00:02:10.950> he's<00:02:11.160> got<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.580> lot<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:11.819> floor<00:02:12.300> space

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
like he's got a lot more floor space

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.190 
like he's got a lot more floor space
so<00:02:14.090> I'll<00:02:14.450> just<00:02:14.480> show<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.400> thing<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.989> under

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
so I'll just show you the thing so under

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.420 
so I'll just show you the thing so under
there<00:02:18.349> he's<00:02:18.560> got<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.709> litter<00:02:18.920> tray<00:02:19.220> we're

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
there he's got a litter tray we're

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.830 
there he's got a litter tray we're
trying<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.819> lose<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.060> train<00:02:20.300> him<00:02:20.540> it's<00:02:20.780> not

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
trying to lose to train him it's not

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.290 
trying to lose to train him it's not
working<00:02:21.349> very<00:02:21.379> well<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.099> think<00:02:22.819> we<00:02:22.970> gave<00:02:23.120> him

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
working very well I think we gave him

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.509 
working very well I think we gave him
too<00:02:23.510> much<00:02:23.540> freedom<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.230> begin<00:02:24.500> with<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:24.890> he's

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
too much freedom to begin with so he's

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:26.740 
too much freedom to begin with so he's
just<00:02:25.550> been<00:02:25.819> kind<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.060> peeing<00:02:26.330> all<00:02:26.510> over<00:02:26.540> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
just been kind of peeing all over the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.960 
just been kind of peeing all over the
house<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.319> think<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.040> need<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.220> start<00:02:28.610> small

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
house I think you need to start small

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.800 
house I think you need to start small
and<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:29.360> as<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:29.959> get<00:02:30.080> better<00:02:30.260> work<00:02:31.099> it<00:02:31.340> up

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
and then as they get better work it up

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.990 
and then as they get better work it up
but<00:02:32.810> at<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.049> same<00:02:33.230> time<00:02:33.470> he's<00:02:33.799> not<00:02:34.129> been

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
but at the same time he's not been

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.850 
but at the same time he's not been
altered<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.840> it's<00:02:36.110> going<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.290> be<00:02:36.379> really<00:02:36.590> hard

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
altered so it's going to be really hard

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.559 
altered so it's going to be really hard
to<00:02:36.920> let<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.310> train<00:02:37.549> him<00:02:37.640> anyway<00:02:38.060> until<00:02:38.269> he's

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
to let you train him anyway until he's

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.039 
to let you train him anyway until he's
had<00:02:38.599> his<00:02:38.810> operation<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.790> um<00:02:41.090> yeah<00:02:41.810> there's<00:02:41.989> a

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
had his operation so um yeah there's a

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.500 
had his operation so um yeah there's a
little<00:02:42.170> tray<00:02:42.530> under<00:02:42.799> there<00:02:43.269> every<00:02:44.269> time<00:02:44.390> you

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
little tray under there every time you

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.660 
little tray under there every time you
just<00:02:44.660> push<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.680> stuff<00:02:45.890> we<00:02:46.040> put<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.340> in<00:02:46.459> there

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
just push and stuff we put it in there

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.160 
just push and stuff we put it in there
so<00:02:46.910> hopefully<00:02:47.030> here<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.569> they<00:02:47.690> see<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.989> hot

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
so hopefully here as they see it hot

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
is much higher but I'm hoping at some

is much higher but I'm hoping at some
point<00:03:58.040> he'll<00:03:58.220> work<00:03:58.430> out<00:03:58.639> that's<00:03:58.880> up<00:03:59.150> there

it's really good for bunnies to be able

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.120 
it's really good for bunnies to be able
to<00:04:02.150> hop<00:04:02.359> around<00:04:02.569> and<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:03.620> was<00:04:03.739> strengthened

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
to hop around and it was strengthened

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.940 
to hop around and it was strengthened
his<00:04:04.250> back<00:04:04.430> legs<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:04.910> obviously<00:04:05.560> natural<00:04:06.560> for

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
his back legs and obviously natural for

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.190 
his back legs and obviously natural for
him<00:04:07.069> to<00:04:07.130> be<00:04:07.459> able<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.819> have<00:04:07.910> places<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.389> hop<00:04:08.750> so

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
him to be able to have places to hop so

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.349 
him to be able to have places to hop so
I'd<00:04:09.950> quite<00:04:10.160> like<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.370> if<00:04:10.549> you<00:04:10.639> did<00:04:10.669> hopping<00:04:11.180> up

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
I'd quite like it if you did hopping up

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.300 
I'd quite like it if you did hopping up
and<00:04:11.690> down<00:04:11.810> off<00:04:12.139> there<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:14.290> that's<00:04:15.290> just<00:04:15.380> seeing

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
and down off there so that's just seeing

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.509 
and down off there so that's just seeing
secrets<00:04:16.789> with<00:04:17.120> some<00:04:17.560> cardboard<00:04:18.560> that's<00:04:19.280> been

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
secrets with some cardboard that's been

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.490 
secrets with some cardboard that's been
capable<00:04:19.760> tied<00:04:20.090> on<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.959> might<00:04:21.139> put<00:04:21.320> some

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
capable tied on and I might put some

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.010 
capable tied on and I might put some
fleece<00:04:21.709> or<00:04:21.919> something<00:04:22.280> over<00:04:22.520> there<00:04:22.700> later<00:04:23.020> but

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
fleece or something over there later but

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.550 
fleece or something over there later but
I'll<00:04:24.110> see<00:04:24.349> how<00:04:24.469> it<00:04:24.620> goes<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:25.099> make

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
I'll see how it goes it make

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.290 
I'll see how it goes it make
temporary<00:04:26.630> thingy<00:04:27.950> so<00:04:28.950> that's<00:04:29.310> k<00:04:29.730> just<00:04:30.090> step

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
temporary thingy so that's k just step

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.409 
temporary thingy so that's k just step
back<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:32.700> quite<00:04:32.880> like<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.150> way<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.389> looks

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
back and quite like the way it looks

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.320 
back and quite like the way it looks
today<00:04:33.810> actually<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.410> looks<00:04:34.530> quite<00:04:34.770> colorful

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
today actually it looks quite colorful

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.820 
today actually it looks quite colorful
and<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.660> think<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.930> looks<00:04:36.960> much<00:04:37.260> bigger<00:04:37.470> now

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
and I think it looks much bigger now

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.710 
and I think it looks much bigger now
