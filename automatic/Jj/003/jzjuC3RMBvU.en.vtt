00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the page file that's on the server or

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
the page file that's on the server or
the<00:00:53.309> workstation<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> total<00:00:55.020> size

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the workstation this is the total size

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.529 
the workstation this is the total size
of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> pagefile<00:00:55.890> 2.7<00:00:56.789> gigabytes<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
of the pagefile 2.7 gigabytes and this

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.900 
of the pagefile 2.7 gigabytes and this
is<00:00:57.690> how<00:00:57.809> much<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.730> that's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
is how much is actually in you so that's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.779 
is how much is actually in you so that's
virtual<00:01:00.600> ram<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> right<00:01:02.219> hand<00:01:02.399> side<00:01:02.489> we

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
virtual ram on the right hand side we

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.690 
virtual ram on the right hand side we
see<00:01:02.820> cash<00:01:03.420> information<00:01:04.250> that's<00:01:05.250> memory

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
see cash information that's memory

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
see cash information that's memory
that's<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.750> being<00:01:06.930> used<00:01:07.229> for<00:01:07.350> system

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that's just being used for system

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.580 
that's just being used for system

physical amount of RAM that's being used

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.560 
physical amount of RAM that's being used
it's<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.950> virtual<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.610> being<00:01:44.880> part<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.329> the

it's not virtual not being part of the

page file so this is the physical RAM
currently<00:01:48.840> 19<00:01:49.259> megabytes<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.600> an

currently 19 megabytes so that's an

double-click on the memory right here

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.600
