00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.469
 she uses less on the song I am 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.250
 already set with colorful farm accents 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.780
 just in the fall I totally care for it and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.309
 This palette is very welcome 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.379

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.620
 still and the colors really have one 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.629
 very very good quality so who on

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.600
 wonderful beautiful reddish color on the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.770
 lips is very light and I think 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.530
 Just when I tell you if I have something like that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.659
 I feel the libdems on it 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.189
 so not as if I had nothing on the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.590
 lips come from as I think so 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.680
 super enjoyable i am just back 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.210

 Here you get very cheap white for 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.200
 199 will just give it a try 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.090
 want it to be very well suited for that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.650

 said if I was happy to fill in 199 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.820
 think so you can not go wrong 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.200
 Just have a look as well 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.299
 stay with the lips and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.189

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.789
 I also like talking super awesome 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.730

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.230
 always 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.020
 I have ordered this now at Amazon 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.480
 it also been a while ago and use it 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.340
 still very much like next 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.160
 something I get to the hair 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.010
 use under the shower and that is 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.230
 that of l'oreal average a mask the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.670
 I really am still under hair 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.370
 short to the average of the water 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.470
 spray all over my hair so full 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.750
 especially the tips not so much the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.489
 approach but rather downwards and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.020
 that is very short act the minute 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.500
 and feel it out and the hair is 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.450
 I know I'm pretty dry 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.580
 hair is very very thick, too 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.310
 is also very dry and that with it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.520
 my hair really stays up to 23 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.720
 nice and shiny these days 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.980
 not at all dry out so me 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.560
 Use is very much like 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.360
 just under the shower i find it 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.700
 Although practically with the spray head so 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.989
 who looked for a good hamas the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.790
 I can absolutely recommend 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.370
 next we come to a person 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.320
 Although this test how would you 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.040
 By the way, I sent it to me 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.950
 So test 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.750
 I found the right one very fresh 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.630
 bit girl has a little bit cute though 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.370
 rather fresh can be so rather than 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.860
 when you're fresh out of the shower 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.330
 got out so very nice for 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.280
 those who want to take a fresh revenge 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.780
 I'm more of a person, even if it's in 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.730
 direction autumn I like more 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.920
 female heavy sweetish likely 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.040
 That's why I'm not that serious 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.180
 fresh fragrance type but for those who 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.159
 to find that beautiful 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.900
 Highly recommended the flash is 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.609
 it's just so beautiful 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.650
 key in what I find full sweet 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.680
 So you can lose weight so give away 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.060
 also super super so well suited 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.560
 also for every run the beaver or 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.500
 it certainly is a cool one 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.090
 gift tip yes otherwise the fragrance 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.250
 stays on the skin longer than the skin 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.560
 micky nicki minaj for example priced 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.329
 the two are equal to 30 euros and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.859
 So that's why I would rather buy the 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.170
 If I want a fragrance longer 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.329
 remains as that of niki mio where the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.849
 also very nice smells but as I said 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:15.480
 not so long remains a good one 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:18.599
 couple of what's priced okay for that 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.310
 Duration of the skin remains and where 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:23.310
 Now you can only get one 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.080
 infobox and yes so for all the above 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.340
 just think about buying yourself 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.919
 play it up and look like that 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.830
 often developed there so last but not least 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.729
 Let's come to this chain here and that 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.020
 although I asked in a lot of videos 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.039
 where I got my chain that is 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.740
 By the way, another 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.720
 I have such a similar something 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.180
 is shorter then gets paid 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.680
 already for a very long time and you almost have 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.330
 in every video that's why I became 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.000
 very often asked the chain answers 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.199
 this so nice and so on and so forth 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.139
 now here would have to say mine 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.210
 kesha is made of real gold and that's why 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.260
 was also a bit more expensive than 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.940
 These ones 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.590
 That's why I'm looking for a cheap one 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.150
 completely sought after alternatives and I am just 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.240
 for me is real with myself 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.820
 real gold plated and costs 59 euros 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.610
 my costs about 120 euros and me 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.349
 think this is a good alternative 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.120
 Now I have to say I have it 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.500
 I showered I slept 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.659
 overused to the point of no more 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.090
 I'm 100 percent behind the 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.590
 did not scratch those who did not fade 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.759
 the color in you have nothing i mean 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.250
 It's also a real gold hit 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:31.440
 that's why I have to say top quality 1 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.789
 I have chosen is because as the 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.280
 also in her short shock for you 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.960
 he can speak offers this is mine 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.789
 yakuza fig for this month 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.320
 I know many they wanted and wanted 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.639
 That's why I never thought I would 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.129
 a 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.349
 the painter would have been similar and I am just 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:47.030
 5 so I hope you like it 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.770
 for all the security for this chain 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.689
