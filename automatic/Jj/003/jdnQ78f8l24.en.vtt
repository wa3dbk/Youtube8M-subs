but<00:02:10.569> when<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.869> watch<00:02:11.019> it<00:02:11.049> go<00:02:11.230> up<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.470> hill<00:02:11.620> we

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
but when you watch it go up the hill we

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.009 
but when you watch it go up the hill we
don't<00:02:11.830> know<00:02:11.890> why<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.099> cost<00:02:12.430> $30,000<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:13.810> just

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
don't know why it cost $30,000 it's just

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.979 
don't know why it cost $30,000 it's just
it's<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.830> gnarly<00:02:15.819> mmm<00:02:16.450> like<00:02:16.570> people<00:02:16.840> aren't

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
it's so gnarly mmm like people aren't

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:28.710 
it's so gnarly mmm like people aren't
ready<00:02:17.230> for<00:02:17.290> this

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720 

roughly<00:02:29.720> at<00:02:29.840> about<00:02:30.110> 9,000<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.130> 10,000<00:02:31.700> feet

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
roughly at about 9,000 to 10,000 feet

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.970 
roughly at about 9,000 to 10,000 feet
and<00:02:32.090> today<00:02:32.930> we<00:02:33.170> are<00:02:33.290> doing<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.650> bunch<00:02:33.770> of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
and today we are doing a bunch of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.970 
and today we are doing a bunch of
product<00:02:34.670> testing<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.810> o<00:02:35.840> 8<00:02:36.140> artic<00:02:36.500> cat<00:02:36.530> m8

product testing on the o 8 artic cat m8
sleds<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.610> we<00:02:38.060> have<00:02:38.210> all<00:02:38.510> four<00:02:38.840> stages<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.790> our

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
sleds and we have all four stages of our

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.840 
sleds and we have all four stages of our
performance<00:02:41.300> levels<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.410> we<00:02:42.500> offer

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
performance levels that that we offer

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.320 
performance levels that that we offer
what<00:02:43.850> we've<00:02:44.000> got<00:02:44.180> here<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:45.010> 2008<00:02:46.010> stocks<00:02:46.580> m8

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
what we've got here is a 2008 stocks m8

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.570 
what we've got here is a 2008 stocks m8
i<00:02:47.570> mean<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:47.930> requests<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.620> be<00:02:48.770> ridden<00:02:49.280> at<00:02:49.430> this

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
i mean is requests to be ridden at this

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.910 
i mean is requests to be ridden at this
elevation<00:02:49.940> 9,000<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.690> 10,000<00:02:51.230> feet<00:02:51.350> from

elevation 9,000 to 10,000 feet from

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.020 
elevation 9,000 to 10,000 feet from
there<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:52.190> is<00:02:52.340> basically<00:02:52.580> our<00:02:52.670> baseline

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
there this is basically our baseline

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.400 
there this is basically our baseline
setup<00:02:53.390> for<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.720> testing<00:02:54.050> we're<00:02:54.140> gonna<00:02:54.230> be

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
setup for the testing we're gonna be

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.650 
setup for the testing we're gonna be
doing<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:55.580> know<00:02:55.610> all<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:55.970> comparisons<00:02:56.540> and

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
doing you know all the comparisons and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.880 
doing you know all the comparisons and
everything<00:02:56.930> we<00:02:57.050> do<00:02:57.170> once<00:02:57.350> we<00:02:57.440> think<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:57.740> got

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
everything we do once we think we got

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.620 
everything we do once we think we got
something<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.160> works<00:02:58.370> good<00:02:58.580> this<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.480> what

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
something that works good this is what

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.940 
something that works good this is what
we<00:02:59.720> compare<00:03:00.050> it<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.350> make<00:03:00.500> sure<00:03:00.650> we<00:03:00.800> are

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
we compare it to to make sure we are

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.710 
we compare it to to make sure we are
doing<00:03:00.980> better<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.700> know<00:03:01.820> we're<00:03:02.180> making<00:03:02.450> it

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
doing better you know we're making it

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.420 
doing better you know we're making it
better<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.800> what<00:03:03.950> we<00:03:04.040> let<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.280> producer

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
better this is what we let the producer

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.040 
better this is what we let the producer
ride<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.090> doesn't<00:03:05.300> get<00:03:05.390> away<00:03:05.570> from<00:03:07.870> here<00:03:08.870> we

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
ride so it doesn't get away from here we

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.810 
ride so it doesn't get away from here we
basically<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:09.500> our<00:03:09.530> stage<00:03:09.800> 1<00:03:10.010> kit<00:03:10.220> it's<00:03:10.580> got

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
basically have our stage 1 kit it's got

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.800 
basically have our stage 1 kit it's got
one<00:03:11.360> of<00:03:11.450> Eric's

balloon doctor fuel controller this is
what<00:03:21.380> we<00:03:21.470> classify<00:03:21.920> as<00:03:22.100> our<00:03:22.250> stage<00:03:22.459> 1<00:03:22.700> kit<00:03:22.970> it's

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
what we classify as our stage 1 kit it's

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.240 
what we classify as our stage 1 kit it's
an<00:03:23.420> entry<00:03:23.750> level<00:03:23.780> good<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:24.830> safe<00:03:25.040> it's

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
an entry level good it's safe it's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.860 
an entry level good it's safe it's
reliable<00:03:25.760> but<00:03:26.240> it<00:03:26.300> will<00:03:26.360> all<00:03:26.450> perform<00:03:26.780> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
reliable but it will all perform the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.510 
reliable but it will all perform the
stock<00:03:27.050> sled<00:03:27.260> all<00:03:27.380> day<00:03:27.530> long<00:03:27.709> actually<00:03:28.280> what

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
stock sled all day long actually what

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.980 
stock sled all day long actually what
we're<00:03:28.640> here<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.880> do<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.120> prove<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.660> what<00:03:29.810> he

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
we're here to do is prove just what he

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.260 
we're here to do is prove just what he
said<00:03:30.020> that<00:03:30.650> will<00:03:31.070> outperform<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.730> stock

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
said that will outperform a stock

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.340 
said that will outperform a stock
so<00:03:32.450> we're<00:03:32.570> gonna<00:03:32.690> run<00:03:32.900> it<00:03:32.989> through<00:03:33.080> a<00:03:33.170> series

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
so we're gonna run it through a series

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.400 
so we're gonna run it through a series
of<00:03:33.470> comparative<00:03:34.400> tests<00:03:34.760> both<00:03:34.959> drag<00:03:35.959> racing<00:03:36.290> on

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
of comparative tests both drag racing on

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.860 
of comparative tests both drag racing on
flats<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:37.040> on<00:03:37.880> track<00:03:38.239> snow<00:03:38.420> which<00:03:38.660> you'll<00:03:38.840> see

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
flats in on track snow which you'll see

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.360 
flats in on track snow which you'll see
a<00:03:39.050> little<00:03:39.200> later<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.590> then<00:03:39.739> in<00:03:39.860> some<00:03:40.070> climbs

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
a little later and then in some climbs

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.400 
a little later and then in some climbs
and<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.300> think<00:03:41.510> that's<00:03:41.630> really<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:41.989> key<00:03:42.170> thing

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
and I think that's really the key thing

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.900 
and I think that's really the key thing
is<00:03:42.590> trying<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:42.980> beat<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.280> use<00:03:43.400> demand<00:03:43.730> of<00:03:43.850> the

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
is trying to beat the use demand of the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.910 
is trying to beat the use demand of the
rider<00:03:44.120> out<00:03:44.360> here<00:03:44.600> everybody<00:03:45.560> rides<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.830> little

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
rider out here everybody rides a little

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.780 
rider out here everybody rides a little
different<00:03:46.310> we're<00:03:46.400> trying<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.670> make<00:03:46.760> sure

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
different we're trying to make sure

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.759 
different we're trying to make sure
these<00:03:46.970> packages<00:03:47.420> work<00:03:47.540> for<00:03:47.750> everybody<00:03:48.050> it's<00:03:48.620> a
