00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.600
 he 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.020
 today talk about sundown audio sa 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.329
 12 of the first version why is it a speaker 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.550
 legendary and why now he is small 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.790
 relevant well and let's a little history 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.059
 this speaker appeared in those times it 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.089
 were 2000 at the time when in the pelvis 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.030
 was little developed and while not 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.410
 It was a particularly worthy competitor to him then 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.300
 have this speaker when it came on 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.690
 market on our russian yes of course 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.600
 dynamics just a bomb because he has 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.090
 600 watt he has pretty 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.039
 powerful magnet in general the type of speaker 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.610
 looks aggressive and the speaker is real 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.250
 tumbled down 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.679
 whether the speaker is real and when it is not 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.720
 competitors and really dynamics knocks 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.929
 of course everything is under demand when 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.960
 especially the games have nothing to choose 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:20.780
 so go-go records mad 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.610
 housing speaker really worth holding 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.770
 power with proper use it 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.579
 gave very high results exactly 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.759
 on them on these speakers from the series well and 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.070
 back koch is also an old version of people 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.310
 There were such results that in those years 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.009
 even now these are quite good results 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.240
 time you would be easier crazy results 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.509
 so all sandalwood on audio like on 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.640
 To hearing, even now people still have to 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.280
 those who adhere to this brand let's 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.710
 in short about the speaker well suspension but 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.270
 foam rubber diffuser paper especially not here 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.329
 nothing so much speaker dynamics especially 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.560
 normally sewed bringing and immediately a couple 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.880
 words about summing up the last time they 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.929
 have become very often 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.260
 cut short i don't know either 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.790
 Mows someone wanted to know likely 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.780
 it still depends on the most still 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.640
 owners because if the owner 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.530
 of course heaps heaps in the clip 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.320
 excess of course of course burns out 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.790
 failing because marriage and me personally but 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.850
 I do not know how much you read the reviews 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.170
 there are few mostly 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.210
 burns lead-in from the people 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.370
 just hell it pour it speaker 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.040
 the speaker is of course holding the power but still 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.900
 it gives you anyway itâ€™s not for you 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.700
 some kind of zhetka this is just a series 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.740
 people take a series of tumble it into 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.050
 clip reel hold holds 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.390
 holding and just letting does not hold 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.860
 all cathedral speaker is not bad this is the first 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.630
 the version ie the speaker is not for how much 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.130
 already years but it is clear that he was battered 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.600
 where many lives already stood here 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.910
 the basket is so tacky that is not 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.800
 the magnet is interesting to me that is the speaker behind 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.310
 the coil is not for and 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.960
 considered a kind of coil she was there too 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.130
 such a lively color but cleat as always 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.750
 and of course we have 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.100
 the rings there we are not visible under beautifully 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.750
 Overlay ie understand at the time 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.620
 when the speaker appeared dynamics really 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.230
 looked fugen 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.940
 but now there looks nice by the way in 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.550
 what is the difference from the example the first version from 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.630
 the rest there are 2 there but yes there is 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.240
 second and third version 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.510
 what is the difference in general differences not only in 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.850
 magnet chromed and slightly 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.090
 modified cooling system but i also 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.250
 in the stitched suspension and by the way there by the suspension 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.600
 blacker when blacker weights 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.360
 aggressive is black stitched 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.940
 suspension even in another form you are not 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.680
 wrong but new drafts he was only 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.140
 on aggressive well and so the difference in general 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.470
 There is no special old and new version of them on 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.240
 it remains the same all too 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.610
 but I want to tell everyone a little more 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.860
 speaker really good good speaker 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.570
 with proper use, it will 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.570
 very good play long serve you 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.530
 again if you know how to use it 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.150
 you can put results on it 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.590
 small you can ride buzz vatnikov 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.450
 blue but there is one but it is always there 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.600
 so the dynamics i can say is one 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.400
 big minus is its price cost 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.250
 This speaker is now on a new course 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.750
 sixteen and a half thousand rubles 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.510
 have you understand sixteen with 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.450
 half a thousand rubles for 12 inches 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.560
 coil two and a half inches nominal 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.840
 600 watts yes of course this speaker is good 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.880
 but it's not worth the money 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.940
 the moment when it cost around 10,000 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.490
 rubles 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.320
 and when there were no competitors, you can 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.580
 was to take this speaker you will see something 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.830
 still take stendal 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.070
 it's as if you take the right brand and take 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.470
 Ponte and immediately the speaker is also not his 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.040
 there is a combination of Ponte evolve in one 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.860
 speakers 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.670
 but this moment has a lot 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.890
 competitors 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.440
 same alphard same project and build 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.540
 there is much better example this is china all 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.090
 probably knows about the magnetic gap with 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.000
 series about his sensitivity 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.220
 a little jock something about him knows that what 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.050
 in short can tell from them to you 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.300
 details that this speaker is already moving away 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.360
 as if from one goes no 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.130
 people get out on listens get high but already 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.050
 there is no such demand why when 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.700
 take the example of passing you a series behind this 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.890
 so what kind of money can you take 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.170
 project bb series understand that 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.510
 three inch coil face value and a half 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.390
 thousands and a half thousand because it may 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.250
 almost like a hand-made grid with 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.570
 American components but it's like 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.490
 example or you can take some 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.190
 alfar is different and 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.620
 take sandal for this money but no longer 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.730
 reason can say so and so these 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.919
 speakers slowly 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.090
 drop in demand even people who take 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.750
 they understand that you can take more 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.820
 slightly better and sell them so 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.940
 sandals quietly well as they do not go away 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.280
 but it is from the series that it certainly lags behind 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.700
 there would be at least a plan price lower times 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.130
 in 2 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.210
 then one could choose a in this one 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:10.570
 case processes but you can fail 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.850
 totals speaker legendary with that not 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.470
 I bet the speaker really showed he 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.110
 established himself showed a lot 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.330
 good speaker results good on 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.940
 everyday pretty good build 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.300
 but not relevant this again as 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.220
 pass the talk in proscar's test 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.100
 review that this dynamic is not really 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.540
 relevant in for the money you can take 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:37.480
 the speakers are much better head and shoulders above 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:42.669
 why spend more if you can take 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:45.400
 Something better therefore prices with a series 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:48.640
 good speaker but very expensive 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.130
 if you should not take it, think for yourself 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.540
 if you and desire you want to take well 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.050
 take 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.660
 but if you are faced with a choice to take 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.070
 something sandalwood or sandalwood example 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.330
 either take some other example here 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.810
 project b series either 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:07.120
 unfamiliar alphard thread I would not advise 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.550
 its because it's really taking a new one 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.820
 the dynamics of 16 captive thousands of this one I would not 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.820
 has become 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.130
 not sandal 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:59.850
 like suzuki 0 no suzuki like
