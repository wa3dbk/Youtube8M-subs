00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.190
 flattened on one side of the ball 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.870

 bomb and you just apply it on the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.689
 flattened mark of your orange ball 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.330
 after that you come to work your 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.420
 yellow paste to form the nose of 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.070
 Pikachu 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.110
 I invite you to see my rate 2 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.770
 pikachu to know a little more about 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.770
 this technique 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.979
 then we will take care of the eyes of 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.570
 magic has so simply you 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.619
 shoot down those two little bits of movies 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.250
 white that you have to 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.020
 the location of the eyes and you come 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.259
 spend a little bit of two black films at 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.259
 center 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.299
 then a lot of pudding two movies 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.609
 to the yellows you're going to apply on 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.770
 the sides of the head and you go in 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.710
 wiggle the end to form the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.609
 species of mustache magic because for 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.740
 the eyes I invite you to go 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.420
 also see my pikachu rate and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.280
 I simply add a little bit of 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.780
 chocolate films down the eye because 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.060
 that I found it a little bit more cute 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.170
 but it's optional of course then 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.000
 you come to make small marks 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.700
 high your timpul back to place the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.319
 eyes opposes an investment and we will come 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.390
 to do the little is so you take a 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.290
 little bit of black movies that you 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.090
 go to the top of the nose at this 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.250
 moment there you mix the patrol 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.230
 and credentials to obtain the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.970
 pink and you're going rolled up finally sausage 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.099

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.819
 yellow paste then connect the two 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.319
 ends of the pink pudding and now 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.420
 we will take care of the small cheekbones 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.120
 red pikachu so you flatten 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 red paste and apply it 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.629
 now we will take care of the ears 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.430

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.290

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.590
 and now will come to take care of the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.090
 fin of carp magic so you 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.860
 flatten yellow fimo and we're going 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.050
 come and give it the shape of the fin 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.150
 so you refine one end and 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.520
 the other you will come traced 3 ridge 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.930
 by cutting into the dough to plant a 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.910
 little bit of cloud and had two teeth 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.300

 the orange dough and you're going to come the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.150
 cut into a v-shape and then place yourself 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.959
 in the space that we have just cut 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.750
 a little white paste given a good 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.580

 head 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.190
 after that you just dig a little 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.350
 hole under the head and you will put 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.970

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 magicka and especially cut so 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.100

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.860
 give the impression that there is a 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.720
