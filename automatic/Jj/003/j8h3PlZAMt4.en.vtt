if they have a lot of brown spots that's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.789 
if they have a lot of brown spots that's
good<00:01:24.659> because<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> means<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> starches

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
good because it means that the starches

great<00:02:12.740> main<00:02:13.280> concern<00:02:13.640> with<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:13.880> lifestyle

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
great main concern with this lifestyle

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.490 
great main concern with this lifestyle
and<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.600> question<00:02:14.900> that<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.050> get<00:02:15.140> asked<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
and the question that I get asked the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.040 
and the question that I get asked the
most<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:15.890> how<00:02:16.700> do<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.850> get<00:02:16.940> my<00:02:17.270> protein<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.020> I

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
most is how do I get my protein and do I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.570 
most is how do I get my protein and do I
get<00:02:18.260> enough<00:02:18.470> protein<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.190> where's<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
get enough protein and where's the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.790 
get enough protein and where's the
protein<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.720> will<00:02:20.930> link<00:02:21.050> videos<00:02:21.380> related<00:02:21.710> to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
protein I will link videos related to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.140 
protein I will link videos related to
protein<00:02:22.130> there<00:02:22.280> below<00:02:22.490> so<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:22.730> guys<00:02:22.790> can<00:02:22.910> get

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
protein there below so you guys can get

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.330 
protein there below so you guys can get
a<00:02:23.180> more<00:02:23.330> in-depth<00:02:23.780> overview<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> but

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
a more in-depth overview of it but

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.700 
a more in-depth overview of it but
basically<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.270> only<00:02:26.420> need<00:02:26.720> 2<00:02:26.990> point<00:02:27.230> 5<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.560> 5

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
basically you only need 2 point 5 to 5

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.560 
basically you only need 2 point 5 to 5
percent<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.340> your<00:02:28.460> total<00:02:28.700> calories<00:02:28.970> from

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
percent of your total calories from

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.150 
percent of your total calories from
protein<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:30.110> can<00:02:30.170> very<00:02:30.470> easily<00:02:30.680> get<00:02:30.950> that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
protein you can very easily get that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.980 
protein you can very easily get that
from<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.550> lifestyle<00:02:32.030> from<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.360> fruits<00:02:32.660> and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
from this lifestyle from the fruits and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.050 
from this lifestyle from the fruits and
all<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.860> carbs<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.400> cooked<00:02:34.640> carbs

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
all the carbs the cooked carbs

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.220 
all the carbs the cooked carbs
everything<00:02:36.610> combined<00:02:37.610> can<00:02:38.390> easily<00:02:38.900> make<00:02:39.080> up

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
everything combined can easily make up

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.410 
everything combined can easily make up
more<00:02:39.530> than<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.860> 2.5<00:02:40.459> or<00:02:40.580> 5%<00:02:40.940> it's<00:02:41.270> really

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
more than that 2.5 or 5% it's really

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.550 
more than that 2.5 or 5% it's really
important<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.780> keep<00:02:41.900> in<00:02:41.990> mind<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.410> meat

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
important to keep in mind that the meat

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.840 
important to keep in mind that the meat
and<00:02:42.650> dairy<00:02:42.680> industry<00:02:43.130> has<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.310> lot<00:02:43.490> of<00:02:43.580> impact

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
and dairy industry has a lot of impact

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.500 
and dairy industry has a lot of impact
over<00:02:44.270> what<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.410> FDA<00:02:46.220> puts<00:02:46.670> out<00:02:46.880> obviously

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
over what the FDA puts out obviously

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.910 
over what the FDA puts out obviously
they're<00:02:47.660> gonna<00:02:47.750> want<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.110> make<00:02:48.260> more<00:02:48.470> money<00:02:48.650> so

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
they're gonna want to make more money so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.020 
they're gonna want to make more money so
they're<00:02:49.040> going<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.370> say<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.700> need<00:02:49.880> more

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
they're going to say that you need more

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.670 
they're going to say that you need more
protein<00:02:50.360> than<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:50.989> in<00:02:51.230> reality<00:02:51.560> you're

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
protein than you do in reality you're

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.990 
protein than you do in reality you're
really<00:02:51.920> high<00:02:52.040> protein<00:02:52.250> diet<00:02:52.610> can<00:02:52.790> lead<00:02:52.910> to

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
really high protein diet can lead to

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.120 
really high protein diet can lead to
osteoporosis<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:54.080> other<00:02:54.290> kinds<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.800> diseases

and stuff that you can easily avoid if

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.560 
and stuff that you can easily avoid if
you<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:58.100> choose<00:02:58.370> another<00:02:58.790> option<00:02:59.000> people

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
you just choose another option people

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.360 
documentaries about the meat and dairy
industry<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.290> can<00:03:06.470> see<00:03:06.620> how<00:03:06.800> terrible<00:03:07.250> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
industry you can see how terrible the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.040 
industry you can see how terrible the
conditions<00:03:07.820> are<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.480> animals<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.870> put

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
conditions are that the animals I put

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.360 
conditions are that the animals I put
there<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.320> important<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.709> remember<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.070> what

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
there is important to remember that what

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.979 
there is important to remember that what
you<00:03:10.430> pay<00:03:10.610> for<00:03:10.640> you're<00:03:11.120> voting<00:03:11.450> for<00:03:11.480> basically

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
you pay for you're voting for basically

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.530 
you pay for you're voting for basically
so<00:03:12.410> if<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:13.100> buy<00:03:13.280> meat<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.880> are<00:03:13.910> supporting

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
so if you buy meat you are supporting

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.780 
so if you buy meat you are supporting
that<00:03:14.720> industry<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:16.070> treatment<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.640> those
