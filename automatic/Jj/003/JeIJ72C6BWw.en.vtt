cheerfully I can see right here where my
finger<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.269> at<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.420> frame<00:02:49.690> her<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.730> that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
finger is at the frame her the that

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.059 
finger is at the frame her the that
shackle<00:02:52.060> bracket<00:02:52.599> is<00:02:52.720> cracked<00:02:53.019> also<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:56.069> my

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
shackle bracket is cracked also so my

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.009 
shackle bracket is cracked also so my
first<00:02:57.400> thoughts<00:02:58.319> is<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.239> main<00:03:01.510> leaf<00:03:01.750> has

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
first thoughts is that the main leaf has

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.589 
first thoughts is that the main leaf has
been<00:03:02.230> case<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.420> too<00:03:04.630> long<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:07.420> got

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
been case and it's too long and it's got

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.710 
been case and it's too long and it's got
that<00:03:07.780> all<00:03:07.959> beat<00:03:08.200> up<00:03:08.380> in<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:08.709> like<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:09.069> so

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
that all beat up in there like that so

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.910 
that all beat up in there like that so
I'm<00:03:10.720> gonna<00:03:10.870> have<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:13.500> show<00:03:14.500> this<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.829> the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
I'm gonna have to show this to the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.000 
I'm gonna have to show this to the
customer<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.690> see<00:03:17.200> what<00:03:17.380> they<00:03:17.530> want<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.799> do

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
customer and see what they want to do

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.420 
customer and see what they want to do
but<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.900> would<00:03:19.900> have<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.170> measure<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:20.709> main

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
but I would have to measure this main

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.160 
but I would have to measure this main
leaf<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:22.030> see<00:03:22.180> if<00:03:22.269> it's<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.540> right<00:03:22.690> leaf<00:03:22.959> or

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
leaf and see if it's the right leaf or

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.099 
leaf and see if it's the right leaf or
not<00:03:23.730> because<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.940> looks<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:25.359> me<00:03:25.510> like<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:25.989> too

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
not because it looks to me like it's too

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.250 
not because it looks to me like it's too
long<00:03:26.730> it's<00:03:27.730> got<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:28.090> shackle<00:03:28.420> too<00:03:28.750> far<00:03:28.989> back

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
long it's got this shackle too far back

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.890 
long it's got this shackle too far back
and<00:03:29.760> it's<00:03:30.760> beating<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.120> crap<00:03:31.450> out<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
and it's beating the crap out of the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.259 
and it's beating the crap out of the
frame<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.500> I'm<00:03:32.829> not<00:03:33.010> sure<00:03:33.190> who<00:03:33.400> put<00:03:33.639> that<00:03:33.670> on<00:03:34.000> or

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
frame so I'm not sure who put that on or

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.990 
frame so I'm not sure who put that on or
what<00:03:34.510> happened<00:03:34.959> there<00:03:35.139> but<00:03:36.000> there's

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
what happened there but there's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:50.100 
what happened there but there's
definitely<00:03:37.420> an<00:03:37.480> issue<00:03:37.630> from<00:03:37.900> that

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.170
