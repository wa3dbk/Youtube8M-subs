00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.279
 I'm coming and today's recipe is pizza 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.890
 of tuna a good order at the pizza table 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:21.609
 In this great time, it's not very good. 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.179
 I at least love good pizza, which is 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:27.759
 needed for today's revenue 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:31.989
 You're going to separate two discs here from 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:35.440
 pasta is two pizza pasta is 20 grams 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.250
 olives and you can choose the green or 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.470
 black 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.450
 I chose the green if you want to mix 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.500
 also no problem 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:48.280
 chopped one can of tuna 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.600
 I would choose the natural act here. 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.710
 I have a glass of oregano 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.010
 I like tomato sauce that I have fashion 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.640
 that we prepared janÃ© with onion and 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.079
 tomato enough behind two pastas 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.560
 and 400 grams of mozzarella 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:15.400
 if you prefer to merge, you can also 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.409
 show it with the gorgonzola or with 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.170
 another cheese of your choice and can 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.110
 is mixing by putting a few slices of 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.400
 one type of cheese and the other the cheese 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.979
 of your preference 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.720
 well here I have good yellow light I go 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.950

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.100
 crunchy 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.650
 There are people who do not like it, but I 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.500
 Crunchy pizza the little secret is to catch the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.350
 pre-baked dough when you buy the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.840
 Even you do, right? 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.020
 baked goods and will take her back to 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.240
 oven to give it a light tan 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.960
 After you go to ride, then let's go. 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.680

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:59.049

 oregano and olive blend here 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:03:03.030
 then rapidly added to the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:09.930
 divine curd stirs well until it forms a 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:17.370
 cheap pasta slogan that they know cheap 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.750

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.799

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.950
 pasta in this mass, right? 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.950
 and another part in the other mass 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.590
 Add a little more oregano than 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:52.579

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:06.890
 The oven looks at something else, a little secret. 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.299
 of the pizza in a very hot hot oven 300 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.579

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:53.660
 assemble looks that separated the pieces of 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:56.000
 life, look, but if you find 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.710

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.840

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:19.640

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:22.400
 then we will try and tuna and 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:27.670
 like olive oil can also perform 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.670
 with olive oil is ideal cv with white wine 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:45.470
