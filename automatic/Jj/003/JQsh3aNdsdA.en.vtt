00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
it is really really tough and great to

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.970 
it is really really tough and great to
work<00:01:26.910> with<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.050> another<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.680> pretty

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
work with this is another of pretty

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.370 
work with this is another of pretty
amazing<00:01:29.550> characteristic<00:01:30.300> often<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.230> have<00:01:31.290> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
amazing characteristic often we have to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.110 
amazing characteristic often we have to
do<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.980> we're<00:01:32.130> using<00:01:32.340> these<00:01:32.640> over<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
do that when we're using these over the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.760 
do that when we're using these over the
edge<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.510> swimming<00:01:33.930> pool<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.200> we're<00:01:34.530> doing

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
edge of a swimming pool or we're doing

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.710 
edge of a swimming pool or we're doing
some<00:01:34.980> things<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:35.940> put<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.240> fish<00:01:36.450> things

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
some things that we put in fish things

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.040 
some things that we put in fish things
but<00:01:36.960> watch<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.380> okay<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.190> we<00:01:38.430> pick<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> up

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
but watch this okay so we pick this up

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.940 
but watch this okay so we pick this up
okay<00:01:40.050> at<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> same<00:01:40.410> time<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.530> cut<00:01:43.830> up

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
okay at the same time you can cut up

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.450 
okay at the same time you can cut up
with<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.190> knife

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
with a knife

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.310 
with a knife
so<00:01:44.790> there's<00:01:45.090> parts<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.660> a<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.930> tough<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
so there's parts of it a bit tough to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
so there's parts of it a bit tough to
get<00:01:46.470> through<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.160> same<00:01:47.370> time<00:01:47.640> simple

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
get through but at the same time simple

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.969 
get through but at the same time simple
knife<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.140> cut<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.500> block<00:01:49.830> of<00:01:50.370> material

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
knife and cut this block of material

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.310 
knife and cut this block of material
okay<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.910> whole<00:01:54.210> range<00:01:54.510> of<00:01:54.720> benchley

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
okay we have a whole range of benchley

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560 
okay we have a whole range of benchley
which<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.400> what<00:01:56.880> we've<00:01:57.060> done<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.390> make

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
which like this what we've done to make

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.330 
which like this what we've done to make
this<00:01:57.690> even<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.050> bit<00:01:58.229> stronger<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.920> put<00:01:59.160> some

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
this even a bit stronger they put some

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.850 
this even a bit stronger they put some
steel<00:01:59.700> bar<00:02:00.000> through<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.229> no<00:02:01.440> one's<00:02:01.650> gonna

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
steel bar through that so no one's gonna

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.280 
steel bar through that so no one's gonna
break<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.460> whatsoever

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
break that whatsoever

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.810 
break that whatsoever
you<00:02:04.290> made<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> clean<00:02:04.950> these<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.520> power

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

surface or a weedeater around the edges
if<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> put<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.080> graph<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.770> it's<00:02:14.190> done

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
if you put it on the graph and it's done

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.090 
if you put it on the graph and it's done
so<00:02:15.020> there's<00:02:16.020> not<00:02:16.110> really<00:02:16.170> much<00:02:16.500> more<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.890> say

the material loss will be making this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.220 
the material loss will be making this
