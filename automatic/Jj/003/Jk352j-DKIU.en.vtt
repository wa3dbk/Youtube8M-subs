what it will look like from a distance
it<00:00:39.390> looks<00:00:39.420> dayson<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.589> it's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.280> little<00:00:41.519> bit<00:00:41.640> of

the<00:01:14.850> first<00:01:15.119> step<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.690> base<00:01:15.929> the<00:01:16.380> power

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the first step is to base the power

I'm<00:01:21.930> being<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.470> messy<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.750> am

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
I'm being very messy about this as I am

I'm being very messy about this as I am
yet<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> paint<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.119> armored<00:01:27.119> parts<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.840> the

yet to paint the armored parts of the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.609 
yet to paint the armored parts of the
gun<00:01:29.180> if<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.240> were<00:01:30.540> doing<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:31.110> after

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
gun if you were doing this after

gun if you were doing this after
painting<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.490> gun<00:01:33.450> already<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:34.079> would<00:01:34.290> take<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
painting the gun already I would take a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
painting the gun already I would take a
lot<00:01:35.070> more<00:01:35.220> care<00:01:37.909> depending<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.030> consistency

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
lot more care depending on consistency

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.260 
lot more care depending on consistency
this<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.140> take<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:41.130> or<00:01:41.729> three<00:01:41.850> coats

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
this could take up to two or three coats

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.289 
this could take up to two or three coats
to<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> solid<00:01:43.200> color<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.820> solid<00:01:45.090> color

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
to get a solid color and the solid color

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:54.649 
to get a solid color and the solid color
is<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:45.720> important<00:01:51.649> in<00:01:52.649> pestilence<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.360> last

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
is very important in pestilence the last

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
is very important in pestilence the last
color<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.469> dry<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.810> start<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.469> apply<00:01:58.590> your

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
color is dry you can start to apply your

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.219 
color is dry you can start to apply your
wash

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.880 

the<00:02:05.220> idea<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:06.570> bit<00:02:07.130> heavier<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.940> cracks

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
the idea is a bit heavier in the cracks

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.040 
the idea is a bit heavier in the cracks
in<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> bit<00:02:11.130> lighter<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.180> central<00:02:12.750> upper

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
in the bit lighter in the central upper

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.780 
in the bit lighter in the central upper
area<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.890> plasma<00:02:14.130> gun<00:02:15.800> or<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.280> plasma

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
area of the plasma gun or in a plasma

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:32.260 
area of the plasma gun or in a plasma
weapon<00:02:18.270> indeed

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.510 

what<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.690> do<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.050> wipe<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.500> bit<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
what you can do is wipe a bit of the

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.220 
what you can do is wipe a bit of the
wash<00:02:35.700> off<00:02:35.910> your<00:02:35.940> brush<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:37.790> remove<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:40.200> upper

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
wash off your brush and remove the upper

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:49.860 
wash off your brush and remove the upper
areas<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:41.310> wash

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.470 

I'll<00:02:50.860> be<00:02:51.010> back<00:02:51.190> when<00:02:51.340> that's<00:02:51.550> dry<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:52.330> next

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
I'll be back when that's dry the next

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.960 
I'll be back when that's dry the next
step<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.140> step<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.160> come<00:02:54.370> back<00:02:54.640> with

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
step is it step is to come back with

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.630 
step is it step is to come back with
scratch<00:02:55.330> brown<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.920> essentially<00:02:59.250> cover<00:03:00.250> up

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
scratch brown and essentially cover up

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:37.059 
scratch brown and essentially cover up
the<00:03:01.150> inner<00:03:01.390> areas<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.440> plasma<00:03:02.890> weapon

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.459 

now<00:03:38.060> that's<00:03:38.390> done<00:03:38.629> we<00:03:38.780> can<00:03:38.959> move<00:03:38.989> on<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.290> the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:39.469 
now that's done we can move on to the

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.130 
now that's done we can move on to the
next<00:03:39.620> step<00:03:39.950> which<00:03:40.879> is<00:03:40.909> essentially<00:03:41.659> adding<00:03:42.019> a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
next step which is essentially adding a

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.619 
next step which is essentially adding a
little<00:03:42.439> bit<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:43.040> yellow<00:03:43.219> to<00:03:44.030> create<00:03:44.420> a

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
little bit of the yellow to create a

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.130 
little bit of the yellow to create a
light<00:03:44.930> orange<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:46.299> coloring<00:03:47.299> in<00:03:47.510> the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
light orange and coloring in the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:04:37.110 
light orange and coloring in the
slightly<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.430> a<00:03:49.549> pot<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.870> last<00:03:51.079> color

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.640 

after<00:04:38.120> finishing<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.600> Vivian<00:04:39.080> step<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.500> last

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
after finishing the Vivian step the last

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.810 
after finishing the Vivian step the last
step<00:04:39.890> is<00:04:40.790> to<00:04:40.850> essentially<00:04:41.690> use<00:04:42.820> a

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
step is to essentially use a

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.910 
step is to essentially use a
watered-down<00:04:44.420> red<00:04:45.230> wash<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:46.640> help<00:04:46.850> blend<00:04:47.270> the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
watered-down red wash to help blend the

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.570
