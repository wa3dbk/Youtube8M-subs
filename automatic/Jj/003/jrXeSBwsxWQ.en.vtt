here where it's fairly easy to trap this
big<00:02:41.840> daddy<00:02:42.110> because<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.840> central<00:02:44.840> area<00:02:45.050> in

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
big daddy because the central area in

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.560 
bull in one of those corridors it's
sometimes<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.910> troublesome<00:02:55.910> because<00:02:56.239> it's

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
sometimes a troublesome because it's

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.630

really hard to get the Rosie to follow
that<00:02:58.850> specific<00:02:59.330> path<00:02:59.569> she<00:02:59.870> might<00:03:00.050> take<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.290> fork

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
that specific path she might take a fork

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.910 
that specific path she might take a fork
somewhere<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:02.390> won't<00:03:02.600> trip<00:03:03.470> all<00:03:03.709> your

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
somewhere and I won't trip all your

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.970 
somewhere and I won't trip all your
wires<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:05.030> like<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.660> kind<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.110> corner<00:03:06.860> her

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
wires so I like to kind of corner her

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.770 
wires so I like to kind of corner her
into<00:03:07.220> an<00:03:07.310> area<00:03:07.489> where<00:03:07.790> she's<00:03:08.120> guaranteed<00:03:08.540> a

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
into an area where she's guaranteed a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.710 
into an area where she's guaranteed a
trip<00:03:09.019> all<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.950> wires<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.580> set<00:03:10.880> up<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.300> I

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
trip all the wires that I set up and I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.850 
trip all the wires that I set up and I
just<00:03:11.900> makes<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.290> easier<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.709> shoot<00:03:13.670> her<00:03:13.790> down

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
just makes it easier to shoot her down

just makes it easier to shoot her down
again<00:03:15.860> just<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.280> couple<00:03:16.459> RPGs<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.239> she's<00:03:17.510> gone

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190
