00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.850
 now I stand here at the rampage and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.040
 this is the girl for everything 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 once the plane has landed it 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.639
 he is responsible for 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.469
 all that happened to her us aircraft fuselage 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 and the pilots of the machine 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 will lead today and now there is yes 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.020
 a handover quite classical I hold 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 now just into the conversation 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.699
 what the gentlemen as well as chatting hello me 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.680
 admit it even with sounds that they make it very 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.590
 good with us we have no shortage 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.100
 Renewable flight plan is still active 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.160
 the current and of the weights only 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.640
 always perfect in the limits and drifted 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.739
 she was so armin that was just that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.600
 first briefing with the pilots and now 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.129
 I would always say your job 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.770
 Let's see how it is flying today 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.940
 looks like the very first ever 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.199
 I keep looking at the plane 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.910
 also the identification of the machine 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.030
 it's true because what you're into 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.800
 All loading planning all weights 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.780
 familiar of the kkm flier language kilo 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 kilo 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.020
 There is no show worldwide only 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.250
 once and as soon as everything fits then 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.070
 continue with my tour 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.080
 ok so that's the name for 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.840
 these machines of registration exactly 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.930
 like the license plate is there 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.720
 worldwide only once how much weight 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.290
 may such a plane have with it 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.479
 can still fly 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.520
 it depends on the type of aircraft at dna 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.100
 330 which we now have here but 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.920
 maximum take-off weight of 233 tons 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 my dear man yes that 's a luggage 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.259
 container of the loading we will be able to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.240
 in the plane not loaded loose because 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.310
 everything would indeed rumfliegen 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.509
 during the different flight were 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.070
 accordingly, the ice comes in 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.930
 Of course, containers also make things easier 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.490
 the work because in one blow up to 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.729
 50 pieces of luggage can be loaded 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.619
 we are inside the luggage 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.380
 so safely loaded and then there can 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.420
 nothing will break 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.430
 Now I leave here in the plane 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.470
 a very interesting cozy 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.690
 room the tail of the airbus a330 here 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.790
 All loose items of luggage come in loose 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.400
 asked for late and so for example pets 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.120
 dogs or cats as for the cabin too 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.849
 are big 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.230
 there are several guidelines that 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.940
 then come here in a dog cage 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.860
 and then be loaded here 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.390
 I am moored here nicely 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.000
 Decorated here does not burn the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.580
 this is the normal time 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.830
 pressurized cabin and it is natural 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.890
 Air-conditioned and he is fine that's it 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.970
 Good, we'll have a look again 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.580
 I convince myself again that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.360
 the water has and if he just one with 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.390
 water replenished 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.010
 many are thankful for that evening 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.959
 the exciting view behind the scenes 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.910
 Now I can have my dog â€‹â€‹in the future 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.680
 good conscience and back in the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.159
 stow space because I know you 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.870
 look very good 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.890
 then I would fire here now 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.409
 so that the plane also in time 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.420
 Thank you very much, too 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.459
 you and exactly against that now 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.379
 weights all of the mum has the finale 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.459
 closing paper with it the captain then 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.459
 can fly up
