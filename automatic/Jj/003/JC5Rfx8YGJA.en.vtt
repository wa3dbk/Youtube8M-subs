00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
build on one of your two odd bars which

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389 
build on one of your two odd bars which
mind<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.140> probably<00:01:46.560> should<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.250> that

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
mind you you probably should for that

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.819 
mind you you probably should for that
very<00:01:47.670> reason<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.560> much

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
very reason so because there is so much

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
very reason so because there is so much
solo<00:01:50.399> potential<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.270> game<00:01:51.540> while

solo potential with this game while

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.420 
solo potential with this game while

you're leveling up and the only thing

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.850 
you're leveling up and the only thing
that<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.729> actually<00:01:54.299> required<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.350> group<00:01:55.680> up

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
that it's actually required to group up

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.819 
that it's actually required to group up
for<00:01:56.159> are<00:01:56.430> those<00:01:56.939> private<00:01:57.630> instanced<00:01:58.500> group

that I've been able to solo those
low-level<00:02:46.680> world<00:02:47.040> bosses<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.670> they're<00:02:48.120> just

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
low-level world bosses and they're just

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.850 
low-level world bosses and they're just
a<00:02:48.420> hodgepodge<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:49.080> things<00:02:49.290> some<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.590> them<00:02:49.830> even

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
a hodgepodge of things some of them even

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.530 
a hodgepodge of things some of them even
melee<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.400> there<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> recurring<00:02:51.270> theme

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
melee but there is the recurring theme

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.660 
melee but there is the recurring theme
of<00:02:51.720> range<00:02:52.680> with<00:02:53.580> CC<00:02:54.410> that<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.620> going<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.920> be<00:02:56.100> how

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
of range with CC that is going to be how

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.550 
of range with CC that is going to be how
you<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:57.030> quite<00:02:57.239> easily<00:02:57.269> do<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.110> but<00:02:58.380> once

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
you can quite easily do this but once

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.470 
you can quite easily do this but once
more<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.040> don't<00:02:59.519> think<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.850> should<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.030> possible

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
more I don't think it should be possible

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.660 
more I don't think it should be possible
because<00:03:00.630> there<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.290> much<00:03:01.470> solo<00:03:01.980> already

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
because there is so much solo already

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.420 
because there is so much solo already
that<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.209> do<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:03.630> game<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:04.430> majority

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
that you can do in this game a majority

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.490 
that you can do in this game a majority
of<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.670> time<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.150> there's<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.540> little<00:03:06.570> forced

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
of the time and there's so little forced

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.610 
of the time and there's so little forced
group<00:03:08.130> effort<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.850> think<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.840> these<00:03:10.019> should

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
group effort I think that these should

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410 
group effort I think that these should
be<00:03:10.680> one<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.310> those<00:03:11.459> instances<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.239> these

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
be one of those instances that these

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.810 
be one of those instances that these
outdoor<00:03:12.780> world<00:03:13.019> bosses<00:03:13.260> should<00:03:14.130> require<00:03:14.760> a

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
outdoor world bosses should require a

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.420 
outdoor world bosses should require a
group<00:03:15.330> multiple<00:03:15.959> people<00:03:16.320> someone<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.160> heal

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
group multiple people someone to heal

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.030 
group multiple people someone to heal
someone<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.060> draw<00:03:18.269> aggro<00:03:18.480> someone<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.290> DPS<00:03:19.650> I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
someone to draw aggro someone to DPS I

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.830 
someone to draw aggro someone to DPS I
think<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.820> ditch<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.180> should<00:03:21.329> require<00:03:21.600> it

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
think that ditch it should require it

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.210 
think that ditch it should require it
and<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.079> think<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.320> would<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.560> great<00:03:22.920> thing

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
and I think that would be a great thing

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.210 
and I think that would be a great thing
for<00:03:23.250> this<00:03:24.180> game<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.620> social<00:03:25.890> aspect

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
for this game to have that social aspect

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.030 
for this game to have that social aspect
forced<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.150> these<00:03:27.690> small<00:03:28.049> instances<00:03:28.500> again

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
forced in these small instances again

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.520 
forced in these small instances again
most<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> game<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.660> can<00:03:30.690> solo<00:03:31.079> without

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
most of the game you can solo without

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.050 
most of the game you can solo without
problem<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.040> never<00:03:32.190> have<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.610> talk<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:33.030> a

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
problem you never have to talk to a

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.000 
problem you never have to talk to a
group<00:03:33.299> with<00:03:33.540> another<00:03:33.840> person<00:03:34.290> if<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.890> don't

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
group with another person if you don't

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.650 
group with another person if you don't
want<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.430> those<00:03:35.579> group<00:03:35.790> instance<00:03:36.239> dungeons

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
want to do those group instance dungeons

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.140 
want to do those group instance dungeons
you're<00:03:37.049> going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.260> be<00:03:37.350> able<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.500> get<00:03:37.739> from<00:03:38.489> 1<00:03:38.700> to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
you're going to be able to get from 1 to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.500 
you're going to be able to get from 1 to
50<00:03:39.570> by<00:03:40.019> yourself<00:03:40.500> without<00:03:41.010> problems<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.239> then

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
50 by yourself without problems so then

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.420 
50 by yourself without problems so then
that<00:03:42.660> leads<00:03:42.870> us<00:03:43.079> into<00:03:43.230> how<00:03:43.709> do<00:03:43.769> they<00:03:43.950> fix<00:03:44.190> this

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
that leads us into how do they fix this

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.830 
that leads us into how do they fix this
there's<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.760> few<00:03:45.000> things<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.750> that

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
there's a few things that I think that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.990 
there's a few things that I think that
they<00:03:45.989> can<00:03:46.170> do<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.829> first<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.250> which<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.430> just

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
they can do the first of which is just

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.440 
they can do the first of which is just
make<00:03:48.360> more<00:03:48.780> mobs<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.590> these<00:03:49.799> areas<00:03:50.310> now<00:03:50.880> most

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
make more mobs in these areas now most

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.120 
make more mobs in these areas now most
of<00:03:51.720> these<00:03:51.930> boss<00:03:52.260> fights<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.769> I've<00:03:52.920> been<00:03:53.040> able

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
of these boss fights that I've been able

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.650 
of these boss fights that I've been able
to<00:03:53.310> solo<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.910> again<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.120> would<00:03:54.299> say<00:03:54.450> that's

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
to solo and again I would say that's

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.539 
to solo and again I would say that's
probably<00:03:54.780> about<00:03:55.049> 80<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.709> 90<00:03:55.980> percent<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.400> those

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
probably about 80 to 90 percent of those

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.300 
probably about 80 to 90 percent of those
that<00:03:56.610> I've<00:03:56.880> come<00:03:57.120> across<00:03:57.420> have<00:03:58.170> been<00:03:58.440> single

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
that I've come across have been single

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.460 
that I've come across have been single
enemies<00:03:59.820> when<00:04:00.510> there<00:04:00.750> are<00:04:00.930> multiple

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
enemies when there are multiple

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.340 
enemies when there are multiple
characters<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.549> fight<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.420> significantly

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
characters to fight it is significantly

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.380 
characters to fight it is significantly
more<00:04:04.620> difficult<00:04:04.829> in<00:04:05.370> fact<00:04:05.489> many<00:04:05.790> times<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.329> is

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
more difficult in fact many times it is

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.630 
more difficult in fact many times it is
almost<00:04:07.079> impossible<00:04:07.410> for<00:04:07.739> me<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.040> solo<00:04:08.370> because

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
almost impossible for me to solo because

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.000 
almost impossible for me to solo because
I<00:04:09.030> am<00:04:09.420> able<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.780> solo<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.290> ones<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.680> can

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
I am able to solo the ones that I can

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.430 
I am able to solo the ones that I can
because<00:04:11.760> I'm<00:04:11.880> able<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.239> lock<00:04:12.420> down<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.720> single

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
because I'm able to lock down a single

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.500 
because I'm able to lock down a single
target<00:04:13.709> when<00:04:14.280> there's<00:04:14.459> multiple<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:15.390> that

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
target when there's multiple and that

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.960 
target when there's multiple and that
becomes<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:16.109> lot<00:04:16.289> more<00:04:16.320> hazardous<00:04:16.950> or<00:04:17.130> even<00:04:17.880> if

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
becomes a lot more hazardous or even if

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.060 
becomes a lot more hazardous or even if
I<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.329> multiple<00:04:19.049> character<00:04:19.380> routes<00:04:19.650> which<00:04:19.919> I

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
I have multiple character routes which I

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.790 
I have multiple character routes which I
do<00:04:20.130> for<00:04:20.489> example<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.030> my<00:04:21.180> Dragon<00:04:21.720> Knight<00:04:21.900> it

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
do for example on my Dragon Knight it

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.500 
do for example on my Dragon Knight it
runs<00:04:23.130> out<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.550> runs<00:04:23.760> me<00:04:23.910> out<00:04:23.970> of<00:04:24.090> mana<00:04:24.240> way<00:04:24.450> too

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
runs out and runs me out of mana way too

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.700 
runs out and runs me out of mana way too
quickly<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.229> I'm<00:04:25.320> not<00:04:25.440> doing

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
quickly and I'm not doing

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.260 
quickly and I'm not doing
damage<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.400> actually<00:04:26.669> take<00:04:26.850> down<00:04:27.030> those

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
damage to actually take down those

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.900 
damage to actually take down those
multiple<00:04:27.720> targets<00:04:28.169> so<00:04:28.410> make<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:29.490> that<00:04:29.639> more

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
multiple targets so make it so that more

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.050 
multiple targets so make it so that more
of<00:04:30.060> these<00:04:30.180> boss<00:04:30.449> areas<00:04:30.960> have<00:04:31.229> an<00:04:31.979> NPC<00:04:32.699> attached

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
of these boss areas have an NPC attached

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.339 
of these boss areas have an NPC attached
to<00:04:33.330> them<00:04:33.449> so<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.660> have<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.870> fight<00:04:34.199> at<00:04:34.319> least

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
to them so you have to fight at least

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.230 
to them so you have to fight at least
two<00:04:34.680> characters<00:04:35.130> another<00:04:35.789> thing<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.120> I

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
two characters another thing that I

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.150 
two characters another thing that I
think<00:04:36.330> they<00:04:36.569> need<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.750> do<00:04:37.020> is<00:04:37.349> put<00:04:37.650> diminishing

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
think they need to do is put diminishing

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.339 
think they need to do is put diminishing

in<00:04:42.569> a<00:04:42.690> video<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.169> think<00:04:43.259> I<00:04:43.560> put<00:04:43.830> out<00:04:43.919> last

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
in a video that I think I put out last

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.480 
in a video that I think I put out last
week<00:04:44.580> about<00:04:44.970> how<00:04:45.270> CC<00:04:45.840> made<00:04:46.500> some<00:04:46.979> of<00:04:47.099> the<00:04:47.160> PvE

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.089 
week about how CC made some of the PvE
experience<00:04:48.090> just<00:04:48.389> way<00:04:48.599> too<00:04:48.660> easy<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:49.889> is

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
experience just way too easy and this is

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.980 
experience just way too easy and this is
a<00:04:50.130> perfect<00:04:50.580> example<00:04:50.729> with<00:04:51.660> crowd<00:04:51.960> control

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
a perfect example with crowd control

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.040 
a perfect example with crowd control

they<00:05:04.590> become<00:05:04.860> immune<00:05:05.130> to<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:05.370> temporarily<00:05:05.970> and

they become immune to it temporarily and

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.580 
they become immune to it temporarily and
then<00:05:06.389> they're<00:05:06.840> going<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:06.990> just<00:05:07.199> walk<00:05:07.380> up<00:05:07.410> to

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
then they're going to just walk up to

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.050 
then they're going to just walk up to
you<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.770> smack<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.280> in<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.430> face<00:05:08.520> but

you and smack you in the face but

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.270 
you and smack you in the face but
because<00:05:09.509> I'm<00:05:09.990> playing<00:05:10.229> at<00:05:10.380> range<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.949> I'm

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
because I'm playing at range and I'm

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.950 
because I'm playing at range and I'm
locking<00:05:11.669> them<00:05:11.820> down<00:05:11.849> they<00:05:12.449> don't<00:05:12.630> even<00:05:12.810> get

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
locking them down they don't even get

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.110 
locking them down they don't even get
within<00:05:13.139> melee<00:05:13.470> range<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:14.160> me<00:05:14.490> most<00:05:14.699> the<00:05:14.910> time

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
within melee range of me most the time

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.060 
within melee range of me most the time
and<00:05:15.419> so<00:05:15.570> that<00:05:15.599> they're<00:05:16.110> not<00:05:16.289> even<00:05:16.530> doing<00:05:16.800> any

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
and so that they're not even doing any

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.980 
and so that they're not even doing any
damage<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.550> me<00:05:17.849> and<00:05:18.060> then<00:05:18.240> finally<00:05:18.659> the<00:05:18.810> one

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
damage to me and then finally the one

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.360 
damage to me and then finally the one
last<00:05:19.259> piece<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.889> think<00:05:20.099> that<00:05:20.220> they<00:05:20.310> could

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
last piece that I think that they could

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.210 
last piece that I think that they could
add<00:05:20.669> would<00:05:21.060> be<00:05:21.210> gap<00:05:21.539> closers<00:05:22.199> for<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.949> melee

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
add would be gap closers for the melee

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.460 
add would be gap closers for the melee
world<00:05:23.970> bosses<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.659> should<00:05:24.810> come<00:05:24.930> up<00:05:24.960> against

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
world bosses that should come up against

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.830 
world bosses that should come up against
because<00:05:26.280> we're<00:05:26.909> able<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.270> keep<00:05:27.449> them<00:05:27.659> at<00:05:27.810> a

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
because we're able to keep them at a

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.260

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
leaper charge effects that would

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.279 
leaper charge effects that would
drastically<00:05:41.969> cut<00:05:42.180> down<00:05:42.210> on<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.840> ability<00:05:43.259> to

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
drastically cut down on the ability to

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.290 
drastically cut down on the ability to
keep<00:05:43.650> them<00:05:43.919> out<00:05:44.099> of<00:05:44.190> damage<00:05:44.699> dealing<00:05:44.940> range

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
keep them out of damage dealing range

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.600 
keep them out of damage dealing range
and<00:05:45.599> Nusli<00:05:46.080> it<00:05:46.560> would<00:05:46.650> cut<00:05:46.800> down<00:05:46.830> on<00:05:47.070> our

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
and Nusli it would cut down on our

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.060 
and Nusli it would cut down on our
chances<00:05:48.180> of<00:05:48.389> soloing<00:05:49.259> these<00:05:49.440> things<00:05:49.740> and

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
chances of soloing these things and

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.830 
chances of soloing these things and
while<00:05:50.280> it's<00:05:50.460> cool<00:05:50.789> and<00:05:51.060> well<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.210> feel<00:05:51.539> awesome

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
while it's cool and well I feel awesome

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.810 
while it's cool and well I feel awesome
being<00:05:52.380> able<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.620> solo<00:05:52.889> this<00:05:53.219> stuff<00:05:53.520> that's

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
being able to solo this stuff that's

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.240 
being able to solo this stuff that's
supposed<00:05:54.120> to<00:05:54.210> be<00:05:54.389> tailored<00:05:54.810> to<00:05:54.960> a<00:05:54.990> group<00:05:55.349> III<00:05:55.949> I

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
supposed to be tailored to a group III I

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.420 
supposed to be tailored to a group III I
do<00:05:56.610> think<00:05:57.030> it<00:05:57.150> takes<00:05:57.389> away<00:05:57.599> from<00:05:58.430> something

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
do think it takes away from something

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.459 
do think it takes away from something
that<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.759> could<00:06:00.210> be<00:06:00.330> more<00:06:00.630> it<00:06:00.870> could<00:06:00.930> be<00:06:01.139> much

00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
that it could be more it could be much

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.320 
that it could be more it could be much
more<00:06:01.770> they<00:06:02.159> should<00:06:02.310> also<00:06:02.430> increase<00:06:02.789> the<00:06:03.090> drops

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
more they should also increase the drops

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.180 
more they should also increase the drops
off<00:06:03.539> these<00:06:03.750> things<00:06:04.020> if<00:06:04.289> especially<00:06:04.860> if

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
off these things if especially if

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.010 
off these things if especially if
they're<00:06:05.400> going<00:06:05.490> to<00:06:05.550> make<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:06.509> so<00:06:06.630> that<00:06:06.659> it<00:06:06.900> does

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
they're going to make it so that it does

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.420 
they're going to make it so that it does
require<00:06:07.320> group<00:06:07.740> because<00:06:08.070> right<00:06:08.219> now<00:06:08.370> the

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
require group because right now the

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.120 
require group because right now the
drops<00:06:08.789> are<00:06:09.330> usually<00:06:09.870> you<00:06:10.440> know<00:06:10.560> just<00:06:10.860> sort<00:06:11.039> of

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
drops are usually you know just sort of

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.800 
drops are usually you know just sort of
whatever<00:06:11.370> just<00:06:11.880> like<00:06:12.090> anything<00:06:12.539> you'll<00:06:12.659> get

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
whatever just like anything you'll get

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.629

off<00:06:12.930> any<00:06:13.169> other<00:06:13.349> NPC<00:06:13.949> so<00:06:14.130> if<00:06:14.219> the<00:06:14.310> increase

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
off any other NPC so if the increase

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.219 
off any other NPC so if the increase
that<00:06:14.789> drops<00:06:15.000> off<00:06:15.150> these<00:06:15.360> things<00:06:15.539> make<00:06:16.080> them

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
that drops off these things make them

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.709 
that drops off these things make them
more<00:06:16.440> difficult<00:06:16.590> force<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.759> group<00:06:18.000> to<00:06:18.389> engage

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:18.719 
more difficult force a group to engage

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:20.450 
more difficult force a group to engage
these<00:06:18.990> and<00:06:19.500> it's<00:06:19.680> not<00:06:19.830> because<00:06:20.099> I<00:06:20.190> want<00:06:20.340> to

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
these and it's not because I want to

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.399 
these and it's not because I want to
force<00:06:20.820> everyone<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:21.330> have<00:06:21.599> to<00:06:21.719> group<00:06:21.930> for<00:06:22.169> so

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
force everyone to have to group for so

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:24.200 
force everyone to have to group for so
much<00:06:22.560> content<00:06:22.979> in<00:06:23.099> this<00:06:23.219> game<00:06:23.430> once<00:06:23.669> more<00:06:23.940> it's

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
much content in this game once more it's

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.659 
much content in this game once more it's
because<00:06:24.810> as<00:06:25.020> it<00:06:25.259> stands<00:06:25.770> you're<00:06:26.130> able<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.430> solo

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
because as it stands you're able to solo

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.029 
because as it stands you're able to solo
pretty<00:06:27.030> much<00:06:27.180> everything<00:06:27.659> else<00:06:27.750> you<00:06:28.320> know<00:06:28.469> so

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
pretty much everything else you know so

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.649 
pretty much everything else you know so
to<00:06:29.099> have<00:06:29.400> something<00:06:29.759> that<00:06:29.909> does<00:06:30.240> require<00:06:30.570> a

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659 
to have something that does require a

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:32.360 
to have something that does require a
group<00:06:31.050> I<00:06:31.259> think<00:06:31.500> would<00:06:31.800> just<00:06:31.949> add<00:06:32.159> an

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
group I think would just add an

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.370 
group I think would just add an
interesting<00:06:32.909> element<00:06:33.060> and<00:06:33.509> again<00:06:33.990> add<00:06:34.199> to

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
interesting element and again add to
