here<00:00:38.460> there's<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.989> marketing<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.470> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
here there's in the marketing of it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.319 
here there's in the marketing of it
there's<00:00:40.830> some<00:00:41.040> ideas<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
there's some ideas that's going to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.940 
there's some ideas that's going to
increase<00:00:42.480> nitric<00:00:42.870> oxide<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> think<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
increase nitric oxide I think we kind of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
increase nitric oxide I think we kind of
made<00:00:44.070> our<00:00:44.190> feelings<00:00:44.700> clear<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.719> topic<00:00:46.020> in

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
made our feelings clear on that topic in

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
made our feelings clear on that topic in
general<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> limitations<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.000> so

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
general and the limitations of it but so

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.630 
general and the limitations of it but so
we<00:00:48.960> always<00:00:49.260> judge<00:00:49.620> things<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.010> terms<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.460> how

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
we always judge things in terms of how

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.279 
we always judge things in terms of how
the<00:00:50.700> stimulants<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.660> work<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.200> what

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
the stimulants you know work and what

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.110 
the stimulants you know work and what
they<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.469> with<00:00:52.770> stuff<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.280> we'll<00:00:53.820> cover<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
they do with stuff but we'll cover that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.700 
they do with stuff but we'll cover that
so<00:00:54.449> when<00:00:54.870> obviously<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.379> first<00:00:55.590> ingredient

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
so when obviously the first ingredient

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
so when obviously the first ingredient
in<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.070> blend<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> caffeine<00:00:57.239> anhydrous

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
in the blend is a caffeine anhydrous

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.819 
in the blend is a caffeine anhydrous
which<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.340> kevan<00:00:59.340> reoli<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.940> caffeine<00:01:00.300> does

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
which is kevan reoli what caffeine does

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.590 
which is kevan reoli what caffeine does

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you take you get a feeling from it this

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
you take you get a feeling from it this
is<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.930> those<00:01:04.050> areas<00:01:04.440> we<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.220> will

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
is one of those areas we you know will

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.190 
is one of those areas we you know will

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
start with one to the szecr fowler

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.760 
start with one to the szecr fowler
exactly<00:01:41.280> moving<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.300> some<00:01:42.450> other<00:01:42.770> stimulants

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
exactly moving to some other stimulants

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.350 
exactly moving to some other stimulants
in<00:01:43.800> there<00:01:43.979> another<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:44.910> is<00:01:45.060> called<00:01:45.239> that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
in there another one is called that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.770 
in there another one is called that
mental<00:01:45.720> flavone<00:01:46.520> comes<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.940> ginkgo<00:01:48.660> biloba

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
mental flavone comes from ginkgo biloba

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
mental flavone comes from ginkgo biloba
there's<00:01:49.619> some<00:01:49.739> interesting<00:01:49.979> research<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
there's some interesting research to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.510 
there's some interesting research to
show<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.910> it<00:01:51.300> can<00:01:51.450> actually<00:01:52.520> inhibit

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
show that it can actually inhibit

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.639 
show that it can actually inhibit
acetylcholinesterase<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.289> an<00:01:55.440> enzyme

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
acetylcholinesterase which is an enzyme

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.979 
acetylcholinesterase which is an enzyme
that<00:01:55.830> breaks<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.220> acetylcholine<00:01:56.849> so<00:01:57.840> it's

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:57.989 
that breaks down acetylcholine so it's

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:59.719 
that breaks down acetylcholine so it's
increasingly<00:01:58.470> acetylcholine<00:01:59.069> levels<00:01:59.190> which

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
increasingly acetylcholine levels which

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.540 
increasingly acetylcholine levels which
can<00:02:00.060> increase<00:02:00.300> brain<00:02:00.989> function<00:02:01.560> mental

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
can increase brain function mental

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.350 
can increase brain function mental
energy<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.989> they're<00:02:04.920> saying<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.459> it<00:02:05.940> has

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
energy and they're saying that it has

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.109 
energy and they're saying that it has
some<00:02:06.750> similar<00:02:07.200> effects<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.649> caffeine<00:02:08.129> not

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
some similar effects to caffeine not

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
some similar effects to caffeine not
stimulating<00:02:09.780> effects<00:02:10.080> but<00:02:10.319> muscle

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
stimulating effects but muscle

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.670 
stimulating effects but muscle
contraction<00:02:11.400> effects<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.900> that's<00:02:13.110> why<00:02:13.440> they

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
contraction effects so that's why they

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.430 
contraction effects so that's why they
put<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.129> in

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
put that in

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.170 
put that in
here<00:02:14.590> I'm<00:02:15.160> already<00:02:15.340> searched<00:02:15.580> by<00:02:15.790> coming<00:02:16.120> out

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
here I'm already searched by coming out

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.550 
here I'm already searched by coming out
in<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.510> out<00:02:16.570> here<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.810> really<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.140> don't<00:02:17.410> have

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
in and out here I really I don't have

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.170 
in and out here I really I don't have
any<00:02:17.680> Kim<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:17.950> evidence<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.430> base<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.000> do

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
any Kim in evidence to base that on do

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.860 
any Kim in evidence to base that on do
they<00:02:19.350> not<00:02:20.350> not<00:02:20.740> human<00:02:21.280> directly<00:02:21.850> there<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
they not not human directly there is a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.350 
they not not human directly there is a
lot<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.260> vitro<00:02:23.470> studies<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.370> yeah<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.180> guess

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
lot of in vitro studies so yeah I guess

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.540 
lot of in vitro studies so yeah I guess
yeah<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.170> take<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.530> with<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.070> know<00:02:27.190> for<00:02:27.430> what

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
yeah so take that with you know for what

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.240 
yeah so take that with you know for what
it<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.030> we<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.300> point<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.780> out<00:02:29.250> kohler

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
it is so we just point that out kohler

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.830 
it is so we just point that out kohler
jenna<00:02:30.490> casa<00:02:30.730> those<00:02:31.180> are<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.330> familiar<00:02:31.570> with

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
jenna casa those are you familiar with

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.750 
jenna casa those are you familiar with
green<00:02:31.990> coffee<00:02:32.290> bean<00:02:32.620> extract<00:02:32.740> that's<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
green coffee bean extract that's the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.040 
green coffee bean extract that's the
active<00:02:34.120> ingredient<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.660> you're<00:02:34.870> going<00:02:34.960> to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
active ingredient that you're going to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.140 
active ingredient that you're going to
see<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.320> there<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:36.280> idea<00:02:36.550> being<00:02:36.760> is<00:02:36.940> when<00:02:37.090> you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
see in there the idea being is when you

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.550 
see in there the idea being is when you
roast<00:02:37.360> coffee<00:02:37.630> beans<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.350> know<00:02:38.440> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
roast coffee beans you know the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.830 
roast coffee beans you know the
chlorogenic<00:02:38.860> acid<00:02:39.490> it's<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:39.940> not<00:02:40.120> as<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.270> poet

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
chlorogenic acid it's it's not as a poet

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.420 
chlorogenic acid it's it's not as a poet
I<00:02:41.050> guess<00:02:41.230> you'd<00:02:41.410> say<00:02:41.590> some<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.190> gets<00:02:42.250> the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
I guess you'd say some of it gets the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.550 
I guess you'd say some of it gets the
nature<00:02:42.700> during<00:02:42.880> that<00:02:43.000> process<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.930> idea<00:02:44.350> with

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
nature during that process the idea with

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.620 
nature during that process the idea with
chlorogenic<00:02:44.950> acid<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.790> has<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.210> ability

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
chlorogenic acid is it has the ability

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.780 
chlorogenic acid is it has the ability
to<00:02:46.660> help<00:02:46.840> lower<00:02:47.440> blood<00:02:47.680> sugar<00:02:47.770> via<00:02:48.370> kind<00:02:48.700> of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
to help lower blood sugar via kind of

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.940 
to help lower blood sugar via kind of
acting<00:02:49.090> as<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.210> carb<00:02:49.420> blocker<00:02:49.690> now<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:50.710> you're

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
acting as a carb blocker now if you're

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.040 
acting as a carb blocker now if you're
somebody<00:02:51.130> who<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.400> pretty<00:02:51.700> lean<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.330> you're

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050

you know at the very least blunting that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.350 
you know at the very least blunting that
effect<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:21.400> know<00:03:21.489> there's<00:03:21.760> various

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
effect you know there's various

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.240 
effect you know there's various
mechanisms<00:03:22.540> for<00:03:23.080> proposed<00:03:23.770> but<00:03:24.130> it's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
mechanisms for proposed but it's

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.640 
mechanisms for proposed but it's
basically<00:03:24.400> from<00:03:24.760> blocking<00:03:25.360> glucose<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.440> day's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
basically from blocking glucose I day's

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.280 
basically from blocking glucose I day's
activities<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:27.489> that's<00:03:28.360> chlorogenic<00:03:28.750> acid

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
activities so that's chlorogenic acid

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.680 
activities so that's chlorogenic acid
for<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.590> um<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:30.520> next<00:03:30.790> stimulating

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
for you um the next stimulating

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.910 
for you um the next stimulating
ingredient<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.230> something<00:03:32.560> called<00:03:32.739> hey

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
ingredient is something called hey

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.890 
ingredient is something called hey
ketamine<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.880> they<00:03:34.030> also<00:03:34.209> seem<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.660> call

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
ketamine and they also seem to call

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.080 
ketamine and they also seem to call
Norco<00:03:35.380> chlorine<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> few<00:03:36.520> other<00:03:36.670> products

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
Norco chlorine and a few other products

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.000 
Norco chlorine and a few other products
is<00:03:37.180> sort<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:37.930> hot<00:03:38.140> new<00:03:38.170> stimuli<00:03:38.860> on<00:03:38.920> the

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
is sort of the hot new stimuli on the

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.290 
is sort of the hot new stimuli on the
market<00:03:39.340> right<00:03:39.459> now<00:03:39.520> it<00:03:39.790> does<00:03:40.000> have

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
market right now it does have

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.820 
market right now it does have
stimulating<00:03:40.900> effects<00:03:41.200> as<00:03:41.350> one<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.560> those<00:03:41.680> that

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
stimulating effects as one of those that

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.830 
stimulating effects as one of those that
you<00:03:41.890> can<00:03:42.070> take<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.489> actually<00:03:42.820> feel<00:03:43.120> it

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
you can take and you actually feel it

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.330 
you can take and you actually feel it
stimulates<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.739> beta-2<00:03:45.130> adrenergic

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
stimulates the beta-2 adrenergic

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.449 
stimulates the beta-2 adrenergic
receptors<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.530> it's<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.800> this<00:03:47.950> product<00:03:48.310> for

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
receptors so it's in this product for

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.240 
receptors so it's in this product for
that<00:03:48.489> reason<00:03:49.170> there<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.200> some<00:03:50.470> thoughts<00:03:51.010> as<00:03:51.220> to

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
that reason there is some thoughts as to

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.550 
that reason there is some thoughts as to
does<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:51.970> stays<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.660> bioavailable<00:03:53.260> business

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
does it stays and bioavailable business

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.080 
does it stays and bioavailable business
they<00:03:53.709> around<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.980> body<00:03:54.220> for<00:03:54.550> lung<00:03:54.700> so

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
they around the body for lung so

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.750 
they around the body for lung so
actually<00:03:55.810> from<00:03:56.410> applying<00:03:56.890> suitable<00:03:57.430> research

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
actually from applying suitable research

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.160 
actually from applying suitable research
they've<00:03:58.060> added<00:03:58.480> clerked<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:58.989> guess<00:03:59.140> it's

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
they've added clerked and I guess it's

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.340 
they've added clerked and I guess it's
also<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.739> prolong<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:01.200> half-light<00:04:02.200> or

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
also to prolong the half-light or

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.890 
also to prolong the half-light or
prolong<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.769> effects<00:04:03.100> if<00:04:03.310> again<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.580> mean<00:04:03.820> so<00:04:04.150> I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
prolong the effects if again I mean so I

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.440 
prolong the effects if again I mean so I
have<00:04:05.620> never<00:04:05.860> seen<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.220> together<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:07.060> if<00:04:07.300> it

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
have never seen that together so if it

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.600 
have never seen that together so if it
does<00:04:07.660> work<00:04:07.900> great<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:09.010> know<00:04:09.130> but<00:04:09.340> there's<00:04:09.489> no

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
does work great you know but there's no

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.460 
does work great you know but there's no
direct<00:04:09.880> evidence<00:04:10.060> it's<00:04:10.600> probably<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.959> theory

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
direct evidence it's probably a theory

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.750 
direct evidence it's probably a theory
based<00:04:11.650> on<00:04:11.920> hey<00:04:12.070> if<00:04:12.190> it's<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.400> blunt

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
based on hey if it's a blunt

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.670 
based on hey if it's a blunt
carbohydrates<00:04:13.540> may<00:04:13.690> be<00:04:13.750> the<00:04:13.959> one<00:04:14.110> that<00:04:14.350> unless

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
carbohydrates may be the one that unless

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.490 
carbohydrates may be the one that unless
blocks<00:04:15.340> of<00:04:15.519> certain<00:04:15.820> pathways

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
blocks of certain pathways

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.430 
blocks of certain pathways
enzymes<00:04:17.040> also<00:04:17.430> i<00:04:17.459> can<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:17.910> that's<00:04:18.440> another

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
enzymes also i can so that's another

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.870 
enzymes also i can so that's another
thing<00:04:19.980> in<00:04:20.160> there<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.400> there's<00:04:20.579> another

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
thing in there so there's another

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.460 
thing in there so there's another
stimulation<00:04:21.510> sign<00:04:21.720> their<00:04:21.930> then<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.200> got<00:04:22.320> the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
stimulation sign their then you got the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.280 
stimulation sign their then you got the
cooper<00:04:22.800> zine<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.220> huge<00:04:24.180> innate<00:04:24.420> can<00:04:24.660> increase

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
cooper zine a huge innate can increase

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.170 
cooper zine a huge innate can increase
the<00:04:25.320> acetylcholine<00:04:26.010> levels<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:26.700> body<00:04:26.850> or

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
the acetylcholine levels in the body or

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.380 
the acetylcholine levels in the body or
i<00:04:27.510> should<00:04:27.660> say<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.080> brain<00:04:28.850> it's<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.940> very

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
i should say in the brain it's a very

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.260 
i should say in the brain it's a very
popular<00:04:30.600> like<00:04:31.020> like<00:04:31.230> as<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.410> study<00:04:31.800> ate<00:04:32.010> a

buying alfeo combine things like that
generally<00:04:55.440> with<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.680> MV<00:04:55.980> so<00:04:56.190> this<00:04:56.310> is<00:04:56.430> going

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
generally with you MV so this is going

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.040 
generally with you MV so this is going
to<00:04:56.580> be<00:04:56.669> really<00:04:56.820> important<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.300> don't<00:04:57.870> know<00:04:57.960> if

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
to be really important I don't know if

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.090 
to be really important I don't know if
it<00:04:58.140> says<00:04:58.290> they're<00:04:58.440> on<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.590> directions<00:04:58.980> but<00:04:59.070> I

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
it says they're on the directions but I

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.409 
it says they're on the directions but I
would<00:04:59.250> definitely<00:04:59.370> do<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.700> does<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.180> without

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
would definitely do it does it without

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.180 
would definitely do it does it without
food<00:05:00.870> because<00:05:01.350> that's<00:05:01.770> when<00:05:01.980> it's<00:05:02.130> most

combination of those two is probably

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.550

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
got the semen since I here and then they

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.010 
got the semen since I here and then they

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
nitric oxide levels so what they have

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.300 
nitric oxide levels so what they have
done<00:05:51.840> is<00:05:52.169> they've<00:05:52.320> added<00:05:52.650> some<00:05:52.680> ingredients

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
done is they've added some ingredients

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.909 
done is they've added some ingredients
to<00:05:53.520> this<00:05:53.700> to<00:05:54.030> sort<00:05:54.780> of<00:05:54.870> help<00:05:55.140> heighten<00:05:55.770> your

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
sensitivity to that that's the reason

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.640

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
say so you know we've gone you know over

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.580 
say so you know we've gone you know over
nitric<00:06:13.210> oxide<00:06:13.569> and<00:06:13.750> greens<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.259> products

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
over the years there we've done these

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.749 
over the years there we've done these
videos<00:06:16.419> and<00:06:16.949> it<00:06:17.949> seems<00:06:18.160> a<00:06:18.250> reason<00:06:18.460> it's<00:06:18.550> always

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
videos and it seems a reason it's always

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.499 
videos and it seems a reason it's always
very<00:06:18.789> limiting<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:20.849> there's<00:06:21.849> always<00:06:22.150> your

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
everybody was making a balance so

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.260

generally if there's an increase is

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.360 
generally if there's an increase is
going<00:06:28.419> to<00:06:28.479> try<00:06:28.599> to<00:06:28.660> balance<00:06:28.870> that<00:06:29.259> out<00:06:29.370> we've

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
going to try to balance that out we've

keeps<00:06:38.319> that<00:06:38.470> happening<00:06:39.160> or<00:06:39.520> blunts<00:06:40.000> that

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
keeps that happening or blunts that

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.860 
keeps that happening or blunts that
response<00:06:40.599> so<00:06:41.160> with<00:06:42.160> this<00:06:42.490> it's<00:06:42.820> a<00:06:42.940> it's<00:06:43.599> a<00:06:43.690> nice

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
response so with this it's a it's a nice

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.879 
response so with this it's a it's a nice
idea<00:06:44.050> that<00:06:44.380> they're<00:06:44.470> adding<00:06:44.770> these

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:44.889 
idea that they're adding these

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.279 
idea that they're adding these

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
help heighten your sensitivity to it

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.960 
help heighten your sensitivity to it
possibly<00:06:49.300> increase<00:06:49.900> that<00:06:50.110> but<00:06:50.440> I<00:06:51.070> don't<00:06:51.910> know

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
possibly increase that but I don't know

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.820 
possibly increase that but I don't know
the<00:06:52.509> evidence<00:06:52.750> is<00:06:52.900> lagging<00:06:53.349> and<00:06:53.470> healthy

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830

going to point out all I fit but when

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.860

would limit that it's not going to be
the<00:07:08.500> same<00:07:08.770> as<00:07:09.039> what<00:07:09.099> you<00:07:09.909> know<00:07:10.090> in<00:07:10.389> elderly

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780 
the same as what you know in elderly

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.050 
the same as what you know in elderly
population<00:07:11.500> for<00:07:11.740> instance<00:07:12.069> who<00:07:12.190> has<00:07:12.400> you<00:07:12.970> know

that<00:07:14.800> so<00:07:15.009> there's<00:07:15.159> a<00:07:15.220> lot<00:07:15.340> of<00:07:15.370> variables<00:07:15.880> to

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 
that so there's a lot of variables to

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.339 
that so there's a lot of variables to
consider<00:07:16.090> so<00:07:16.630> that's<00:07:16.780> what<00:07:16.900> kind<00:07:17.050> of<00:07:17.080> makes<00:07:17.259> it

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:17.349 
consider so that's what kind of makes it

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:48.789 
effective on then you're going to be

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:50.610 
effective on then you're going to be
taking<00:07:49.030> a<00:07:49.060> lot<00:07:49.180> of<00:07:49.270> capsules<00:07:49.690> so<00:07:49.840> their<00:07:50.320> eyes

taking a lot of capsules so their eyes

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.899 
taking a lot of capsules so their eyes
would<00:07:50.860> be<00:07:50.979> one<00:07:51.250> of<00:07:51.280> the<00:07:51.370> main<00:07:51.520> difference<00:07:51.820> but

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:51.909 
would be one of the main difference but

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:53.430 
would be one of the main difference but
in<00:07:52.000> terms<00:07:52.120> of<00:07:52.300> stimulants<00:07:52.810> you<00:07:53.199> know<00:07:53.320> if<00:07:53.380> you

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 
in terms of stimulants you know if you

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.689 
in terms of stimulants you know if you
don't<00:07:53.620> like<00:07:53.770> a<00:07:53.800> drink<00:07:54.130> and<00:07:54.310> you<00:07:54.370> want<00:07:54.550> to<00:07:54.610> get

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:54.699 
don't like a drink and you want to get

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:56.249 
don't like a drink and you want to get
that<00:07:54.789> stem<00:07:55.060> effect<00:07:55.360> what<00:07:55.570> was<00:07:55.659> you<00:07:55.900> know<00:07:55.990> can

00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:56.259 
that stem effect what was you know can

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:58.230 
that stem effect what was you know can
be<00:07:56.409> your<00:07:56.560> pre-workout<00:07:57.099> it's<00:07:57.610> just<00:07:57.789> basically

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 
be your pre-workout it's just basically

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.490 
be your pre-workout it's just basically
in<00:07:58.389> choosing<00:07:58.599> how<00:07:58.780> you<00:07:58.840> market<00:07:59.050> or<00:07:59.320> you<00:07:59.380> could
