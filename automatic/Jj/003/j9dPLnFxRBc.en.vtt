00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
front of a computer as you can imagine

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.539

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
now whenever I look at my hand typing on

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.730 
now whenever I look at my hand typing on
the<00:01:32.189> computer<00:01:32.570> I'll<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.960> shiny

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
a pen how crazy is that outside and work

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.840 
a pen how crazy is that outside and work
on<00:02:22.440> articles<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.070> recipes<00:02:23.430> or<00:02:23.640> something

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
on articles and recipes or something

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.980 
on articles and recipes or something
like<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.240> know<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.480> sounds<00:02:24.540> crazy<00:02:24.780> but

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
like that I know it sounds crazy but

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.660 
like that I know it sounds crazy but
sometimes<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.680> get<00:02:25.800> more<00:02:25.980> creative<00:02:26.220> with

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
sometimes I can get more creative with

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.370 
sometimes I can get more creative with
recipes<00:02:27.150> when<00:02:27.450> I'm<00:02:27.570> actually<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:28.110> in<00:02:28.170> my

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
recipes when I'm actually not in my

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.800 
recipes when I'm actually not in my
kitchen<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:29.610> that's<00:02:29.760> part<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.150> my<00:02:30.209> balance<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
kitchen so that's part of my balance and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.990 
kitchen so that's part of my balance and
then<00:02:31.320> if<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.680> look<00:02:31.830> at<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.520> terms<00:02:32.820> of

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
then if you look at that in terms of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.040 
then if you look at that in terms of
healthy<00:02:33.300> eating<00:02:33.330> if<00:02:33.720> you're<00:02:33.840> having<00:02:33.959> trouble

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
healthy eating if you're having trouble

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.310 
healthy eating if you're having trouble
maintaining<00:02:34.380> balance<00:02:35.900> one<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.080> things

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
maintaining balance one of the things

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.680 
maintaining balance one of the things
I've<00:02:37.500> been<00:02:37.530> having<00:02:38.430> challenges<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.300> this

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
I've been having challenges with this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
summer in particular is I've been

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.690 
summer in particular is I've been
traveling<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.180> lot<00:02:42.450> which<00:02:43.440> has<00:02:43.650> been<00:02:43.890> amazing

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
traveling a lot which has been amazing

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030 
traveling a lot which has been amazing
and<00:02:44.850> really<00:02:45.209> fun<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.470> also<00:02:46.650> can<00:02:47.010> be

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
and really fun but it also can be

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.220 
and really fun but it also can be
challenging<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:48.000> terms<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.480> maintaining<00:02:48.930> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
challenging in terms of maintaining a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.320 
challenging in terms of maintaining a
routine<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.980> healthy<00:02:50.730> eating<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.209> exercise

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
and that kind of stuff what I find is

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.690 
and that kind of stuff what I find is
that<00:02:55.230> when<00:02:55.590> I'm<00:02:55.680> visiting<00:02:55.950> with<00:02:56.130> someone<00:02:56.459> I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
that when I'm visiting with someone I

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.070 
that when I'm visiting with someone I
want<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.239> visit<00:02:57.360> with<00:02:57.570> them<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.720> spend<00:02:57.989> time

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
with them and that is really really

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.720 
with them and that is really really
valuable<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.440> also<00:03:01.769> don't<00:03:02.160> want<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.459> be<00:03:02.580> that

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
