00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.220
 hi all guys today i 'm here for 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.400
 explain to all those who do not know it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.970
 what is league of legends pb and who is 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 for public beta environment that is the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.189
 as he says here was beta let's say league 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
 of legends and allows all 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.079
 players try the patches try the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.640
 new champions try anyway league 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.129
 of legends with the new things that 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.050
 will arrive on the official file before 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.530
 time 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.550
 then for there to register but there is 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.559
 a problem 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.719
 lately given the amount of people 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.699
 that you are registering and writing 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.910
 and that does multiple accounts 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.180
 registration is apparently limited to the first ones 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.829
 of the month then to register if a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.600
 click here of course to register 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.380
 you have to wait for the first days of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.030
 tiple month 1 the 2 the 3 things so one 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.110
 once you have registered to not 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.640
 league of account function 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.280
 normal legends you have to create another one 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.450
 for this we will need to register one 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 Once you are registered, he said 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.110
 Download the game that this time will be 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.680
 a zip that I already and therefore I'm not at re 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.310
 download then it will make you download 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.869
 this lol pb and zip which will contain one 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.310
 pd folder is that you 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.689
 extract where you want I already have it here 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.009
 and this fine game you don't have to 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.750
 install you want to do anything to do it 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.790
 starting you have to start this here 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.000
 the launcher the first time that the pritt 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.460
 and will have to do it plate because it is obviously 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 there is no zip with the latest version 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.579
 but in that a little earlier and protection for the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.009
 nine that have been made necessary of 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.500
 then download and then update 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.799
 play as if it were swollen there 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.799
 normal 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:09.509
 just put part put yours 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.569
 I took the wrong step on our name and the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.349
 your password to lol pb and those that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.349
 you have registered before 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.590
 and enter these le goffs the people there are 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.490
 It never seems to have TV and what you 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.880
 see that the pd is that 11.465 riads 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.590
 point and 14050 influence point this 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.090
 because why to every patch that comes 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.850
 issued to every sample that comes 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.250
 released the reality from in automatic a 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.980
 all players something like 9000 not 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.010
 I remember how much rpp is 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.770
 because why so people can buy 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.980
 quietly whatever he wants 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.720
 now I'll show you the shop ad 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.610
 example that you see the gearing center that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.740
 in the league offers of the normal it seems to me that 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:03.910
 still there is in any case look 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:06.610
 for example that I have to remove in brass 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.300
 you see for example that elisa cost 10 e 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.120
 10 cases costs 10 in friend chairs CV costs 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.590
 10 Feb costs 10 and pedro 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.850
 these are the ones that have already left the most 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.520
 time this normal but in any case 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.470
 you have so many rp 's so many 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.340
 ip that you can buy without problems 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.410
 regardless of expense 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.650
 this also applies to skins for 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.120
 try them skin 9 and have fun so you see 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.820
 that plus or melis 10 match a case x10 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.980
 etcetera etc. etc. 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.640
 the only problem is that these servers 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.630
 being I don't think they are in Europe they are 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.720
 further 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.240
 who plays from laga europe or at least me 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.130
 I have an average ping of 200 but who cares 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.610
 so much their only to buy i 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.030
 characters and try them before buying them 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.850
 league of legends normal well this is 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.390

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.160

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.030
 have fun and went to try all the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.030
 samples bye bye 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.780
 and he could not cold first Rome 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.930
 that caesar was caught diploma adds 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.880
 among the favorites 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.500
 I went out again to sign up 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.060

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.060
