00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.480
 in all my regards my dear friends with you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.940
 Do not feast yesterday on advance rp yellow 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.020
 as well as on other advanced servers 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.640
 held a parade in honor of May 9th and 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 naturally I decided to go see what 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.290
 same ring slaves prepared for this 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.320
 really great holiday 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.360
 In general, the whole thing took place in 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.160
 Airport Los Santos not to the rank of 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.099
 fierro as was the last time and along the way 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.329
 there I discovered this cheat brain 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.110
 which you can now notice on 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 the screens it runs from mine achieve 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.020
 los santos spawn even dls 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 by the way vrp baths I found a couple of screenshots 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.970
 in general, this is how this road looks 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.130
 when you're on it, these well, in general, I reached 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.280
 to los santos pretty departure what are you 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.250
 can see here you see mapping here 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.170
 in short the stands were set up in the center supposedly 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.059
 carpet itself understand everything 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.710
 the action to come was happening as i had 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.899
 said in los santos namely in 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.079
 airport here on these here red 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.119
 the turbo square is installed just the same 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:10.950
 carpet well and 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.069
 the runway should have been 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.389
 General transport is immediately noticed 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:20.759
 these dangerous bots that cost 

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:23.159
 directly about the red carpet well 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.229
 cool cool implemented so what 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.079
 say at all the event was pretty 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.039
 strongly prolonged perhaps begin with 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.880
 what's in the beginning 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:36.630
 we were heartily congratulated on May 9 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.700
 all sorts of leaders all sorts of scourge and unnecessary 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.899
 why should I listen to this and so do 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.770
 I know and in general because of this 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.420
 the event took about minutes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.819
 twenty that is 20 minutes they are pure 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.639
 congratulated in year chat fished by 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.770
 tough so what happened next 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:56.340
 the peak and the most 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.170
 interesting show program so let's say in 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.990
 general 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.909
 first ride equipment 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.009
 but perhaps only the tanks are asleep until 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.649
 the tanks were also cool I remember 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.569
 how admin panel merged the sixth level on 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.630
 Advance whales generally shorter dude slept 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.400
 tanks okay now is not about this talk in 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.170
 general technology passes standard up 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.569
 Army principle in this nothing 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.300
 no eye on the attention when it is not 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.940
 synchronously go they keep exactly 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.690
 speed therefore for this particular 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.720
 separate respect from me as a connoisseur 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.000
 any events that suits 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.580
 the ring and so well in the meantime ground 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.560
 technique passed and in principle of course her 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.830
 could be much more but in principle 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.739
 so go in general gave ban grow writes 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.590
 What will the air parade be coming to 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.680
 technology and actually already flying through the sky 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.790
 Andromeda is a very powerful aircraft. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.250
 which could be arranged 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.410
 dangerous epic explosion he flies 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.630
 calm unlike helicopters which 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.239
 You will now see that he is probably behind 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.760
 sat at the wheel of the Curonus more precisely at the helm 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.010
 well, or addicts, I do not know 0 and those who 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.140
 The first time in general is playing by itself, that is, you 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.450
 see he flew there in millimeters from 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.079
 landing strip here now you see 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.000
 one more full 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.790
 downa who just decided to go on 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.829
 ram and eventually even jumped out 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.720
 of the plane screaming cuckoo pachany whines 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.900
 okay, this advance is nothing like that 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.350
 in this there is no further in the background see 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.010
 the plane that is also barely piloting 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.340
 from the earth trying not the killer and at the end 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.690
 the pilot just jumps out of the plane and 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.890
 also jumps out another pilot with 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.170
 words of glory to Ukraine 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.950
 but this advance is quite normal 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.980
 naturally but the apparatus continues and 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.870
 what happens next we see 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.019
 hydra which shoot at us some 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.940
 rockets or what it looks like driving 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.290
 Hydra at the helm of the hydraulic system admin 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.389
 because we will find with such a wild 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.920
 speed that dude he pursed speedhack 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:02.250
 generally hard 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.730
 well, in the meantime, the number of people in the zone 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.500
 Stream is already 190 that is almost 200 is quite 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.500
 quite well for yourself 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.390
 and here it happens just unexpectedly and we 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.000
 somewhere about five minutes of inactivity that is 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.430
 just and then we are sharply admin gives everything 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.970
 these are the torches that are from the animation 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.860
 fire and video card donuts which 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.910
 standing next to me starts quietly 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:30.030
 melts and my VPS also drops noticeably 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.660
 that is, already up to 20 , given that 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.090
 all the same 190 people for not stream plus 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.010
 each of them stands with a torch with animation 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.310
 fire that really it takes very 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.810
 much performance so say sampo 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.030
 asking everyone to come to the center 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.190
 torch legs understandably put it 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.570
 no way because ringa is not 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.669
 thought out but in general, then in general we 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.770
 just stood there for about five minutes 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.960
 Well, it 's kinda normal, that is, well, 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.430
 after this long inactivity decided 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.960
 walk away and see what follows 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.600
 point in the program were effects that 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.419
 turned on on this red carpet well 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.430
 not bad not bad of course such bots 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.530
 effects in general is beautiful everything 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.419
 looked like 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.729
 Norenko here, too, decided to arrange 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.640
 unusual in general now this fire 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.460
 turned into a kind of elevator which 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.320
 climbed to the man up and proper 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.640
 such an interesting effect turned on 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.220
 some snow or 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.220
 I do not know that rain or is it all about 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.020
 it was not very clear but looked in 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.270
 principle, not bad though it was impossible 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.110
 no effect to explain also included 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.789
 blew up anybody what is it well in general how 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.740
 so it looked like I don't know how it is 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.390
 describe really well cool 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.000
 cool so visually beautiful of course 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.810
 Looks like see now Iâ€™ll go away 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.210
 Centre 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.050
 what to catch symmetry and see how it is 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.409
 everything looked beautiful 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.960
 further a few players or do not know 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:02.020
 administrators decided to let salutes 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.389
 they bought salute at 60,000 put 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.629
 them and the sky just filled with these 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:09.190
 explosive pieces shorter there by the way 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:12.280
 very unlucky army team who 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.250
 flew this time I hit you like 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.039
 just what they will explode top 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.810
 but somehow I wondered how 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:21.699
 it will look like the night i turned on 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.990
 night mode and understand what it is 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.659
 event star had to hold 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.889
 in the dark so that how would it 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:32.379
 looks even prettier at night 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:34.690
 thanks to this firework people have become 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:37.719
 quietly fly to heaven and explode 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.849
 in the name of a bright holiday well, in general 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:41.770
 such garbage turned out some real 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.219
 it is not clear why they jumped but so 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.190
 or else a person is probably 20 30 for sure 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:50.830
 flew into the sky was blown up and already corpses 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.270
 they fell to the ground well what by the way so 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:55.389
 happened because I have FPS 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.099
 increased due to this number of people 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.620
 less due to no drawing on the general 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.610
 thanks to these dudes if you ask u 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.340
 Uncle Ringa 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:07.080
 that on this program ended up it 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:10.630
 such endings are these activities well 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.219
 further it was not so interesting just 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.990
 now all this will be static 

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.440
 the effect works and that is but everything is as 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.779
 usually 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.060
 true administrators have stepped in only 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:20.469
 the very last moment came up with that 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.440
 it would be nice to organize or 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:25.870
 teleport and as soon as they did 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.430
 number of players for not stream 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.669
 increased to three hundred 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:34.029
 and subsequently what bandicam along with 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:36.190
 my game safely crashed and in 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:38.919
 Generally, it was only then that I rebooted again 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.779
 led etc. and brings in here connected 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:42.879
 by the way along with me knocked out another 50 

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:45.520
 man server but it's ok it 

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:47.380
 advance what what resent something 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.810
 speak in general 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:54.190
 Here is an event on 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:56.110
 dvoechke naturally write your opinion in 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.600
