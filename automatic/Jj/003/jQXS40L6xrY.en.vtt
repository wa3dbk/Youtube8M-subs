00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.890 

well<00:01:45.850> as<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.090> could<00:01:46.240> see<00:01:46.360> that<00:01:46.509> was<00:01:46.630> really

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
well as you could see that was really

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.320 
well as you could see that was really
close<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.530> came<00:01:47.740> down<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:48.159> literally<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:49.000> nose

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
close it came down to literally a nose

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.160 
close it came down to literally a nose
so<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.619> guess<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.310> x6m<00:01:51.970> does<00:01:52.509> live<00:01:52.750> up<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:52.899> its

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
so I guess the x6m does live up to its

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.310 
so I guess the x6m does live up to its
claim<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.409> being<00:01:53.740> as<00:01:53.920> fast<00:01:54.280> as<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:54.580> bmw<00:01:55.149> m3<00:01:55.320> but

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
claim to being as fast as a bmw m3 but
