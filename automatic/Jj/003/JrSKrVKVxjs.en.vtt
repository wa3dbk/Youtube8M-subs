00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.600
 the SC FC Kaiserslautern in dark play clothes start the only in the 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.430
 first few minutes of play in Munich successful and dangerous attacks 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.840
 on the gate of the TSV 1860 mostly went this action of Brenz the want out of it 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.840
 maybe one of the best fielders of the culprit 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.239
 but then the guests indulge themselves and how they lived entirely from theirs 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.319
 Backing team reinforced by the hype striker Bauer 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.489
 also from the great achievements of her goalkeeper dash 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.280
 Of course, not so much by this somewhat weak shot of Rebele 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
 very put to the test 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.650
 so the first half was a pretty one-sided affair the Munich 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.490
 dominated the midfield but they did not dominate the opponent 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.880
 his penalty area 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.250
 and then when really a good shot was fired then as I said 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.610
 Goalkeeper dash in the post and he turned out to be anything but just 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.890
 Spare man from the pain 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.220
 also well disposed offenders of the club with shoes at the Munich 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.150
 lions 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.640
 in the second half they will see completely without him it is not with him 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.990
 Again and again, there is a line 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.190
 albeit at the expense of corner balls 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.410
 Stopper Poulter lets Brunnenmeier pass the match shortly before halftime 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.900
 Unfortunately, Kaus Dortmund are penalties 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.460
 Penalties will shoot the celestial body but 7 white at Kaiserslautern goal 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.840
 over and so it goes with 0 to 0 in the break 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.409
 and the Munich 35 000 spectators waved like the flags 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.570
 that did not know that maybe after paging 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.990
 The hosts once again the chance Ines Need Need to bloom here Zeiser 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 the producers hit the ball but then still a corner kick out brings 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.620
 defender Mangold passes the mishap on the 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.260
 Goal line to make again meters for the Munich is parried this time 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.350
 the further start 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.680
 and against his shot he let time teenagers once again Tarkan 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.960
 Herb grown 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.980
 one to zero and thus were the Münchnerin 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.590
 well on its way to winning your first success in the football league 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.679
 because after these 1 to 0, the Lauterer had to surrender from their audience 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.679
 they did not do it right away 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:23.669
 Basel the center forward Büns to violent protests with his coach 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:25.249
 Bogdan arranged 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.979
 but Broker got himself re-recorded and then turned pro mid-runners 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.329
 Liter also went forward in the attack, said Bucher afterwards 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.329
 but not on my instructions 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.189
 the guests that we of course after his missed penalty especially 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.529
 Witte wants to make an effort 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:46.179
 now the measure to Rudi Brunnenmeier his center forward and the shoots 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.800
 to the 2 0 for the TSV 1860 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.819
 in the 63rd 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.699
 that was the race 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.279
 Satisfaction among the people of Munich with the Cypress course special joy 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:01.239
 This was not his missed penalty on basketball 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.239
 another draw 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.869
 the Lauter seal continued to work hard to make two corner balls 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.499
 this time again Küppers as Sagittarius 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.589
 and now on the other side a very tough situation 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.809
 because as a stopper center runner Stemmer also believes in already having in it 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:23.980
 Shares in the letter worker has memorably parried and now comes one 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:27.659
 typical even the scene he still goes out a little denies the 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.519
 attacking Bremen and then plays over to the left then yes yes the 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.639
 Just do not leave it if he can not do that then the whole game will make him happy 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.959
 Not 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.419
 two to zero so for 1860 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.419
 a tour that was well deserved after the game 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.829
 they now see some stronger attacks because of those who are even louder 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.249
 Defender Mangold has turned on 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:55.249
 but everything runs too much in the wide right the gate 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.199
 Mr. Blatter 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.709
 and still a dangerous situation but was memorable can also be factual 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.709
 Has 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.399
 beautiful template from Brunnenmeier to Hanescu the paper 1 0 for the TSV 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:17.959
 In 1860 they are seen showing again 1 0 for 1860 against Kaiserslautern
