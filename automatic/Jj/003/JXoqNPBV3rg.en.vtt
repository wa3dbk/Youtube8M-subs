Roland was our first true open platform

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.340 
Roland was our first true open platform
system<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:26.120> enables<00:02:27.120> us<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.270> mill<00:02:27.600> whatever

any material use any file format that we
would<00:02:35.130> like<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.940> gives<00:02:36.240> us<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.390> lot<00:02:36.480> more

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
would like it gives us a lot more

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
our growth path according to us the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.600 
our growth path according to us the
Roland<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.950> best<00:02:47.160> bang<00:02:47.340> for<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.580> buck

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
Roland is the best bang for the buck

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.080 
Roland is the best bang for the buck
it's<00:02:48.950> cost-effective<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.910> low

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
it's cost-effective it's a low

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.020 
it's cost-effective it's a low
maintenance<00:02:51.470> hands-free<00:02:52.700> it's<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.820> best

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
maintenance hands-free it's the best

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.260 
maintenance hands-free it's the best
value<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.630> feel<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.530> mills<00:02:55.680> today<00:02:56.270> my

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
value we feel for mills today my

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.910 
value we feel for mills today my
favorite<00:02:57.600> thing<00:02:57.720> about<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.930> Roland<00:02:58.320> is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
favorite thing about the Roland is

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.120 
favorite thing about the Roland is
basically<00:02:59.430> how<00:02:59.820> easy<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.440> operate<00:03:01.950> to

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
basically how easy it is to operate to

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.750 
basically how easy it is to operate to
maintain<00:03:02.520> it<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:03.840> runs<00:03:04.290> every<00:03:04.500> day<00:03:04.530> about<00:03:05.370> 20

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
maintain it just runs every day about 20

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.930 
maintain it just runs every day about 20
hours<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> day<00:03:06.650> hands-free<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:08.610> don't<00:03:08.790> touch

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
hours a day hands-free we don't touch

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.380 
hours a day hands-free we don't touch
anything

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
anything

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.540 
anything
we<00:03:10.110> just<00:03:10.290> changed<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.590> puck<00:03:10.830> change<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
we just changed the puck change the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.060 
we just changed the puck change the
birds<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.180> that's<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.709> life<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
birds and that's it the life of the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.550 
birds and that's it the life of the
spindle<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.550> 2,000<00:03:15.150> hours<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.380> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
spindle is 2,000 hours and so that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.530 
spindle is 2,000 hours and so that
should<00:03:16.800> last<00:03:17.010> for<00:03:17.430> quite<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.820> few<00:03:18.060> months<00:03:18.180> for<00:03:18.510> a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
should last for quite a few months for a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.180 
should last for quite a few months for a
full<00:03:18.810> time<00:03:19.080> operation<00:03:19.769> for<00:03:19.920> any<00:03:20.040> laboratory

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
full time operation for any laboratory

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.820 
full time operation for any laboratory
and<00:03:20.940> that's<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.720> great<00:03:21.959> value<00:03:22.290> proposition<00:03:22.799> for

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
and that's a great value proposition for

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.400 
and that's a great value proposition for
anybody

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.140 

one<00:03:29.410> major<00:03:29.680> benefit<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> rolling<00:03:30.820> mill<00:03:31.000> is

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
one major benefit to the rolling mill is

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.450 
one major benefit to the rolling mill is
that<00:03:31.360> uh<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.840> basically<00:03:32.170> runs<00:03:32.410> by<00:03:32.710> itself<00:03:33.040> even

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
that uh it basically runs by itself even

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.240 
that uh it basically runs by itself even
after<00:03:33.820> hours<00:03:34.320> we're<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.350> high<00:03:35.560> production<00:03:36.010> labs

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
after hours we're a high production labs

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.070 
after hours we're a high production labs
we<00:03:36.850> need<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.060> get<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.300> most<00:03:37.450> units<00:03:37.810> out<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:37.990> our

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
we need to get the most units out of our

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.470 
we need to get the most units out of our
machine<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.440> out<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.710> our<00:03:38.770> equipment<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:39.610> what

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
machine and out of our equipment so what

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.450 
machine and out of our equipment so what
we<00:03:40.570> do<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.870> we<00:03:40.960> have<00:03:41.020> two<00:03:41.200> shifts<00:03:41.440> here<00:03:41.770> on<00:03:42.040> our

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
we do is we have two shifts here on our

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.790 
we do is we have two shifts here on our
last<00:03:42.670> shift<00:03:43.030> maybe<00:03:43.210> around<00:03:43.450> 8:00<00:03:43.600> p.m.<00:03:43.800> the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
last shift maybe around 8:00 p.m. the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.140 
last shift maybe around 8:00 p.m. the
technician<00:03:45.220> will<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.550> load<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.940> puck

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
technician will just load the puck

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.270 
technician will just load the puck
change<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.960> tool<00:03:47.110> perhaps<00:03:47.410> if<00:03:47.590> required<00:03:47.950> and

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
change the tool perhaps if required and

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.400 
change the tool perhaps if required and
then<00:03:49.060> just<00:03:49.330> click<00:03:49.510> prints<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.110> machine

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
then just click prints to the machine

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.170 
then just click prints to the machine
and<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:51.010> machine<00:03:51.040> to<00:03:51.460> run<00:03:51.550> by<00:03:51.700> itself<00:03:51.970> for<00:03:52.090> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
and the machine to run by itself for the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:05.600 
and the machine to run by itself for the
next<00:03:52.360> four<00:03:52.540> hours<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:52.900> for<00:03:52.990> midnight

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.450 

yeah<00:04:06.480> if<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.870> had<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.200> describe<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.800> bowline<00:04:08.160> to

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
yeah if I had to describe a bowline to

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.540 
yeah if I had to describe a bowline to
the<00:04:08.550> one<00:04:08.730> word<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:10.130> probably<00:04:11.130> say<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.430> it's

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
the one word I probably say that it's

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.930 
the one word I probably say that it's
basically<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.510> invisible<00:04:13.020> meaning<00:04:13.940> we

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
basically it's invisible meaning we

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.780 
basically it's invisible meaning we
don't<00:04:15.030> notice<00:04:15.180> it's<00:04:15.420> there<00:04:15.600> it<00:04:16.080> does<00:04:16.290> its<00:04:16.440> job

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
don't notice it's there it does its job

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.490 
don't notice it's there it does its job
it<00:04:17.790> doesn't<00:04:18.000> ask<00:04:18.299> us<00:04:18.510> for<00:04:18.720> help<00:04:18.780> doesn't

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
it doesn't ask us for help doesn't

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.400 
it doesn't ask us for help doesn't
require<00:04:19.709> any<00:04:20.070> maintenance<00:04:21.030> or<00:04:21.600> work<00:04:22.109> or

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
require any maintenance or work or

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.490 
require any maintenance or work or
touches<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:24.030> machine<00:04:24.420> ran<00:04:24.930> right<00:04:25.200> out<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.410> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
touches the machine ran right out of the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.210 
touches the machine ran right out of the
box<00:04:25.710> no<00:04:26.460> glitches<00:04:27.030> no<00:04:27.300> gacho's<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.590> was<00:04:28.770> pretty

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
box no glitches no gacho's it was pretty

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.510 
box no glitches no gacho's it was pretty
much<00:04:29.400> just<00:04:29.660> plug<00:04:30.660> in<00:04:30.810> place<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.560> it's
