00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.410
 welcome to a series of videos 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.980
 tutorials where we will deal with the subject 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.670
 of wake on line or said otherwise 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.500
 wake up a computer remotely 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.830
 well let's see the requirements and the 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.250
 necessary applications for this 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.829
 objective well let's go to do 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.950
 a first introduction for us to see 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.560
 what is this about wake on line 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.450
 and little by little we will understand and you will see 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.140
 How simple and how powerful is this 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.840
 utility 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.670
 well the first thing we're going to see 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.670
 related to waking up a computer 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.340
 remotely if we search the internet 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.559
 we will obtain a lot of information 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.420
 where we in this case want 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.940
 observe this website 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.180
 It's worth where what interests me most 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.210
 reflect is that first we can 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.759
 wake up to a computer always and 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.369
 when you have for example a source of 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.420
 food type x because that's the way 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.570
 way your plate will be tx and it will support in 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.330
 99% of the cases will support the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.600
 remote ignition we also have another 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.159
 option and it's a very old one that I'm going to 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.159
 teach the image because it is the best 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.170
 that in this case to those cards 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.850
 network that what they had was a connection 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.290
 it was connected to the network card with a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.780
 cable of this type like the one you are 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.630
 seeing in the image and the other part of the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.540
 cable was going to the board to the connector that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.530
 you are looking here in red where also 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 puts in tiny world agree that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.290
 It was already a while ago but we still 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.450
 We can find some equipment where 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.540
 to be able to light them and have this 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.810
 type of network cards for example in 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.690
 pci slots that cable must go 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.330
 connected from the network card to the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.569
 plate if not the computer can not be 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.680
 awakened vale 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.950
 here you see a clearer picture of the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.079
 card the connector above is 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.109
 connected to the card which in turn is 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:32.620
 inserted in a PCI slot and then this 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:35.739
 cable goes connected to the plate according 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.349
 well nowadays and to all the plates that 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.209
 we found are type tx and not 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.200
 We will have no problem because all 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.299
 support 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.390
 walk according to what also 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.290
 we call wake on lan 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:54.090
 well done this introduction what 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.849
 we're going to do is see how to download the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.000
 the application is worth it but that's it 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.349
 We will see in the following video tutorial 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.349
 ok come on then
