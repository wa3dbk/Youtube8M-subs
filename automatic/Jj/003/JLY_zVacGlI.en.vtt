00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.250
 Designed by Makoto Yanase 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.270
 Casa Bago 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:19.390
 It is the first single-family house as a product house 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.390
 Hano texture is provided with a beautiful deep movement 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.110
 This should be in Fukuoka Prefecture or the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.770
 What is a basso 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:38.020
 It means that it is low in Italian 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:43.590
 Deep eaves extending from the street gable roof of the name 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.590
 Say he cut out a view of the outdoors at the calculated low 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:53.790
 That it is now that the commodity housing be ready in one of the drawings anywhere 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.150
 Like 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:03.160
 To make things cheap and high quality 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:06.760
 As we create things in was very highly ordered plan 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.310
 So it's also very structurally simple 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:15.299
 Also how to use Shi member becomes a space in the newspaper 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.800
 When it comes to rational, it is more than that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:23.530
 The version those Kogyo people like a 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.530
 I was most interested in making things 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.770
 me 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.040
 Do not pull out 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 There are two rooms with a high degree of freedom to sandwich the living 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.520
 Keeping a horizontal connection towards the direction of the eaves 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.920
 And I can say that only architects 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.290
 Commitment to the details 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.100
 Roof and wall joints and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.050
 How to cure the roll curtain 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.590
 By repeating adjustment of 1 mm unit 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.590
 You can feel beauty that is not theoretical 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.420
 The length of the eaves extending from the roof is 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.420
 1 meter 10 cm 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:14.030
 This space has long been loved by Japanese as an intermediate area connecting the outdoors and indoors 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.240
 Give me some space in my life 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.690
 But like a house of umbrellas because Hisashige 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.410
 Much that by saying or conflict holding an umbrella 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.950
 The age and comfort of the building change 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:33.080
 At the same time with such physical meaning 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:40.180
 For example, even when the turtle falls, you can live without window death 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.180
 We will have to enjoy this say raindrop Toka candy in life 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:51.390
 Usually when architects build custom homes 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:57.240
 It is said that 10% to 15% of the county construction costs will be spent as design costs 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:03.540
 However, the setting date included in the product housing is only 1% 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.990
 Providing architects homes at amazing prices through a streamlined cost-down scheme 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.450
 Are 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.170
 After all I think that family is the most valuable thing for humans 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.870
 so 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.770
 Such a family 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.750
 That 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:24.920
 A house where you can live at a reasonable distance 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.920
 While enjoying nature, I hope that you can live that way
