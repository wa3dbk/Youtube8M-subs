I<00:03:20.709> think<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:23.360> just<00:03:24.010> see<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.040> connections

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
I think you can just see the connections

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.010 
I think you can just see the connections
here<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.959> can<00:03:27.170> pair<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.470> with<00:03:27.620> NFC<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.750> top

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
here you can pair it with NFC the top

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.729 
here you can pair it with NFC the top
turn<00:03:30.800> on<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.310> turn<00:03:31.489> off<00:03:31.550> button<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.739> over

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
turn on and turn off button and over

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.120 
turn on and turn off button and over
this<00:03:33.950> one<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.520> can<00:03:34.550> see<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:35.150> let<00:03:35.420> which<00:03:35.780> is<00:03:36.130> the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
this one you can see to let which is the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.380 
this one you can see to let which is the
Bluetooth<00:03:37.640> connection

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
Bluetooth connection

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.300 
Bluetooth connection
and<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:39.380> charging<00:03:39.950> lead<00:03:40.640> indicator<00:03:42.130> there<00:03:43.130> is

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
and the charging lead indicator there is

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.420 
and the charging lead indicator there is
three<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.760> half<00:03:43.810> millimeter<00:03:44.810> jack<00:03:45.430> inputs

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
three and a half millimeter jack inputs

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.660 
three and a half millimeter jack inputs
and<00:03:46.720> there<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> micro<00:03:48.290> USB<00:03:48.319> connection<00:03:49.280> port

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
and there is a micro USB connection port

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.640 
and there is a micro USB connection port
and<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.170> USB<00:03:51.170> connection<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:54.020> board

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
and the USB connection this is the board

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.650 
and the USB connection this is the board
while<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:54.980> can<00:03:55.220> charge<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:56.720> device<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:58.660> the

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
while you can charge this device and the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.860 
while you can charge this device and the
speakers<00:04:00.260> are<00:04:01.510> both<00:04:02.510> of<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.020> sides<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.250> I

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
speakers are both of the sides so I

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.040 
speakers are both of the sides so I
expect<00:04:05.870> pretty<00:04:06.560> good<00:04:06.800> sounds<00:04:07.280> will<00:04:08.180> come<00:04:08.450> out

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
expect pretty good sounds will come out

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.560 
expect pretty good sounds will come out
from<00:04:09.440> this<00:04:09.590> box<00:04:10.069> on<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.780> bottom<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.470> can<00:04:12.590> see

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
from this box on the bottom you can see

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.659 
from this box on the bottom you can see
an<00:04:14.570> extra<00:04:15.400> three-and-a-half<00:04:16.400> millimeter

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
an extra three-and-a-half millimeter

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.449 
an extra three-and-a-half millimeter
jack<00:04:17.030> input<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:18.650> connect<00:04:19.070> with<00:04:19.160> this

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
jack input so you can connect with this

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.020 
jack input so you can connect with this
one<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:21.049> phone<00:04:21.320> or<00:04:21.530> or<00:04:21.829> anything<00:04:22.220> else<00:04:22.490> and

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
one to the phone or or anything else and

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.510 
one to the phone or or anything else and
the<00:04:23.180> devices<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:26.200> it's<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.350> rubber<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.460> a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
the devices and it's a rubber so it's a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.140 
the devices and it's a rubber so it's a
great<00:04:28.640> mood<00:04:29.000> rubber<00:04:29.919> so<00:04:30.919> that's<00:04:31.160> why<00:04:31.400> it's<00:04:31.430> if

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
great mood rubber so that's why it's if

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.170 
great mood rubber so that's why it's if
you<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.540> for<00:04:33.290> example<00:04:33.710> felt<00:04:34.520> this<00:04:34.700> one<00:04:35.000> down

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
you just for example felt this one down

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.170 
you just for example felt this one down
if<00:04:35.810> he's<00:04:36.080> fine<00:04:36.350> down<00:04:36.880> it<00:04:37.880> won't<00:04:38.510> be<00:04:38.720> hurt<00:04:39.230> or

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
if he's fine down it won't be hurt or

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.900 
if he's fine down it won't be hurt or
probably<00:04:41.180> won't<00:04:41.540> be<00:04:42.380> messed<00:04:42.680> up<00:04:42.950> I<00:04:43.250> would<00:04:43.880> just

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
probably won't be messed up I would just

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.170 
probably won't be messed up I would just
put<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.870> on<00:04:44.960> a<00:04:45.020> table<00:04:45.260> it's<00:04:45.710> pretty<00:04:46.010> heavy<00:04:46.280> okay

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
put it on a table it's pretty heavy okay

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.420 
put it on a table it's pretty heavy okay
let's<00:04:47.360> just<00:04:47.510> try<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.040> through<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.100> phone

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
let's just try it through the phone

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.310 
let's just try it through the phone
