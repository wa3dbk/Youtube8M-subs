00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
we did is put a new pump on it a new

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.359 
we did is put a new pump on it a new
belt<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:23.689> so<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.800> wanted<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.130> give<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.310> a

belt and so I just wanted to give you a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.870 
belt and so I just wanted to give you a
tip<00:00:26.609> about<00:00:26.760> putting<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> belt<00:00:27.449> on

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.330 

and<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> Bell<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.800> course<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.880> threaded

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
and so the Bell of course is threaded

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
and so the Bell of course is threaded
sort<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.880> pump<00:00:36.510> pulley<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:38.930> notice

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
sort of on the pump pulley and notice

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.569 
sort of on the pump pulley and notice
how<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> pump<00:00:40.469> comes<00:00:40.710> off<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> direction

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
how the pump comes off in the direction

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
how the pump comes off in the direction
the<00:00:41.790> pump<00:00:42.030> goes<00:00:42.500> as<00:00:43.820> well<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.930> inner<00:00:46.110> pulley

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the pump goes as well the inner pulley

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.590 
the pump goes as well the inner pulley
inside<00:00:47.160> here<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:50.399> belt<00:00:50.700> has<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.270> inside

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
inside here the belt has to go inside

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.310 
inside here the belt has to go inside
the<00:00:52.079> pulley<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.449> want<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> start<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the pulley and so you want to start this

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.790 
the pulley and so you want to start this
end<00:00:55.710> first<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.610> want<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.940> put<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.960> part

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
end first so you want to put this part

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.439 
end first so you want to put this part
of<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> belt<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.370> first<00:00:59.879> into<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> pulley<00:01:02.449> of

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
of the belt on first into the pulley of

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.510 
of the belt on first into the pulley of
course<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> want<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:05.720> not<00:01:06.720> mount<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.520> yet

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
course you want to not mount it up yet

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.170 
course you want to not mount it up yet
these<00:01:09.180> are<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> mount<00:01:09.860> nuts<00:01:10.860> there's<00:01:11.640> one

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
these are the mount nuts there's one

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.490 
these are the mount nuts there's one
there<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.560> there<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
there one there one there one there and

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.820 
there one there one there one there and
so<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.740> don't<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.159> those<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.610> yet<00:01:18.830> until

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so you don't put those on yet until

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.820 
so you don't put those on yet until
you've<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> belt<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.790> correctly<00:01:21.830> so

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you've got the belt on correctly so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.109 
you've got the belt on correctly so
basically<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.400> thread<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> through<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
basically you thread it through the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.359 
basically you thread it through the
pulley<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> wrap<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.159> around

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
pulley here and then you wrap it around

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.440 
pulley here and then you wrap it around
this<00:01:27.080> larger<00:01:28.080> pulley<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.280> spin<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.880> spin

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
this larger pulley and then spin it spin

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.069 
this larger pulley and then spin it spin
it<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> fully<00:01:32.820> wraps<00:01:33.150> around<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.780> pulley

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
it so the fully wraps around that pulley

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.020 
it so the fully wraps around that pulley
and<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.490> on

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and then it's on

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.450 
and then it's on
so<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.390> your<00:01:37.640> your<00:01:38.640> belt<00:01:39.479> tip<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.960> today

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
so that's your your belt tip for today

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.120 
so that's your your belt tip for today
