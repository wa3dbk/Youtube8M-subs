just<00:04:40.260> really<00:04:40.710> didn't<00:04:40.950> encounter<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.460> lot<00:04:41.550> of

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
just really didn't encounter a lot of

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.580 
just really didn't encounter a lot of
trainer<00:04:42.060> luck<00:04:42.360> just<00:04:42.600> because<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.170> line

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
trainer luck just because that line

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.010 
trainer luck just because that line
would<00:04:44.070> have<00:04:44.220> been<00:04:44.400> decimated<00:04:45.390> by<00:04:45.420> a<00:04:45.630> trainer

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
would have been decimated by a trainer

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.400 
would have been decimated by a trainer

as the to rescue energy that is

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.670 
as the to rescue energy that is
absolutely<00:04:55.470> critical<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:58.110> supporter

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
absolutely critical the the supporter

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.590 
absolutely critical the the supporter
line<00:04:58.890> is<00:04:59.160> a<00:04:59.190> lot<00:04:59.610> different<00:04:59.940> than<00:05:00.300> what<00:05:00.480> you're

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
line is a lot different than what you're

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.590 
line is a lot different than what you're
going<00:05:00.720> to<00:05:00.780> see<00:05:00.870> today<00:05:01.010> for<00:05:02.010> junk<00:05:02.310> arms<00:05:02.670> normal

a<00:05:13.470> few<00:05:14.370> plus<00:05:14.610> power<00:05:14.910> I'm<00:05:15.660> surprised<00:05:16.650> he<00:05:16.770> only

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
a few plus power I'm surprised he only

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.460 
a few plus power I'm surprised he only
runs<00:05:17.250> to<00:05:17.520> communication<00:05:18.240> I<00:05:18.420> was<00:05:19.200> really

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
runs to communication I was really

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.190 
runs to communication I was really
expecting<00:05:19.740> probably<00:05:20.400> three<00:05:20.850> revive<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:21.810> see

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
expecting probably three revive I see

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.620 
expecting probably three revive I see
almost<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.220> bit<00:05:23.340> of<00:05:23.430> a<00:05:23.490> surprise<00:05:23.610> considering<00:05:24.390> i

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
almost a bit of a surprise considering i

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.900 
almost a bit of a surprise considering i
would<00:05:24.780> only<00:05:24.810> see<00:05:25.200> elm<00:05:25.530> if<00:05:26.010> he<00:05:26.370> was<00:05:26.460> expecting<00:05:26.850> a

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
would only see elm if he was expecting a

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.190 
would only see elm if he was expecting a
lot<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.090> trainer<00:05:27.300> lock<00:05:27.540> but<00:05:27.840> if<00:05:27.990> he<00:05:28.110> was

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
lot of trainer lock but if he was

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.570 
lot of trainer lock but if he was
expecting<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.650> lot<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.830> trainer<00:05:29.010> luck<00:05:29.250> I'd<00:05:29.400> also

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
expecting a lot of trainer luck I'd also

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.190 
expecting a lot of trainer luck I'd also
see<00:05:29.850> more<00:05:30.030> cool<00:05:30.150> Abba<00:05:30.330> so<00:05:30.810> this<00:05:30.930> is<00:05:31.020> a<00:05:31.050> bit

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
see more cool Abba so this is a bit

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.150 
see more cool Abba so this is a bit
weird<00:05:33.170> toga<00:05:34.170> Gator<00:05:34.350> is<00:05:34.470> great<00:05:34.920> but<00:05:35.100> I

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
weird toga Gator is great but I

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.840 
weird toga Gator is great but I
typically<00:05:35.670> see<00:05:35.820> it<00:05:35.940> more<00:05:36.150> on<00:05:36.240> GPS<00:05:37.580> but<00:05:38.580> i<00:05:38.610> guess

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
typically see it more on GPS but i guess

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.310 
typically see it more on GPS but i guess
that<00:05:39.060> really<00:05:39.300> helped<00:05:39.540> him<00:05:39.630> get<00:05:39.750> out<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:40.080> turn

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
that really helped him get out that turn

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.760 
that really helped him get out that turn
one<00:05:40.530> collector<00:05:40.920> so<00:05:41.840> probably<00:05:42.840> not<00:05:43.080> a<00:05:43.140> bad<00:05:43.260> move

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
one collector so probably not a bad move

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.580 
one collector so probably not a bad move

you get through your deck really fast

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.300 
you get through your deck really fast
but<00:05:59.490> you're<00:05:59.910> also<00:06:00.390> gonna<00:06:01.020> have<00:06:01.230> a<00:06:01.290> I<00:06:01.710> mean<00:06:02.130> he

his deck in and out because a lot of
people<00:06:07.380> would<00:06:07.890> you<00:06:08.280> know<00:06:08.340> kind<00:06:08.550> of<00:06:08.670> lose<00:06:08.850> track

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
people would you know kind of lose track

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.260 
people would you know kind of lose track
and<00:06:09.710> for<00:06:10.710> your<00:06:10.830> opponent<00:06:10.980> if<00:06:11.670> you're<00:06:11.820> using<00:06:12.060> a

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
and for your opponent if you're using a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.720 
and for your opponent if you're using a
lot<00:06:12.510> of<00:06:12.540> these<00:06:12.810> it'd<00:06:13.710> be<00:06:13.860> very<00:06:13.890> easy<00:06:14.160> just<00:06:14.430> to

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
lot of these it'd be very easy just to

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.360 
lot of these it'd be very easy just to
stall<00:06:15.120> them<00:06:15.360> out<00:06:15.570> if<00:06:15.890> your<00:06:16.890> opponent<00:06:17.070> just

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
stall them out if your opponent just

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.700 
stall them out if your opponent just
really<00:06:17.610> wasn't<00:06:17.910> paying<00:06:17.940> attention<00:06:18.150> so<00:06:18.930> kind

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
really wasn't paying attention so kind

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.340 
really wasn't paying attention so kind
of<00:06:19.800> interest<00:06:20.100> his<00:06:20.910> build<00:06:21.240> is<00:06:21.420> a<00:06:21.630> lot<00:06:22.080> different

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
of interest his build is a lot different

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.100 
of interest his build is a lot different
than<00:06:22.740> I<00:06:22.800> thought<00:06:23.340> it<00:06:23.400> would<00:06:23.490> be<00:06:23.700> um<00:06:24.110> maybe

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
than I thought it would be um maybe

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.320 
than I thought it would be um maybe
that's<00:06:25.440> just<00:06:25.560> because<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:26.580> restful<00:06:27.060> oceans

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
that's just because the restful oceans

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.690 
that's just because the restful oceans
today<00:06:27.510> are<00:06:27.900> really<00:06:28.680> just<00:06:29.070> going<00:06:29.550> for

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
today are really just going for

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.780 
today are really just going for
consistency<00:06:31.130> but<00:06:32.130> just<00:06:32.340> yeah<00:06:32.520> it<00:06:32.640> was<00:06:32.760> a

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
consistency but just yeah it was a

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
consistency but just yeah it was a
little<00:06:32.880> different<00:06:33.150> than<00:06:33.450> what<00:06:33.720> I<00:06:33.750> thought

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
little different than what I thought

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.500 
little different than what I thought
it'd<00:06:34.140> be<00:06:34.170> but<00:06:34.500> more<00:06:35.190> props<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:35.669> them<00:06:35.760> that<00:06:36.330> is

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
it'd be but more props to them that is

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.120 
it'd be but more props to them that is
first<00:06:36.930> place<00:06:37.320> senior<00:06:37.950> division<00:06:38.430> champion

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
first place senior division champion

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.239 
first place senior division champion
like

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
like
