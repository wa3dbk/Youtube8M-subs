megapixel camera though it is just an 8
megapixel<00:00:18.300> camera<00:00:18.830> we<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:19.949> heard<00:00:20.100> good

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
megapixel camera we have heard good

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.279 
megapixel camera we have heard good
things<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.270> are<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> test

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
things about it so we are going to test

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.140 
things about it so we are going to test
it<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.369> both<00:00:23.580> these

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
it with this one because both these

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.210 
it with this one because both these
phones<00:00:24.420> are<00:00:24.600> actually<00:00:24.990> pretty<00:00:25.619> compact

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
1080p that's full HD and for making it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.920 
1080p that's full HD and for making it
fair<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.860> kept<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> settings<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.149> auto<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
fair I kept all the settings to auto and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.560 
fair I kept all the settings to auto and
the<00:00:52.500> experience<00:00:53.010> set<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.399> has<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.030> superior

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the experience set one has that superior

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.869 
the experience set one has that superior
auto<00:00:54.750> mode<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.770> when<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.010> keep<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.640> auto

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
auto mode but when you keep it on auto

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.240 
auto mode but when you keep it on auto
mode<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> pictures<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.170> takes<00:00:58.199> only<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.980> 8

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
mode the pictures it takes only at 8

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.459 
mode the pictures it takes only at 8
megapixel<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.239> comparable<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> what

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
megapixel so it's comparable to the what

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.160 
megapixel so it's comparable to the what
do<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> say<00:01:01.829> iPhone<00:01:02.250> 5s<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.270> we'll<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.960> doing

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
do you say iPhone 5s and we'll be doing

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
do you say iPhone 5s and we'll be doing
two<00:01:04.409> tests<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.369> test<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.150> I'll

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
did a better job because the video was a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.720 
did a better job because the video was a

a<00:03:59.250> little<00:03:59.370> bit<00:03:59.670> brighter<00:03:59.910> but<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.540> terms<00:04:00.810> of

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
a little bit brighter but in terms of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.170 
a little bit brighter but in terms of
sharpness<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:02.100> saidwhat<00:04:02.490> compact<00:04:02.940> went

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
say both of them did very well but I

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.980 
say both of them did very well but I
felt<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.490> colour<00:04:09.120> reproduction<00:04:09.600> was<00:04:09.930> a

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
felt the colour reproduction was a

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.380 
felt the colour reproduction was a
little<00:04:10.380> bit<00:04:10.530> better<00:04:10.890> on<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.370> iPhone<00:04:11.790> 5s<00:04:12.060> in

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
little bit better on the iPhone 5s in

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.290 
little bit better on the iPhone 5s in
terms<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.870> photograph<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:14.010> Xperia<00:04:14.820> z1

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.060 
was slightly overexposing in the static
pictures<00:04:18.360> Department<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.410> overall<00:04:19.830> I<00:04:19.950> would

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
pictures Department but overall I would

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.670 
pictures Department but overall I would
say<00:04:20.190> both<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.850> phones<00:04:21.270> do<00:04:21.690> an<00:04:21.810> incredible<00:04:22.410> job
