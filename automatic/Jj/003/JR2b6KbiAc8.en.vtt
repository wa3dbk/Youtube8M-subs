00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
made in the plugin and then I'm going to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.850 
made in the plugin and then I'm going to
just<00:00:31.980> quickly<00:00:32.160> show<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.149> plugin<00:00:33.860> so

just quickly show you the plugin so

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.229 
just quickly show you the plugin so
let's<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.160> go<00:00:35.280> through<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.910> think<00:00:36.120> there

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
let's just go through and I think there

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.990 
let's just go through and I think there
were<00:00:36.329> two<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.630> three<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.760> fixes<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> I

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
were two or three little fixes that I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
were two or three little fixes that I
made<00:00:39.390> between<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.260> episode<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> last

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
made between this episode and the last

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.090 
made between this episode and the last
episode<00:00:42.020> so<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.969> first<00:00:45.390> major<00:00:45.809> change<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
episode so the first major change that I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.090 
episode so the first major change that I
made<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:48.140> to<00:00:50.030> go<00:00:51.030> over<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:52.559> balanced<00:00:52.920> with

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
made is to go over to get balanced with

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.510 
made is to go over to get balanced with
the<00:00:53.219> player<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.789> now

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
the player it now

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.150 
the player it now
uses<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.789> takes<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.420> name<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.320> puts<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
uses it takes the name and it puts it to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.430 
uses it takes the name and it puts it to
lowercase<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.030> set<00:01:00.329> bounds<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.079> balanced

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
lowercase so set bounds and get balanced

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.889 
lowercase so set bounds and get balanced
use<00:01:01.949> lowercase<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.239> was<00:01:03.359> having<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:03.719> issue

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
use lowercase so I was having an issue

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.520 
use lowercase so I was having an issue
where<00:01:04.909> sometimes<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.689> name<00:01:06.900> would<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.260> saved

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
where sometimes the name would be saved

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
where sometimes the name would be saved
to<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> configuration<00:01:08.280> file<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.729> lower<00:01:08.909> case

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
to the configuration file in lower case

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.179 
to the configuration file in lower case
sometimes<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.869> uppercase<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
sometimes in uppercase and then it

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.609 
sometimes in uppercase and then it
wouldn't<00:01:11.490> work<00:01:11.850> correctly<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:13.530> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
wouldn't work correctly because like I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
wouldn't work correctly because like I
would<00:01:13.770> try<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.549> amount<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
would try to get the amount for the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.520 
would try to get the amount for the
player<00:01:16.170> name<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.180> stylized<00:01:18.780> an

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
player name out with like stylized an

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.859 
player name out with like stylized an
uppercase<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> would<00:01:21.780> be

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
uppercase like that but then it would be

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
uppercase like that but then it would be
saved<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.740> lowercase<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.619> then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
saved in lowercase like this and then

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.870 
saved in lowercase like this and then
the<00:01:27.509> values<00:01:28.020> would<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.680> different<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the values would be different and it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.289 
the values would be different and it
wouldn't<00:01:30.119> work<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:32.040> fixed<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.790> by<00:01:33.000> using

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
wouldn't work so I fixed that by using

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.539 
wouldn't work so I fixed that by using
locate<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.869> it'll<00:01:34.049> always<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.470> lowercase<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
locate so it'll always be lowercase and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.359 
locate so it'll always be lowercase and
we<00:01:35.759> won't<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> worry<00:01:36.240> about<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.600> issue

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
we won't have to worry about that issue

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.950 
we won't have to worry about that issue
second<00:01:38.369> thing<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.820> forgot<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.240> set<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
second thing is I forgot to set up the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.770 
second thing is I forgot to set up the
scoreboard<00:01:40.259> manager<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:42.329> added<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
scoreboard manager so I just added that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.440 
scoreboard manager so I just added that

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
before this channel maybe a year ago is

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.150 
before this channel maybe a year ago is
one<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> first<00:02:30.360> things<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.410> ever<00:02:31.560> made<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
one of the first things I ever made and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.890 
one of the first things I ever made and
it<00:02:32.640> basically<00:02:33.030> allows<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.520> use<00:02:35.900> money

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
it basically allows you to use money

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.890 
it basically allows you to use money
through<00:02:37.290> volt<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.950> buy<00:02:38.360> levels<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.510> experience

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
through volt to buy levels of experience

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.920 
through volt to buy levels of experience
yeah<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.519> wouldn't<00:02:41.519> use<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.819> now<00:02:42.180> because<00:02:42.720> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
yeah I wouldn't use it now because of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.550 
yeah I wouldn't use it now because of
the<00:02:43.110> staggered<00:02:44.239> experience<00:02:45.239> level<00:02:46.110> change

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the staggered experience level change

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.520 
the staggered experience level change
that<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:47.100> introduced<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.670> while<00:02:47.819> ago<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.930> back

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
that was introduced a while ago but back

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.509 
that was introduced a while ago but back
when<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.769> made<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.280> levels<00:02:50.910> were<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:53.310> wasn't

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
when I made it levels were it wasn't

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.210 
when I made it levels were it wasn't
staggered<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:55.260> know<00:02:55.350> it's<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.650> fine<00:02:55.860> tool

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
staggered I you know it's a fine tool

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.880 
staggered I you know it's a fine tool
for<00:02:56.670> testing<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.540> vault<00:02:57.810> integration<00:02:58.440> so

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
for testing the vault integration so

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.800 
for testing the vault integration so
first<00:02:59.220> load<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.670> run<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.910> Eco<00:03:00.209> command<00:03:00.600> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
first load and run the Eco command and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.780 
first load and run the Eco command and
you'll<00:03:00.900> see<00:03:01.140> says<00:03:02.010> my<00:03:02.280> balance<00:03:02.640> is<00:03:02.870> $10<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.790> have

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
you'll see says my balance is $10 I have

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.479 
you'll see says my balance is $10 I have
been<00:03:06.120> testing<00:03:06.780> with<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:07.980> set<00:03:08.340> my

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
been testing with this so I set my

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.570 
been testing with this so I set my
balance<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:09.930> $10<00:03:10.620> when<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.069> was<00:03:11.280> doing<00:03:11.430> some

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
balance to be $10 when I was doing some

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.570 
balance to be $10 when I was doing some
testing<00:03:12.150> earlier<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.470> let's<00:03:14.280> go<00:03:14.430> ahead<00:03:14.489> and

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
testing earlier so let's go ahead and

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.070 
testing earlier so let's go ahead and
test<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.090> two<00:03:15.239> command<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:15.690> let's<00:03:15.840> go<00:03:15.959> ahead

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
test the two command so let's go ahead

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
test the two command so let's go ahead
and<00:03:16.290> add<00:03:16.590> our<00:03:17.069> ten<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.870> we'll<00:03:19.019> say<00:03:19.140> added<00:03:19.470> $10

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
and add our ten and we'll say added $10

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.670 
and add our ten and we'll say added $10
folks<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.519> 29<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.180> then<00:03:21.329> out<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.540> $20<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.500> if<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
folks of 29 so then out of $20 and if I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.699 
folks of 29 so then out of $20 and if I
run<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.040> says<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.459> $20<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.840> had<00:03:25.079> 10<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.620> I

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
run it says I have $20 so I had 10 and I

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.699 
run it says I have $20 so I had 10 and I
added<00:03:25.920> 10<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.579> now<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:26.790> have<00:03:27.090> 20<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.440> let's<00:03:28.590> go

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
added 10 so now I have 20 so let's go

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.720 
added 10 so now I have 20 so let's go
ahead<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.980> do<00:03:29.130> eco<00:03:29.549> remove<00:03:30.170> holistic<00:03:31.730> 29:10

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
ahead and do eco remove holistic 29:10

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.390 
ahead and do eco remove holistic 29:10
so<00:03:33.450> let's<00:03:33.630> say<00:03:33.720> remove<00:03:34.079> $10<00:03:34.829> from<00:03:35.130> probably

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
so let's say remove $10 from probably

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.490 
so let's say remove $10 from probably
six<00:03:35.549> twenty<00:03:35.730> nine<00:03:35.880> out<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.299> ten<00:03:36.600> dollars<00:03:37.049> and

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
six twenty nine out of ten dollars and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.770 
six twenty nine out of ten dollars and
if<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.680> go<00:03:37.829> here<00:03:38.130> then<00:03:38.340> in<00:03:38.489> fact<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.090> money<00:03:39.329> was

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
if I go here then in fact the money was

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.150 
if I go here then in fact the money was
removed<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.720> Eco<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.230> built-in<00:03:43.650> command

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
removed so the Eco the built-in command

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.400 
removed so the Eco the built-in command
functionality<00:03:44.910> does<00:03:45.239> work<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.959> now<00:03:46.140> let<00:03:46.380> me

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
functionality does work so now let me

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.199 
functionality does work so now let me
just<00:03:46.500> show<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.400> Volt<00:03:48.440> integration<00:03:50.209> so

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
just show you the Volt integration so

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.660 
just show you the Volt integration so
we'll<00:03:51.600> go<00:03:51.720> ahead<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:52.290> over<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.500> buy<00:03:52.769> XP<00:03:53.340> and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
we'll go ahead and go over to buy XP and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.319 
we'll go ahead and go over to buy XP and
you<00:03:54.540> type<00:03:54.780> by<00:03:55.019> XP<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:55.709> then<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:55.980> level<00:03:56.329> there

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
you type by XP and then the level there

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.180 
you type by XP and then the level there
is<00:03:57.420> a<00:03:57.450> configuration<00:03:57.989> file<00:03:58.350> for<00:03:58.380> buy<00:03:58.739> XP<00:03:59.160> I

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
is a configuration file for buy XP I

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.979 
is a configuration file for buy XP I
think<00:03:59.579> that<00:03:59.730> each<00:03:59.940> level<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.390> currently<00:04:00.720> set

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
think that each level is currently set

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.690 
think that each level is currently set
at<00:04:01.910> $10<00:04:02.910> per<00:04:03.350> level<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:05.130> we'll<00:04:05.250> go<00:04:05.370> ahead<00:04:05.519> and

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
at $10 per level so we'll go ahead and

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.470 
at $10 per level so we'll go ahead and
do<00:04:06.150> buy<00:04:06.930> XP<00:04:07.530> one<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:08.790> will<00:04:08.940> say<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.150> bought

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
do buy XP one and it will say you bought

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.050 
do buy XP one and it will say you bought
one<00:04:09.780> level<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.410> spent<00:04:11.310> $10<00:04:12.950> so<00:04:13.950> we<00:04:14.670> go<00:04:14.819> back<00:04:14.850> to

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
one level and spent $10 so we go back to

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.390 
one level and spent $10 so we go back to
eco<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.959> will<00:04:16.109> see<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.350> my<00:04:16.500> balance<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:17.190> now

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
eco you will see that my balance is now

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.440 
eco you will see that my balance is now
$0<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.299> was<00:04:18.479> ten<00:04:19.049> before<00:04:19.639> but<00:04:20.639> vault<00:04:21.090> went

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
$0 it was ten before but vault went

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.120 
$0 it was ten before but vault went
ahead<00:04:21.599> and<00:04:21.870> took<00:04:22.109> away<00:04:22.430> $10

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
ahead and took away $10

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.650 
ahead and took away $10
that<00:04:24.460> works<00:04:26.460> see<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.580> final<00:04:28.030> thing<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.330> I

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
that works see the final thing that I

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.000 
that works see the final thing that I
want<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:28.930> show<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.140> is<00:04:29.380> let's<00:04:29.590> say<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:29.740> try<00:04:29.950> to

want to show you is let's say I try to
buy<00:04:30.160> another<00:04:30.520> level<00:04:30.850> but<00:04:31.390> I<00:04:31.450> don't<00:04:31.780> have<00:04:31.990> any

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
buy another level but I don't have any

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.130 
buy another level but I don't have any
money<00:04:32.410> you'll<00:04:33.100> see<00:04:33.250> an<00:04:33.340> error<00:04:33.520> has<00:04:33.670> occurred

insufficient funds the message they did
not<00:04:38.080> have<00:04:38.260> enough<00:04:38.320> money<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.580> message

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
not have enough money so the message

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.090 
not have enough money so the message
that<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.150> wrote<00:04:40.450> back<00:04:40.720> was<00:04:41.050> insufficient<00:04:41.800> funds

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
that I wrote back was insufficient funds

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.950 
that I wrote back was insufficient funds
and<00:04:42.460> that's<00:04:42.670> the<00:04:42.850> message<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.210> they<00:04:43.540> receive

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
and that's the message that they receive

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.710 
and that's the message that they receive
and<00:04:44.260> in<00:04:44.740> fact<00:04:44.980> if<00:04:45.100> I<00:04:45.130> go<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.310> eco<00:04:45.670> I<00:04:45.880> have<00:04:46.420> zero

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
and in fact if I go to eco I have zero

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.750 
and in fact if I go to eco I have zero
dollars<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.170> not<00:04:47.530> like<00:04:47.980> negative<00:04:48.430> ten

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
dollars and not like negative ten

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.720 
dollars and not like negative ten
dollars<00:04:49.180> or<00:04:49.390> something<00:04:49.810> like<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:50.700> so<00:04:51.700> I

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
dollars or something like that so I

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.520 
dollars or something like that so I
guess<00:04:52.180> that's<00:04:52.420> pretty<00:04:52.600> much<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:53.050> this<00:04:53.290> was

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
guess that's pretty much it this was

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.050 
guess that's pretty much it this was
just<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.920> very<00:04:54.070> basic<00:04:55.110> introduction<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:57.060> an

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
just a very basic introduction to an

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.750 
just a very basic introduction to an
economy<00:04:58.630> plug-in<00:04:59.080> it's<00:04:59.590> fully<00:05:00.010> working<00:05:00.550> and

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
economy plug-in it's fully working and

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.460 
economy plug-in it's fully working and
it<00:05:00.850> has<00:05:01.060> vault<00:05:01.390> support<00:05:01.840> which<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.200> pretty

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
it has vault support which is pretty

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.030 
it has vault support which is pretty
cool

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
cool

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.720 
cool
the<00:05:03.700> next<00:05:04.380> mini<00:05:05.380> series<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:06.100> I'm<00:05:06.220> going<00:05:06.520> to

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
the next mini series that I'm going to

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.270 
the next mini series that I'm going to
do<00:05:06.910> is<00:05:07.570> permissions<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:11.350> will<00:05:11.620> be<00:05:12.010> you<00:05:12.250> know

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
do is permissions that will be you know

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.730 
do is permissions that will be you know
another<00:05:12.610> five<00:05:13.150> or<00:05:13.450> six<00:05:13.690> part<00:05:13.960> series<00:05:13.990> maybe<00:05:14.650> a

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
another five or six part series maybe a

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.890 
another five or six part series maybe a
little<00:05:14.980> bit<00:05:15.100> more<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:16.420> will<00:05:16.660> basically

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
little bit more and that will basically

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.960 
little bit more and that will basically
cover<00:05:17.350> a<00:05:17.530> permissions<00:05:18.130> plug-in<00:05:18.520> with<00:05:18.670> adding

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
cover a permissions plug-in with adding

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.770 
cover a permissions plug-in with adding
and<00:05:19.060> removing<00:05:19.090> permissions<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:19.990> again<00:05:20.710> I

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
and removing permissions and again I

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.360 
and removing permissions and again I
guess<00:05:22.780> I'll<00:05:22.960> do<00:05:23.230> vault<00:05:23.530> integration<00:05:24.130> but<00:05:24.250> the

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
guess I'll do vault integration but the

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.880 
guess I'll do vault integration but the
real<00:05:24.520> thing<00:05:24.700> with<00:05:24.820> permissions<00:05:25.210> plugins<00:05:25.630> is

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
real thing with permissions plugins is

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.390 
real thing with permissions plugins is
bucket<00:05:26.890> integration<00:05:27.640> so<00:05:28.360> that<00:05:28.510> it<00:05:28.630> can<00:05:29.400> you

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
bucket integration so that it can you

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.950 
bucket integration so that it can you
know<00:05:30.430> it<00:05:30.730> so<00:05:30.880> that<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.090> can<00:05:31.210> integrate<00:05:31.510> with

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
know it so that it can integrate with

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.310 
know it so that it can integrate with
the<00:05:32.920> sender<00:05:33.490> dot<00:05:33.730> has<00:05:34.000> permission<00:05:34.690> the

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
the sender dot has permission the

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.170 
the sender dot has permission the
command<00:05:35.620> sender<00:05:35.920> has<00:05:36.130> permission<00:05:36.640> method<00:05:37.000> and

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
command sender has permission method and

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.240 
command sender has permission method and
all<00:05:37.570> of<00:05:37.690> those<00:05:37.780> different<00:05:38.020> things<00:05:38.230> so<00:05:38.860> that's

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
all of those different things so that's

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.410 
all of those different things so that's
going<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:39.700> be<00:05:40.090> pretty<00:05:40.630> important<00:05:41.760> so<00:05:42.760> that<00:05:43.180> is

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
going to be pretty important so that is

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.150 
going to be pretty important so that is
coming<00:05:43.660> soon<00:05:44.080> I<00:05:44.380> will<00:05:44.560> try<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:44.770> get<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.040> first

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
coming soon I will try to get the first

redo the Java tutorial series because
the<00:06:07.180> current<00:06:07.570> tutorial<00:06:07.810> series<00:06:08.410> is<00:06:08.860> old<00:06:09.760> and

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
the current tutorial series is old and

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.560 
the current tutorial series is old and
it's<00:06:11.860> not<00:06:12.070> very<00:06:12.880> good<00:06:13.120> I'm<00:06:13.360> gonna<00:06:13.480> be

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
want to read you the Java series because

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.790 
want to read you the Java series because
it's<00:06:19.540> very<00:06:19.630> important<00:06:20.110> that<00:06:20.230> you<00:06:20.320> know<00:06:20.470> Java

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
it's very important that you know Java

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.610 
it's very important that you know Java
before<00:06:21.120> you<00:06:22.120> start<00:06:22.360> trying<00:06:22.720> to<00:06:22.900> tackle<00:06:23.110> bucket

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
before you start trying to tackle bucket

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.240 
before you start trying to tackle bucket
so<00:06:24.900> that's<00:06:25.900> that<00:06:26.410> is<00:06:26.650> basically<00:06:26.920> where<00:06:27.130> we're

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250

so that's that is basically where we're
don'ting<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:27.700> I<00:06:27.790> know<00:06:27.850> that<00:06:28.210> 2,000

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870
