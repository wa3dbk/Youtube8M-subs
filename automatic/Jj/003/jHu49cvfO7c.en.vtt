00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello I am home winemaker jules 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.490
 our lives our today I'm going 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.440
 answer the question how to choose 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.269
 his wine at the restaurant then the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.940
 restaurant is a privileged place 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.010
 where to drink wine why generally 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.810
 we go there to eat well and in France 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.580
 when we eat well we want to good 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.710
 to drink but when choosing the wine 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.359
 if you do not know it, it becomes 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.849
 really a jungle 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 amazing so some restaurants 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 upscale have sommeliers who 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.489
 can guide you and give you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.640
 choice of wines according to the dishes 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.550
 it's the easiest but in general these 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960
 restaurants there are not data and so 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 in the other restaurants but you 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.489
 find yourself without a card 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.530
 wines is very often it takes the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.489
 to say incomprehensible what are you going 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.789
 find in the wine list it's 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.010
 the sparkling red rosy white colors 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.520
 that's easy when they're a bit 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.120
 better done 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.410
 you also have the regions but if you 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.510
 do not know anything that does not give you 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.570
 many indications - between a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 Côtes-du-Rhône and a Bordeaux where a 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.470
 hillside of the Var do not know too much 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.659
 you are going to have to question the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.460
 servers and if they do not know you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.840
 reply 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.820
 if it's a little bistro the boss of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 restaurant based on the answers that 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.640
 will give you on your questions about 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.490
 the wine list you will be able to 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.159
 find out if they really chose 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.720
 the wines and if they tasted them more they 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.729
 remain unclear - they are able to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.170
 give you an answer more you can 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.810
 tell you that the wines were not 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.189
 well selected if there is little 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.079
 information on the map if you 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.430
 can not find it and that 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.720
 you have hesitated between 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.549
 bottles asked to see the bottle 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.630
 because the bottle will carry all 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.159
 indications that will allow you 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.930
 to judge whether the wine deserves to be purpose or 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.390
 not a few tips in the little ones 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.649
 bistros in small restaurants 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.990
 favor the 20 young 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.549
 why because often wines to 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.229
 small prices it's wines that have to 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.579
 to drink young so if they have more than 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.469
 three or four years you can you 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.780
 say the wines they will be a little finished a 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.960
 little on the end and not very good worth 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.990
 better today for example in 2011 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.810
 drink red wines from 2008 2009 drink 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.550
 white wines from 2009 2010 we are sure 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.900
 that they will still be on their youth 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.489
 and scented 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.150
 on the other hand for the more expensive 20 who 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.790
 exceeds 30 40 50 or even 150 euros on 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.220
 the map this will be often wines 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.900
 guard your big ribs of the Rhône des 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.140
 great Bordeaux and there it is better that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.019
 the vintage is a bit older if 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.150
 you have a hermitage for example in 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.459
 ribs of the rhone or a châteauneuf du pape 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.569
 or a medoc of 2008 à la carte you 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.819
 can you tell he's going to be too much 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.769
 young and not pleasant privileged of 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.780
 wines that are rather with five years of age 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.159
 today in 2011 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.010
 prefer wines 2006 2005 or even 2003 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.329
 2002 of the older years that make 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.760
 a wine that will already be balanced 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.379
 in conclusion the wine list of 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.909
 restaurants it is not made for 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.620
 the neophytes is made for those who are there 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.980
 know so do not hesitate to ask 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.290
 questions ask to taste the wine to 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.730
 see the bottle and Sylvain do you 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.970
 please not at all if it is corked 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.150
 if he has a fault you may have to 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.970
 send it back by asking for another wine 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.769
 here you have now in hand 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.459
 some clues to help you better 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.459
 choose the wine at the restaurant
