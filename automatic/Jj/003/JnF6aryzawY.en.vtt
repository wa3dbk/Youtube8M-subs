you've<00:00:30.770> got<00:00:30.950> multiple<00:00:31.669> tracks<00:00:32.180> one<00:00:33.110> track<00:00:33.410> per

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
you've got multiple tracks one track per

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.260 
you've got multiple tracks one track per
instrument<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:34.370> in<00:00:34.550> this<00:00:34.670> case<00:00:34.910> we<00:00:35.090> have<00:00:35.239> a

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
instrument so in this case we have a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.450 
instrument so in this case we have a
second<00:00:36.020> guitar<00:00:36.320> track<00:00:36.620> which<00:00:36.890> has<00:00:37.129> its<00:00:37.309> own

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
my best method of practice is to slow it

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.169 
my best method of practice is to slow it
down<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.469> break<00:00:48.679> it<00:00:48.859> down<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:49.909> that's<00:00:50.030> what

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
down and break it down so that's what

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:51.399 
down and break it down so that's what

first we're going to go ahead and give

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.910 
first we're going to go ahead and give
the<00:01:04.640> song<00:01:04.850> a<00:01:04.879> quick<00:01:05.239> a<00:01:05.720> quick<00:01:06.110> run<00:01:06.440> on<00:01:06.620> a<00:01:06.650> few

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
the song a quick a quick run on a few

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:20.590 
the song a quick a quick run on a few
measures<00:01:07.310> at<00:01:07.580> full<00:01:07.940> speed<00:01:08.240> here<00:01:08.780> we<00:01:08.870> go

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.180 

next<00:01:21.600> we're<00:01:21.720> gonna<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.990> ahead<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.530> slow<00:01:23.040> it

next we're gonna go ahead and slow it
down<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.580> break<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.910> down<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.480> if<00:01:24.660> I<00:01:24.780> were<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
down and break it down so if I were to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
down and break it down so if I were to
start<00:01:25.350> learning<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:25.950> song<00:01:26.190> today<00:01:26.430> first

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
start learning this song today first

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.370 
start learning this song today first
thing<00:01:27.120> I'm<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.480> do<00:01:27.660> is<00:01:27.780> slow<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.050> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
thing I'm going to do is slow down the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.170 
thing I'm going to do is slow down the
tempo<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.160> we'll<00:01:29.310> go<00:01:29.400> ahead<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.640> click<00:01:29.910> on<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
tempo so we'll go ahead and click on the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.980 
tempo so we'll go ahead and click on the
tempo<00:01:30.600> button<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.410> toolbar<00:01:32.690> full<00:01:33.690> speed

of the song is 156 beats per minute

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.010 
of the song is 156 beats per minute
we're<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:39.000> ahead<00:01:39.120> and<00:01:39.270> lower<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:39.630> down

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
we're gonna go ahead and lower that down

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.469 
we're gonna go ahead and lower that down
to<00:01:40.229> let's<00:01:40.410> say<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> hundred<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.420> apply<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
to let's say a hundred and apply the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.400 
to let's say a hundred and apply the
tempo<00:01:42.930> change<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.410> the<00:01:43.500> entire<00:01:43.770> song<00:01:45.050> next<00:01:46.050> I'm

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
tempo change to the entire song next I'm

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.160 
tempo change to the entire song next I'm
going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.890> concentrate<00:01:47.630> simply<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.840> learning

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
going to concentrate simply on learning

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.910 
going to concentrate simply on learning
measure<00:01:50.040> number<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.000> point<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.360> time

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
measure number one at this point in time

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.700 
measure number one at this point in time
so<00:01:52.920> we're<00:01:53.550> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> set<00:01:53.910> up<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:54.119> repeat<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:55.050> loop

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
so we're going to set up a repeat a loop

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.060 
so we're going to set up a repeat a loop
if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> will<00:01:56.220> of<00:01:56.400> measure<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
if you will of measure one to do that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.340 
if you will of measure one to do that
we're<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.400> to<00:01:59.490> add<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.060> repeat<00:02:00.479> bar<00:02:00.690> at<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
we're going to add a repeat bar at the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.800 
we're going to add a repeat bar at the
end<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:02.070> measure<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:03.380> choose<00:02:04.380> composition

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
end of measure one choose composition

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
end of measure one choose composition
close<00:02:06.810> repeat<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.470> we'll<00:02:08.310> tell<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> repeat

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
close repeat and we'll tell it to repeat

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.340 
close repeat and we'll tell it to repeat
ten<00:02:09.149> times<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.950> also<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> add<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:12.350> lead-in

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
ten times I also like to add a lead-in

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.030 
ten times I also like to add a lead-in
measure<00:02:14.450> for<00:02:15.450> each<00:02:15.600> practice<00:02:16.590> loop<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.010> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
measure for each practice loop that I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.650 
measure for each practice loop that I
