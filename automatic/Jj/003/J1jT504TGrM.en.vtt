in<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.209> tutorial<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.869> will<00:00:15.900> learn<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> little

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
in this tutorial we will learn a little

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.810 
in this tutorial we will learn a little
bit<00:00:16.619> more<00:00:16.680> about<00:00:17.039> motion<00:00:17.310> layering

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
bit more about motion layering

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.550 
bit more about motion layering
especially<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.630> absolute<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.410> relative

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
especially about absolute and relative

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.890 
especially about absolute and relative
layering<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.759> notice<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.390> scene<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.750> have

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
layering so notice in this scene I have

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080 
layering so notice in this scene I have
a<00:00:21.930> lady<00:00:22.200> just<00:00:22.500> walking<00:00:22.860> along<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:23.939> we're

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
a lady just walking along so what we're

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
a lady just walking along so what we're
gonna<00:00:24.180> do<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:25.439> open<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
gonna do is is we're open up the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.550 
gonna do is is we're open up the
timeline<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.810> notice<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:28.020> on<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.230> motion

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
timeline and notice here on the motion

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.729 
timeline and notice here on the motion
layer<00:00:28.710> at<00:00:28.980> 0<00:00:29.369> 1<00:00:29.640> she<00:00:30.210> has<00:00:30.360> this<00:00:30.570> pose<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.079> as<00:00:31.529> we

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
layer at 0 1 she has this pose and as we

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.709 
layer at 0 1 she has this pose and as we
play<00:00:31.950> along<00:00:32.099> she<00:00:32.610> keeps<00:00:32.879> that<00:00:33.059> pose<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.540> her

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
play along she keeps that pose and her

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.380 
play along she keeps that pose and her
arm<00:00:33.930> moves<00:00:34.170> along<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.680> frame<00:00:35.550> 60<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.329> her

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
arm moves along at frame 60 we want her

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.639 
arm moves along at frame 60 we want her
to<00:00:36.510> keep<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.870> pose<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.530> gonna

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to keep that pose so I'm just gonna

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.470 
to keep that pose so I'm just gonna
double<00:00:38.040> click<00:00:38.129> creating<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> keyframe<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
double click creating a keyframe and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.150 
double click creating a keyframe and
it's<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.079> gonna<00:00:40.230> keep<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> keyframe<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it's just gonna keep the keyframe with a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.410 
it's just gonna keep the keyframe with a
motion<00:00:41.520> layer<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.760> she<00:00:41.940> already<00:00:42.090> has

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
motion layer that she already has

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.310 
motion layer that she already has
however<00:00:43.289> at<00:00:43.559> keyframe<00:00:44.010> 90<00:00:44.960> I'm<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.260> add

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
however at keyframe 90 I'm going to add

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.259 
however at keyframe 90 I'm going to add
in<00:00:46.499> another<00:00:46.620> keyframe<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:47.699> gonna<00:00:47.940> open<00:00:48.059> up

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
in another keyframe I'm gonna open up

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.329 
in another keyframe I'm gonna open up
the<00:00:48.390> Edit<00:00:48.749> motion<00:00:49.170> layer<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.159> going

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
the Edit motion layer and we are going

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.520 
the Edit motion layer and we are going
to<00:00:50.460> change<00:00:50.789> her<00:00:51.120> arm<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.749> position<00:00:52.199> over<00:00:52.260> arm

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to change her arm the position over arm

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
to change her arm the position over arm
was<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> timeline<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> way<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
was get the timeline out of the way and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
was get the timeline out of the way and
we're<00:00:54.929> gonna<00:00:55.079> create<00:00:55.350> animation<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.039> her

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
we're gonna create animation of her

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
we're gonna create animation of her
putting<00:00:56.339> her<00:00:56.460> hand<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:56.969> above<00:00:57.179> her<00:00:57.479> brow<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
putting her hand just above her brow to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.149 
putting her hand just above her brow to
shield<00:00:58.499> her<00:00:58.679> eyes<00:00:58.859> from<00:00:59.159> the<00:00:59.249> Sun<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.769> do<00:01:01.949> so

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
shield her eyes from the Sun so to do so

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.280 
shield her eyes from the Sun so to do so
let's<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.789> ahead<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:02.969> grab<00:01:03.749> the<00:01:03.899> arm<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
let's go ahead and grab the arm and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.100 
let's go ahead and grab the arm and
let's<00:01:04.800> use<00:01:05.040> rotate<00:01:05.580> tool<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.659> bring<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> arm

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
let's use rotate tool to bring the arm

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.300 
let's use rotate tool to bring the arm
up<00:01:08.720> let's<00:01:09.720> grab<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.170> arm<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> low<00:01:11.100> on

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
up let's grab this arm here the low on

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.270 
up let's grab this arm here the low on
move<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> down<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:15.740> let's<00:01:16.740> move<00:01:16.980> it<00:01:17.100> down

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
move it down a little let's move it down

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
move it down a little let's move it down
in<00:01:17.520> position<00:01:20.660> rotate<00:01:21.660> it<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:21.840> bit<00:01:22.140> all

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
in position rotate it a little bit all

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.650 
in position rotate it a little bit all
right<00:01:23.010> so<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:23.640> our<00:01:23.790> hand<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.210> shielding<00:01:24.570> her

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
right so now our hand is shielding her

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.290 
right so now our hand is shielding her
eyes<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.260> Sun<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> let's<00:01:26.790> get<00:01:27.000> back<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
eyes from the Sun so let's get back to

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.690 
eyes from the Sun so let's get back to
the<00:01:27.420> beginning<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.960> press<00:01:28.230> play<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the beginning and press play so now you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.850 
the beginning and press play so now you
see<00:01:30.000> her<00:01:30.120> arm<00:01:30.300> goes<00:01:30.570> up<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.290> since<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.710> use

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
see her arm goes up but since we use

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.920 
see her arm goes up but since we use
relative<00:01:32.430> motion<00:01:32.820> layer<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.450> her<00:01:33.720> arm

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
relative motion layer we see her arm

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.540 
relative motion layer we see her arm
seems<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.440> Bob<00:01:34.650> along<00:01:35.010> with<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> original

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
seems to Bob along with the original

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.660 
seems to Bob along with the original
animation<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:40.200> let<00:01:40.920> me<00:01:41.010> show<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.250> how<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.400> can

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
animation and let me show you how we can

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.390 
animation and let me show you how we can
fix<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.900> let's<00:01:43.050> go<00:01:43.110> back<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.380> keyframe<00:01:43.890> 90

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
fix that so let's go back to keyframe 90

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.130 
fix that so let's go back to keyframe 90
where<00:01:44.850> our<00:01:44.970> hand<00:01:45.240> comes<00:01:45.510> up<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.810> her<00:01:45.930> face

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
where our hand comes up to her face

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.070 
where our hand comes up to her face
shoulder<00:01:46.860> eyes<00:01:47.040> from<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.400> Sun<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.970> let's<00:01:48.930> go

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
shoulder eyes from the Sun and let's go

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.780 
shoulder eyes from the Sun and let's go
back<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.500> Edit<00:01:49.770> motion<00:01:50.130> layer<00:01:50.250> panel<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
back to the Edit motion layer panel and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.080 
back to the Edit motion layer panel and
go<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> set<00:01:51.660> absolute<00:01:52.320> bones<00:01:52.670> now<00:01:53.670> since<00:01:53.940> we

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
go to set absolute bones now since we

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.700 
go to set absolute bones now since we
have<00:01:54.270> our<00:01:54.300> left<00:01:54.600> arm<00:01:54.840> here<00:01:55.230> and<00:01:55.410> we<00:01:55.500> don't<00:01:55.620> want

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
have our left arm here and we don't want

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.830 
have our left arm here and we don't want
it<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.980> flop<00:01:56.250> around<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.820> she<00:01:57.000> walks<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.690> we

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it to flop around as she walks what we

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.270 
it to flop around as she walks what we
want<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.140> do<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.440> set<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.680> bones<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.190> be

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
want to do is set the bones to be

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.700 
want to do is set the bones to be
absolute<00:01:59.760> so<00:02:00.240> go<00:02:00.420> ahead<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.630> highlight<00:02:01.230> our

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
absolute so go ahead and highlight our

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.100 
absolute so go ahead and highlight our
entire<00:02:02.130> left<00:02:02.400> arm<00:02:02.730> this<00:02:03.300> will<00:02:03.540> lock<00:02:03.690> her<00:02:03.870> arm

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
entire left arm this will lock her arm

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.649 
entire left arm this will lock her arm
into<00:02:04.320> position

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
into position

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.350 
into position
so<00:02:06.560> when<00:02:06.829> we<00:02:06.950> stop<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:07.789> play<00:02:08.060> it<00:02:08.179> back

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
so when we stop this and play it back

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.940 
so when we stop this and play it back
watch<00:02:09.170> what<00:02:09.380> happens

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
watch what happens

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.890 
watch what happens
she<00:02:10.429> puts<00:02:10.610> her<00:02:10.670> arm<00:02:10.880> up<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:11.239> she<00:02:11.540> holds<00:02:11.810> it

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
she puts her arm up and she holds it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.030 
she puts her arm up and she holds it
there<00:02:11.930> without<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.620> motion<00:02:12.770> layer

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
there without the motion layer

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.710 
there without the motion layer
interfering<00:02:13.760> with<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:13.970> animation<00:02:16.540> now<00:02:17.540> let

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
interfering with the animation now let

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.089 
interfering with the animation now let
me<00:02:17.810> show<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.080> how<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.260> can<00:02:18.500> take<00:02:18.769> her<00:02:18.890> arm

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
me show you how you can take her arm

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.180 
me show you how you can take her arm
back<00:02:19.430> down<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:20.420> we<00:02:20.569> have<00:02:20.750> 90<00:02:21.319> where<00:02:21.800> she<00:02:21.980> puts

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
back down so we have 90 where she puts

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.330 
back down so we have 90 where she puts
her<00:02:22.250> arm<00:02:22.459> up<00:02:22.670> let's<00:02:23.090> go<00:02:23.239> ahead<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.510> copy<00:02:23.720> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
her arm up let's go ahead and copy that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.949 
her arm up let's go ahead and copy that
let's<00:02:25.340> say<00:02:25.489> we'll<00:02:25.670> hold<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.630> pose

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
let's say we'll hold that that pose

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.290 
let's say we'll hold that that pose
until<00:02:27.290> 190<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.700> we'll<00:02:28.819> just<00:02:28.940> go<00:02:29.030> ahead<00:02:29.090> and

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
until 190 so we'll just go ahead and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.920 
until 190 so we'll just go ahead and
paste<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.690> keyframe<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:32.360> here<00:02:32.750> at

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
paste that keyframe there then here at

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.270 
paste that keyframe there then here at
210<00:02:34.150> what<00:02:35.150> we'll<00:02:35.330> do<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.660> use<00:02:35.840> reset<00:02:36.560> pose<00:02:36.890> and

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
210 what we'll do is use reset pose and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.860 
210 what we'll do is use reset pose and
then<00:02:37.700> her<00:02:37.849> arm<00:02:38.060> will<00:02:38.239> go<00:02:38.330> back<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.690> whatever

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
then her arm will go back to whatever

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.750 
then her arm will go back to whatever
the<00:02:39.049> pose<00:02:39.380> was<00:02:39.650> that's<00:02:39.980> original<00:02:40.489> for<00:02:40.730> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
the pose was that's original for the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.240 
the pose was that's original for the
animation<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:41.780> let's<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.019> ahead<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.230> stop<00:02:42.500> and

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
animation so let's go ahead and stop and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.009 
animation so let's go ahead and stop and
play<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.610> back<00:02:43.790> we<00:02:44.180> get<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.330> timeline<00:02:44.780> out<00:02:44.959> of

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
play that back we get a timeline out of

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.020 
play that back we get a timeline out of
the<00:02:45.080> way<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.680> she<00:02:45.709> brings<00:02:46.010> our<00:02:46.099> arm<00:02:46.250> up<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
the way so she brings our arm up and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.670 
the way so she brings our arm up and
then<00:02:47.209> she<00:02:47.330> brings<00:02:47.540> our<00:02:47.630> arm<00:02:47.780> back<00:02:47.989> down<00:02:48.230> and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
then she brings our arm back down and

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.880 
then she brings our arm back down and
continues<00:02:49.160> on<00:02:49.310> with<00:02:49.340> our<00:02:49.519> animation<00:02:50.860> but<00:02:51.860> I

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
continues on with our animation but I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.680 
continues on with our animation but I
didn't<00:02:52.190> like<00:02:52.340> how<00:02:52.370> quickly<00:02:52.849> that<00:02:53.120> blend<00:02:53.450> was

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
didn't like how quickly that blend was

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.479 
didn't like how quickly that blend was
between<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.230> absolute<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:54.890> relative<00:02:55.010> so

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
between the absolute and relative so

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.550 
between the absolute and relative so
what<00:02:55.670> I'm<00:02:55.790> going<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.030> do<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:57.079> is<00:02:57.140> where<00:02:57.440> my

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
what I'm going to do is this is where my

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.009 
what I'm going to do is this is where my
absolute<00:02:58.010> was<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.579> before<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.630> would<00:02:59.810> be<00:02:59.870> a

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
absolute was and before it would be a

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.080 
absolute was and before it would be a
sharp<00:03:00.470> contrast<00:03:01.069> between<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.519> two<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:01.819> I<00:03:01.880> can

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
sharp contrast between the two but I can

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.630 
sharp contrast between the two but I can
actually<00:03:02.239> extend<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:02.959> out<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:04.190> make<00:03:04.459> that

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
actually extend this out and make that

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.360 
actually extend this out and make that
animation<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.510> little<00:03:05.690> bit<00:03:05.810> slower<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:07.220> now

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
animation a little bit slower so now

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.100 
animation a little bit slower so now
we'll<00:03:07.610> see<00:03:07.849> that<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.090> animation<00:03:08.690> between<00:03:08.840> the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
we'll see that the animation between the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.319 
we'll see that the animation between the
absolute<00:03:09.500> -<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.100> relative<00:03:10.579> will<00:03:10.970> be<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> little

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
absolute - the relative will be a little

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.240 
absolute - the relative will be a little
bit<00:03:11.540> longer<00:03:11.780> drawn<00:03:12.170> out<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.560> little<00:03:12.829> smoother

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
bit longer drawn out a little smoother

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.340 
bit longer drawn out a little smoother
animation<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.510> can<00:03:14.690> blend<00:03:14.900> those<00:03:15.079> two

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
animation so we can blend those two

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.809 
animation so we can blend those two
together<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:15.739> let<00:03:16.010> me<00:03:16.100> get<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.280> timeline<00:03:16.640> all

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
together so let me get the timeline all

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.210 
together so let me get the timeline all
the<00:03:16.880> way<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.209> we<00:03:17.660> can<00:03:17.840> watch<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.859> you<00:03:18.920> can<00:03:19.040> see

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
the way and we can watch so you can see

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.280 
the way and we can watch so you can see
how<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.400> blending<00:03:20.269> of<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.540> motions<00:03:20.900> between

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
how the blending of the motions between

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.410 
how the blending of the motions between
absolute<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.130> relative<00:03:22.340> can<00:03:23.150> be<00:03:23.239> made

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
absolute and relative can be made

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.780 
absolute and relative can be made
possible<00:03:23.829> so<00:03:24.829> that's<00:03:25.010> how<00:03:25.160> we<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.489> use<00:03:25.639> the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
possible so that's how we can use the

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.000 
possible so that's how we can use the
motion<00:03:26.120> layer<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:26.780> edit<00:03:27.109> our<00:03:27.319> animation

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
motion layer to edit our animation

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.190 
motion layer to edit our animation
sequences<00:03:28.549> using<00:03:29.239> relative<00:03:29.690> bones<00:03:29.900> and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
sequences using relative bones and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:50.479 
sequences using relative bones and
absolute<00:03:31.040> bones

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.640 

in<00:03:51.489> that<00:03:51.610> last<00:03:51.819> video<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.299> saw<00:03:52.659> clone<00:03:53.019> bono<00:03:53.409> of

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
in that last video you saw clone bono of

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.009 
in that last video you saw clone bono of
yours<00:03:54.069> truly<00:03:54.489> as<00:03:54.670> well<00:03:55.120> as<00:03:55.269> a<00:03:55.299> clone<00:03:55.569> bone<00:03:55.780> of<00:03:55.959> a

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
yours truly as well as a clone bone of a

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.679 
yours truly as well as a clone bone of a
lamp<00:03:56.260> bouncing<00:03:56.829> around<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.549> horse<00:03:57.819> now<00:03:58.480> let

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
lamp bouncing around and a horse now let

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.179 
lamp bouncing around and a horse now let
me<00:03:58.810> demonstrate<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.680> how<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.859> actually

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
me demonstrate to you how I actually

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.460 
me demonstrate to you how I actually
made<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.640> animation<00:04:01.120> for<00:04:01.299> that<00:04:01.450> horse<00:04:01.689> so<00:04:02.260> we

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
made the animation for that horse so we

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.319 
made the animation for that horse so we
have<00:04:02.650> here<00:04:03.129> we<00:04:03.280> added<00:04:03.609> in<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.790> horse<00:04:04.030> from<00:04:04.239> our

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
have here we added in a horse from our

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.569 
have here we added in a horse from our
actors<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:05.049> we<00:04:05.470> can<00:04:05.590> just<00:04:05.709> go<00:04:05.859> to<00:04:05.920> animation

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
actors and we can just go to animation

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.149 
actors and we can just go to animation
and<00:04:06.700> go<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.209> edit<00:04:07.390> motion<00:04:07.870> layer<00:04:07.989> now<00:04:08.709> unlike

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
and go to edit motion layer now unlike

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.949 
and go to edit motion layer now unlike
editing<00:04:09.700> motion<00:04:10.060> layer<00:04:10.150> for<00:04:10.510> biped

actually<00:04:13.720> navigate<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.290> those<00:04:14.409> bones<00:04:14.709> at

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
actually navigate to those bones at

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.979 
actually navigate to those bones at
first<00:04:15.879> that<00:04:16.060> might<00:04:16.269> seem<00:04:16.479> a<00:04:16.539> little<00:04:16.750> daunting

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
first that might seem a little daunting

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.689 
first that might seem a little daunting
having<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.620> go<00:04:17.709> through<00:04:17.739> all<00:04:17.949> the<00:04:18.220> sub<00:04:18.459> notes

having to go through all the sub notes

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.400 
having to go through all the sub notes
to<00:04:18.880> find<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.239> actual<00:04:19.570> bone<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.900> want<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.229> get

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
to find the actual bone you want to get

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.920 
to find the actual bone you want to get
to<00:04:20.590> but<00:04:21.160> it's<00:04:21.340> actually<00:04:21.669> pretty<00:04:21.850> easy<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.750> for

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
to but it's actually pretty easy so for

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.120 
to but it's actually pretty easy so for
instance<00:04:23.229> if<00:04:23.350> we<00:04:23.470> want<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.740> move<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:23.979> head

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.070 
instance if we want to move the head
around<00:04:24.370> for<00:04:24.639> our<00:04:24.729> horse<00:04:24.940> let's<00:04:25.539> go<00:04:25.690> ahead<00:04:25.780> and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
around for our horse let's go ahead and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.170 
around for our horse let's go ahead and
find<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.770> head<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.130> we<00:04:27.220> just<00:04:27.490> keep<00:04:27.639> going<00:04:27.940> down

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
find the head so we just keep going down

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.920 
find the head so we just keep going down
down<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.820> here<00:04:30.820> we<00:04:30.940> are<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.090> spline<00:04:31.600> thigh

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
down and here we are a spline thigh

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.779 
down and here we are a spline thigh
thigh<00:04:32.289> let's<00:04:32.650> go<00:04:32.800> through<00:04:33.099> spline<00:04:33.430> again

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
thigh let's go through spline again

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.330 
thigh let's go through spline again

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.430 
spline zero to spline zero three oh
we're<00:04:36.910> getting<00:04:37.090> close<00:04:37.300> here's<00:04:37.630> neck<00:04:37.900> keep

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
we're getting close here's neck keep

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.129 
we're getting close here's neck keep
going<00:04:38.800> neck<00:04:39.340> again<00:04:39.669> let's<00:04:39.970> let's<00:04:40.539> keep<00:04:40.810> going

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
going neck again let's let's keep going

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.110 
going neck again let's let's keep going
through<00:04:41.289> neck<00:04:41.500> neck<00:04:41.889> to<00:04:42.099> neck<00:04:42.400> three<00:04:42.910> and

through neck neck to neck three and

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.439 
through neck neck to neck three and
finally<00:04:43.930> we<00:04:44.349> get<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.710> head<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:46.030> now<00:04:46.150> we<00:04:46.210> can

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
finally we get to the head so now we can

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.210 
finally we get to the head so now we can
use<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.780> move<00:04:46.930> key<00:04:47.169> to<00:04:47.530> move<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.740> head<00:04:47.919> up<00:04:48.070> and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
use the move key to move the head up and

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.620 
use the move key to move the head up and
down<00:04:48.400> or<00:04:49.000> look<00:04:49.960> around<00:04:50.789> can<00:04:51.789> you<00:04:51.820> use<00:04:52.060> this<00:04:52.270> to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
down or look around can you use this to

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.870 
down or look around can you use this to
create<00:04:52.870> animation<00:04:53.590> keyframes<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:54.310> create<00:04:54.729> any

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
create animation keyframes to create any
