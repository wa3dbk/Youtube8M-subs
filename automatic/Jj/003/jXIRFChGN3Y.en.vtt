00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.220 
so to get some stuff done when I'm awake
but<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.430> used<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.180> stay<00:03:15.360> up<00:03:15.390> all<00:03:15.630> night<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.110> do

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
but I used to stay up all night to do

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.130 
but I used to stay up all night to do
collabs<00:03:16.590> with<00:03:17.060> my<00:03:18.060> us<00:03:18.450> buddies<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:18.989> at<00:03:19.079> the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
collabs with my us buddies and at the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.630 
collabs with my us buddies and at the
moment<00:03:19.320> just<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:19.980> have<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.280> much<00:03:20.430> going

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
moment just because I have so much going

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.640 
moment just because I have so much going
on<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.209> isn't<00:03:21.510> practical<00:03:21.720> which<00:03:22.500> is

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
on that just isn't practical which is

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.039 
on that just isn't practical which is
why<00:03:22.829> I<00:03:22.859> kind<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.400> ran<00:03:23.730> dry<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.390> gmod<00:03:24.780> footage

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
why I kind of ran dry on gmod footage

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.420 
why I kind of ran dry on gmod footage
that<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.440> fact<00:03:25.560> everyone<00:03:26.010> was<00:03:26.160> away<00:03:26.370> for

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
that and the fact everyone was away for

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.300 
that and the fact everyone was away for
a<00:03:26.700> week<00:03:26.880> at<00:03:27.120> PAX<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.560> normally<00:03:28.680> do<00:03:29.070> stuff

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
a week at PAX that I normally do stuff

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.979 
a week at PAX that I normally do stuff
with<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:30.060> made<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.359> really<00:03:30.390> hard<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.930> I

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
with that made it really hard and I

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.509 
with that made it really hard and I
found<00:03:31.170> myself<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.650> situation<00:03:31.799> now<00:03:32.190> where<00:03:32.340> I

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
found myself in a situation now where I

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.400 
found myself in a situation now where I
don't<00:03:32.700> really<00:03:32.820> have<00:03:32.910> any<00:03:33.180> gmod<00:03:33.510> footage<00:03:33.840> to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
don't really have any gmod footage to

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.810 
don't really have any gmod footage to
use<00:03:34.650> which<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.370> don't<00:03:35.430> think<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.730> huge

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
use which I don't think is a huge

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.729 
use which I don't think is a huge
problem<00:03:36.510> because<00:03:36.660> there<00:03:37.079> will<00:03:37.230> be<00:03:37.350> some<00:03:37.560> more

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
problem because there will be some more

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.410 
problem because there will be some more
and<00:03:38.010> we'll<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.400> back<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.730> playing<00:03:38.910> it<00:03:39.150> just

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
and we'll get back to playing it just

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.870 
and we'll get back to playing it just
might<00:03:39.570> take<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:40.170> know<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> few<00:03:41.459> weeks<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:41.790> get

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
might take I know a few weeks to get

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.910
