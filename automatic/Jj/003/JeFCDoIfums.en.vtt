that the client can put in his own
pictures<00:00:51.589> with<00:00:51.829> clear<00:00:52.280> decals<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:53.030> again<00:00:53.749> if

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
pictures with clear decals and again if

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.630 
pictures with clear decals and again if
you<00:00:53.989> look<00:00:54.109> really<00:00:54.350> closely<00:00:54.679> here<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:55.309> can<00:00:55.489> see

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
you look really closely here you can see

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.419 
you look really closely here you can see
the<00:00:55.670> Technic<00:00:56.179> beat<00:00:56.449> bits<00:00:56.960> or<00:00:57.260> pieces<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.129> you

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
the Technic beat bits or pieces and you

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:00.669 
the Technic beat bits or pieces and you
can<00:00:58.579> use<00:00:58.729> Technic<00:00:59.120> pins<00:00:59.359> to<00:00:59.719> rearrange<00:01:00.019> the

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
can use Technic pins to rearrange the

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.169 
can use Technic pins to rearrange the
panels<00:01:01.100> however<00:01:01.370> you<00:01:01.460> want<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:01.729> they're<00:01:01.999> quite

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
panels however you want so they're quite

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.920 
panels however you want so they're quite
modular<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.839> then<00:01:03.469> there's<00:01:03.800> this<00:01:04.930> adapter

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
modular and then there's this adapter

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.230 
modular and then there's this adapter
that<00:01:06.020> I<00:01:06.080> made<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.560> can<00:01:06.770> put<00:01:07.040> you<00:01:07.880> know<00:01:08.000> wall

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
that I made so you can put you know wall

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.910 
that I made so you can put you know wall
on<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.510> side<00:01:08.540> or<00:01:08.780> whatever<00:01:09.350> you<00:01:09.470> want<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.710> do

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
on the side or whatever you want to do

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.969 
on the side or whatever you want to do
and<00:01:10.159> they're<00:01:10.549> obviously<00:01:11.090> at<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.390> back<00:01:11.600> there

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
and they're obviously at the back there

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.350 
and they're obviously at the back there
holding<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.010> back<00:01:13.280> sections<00:01:13.760> together<00:01:13.909> and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
holding the back sections together and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.140 
holding the back sections together and
then<00:01:14.479> pins<00:01:14.870> come<00:01:15.710> across<00:01:16.040> each<00:01:16.280> section<00:01:16.820> here

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
then pins come across each section here

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.540 
then pins come across each section here
and<00:01:17.300> it's<00:01:17.630> quite<00:01:17.930> modular<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:18.950> I'm<00:01:19.190> very<00:01:19.220> happy

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
and it's quite modular so I'm very happy

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.350 
and it's quite modular so I'm very happy
with<00:01:19.880> this<00:01:20.060> build<00:01:20.510> its<00:01:20.930> I<00:01:21.740> did<00:01:22.190> go<00:01:22.430> basically

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
with this build its I did go basically

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.420 
with this build its I did go basically
blind<00:01:23.780> from<00:01:24.230> working<00:01:24.590> with<00:01:24.620> orange<00:01:24.950> Lego<00:01:25.130> for

blind from working with orange Lego for
a<00:01:25.460> few<00:01:25.670> days<00:01:25.790> both<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.570> that<00:01:26.720> I<00:01:26.780> think<00:01:27.170> I'm

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
a few days both of that I think I'm

a few days both of that I think I'm
going<00:01:28.160> to<00:01:28.280> be<00:01:28.540> making<00:01:29.540> one<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:29.930> these<00:01:30.080> for

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
going to be making one of these for

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.780 
going to be making one of these for
myself<00:01:30.440> perhaps<00:01:30.950> when<00:01:31.400> i<00:01:31.430> get<00:01:31.580> another

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
truckload of orange because it did did

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.070 
truckload of orange because it did did
take<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.340> lot<00:01:34.580> more<00:01:34.610> than<00:01:34.880> i<00:01:34.970> expected<00:01:35.120> to<00:01:35.810> make
