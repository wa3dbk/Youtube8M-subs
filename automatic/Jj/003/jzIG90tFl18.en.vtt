box<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:52.110> thought<00:02:52.680> had<00:02:52.739> something<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.340> it

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
box that I thought had something in it

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.910 
box that I thought had something in it
but<00:02:53.970> there's<00:02:54.360> absolutely<00:02:54.780> nothing<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.440> at

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
but there's absolutely nothing in it at

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.430 
but there's absolutely nothing in it at
all<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.519> then<00:02:57.450> pretty<00:02:57.660> much<00:02:57.780> do<00:02:58.019> exactly<00:02:58.290> what

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
all and then pretty much do exactly what

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.430 
all and then pretty much do exactly what
you<00:02:58.560> think<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.570> slide<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.930> neck<00:03:01.170> into

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
you think you do you slide the neck into

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.590 
you think you do you slide the neck into
the<00:03:01.680> body<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.430> slide<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.000> head<00:03:03.180> onto<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the body and you slide the head onto the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:14.650 
the body and you slide the head onto the
top<00:03:10.790> looks<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:11.970> some<00:03:12.590> weird<00:03:13.590> bring

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
top looks like some weird bring

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
top looks like some weird bring
batteries<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:16.370> there's<00:03:17.370> something<00:03:17.579> else<00:03:17.670> box

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
batteries and there's something else box

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.170 
batteries and there's something else box
and<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.250> here's<00:03:20.579> how<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.940> should<00:03:21.150> look

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
and so it here's how it should look

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:31.890 
and so it here's how it should look
after<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:21.930> all<00:03:22.049> put<00:03:22.260> together

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.959
