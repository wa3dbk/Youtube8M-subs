all right so I didn't do a whole lot as
far<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.970> running<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.479> machine<00:01:45.750> goes<00:01:46.580> mainly

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
far as running this machine goes mainly

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.940 
far as running this machine goes mainly
because<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.350> dozers<00:01:49.350> I'm<00:01:49.470> used<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> running

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
because the dozers I'm used to running

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.420 
because the dozers I'm used to running
are<00:01:50.720> D<00:01:51.720> models<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.440> totally<00:01:53.009> different

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
are D models so totally different

awesome<00:03:58.770> machine<00:03:58.980> there's<00:03:59.520> another<00:03:59.760> one<00:04:00.000> that

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
awesome machine there's another one that

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.440 
awesome machine there's another one that
one<00:04:00.420> might<00:04:00.630> have<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> few<00:04:01.670> fewer<00:04:02.670> hours<00:04:02.970> on<00:04:03.300> it

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
one might have a few fewer hours on it

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.360 
one might have a few fewer hours on it
these<00:04:04.020> are<00:04:04.140> both<00:04:04.290> brand-new<00:04:04.620> machine<00:04:04.950> this
