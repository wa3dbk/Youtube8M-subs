this<00:00:43.079> game<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.530> actually<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.219> think<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.329> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
this game but actually I think I in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.450 
this game but actually I think I in
which<00:00:45.989> got<00:00:46.200> all<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> kills<00:00:46.980> pistol

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
which got all of all the kills pistol

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.100 
which got all of all the kills pistol
only<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> didn't<00:00:48.030> get<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> retail<00:00:48.480> was<00:00:48.690> really

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
only I didn't get the retail was really

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.380 
only I didn't get the retail was really
close<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.559> twice<00:00:49.680> I'd<00:00:50.370> I'd<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390

close to it twice I'd I'd really like a
few<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.780> my<00:00:51.960> me<00:00:52.680> sad<00:00:52.949> why<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.640> was<00:00:53.789> really

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
few of my me sad why so it was really

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.029

really<00:00:54.570> frustrating<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> same<00:00:55.590> time<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
really frustrating by the same time on

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
really frustrating by the same time on
me<00:00:56.250> whatever<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:57.090> got<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> decent<00:00:57.989> amount<00:00:58.140> of

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.110 
kills bondhus in this time frame with a
pistol<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.320> opinion<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.250> map<00:01:02.520> because

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
pistol in my opinion on this map because

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.719 
pistol in my opinion on this map because
this<00:01:03.359> map<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.019> game<00:01:04.229> had<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.040> slow<00:01:05.430> if

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
this map this game had kind of a slow if

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.830 
this map this game had kind of a slow if
you're<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> killstreak<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.040> is

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
you're not in a killstreak like it is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
you're not in a killstreak like it is
you<00:01:09.840> can't<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.409> rush<00:01:10.890> their<00:01:11.130> sport

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
you can't really rush their sport

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
you can't really rush their sport
because<00:01:11.820> they<00:01:12.030> were<00:01:12.090> consistently<00:01:12.720> spawn<00:01:13.140> on

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
because they were consistently spawn on

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590 
because they were consistently spawn on
you<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.340> rush<00:01:14.670> their<00:01:14.850> spawns<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.450> will

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you if you rush their spawns they will

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
you if you rush their spawns they will
just<00:01:15.750> keep<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.259> spawning<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
just keep on spawning on you and in

say if you want try pairing with pistol
try<00:01:53.909> 57<00:01:54.420> because<00:01:54.649> 57<00:01:55.649> has<00:01:55.829> larger<00:01:56.280> bank<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.299> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
try 57 because 57 has larger bank and it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.050 
try 57 because 57 has larger bank and it
is<00:01:58.229> almost<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.680> skirt<00:01:58.920> basically<00:01:59.610> when<00:01:59.969> it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
is almost a skirt basically when it

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
is almost a skirt basically when it
comes<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> damage<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.750> range<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.350> decorative

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
comes to damage in range as a decorative

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.320 
comes to damage in range as a decorative
five

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
five

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.090 
five
I<00:02:03.420> think<00:02:04.260> that<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.380> quality<00:02:04.710> fibers<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.040> a

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
I think that that quality fibers have a

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
I think that that quality fibers have a
little<00:02:05.220> bit<00:02:05.340> more<00:02:05.430> range<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.600> basically

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
little bit more range but it's basically

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.260 
little bit more range but it's basically
the<00:02:07.140> same<00:02:07.380> because<00:02:07.620> this<00:02:08.190> guy<00:02:08.369> died<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:08.910> three

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the same because this guy died in three

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.650 
the same because this guy died in three
shots<00:02:09.600> and<00:02:10.070> you<00:02:11.070> can<00:02:11.250> very<00:02:11.550> well<00:02:11.610> britain<00:02:12.510> you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
shots and you can very well britain you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.230 
shots and you can very well britain you
can<00:02:12.840> pretty<00:02:13.260> easily<00:02:13.580> take<00:02:14.580> down<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:15.060> three

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
can pretty easily take down to three

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.120 
can pretty easily take down to three
people<00:02:15.540> at<00:02:15.660> once<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.230> gun<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.980> will
