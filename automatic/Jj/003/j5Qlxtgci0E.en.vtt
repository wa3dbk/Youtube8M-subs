00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.310 
with my 2003 Ford Explorer
I<00:00:11.000> guess<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:11.960> door<00:00:12.769> ajar<00:00:13.269> kept<00:00:14.269> going<00:00:14.900> on<00:00:15.049> and

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
I guess the door ajar kept going on and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.340 
I guess the door ajar kept going on and
I<00:00:16.090> was<00:00:17.090> trying<00:00:17.300> to<00:00:17.360> figure<00:00:17.540> it<00:00:17.780> out<00:00:17.900> if<00:00:18.080> it<00:00:18.230> was

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
I was trying to figure it out if it was

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.540 
I was trying to figure it out if it was
maybe<00:00:18.560> I<00:00:18.650> might<00:00:18.860> have<00:00:18.980> been<00:00:19.070> a<00:00:19.100> sensor<00:00:19.520> or

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
maybe I might have been a sensor or

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.740 
maybe I might have been a sensor or
something<00:00:19.940> but<00:00:20.090> it's<00:00:20.240> not<00:00:21.850> if<00:00:22.850> you<00:00:23.060> just<00:00:23.480> turn

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
something but it's not if you just turn

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.290 
something but it's not if you just turn
around<00:00:24.020> and<00:00:24.170> look<00:00:24.260> over<00:00:24.410> here<00:00:24.880> as<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.000> can<00:00:26.150> see

in there and here I was I was able to I
was<00:00:59.329> able<00:00:59.510> to<00:01:04.359> I<00:01:06.159> had<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.189> um<00:01:08.380> no<00:01:09.380> not<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:10.609> much

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
was able to I had to um no not so much

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.480 
was able to I had to um no not so much
okay<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.319> had<00:01:12.499> to<00:01:12.590> take<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.920> whole<00:01:13.100> door

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
okay so I had to take the whole door

okay so I had to take the whole door
panel<00:01:13.880> off<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.359> was<00:01:14.479> pretty<00:01:14.869> simple<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.469> do<00:01:15.939> as

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
panel off it was pretty simple to do as

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.249 
panel off it was pretty simple to do as
you<00:01:17.090> can<00:01:17.299> see<00:01:17.539> it's<00:01:17.899> right<00:01:18.200> there<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:20.079> also<00:01:21.079> had

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
you can see it's right there I also had

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.459 
you can see it's right there I also had
to<00:01:21.319> replace<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.770> taillight<00:01:22.929> but<00:01:23.929> on<00:01:24.139> this<00:01:24.289> one

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
to replace the taillight but on this one

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.260 
to replace the taillight but on this one
basically<00:01:24.950> take<00:01:25.249> out<00:01:25.340> all<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.579> screws<00:01:25.909> and

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
basically take out all the screws and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.020 
basically take out all the screws and
and<00:01:26.479> you<00:01:27.109> pull<00:01:27.319> upward<00:01:27.829> you<00:01:28.579> don't<00:01:28.729> want<00:01:28.880> to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
and you pull upward you don't want to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.269 
and you pull upward you don't want to
pull<00:01:29.899> straight<00:01:30.319> out<00:01:30.380> because<00:01:30.859> if<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.130> do

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:31.279 
pull straight out because if you do

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
pull straight out because if you do
you're<00:01:31.459> going<00:01:31.609> to<00:01:31.670> end<00:01:31.759> up<00:01:31.819> breaking<00:01:31.939> these

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
you're going to end up breaking these

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.789 
you're going to end up breaking these
little<00:01:34.329> these<00:01:35.329> hooks<00:01:35.689> that<00:01:36.079> go<00:01:36.259> on<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.679> the

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
little these hooks that go on to the

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.550 
little these hooks that go on to the
door<00:01:37.039> latch<00:01:37.219> which<00:01:37.969> is<00:01:38.240> as<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.170> can<00:01:39.319> see

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
door latch which is as you can see

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.419 
door latch which is as you can see
there's<00:01:40.100> they're<00:01:40.399> still<00:01:40.609> intact<00:01:42.039> very<00:01:43.039> simple

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
there's they're still intact very simple

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.709 
there's they're still intact very simple
to<00:01:43.520> do<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.880> don't<00:01:44.119> know<00:01:44.299> if<00:01:44.389> you<00:01:44.450> guys<00:01:44.569> knew<00:01:44.959> but

okay back to this I thought it was one

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.450 
okay back to this I thought it was one
of<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> centuries<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.180> came<00:01:56.600> in<00:01:56.840> there<00:01:57.740> but

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
of the centuries that came in there but

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.440 
of the centuries that came in there but

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
looking around and we finally found what

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
as soon as I repatched that again and

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.060 
as soon as I repatched that again and
that's<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.510> door<00:02:44.990> ajar<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.590> lights<00:02:45.770> turn

that's for the door ajar the lights turn

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.480 
that's for the door ajar the lights turn
off<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.610> now<00:02:47.620> when<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.709> put<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:48.980> key<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.340> it

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
off and now when you put the key in it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.949 
off and now when you put the key in it
doesn't<00:02:49.730> make<00:02:49.820> that<00:02:49.940> much<00:02:50.000> that<00:02:50.480> sound<00:02:50.750> again

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
doesn't make that much that sound again

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.530 
doesn't make that much that sound again
it'll<00:02:51.200> it'll<00:02:51.470> cut<00:02:51.770> off<00:02:51.890> once<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:52.250> take<00:02:52.400> up<00:02:52.550> the

much<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.400> I'm<00:02:59.300> going<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.290> get<00:03:00.440> ready<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.770> put
