MCM I Michael
carruchi<00:03:08.420> bag<00:03:08.629> vintage<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.799> I<00:03:09.859> decided<00:03:10.400> that

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
carruchi bag vintage and I decided that

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.610 
carruchi bag vintage and I decided that
this<00:03:10.670> would<00:03:10.819> be<00:03:10.879> a<00:03:10.969> right<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.239> bring<00:03:11.359> it<00:03:11.480> out

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
this would be a right to bring it out

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.970 
this would be a right to bring it out
because<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.829> is<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.950> Hamptons<00:03:13.400> event<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:15.709> though

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
because it is a Hamptons event so though

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.920 
because it is a Hamptons event so though
it<00:03:16.099> doesn't<00:03:16.249> match<00:03:16.489> no<00:03:17.269> one's<00:03:17.420> really<00:03:17.569> looking

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
it doesn't match no one's really looking

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.989 
it doesn't match no one's really looking
and<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.290> doesn't<00:03:18.560> really<00:03:18.680> matter<00:03:18.969> so<00:03:19.969> I

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:19.999 
and it doesn't really matter so I

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.000 
and it doesn't really matter so I
everyone's<00:03:20.780> more<00:03:21.049> concerned<00:03:21.499> with<00:03:21.560> what<00:03:21.889> the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
everyone's more concerned with what the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.119 
everyone's more concerned with what the
bag<00:03:22.159> is<00:03:22.430> then<00:03:22.730> what<00:03:22.879> it<00:03:22.969> looks<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.659> who

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
bag is then what it looks like and who

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.209

what<00:03:25.129> it<00:03:25.219> matches<00:03:25.519> really<00:03:26.439> so<00:03:27.439> anyway<00:03:27.739> that<00:03:27.980> is

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:28.219 
what it matches really so anyway that is
