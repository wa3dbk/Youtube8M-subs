00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
see Lallana again I told you he was a

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.330 
see Lallana again I told you he was a
beast<00:05:15.960> he<00:05:16.410> gets<00:05:16.650> off<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:16.919> Florida<00:05:17.220> after

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
beast he gets off to Florida after

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.940 
beast he gets off to Florida after
humping<00:05:17.850> that<00:05:18.120> guy's<00:05:18.570> defender<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.440> he<00:05:19.800> did

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
humping that guy's defender and he did

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.710 
humping that guy's defender and he did
score<00:05:20.040> a<00:05:20.220> nice<00:05:20.550> nice<00:05:20.850> goal<00:05:21.150> there<00:05:21.330> so<00:05:21.450> I<00:05:21.480> guess

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
score a nice nice goal there so I guess

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.240 
score a nice nice goal there so I guess
we<00:05:21.840> deserved<00:05:22.200> that<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.860> hump<00:05:23.070> on<00:05:23.190> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
we deserved that the hump on the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.190 
we deserved that the hump on the
defender<00:05:23.669> after<00:05:24.000> that<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.419> this<00:05:24.930> guy<00:05:25.050> had<00:05:25.169> a

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
defender after that and this guy had a

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.870 
defender after that and this guy had a
very<00:05:25.530> good<00:05:25.590> chance<00:05:25.830> i'm<00:05:26.100> really<00:05:26.640> really

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
very good chance i'm really really

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.090 
very good chance i'm really really
surprised<00:05:27.570> i<00:05:27.900> didn't<00:05:28.200> go<00:05:28.260> on<00:05:28.380> target<00:05:28.710> at<00:05:28.800> least

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
surprised i didn't go on target at least

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.310 
surprised i didn't go on target at least
there<00:05:29.370> but<00:05:30.090> this<00:05:30.180> game<00:05:30.330> was<00:05:30.390> definitely<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.140> lot

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
there but this game was definitely a lot

more<00:05:31.380> in<00:05:31.590> my<00:05:31.680> favor<00:05:31.860> but<00:05:31.980> obviously<00:05:32.280> we<00:05:32.400> got

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
more in my favor but obviously we got

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.830 
more in my favor but obviously we got
that<00:05:32.669> goal<00:05:32.820> in<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.060> second<00:05:33.419> then<00:05:33.510> it<00:05:33.600> we<00:05:33.690> got

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840
