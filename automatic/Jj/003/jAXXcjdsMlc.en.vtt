details for cod ghosts the new game is

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.780

going<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> come<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:12.599> um<00:00:12.960> not<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.219> official

going to come out um not the official
multiplayer<00:00:15.330> details<00:00:15.780> but<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.440> think

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
multiplayer details but what I think

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.519 
multiplayer details but what I think
would<00:00:16.859> be<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.100> greatest<00:00:17.609> if<00:00:18.119> if<00:00:18.720> these<00:00:19.260> were

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
would be the greatest if if these were

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.400 
would be the greatest if if these were
the<00:00:19.770> details<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.369> kind<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.410> mash-up

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the details it's kind of like a mash-up

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.170 
the details it's kind of like a mash-up
of<00:00:22.859> all<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> call<00:00:23.460> duties<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.970> all<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
of all the call duties and all the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.609 
of all the call duties and all the
things<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.510> I've<00:00:24.600> had<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.810> most<00:00:24.930> fun<00:00:25.439> of

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
things that I've had the most fun of

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.380 
things that I've had the most fun of
with<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.490> them<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.119> think<00:00:27.300> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
with all of them and I just think that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.870 
with all of them and I just think that
this<00:00:27.810> would<00:00:28.080> be<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> ideal<00:00:28.650> cod<00:00:29.310> game<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
this would be the ideal cod game if it

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.970 
this would be the ideal cod game if it
had<00:00:30.029> all<00:00:30.060> these<00:00:30.420> details<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.590> think<00:00:31.650> they

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
had all these details and I think they

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.170 
had all these details and I think they
should<00:00:32.189> take<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.610> think<00:00:32.640> they<00:00:32.880> should<00:00:33.059> actually

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
should take I think they should actually

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.770 
should take I think they should actually
look<00:00:33.360> into<00:00:33.690> stuff<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.250> taking

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
look into stuff like this like taking

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
look into stuff like this like taking
elements<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:36.989> each<00:00:37.170> comment<00:00:37.739> people<00:00:37.980> found

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
elements from each comment people found

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.340 
elements from each comment people found
the<00:00:38.820> most<00:00:39.000> exciting<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.809> don't<00:00:40.110> think<00:00:40.260> they

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the most exciting but I don't think they

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
the most exciting but I don't think they
play<00:00:40.770> their<00:00:41.040> games<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.579> wouldn't<00:00:41.910> really

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
play their games they wouldn't really

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.990 
play their games they wouldn't really
know<00:00:43.079> what's<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.710> best<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.219> don't<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:44.820> um

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
know what's the best I don't know but um

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.260 
know what's the best I don't know but um
so<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.780> killstreaks<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.760> think<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.940> best

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
so for killstreaks I think the best

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.389 
so for killstreaks I think the best
killstreaks<00:00:48.930> would<00:00:49.710> be<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.160> had

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
killstreaks would be if they had

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.790 
killstreaks would be if they had
harriers<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.449> mw2<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> most

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
harriers from mw2 that was like the most

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
harriers from mw2 that was like the most
fun<00:00:53.100> kill<00:00:53.460> streak<00:00:53.699> ever<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.239> pull<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.079> put

fun kill streak ever just pull you put

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
fun kill streak ever just pull you put
it<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.410> anywhere<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> map<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.969> just

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
it on anywhere on the map then it's just

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
it on anywhere on the map then it's just
so<00:00:57.360> exciting<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> numbers<00:00:58.739> pop

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so exciting to see all the numbers pop

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.540 
so exciting to see all the numbers pop

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the Harriers and then black ops 1

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.670 
the Harriers and then black ops 1
chopped<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.670> got<00:01:11.820> her<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.990> chopper

gunner<00:01:13.860> from<00:01:13.979> black<00:01:14.220> ops<00:01:14.400> 1<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.330> good<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
gunner from black ops 1 was so good and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.740 
gunner from black ops 1 was so good and
it<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.020> fun<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.439> use<00:01:16.909> dogs<00:01:17.909> from<00:01:18.299> black<00:01:18.540> ops

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it was so fun to use dogs from black ops

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.920 
it was so fun to use dogs from black ops
one<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.110> two<00:01:19.290> no<00:01:20.280> swarm<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.909> swarm<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.540> too

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
one or two no swarm the swarm is too

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.510 
one or two no swarm the swarm is too
powerful<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.310> not

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
powerful I think and just it's not

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
powerful I think and just it's not
really<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.110> think

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
really that's I don't know I just think

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
really that's I don't know I just think
it's<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> stupid<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:27.030> too<00:01:27.210> powerful

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it's kind of stupid it's too powerful

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.319 
it's kind of stupid it's too powerful
the<00:01:28.409> Moab<00:01:28.799> not<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.490> nuke<00:01:29.640> put<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> Moab

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the Moab not the nuke put the Moab

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.319 
the Moab not the nuke put the Moab
because<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> mob<00:01:30.930> takes<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.470> skill<00:01:31.680> and

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
because the mob takes more skill and

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.850 
because the mob takes more skill and
definitely<00:01:33.329> specialist<00:01:33.900> along<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.560> so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
definitely specialist along with that so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.910 
definitely specialist along with that so
those<00:01:35.070> would<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.659> along<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.920> random

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
those would be along with random

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.980 
those would be along with random
assorted<00:01:38.369> killstreaks<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.659> those

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

and then m2 v2 hit detection now this is

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.720 
and then m2 v2 hit detection now this is
the<00:02:23.549> one<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.209> biggest<00:02:24.360> things<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:25.730> take

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
the one of the biggest things is take

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.250 
the one of the biggest things is take
the<00:02:27.000> whatever<00:02:27.330> they<00:02:27.480> didn't<00:02:27.750> enter<00:02:27.989> be<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the whatever they didn't enter be to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.199 
the whatever they didn't enter be to
keep<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.769> because<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.400> had<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.819> best<00:02:30.000> hit

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
keep that because they had the best hit

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.240 
keep that because they had the best hit
detection<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.870> game<00:02:31.049> I<00:02:31.079> think<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.620> then

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
detection in that game I think and then

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.520 
detection in that game I think and then

a<00:03:27.810> scumbag<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.889> just<00:03:29.370> didn't<00:03:29.669> really<00:03:29.849> know

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000

that<00:03:30.030> they're<00:03:30.329> on<00:03:30.480> streaks<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.079> I<00:03:31.139> think<00:03:31.410> that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.839 
that they're on streaks but I think that
that's<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.859> lot<00:03:32.010> more<00:03:32.129> convenient<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.819> just

from different call duties along the way
but<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.650> think<00:04:38.949> if<00:04:39.100> these<00:04:39.400> all<00:04:39.729> of<00:04:39.789> these

but I think if these all of these

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.379 
but I think if these all of these
details<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:41.050> I<00:04:41.080> mentioned<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:42.699> few<00:04:43.210> more

i think that this would be the most fun
cod<00:04:57.460> ever<00:04:57.789> because<00:04:58.509> it<00:04:58.660> just<00:04:58.750> has<00:04:58.930> every

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
cod ever because it just has every

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.740
