00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.590 
is take it back of your hand or a tissue
and<00:01:51.990> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.290> swype<00:01:52.680> off<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.250> excess<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.479> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and kind of swype off the excess so that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
and kind of swype off the excess so that
you<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.439> thinned<00:01:55.799> down<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you have it really thinned down and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.069 
you have it really thinned down and
that's<00:01:57.030> when<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.450> go<00:01:57.570> ahead<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.810> start

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that's when you can go ahead and start

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.260 
that's when you can go ahead and start
using<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:58.860> eye<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.850> might<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
using it on your eye you might have to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.149 
using it on your eye you might have to
do<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.750> couple<00:02:00.840> times<00:02:01.110> while<00:02:01.890> you're

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
do that a couple times while you're

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.410 
do that a couple times while you're
using<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.570> I'm<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.439> start<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
using it so I'm just going to start the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.110 
using it so I'm just going to start the
inner<00:02:06.600> corner<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.049> eye<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:09.950> just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
inner corner of my eye and just

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.070 
inner corner of my eye and just
pull<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.930> just<00:02:12.799> did<00:02:12.950> one<00:02:13.340> big<00:02:13.970> sweep<00:02:14.659> I<00:02:14.900> don't

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
pull I just did one big sweep I don't

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.500 
pull I just did one big sweep I don't
usually<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.680> but<00:02:16.549> I<00:02:16.580> find<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.299> it's

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
usually do that but I find that it's

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.809 
usually do that but I find that it's
kind<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.780> easier<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.319> do<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.530> with<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.129> so

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
kind of easier to do that with this so

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.250 
kind of easier to do that with this so
that<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.060> doesn't<00:02:20.239> pull<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.840> don't<00:02:21.019> get<00:02:21.140> those

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
that it doesn't pull you don't get those

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.649 
that it doesn't pull you don't get those
little<00:02:21.560> Mark's<00:02:21.950> just<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.310> make<00:02:22.489> one<00:02:22.909> big<00:02:23.390> line

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
little Mark's just to make one big line

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.539 
little Mark's just to make one big line
and<00:02:23.989> then<00:02:24.709> I'm<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:24.950> going<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.190> fill<00:02:25.519> that

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
and then I'm just going to fill that

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:36.510 
and then I'm just going to fill that
line<00:02:25.909> in<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:28.250> black

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.030 

and<00:02:37.030> already<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:38.110> line<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.710> thicker

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
and already like this line is thicker

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.920 
and already like this line is thicker
than<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.370> other<00:02:39.610> one<00:02:39.850> but<00:02:40.090> that's<00:02:40.210> okay<00:02:40.570> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
than the other one but that's okay the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.540 
than the other one but that's okay the
lashes<00:02:41.470> will<00:02:41.620> kind<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.890> hide<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.310> and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
lashes will kind of hide that and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.610 
lashes will kind of hide that and
disguise<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.960> not<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.530> go

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
disguise it and if not I can just go

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.320 
disguise it and if not I can just go
back<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.010> make<00:02:45.070> this<00:02:45.220> one<00:02:45.400> thicker<00:02:45.640> so<00:02:46.270> I'm

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
back and make this one thicker so I'm

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.320 
back and make this one thicker so I'm
going<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.600> click<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.960> up<00:02:47.080> again<00:02:48.210> put<00:02:49.210> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
going to click it up again put the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.310 
going to click it up again put the
excess<00:02:49.780> off<00:02:51.360> on<00:02:52.360> my<00:02:52.480> hand<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.020> then<00:02:53.110> I'm<00:02:53.260> gonna

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
in the corner of the inner corner of

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.810 
in the corner of the inner corner of
your<00:02:58.990> eye<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.740> hold<00:02:59.950> it<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.220> with<00:03:00.460> the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
you're going to go from the outer corner

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.820 
you're going to go from the outer corner

draw that line and then all you want to

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.680 
draw that line and then all you want to
do<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.130> swoop<00:03:15.520> it<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.000> connect<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.270 
that little chunk and you don't want
that<00:05:02.000> on<00:05:02.090> your<00:05:02.210> eyeball<00:05:02.720> um<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:04.400> tip<00:05:04.790> is<00:05:05.030> like

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
that on your eyeball um the tip is like

that on your eyeball um the tip is like
flexible<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.580> moves<00:05:07.960> but<00:05:08.960> when<00:05:09.140> I<00:05:09.170> first<00:05:09.560> saw

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
flexible and moves but when I first saw

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.130 
flexible and moves but when I first saw
it<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:10.130> thought<00:05:10.160> this<00:05:10.670> whole<00:05:10.940> thing<00:05:11.330> was<00:05:11.570> the

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
it I thought this whole thing was the

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.070 
it I thought this whole thing was the
was<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:12.920> gel<00:05:13.340> but<00:05:13.550> it's<00:05:13.700> not<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.240> gel<00:05:14.600> is<00:05:14.630> only

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
was the gel but it's not the gel is only

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.860 
was the gel but it's not the gel is only
on<00:05:15.350> the<00:05:15.500> three<00:05:15.920> lee<00:05:16.160> top<00:05:16.490> part<00:05:16.790> at<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.000> tip<00:05:17.270> and

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
on the three lee top part at the tip and

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.400 
on the three lee top part at the tip and
it<00:05:18.380> kind<00:05:18.800> of<00:05:18.860> goes<00:05:19.010> on<00:05:19.280> really<00:05:19.460> smooth<00:05:20.410> the

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
it kind of goes on really smooth the

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.830 
it kind of goes on really smooth the
concept<00:05:21.950> it's<00:05:22.190> supposed<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.580> be<00:05:22.790> lash<00:05:23.510> hugging

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
concept it's supposed to be lash hugging

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.130 
concept it's supposed to be lash hugging
so<00:05:24.410> it's<00:05:24.650> supposed<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.070> be<00:05:25.280> easy<00:05:25.780> for<00:05:26.780> people

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
so it's supposed to be easy for people

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.530 
so it's supposed to be easy for people

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
easiest way where you kind of because I

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.530
