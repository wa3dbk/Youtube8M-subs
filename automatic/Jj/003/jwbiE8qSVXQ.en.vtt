00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
touch excited face this valley it's

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.380 
touch excited face this valley it's
pretty<00:01:26.270> narrow<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:27.430> it<00:01:28.430> gets<00:01:28.850> really<00:01:29.060> narrow

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
pretty narrow and it gets really narrow

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.749 
pretty narrow and it gets really narrow
right<00:01:29.840> where<00:01:30.079> we<00:01:30.259> want<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.619> go<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.250> look<00:01:31.520> at<00:01:31.729> it

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
right where we want to go and look at it

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.139 
right where we want to go and look at it
but<00:01:32.270> because<00:01:32.479> it's<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.189> beautiful<00:01:34.970> in

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149

but because it's it's so beautiful in
here<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:35.780> makes<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.380> worthwhile<00:01:36.920> it's<00:01:37.399> worth

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
here it makes it worthwhile it's worth
