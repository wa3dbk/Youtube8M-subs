and from this position oil will drop

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.069 
and from this position oil will drop
down<00:03:57.510> in<00:03:58.010> along<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.220> engine<00:03:59.579> so<00:04:00.540> what<00:04:01.049> I

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
down in along the engine so what I

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.400 
down in along the engine so what I
usually<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.980> is<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.220> usually<00:04:02.400> place<00:04:03.410> newspaper

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
usually do is I usually place newspaper

down to catch any oil drops to say they

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.580 
down to catch any oil drops to say they
go<00:04:09.030> onto<00:04:09.180> country<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.810> stay<00:04:09.989> in<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.260> concrete

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
go onto country and stay in the concrete

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.090 
go onto country and stay in the concrete
and<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:13.200> will<00:04:13.489> go<00:04:14.489> down<00:04:14.730> along<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.989> wires<00:04:16.919> and

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
and it will go down along and wires and

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.189 
and it will go down along and wires and
different<00:04:17.609> components<00:04:17.729> just<00:04:18.299> wipe<00:04:18.959> them

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
different components just wipe them

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.219 
different components just wipe them
because<00:04:19.620> when<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.010> engine<00:04:20.430> is<00:04:20.519> hot<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:21.229> the

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
because when the engine is hot and the

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.879 
because when the engine is hot and the
oil<00:04:22.500> will<00:04:22.650> heat<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.160> there<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.430> smell<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.150> corn

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
oil will heat and there a smell of corn

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.230 
oil will heat and there a smell of corn
you'll<00:04:25.889> eventually<00:04:26.160> burn<00:04:26.550> off<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:29.240> just

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
you'll eventually burn off just and just

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.270 
you'll eventually burn off just and just
to<00:04:30.330> keep<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.599> oil<00:04:30.750> off<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.320> engine<00:04:31.950> itself

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
to keep the oil off the engine itself

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.620 
to keep the oil off the engine itself
just<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.760> wipe<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.090> clean<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:34.229> after<00:04:34.860> this<00:04:35.630> I'm

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
engine which is ten by four ten by m40

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.620 
engine which is ten by four ten by m40
Supremes<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.940> I'm<00:04:53.940> gonna<00:04:54.030> be<00:04:54.150> putting<00:04:54.360> three

T's of oil in this so I'll be down here

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.080 
T's of oil in this so I'll be down here
to<00:04:58.320> three<00:04:58.560> liters<00:04:58.740> as<00:04:59.010> five<00:04:59.220> liters<00:04:59.639> in<00:04:59.849> this

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
to three liters as five liters in this

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.610 
and in this container so I'll be putting
three<00:05:05.310> liters<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:05.789> I<00:05:06.440> have<00:05:07.440> my<00:05:08.450> filter<00:05:09.450> in<00:05:09.630> I'll

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
three liters in I have my filter in I'll

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.830 
three liters in I have my filter in I'll
just<00:05:10.830> be<00:05:11.160> making<00:05:11.310> sure<00:05:11.490> that's<00:05:11.700> tight<00:05:12.060> recheck

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
just be making sure that's tight recheck

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.969 
just be making sure that's tight recheck
on<00:05:13.020> my<00:05:13.110> salt<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:14.120> then<00:05:15.120> that's<00:05:15.360> it

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
on my salt and then that's it

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.820 
on my salt and then that's it
so<00:05:16.979> this<00:05:17.610> is<00:05:17.940> how<00:05:18.720> to<00:05:19.110> change<00:05:19.349> the<00:05:19.560> oil<00:05:19.650> filter

so this is how to change the oil filter

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.150 
so this is how to change the oil filter
and<00:05:20.510> chance<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.660> go<00:05:21.780> in<00:05:21.900> your<00:05:22.080> car<00:05:22.260> and<00:05:22.620> for

models etc for six months to a year is

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.990 
models etc for six months to a year is
about<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.530> time<00:05:34.770> when<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:35.990> will<00:05:36.990> change
