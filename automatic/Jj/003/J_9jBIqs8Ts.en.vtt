copy<00:02:30.010> that<00:02:30.580> one<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.930> put<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.380> where<00:02:32.650> I

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
copy that one and you put it where I

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.040 
copy that one and you put it where I
showed<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.310> how<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.430> get<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.270> in<00:02:34.750> this

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
showed you how to get to in in this

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.020 
showed you how to get to in in this
folder<00:02:35.320> wins<00:02:35.740> with<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.100> bunch<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.490> ones<00:02:36.790> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
folder wins with a bunch of ones and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.030 
folder wins with a bunch of ones and
zeros<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.140> paste<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.680> there

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
zeros so just paste it in there

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.660 
zeros so just paste it in there
oh<00:02:39.570> shut<00:02:41.970> yes<00:02:42.970> we<00:02:43.239> do<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.459> paste

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
oh shut yes we do that so you just paste

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.449 
oh shut yes we do that so you just paste
the<00:02:45.880> user<00:02:46.090> file<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.630> here<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.020> CFG<00:02:47.350> file<00:02:47.860> then

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
the user file in here the CFG file then

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.520 
the user file in here the CFG file then
you<00:02:48.489> have<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.760> run<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.209> game<00:02:49.420> first<00:02:49.780> before

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
you have to run the game first before

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.410 
you have to run the game first before
you<00:02:50.680> go<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.220> next<00:02:51.459> step<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:51.910> sure<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.300> do

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
you go to the next step be sure to do

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.580 
you go to the next step be sure to do
that<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:52.720> have<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.930> do<00:02:53.200> that

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
that you have to do that

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.250 
that you have to do that
so<00:02:54.010> after<00:02:54.310> you've<00:02:54.489> run<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.760> game<00:02:54.910> once<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:56.140> go

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
so after you've run the game once you go

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.660 
so after you've run the game once you go
into<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:56.739> user<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.640> again<00:02:58.330> ones<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.170> zeros

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
into this user and again ones and zeros

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.660 
into this user and again ones and zeros
user<00:03:00.670> CFG<00:03:01.660> file<00:03:01.900> then<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.560> go<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:03.430> bottom

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
user CFG file then you go to the bottom

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.640 
user CFG file then you go to the bottom
and<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:04.989> up<00:03:05.140> here<00:03:05.410> you'll<00:03:05.590> see<00:03:05.800> base<00:03:06.450> fov

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and then up here you'll see base fov

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.509 
and then up here you'll see base fov
default<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.890> will<00:03:09.100> be<00:03:09.280> something<00:03:09.640> like<00:03:09.820> 5<00:03:10.480> 6<00:03:11.519> 6

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
default it will be something like 5 6 6

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.240 
default it will be something like 5 6 6
5<00:03:12.850> 1<00:03:12.910> or<00:03:13.480> something<00:03:13.959> like<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:15.070> is

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
5 1 or something like that that is

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.720 
5 1 or something like that that is
ridiculous<00:03:16.000> low<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.660> disgusting<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.730> I

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
ridiculous low and disgusting so I I

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.150 
ridiculous low and disgusting so I I
just<00:03:19.390> changed<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.260> second<00:03:20.650> ago<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.100> I

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
just changed it a second ago and I

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.490 
just changed it a second ago and I
thought<00:03:21.430> that<00:03:21.640> 65<00:03:22.299> is<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.570> pretty<00:03:22.959> pretty

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
thought that 65 is a pretty pretty

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.590 
thought that 65 is a pretty pretty
decent<00:03:23.980> amount<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:24.730> good<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.940> yeah<00:03:28.330> but

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
decent amount it's good so yeah but

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.880 
decent amount it's good so yeah but
there<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:29.049> have<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.410> it's<00:03:29.560> done<00:03:29.769> I'm

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
there you have it that it's done I'm

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.530 
there you have it that it's done I'm
going<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.070> show<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.489> comparison<00:03:31.000> between

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
going to show you a comparison between

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.130 
going to show you a comparison between
the<00:03:31.810> default<00:03:32.560> one<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.690> one<00:03:34.840> with<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the default one and the the one with the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.490 
the default one and the the one with the
65<00:03:35.680> fov<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.790> can<00:03:36.940> probably<00:03:37.420> go<00:03:37.810> crazy<00:03:38.110> with

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
65 fov you can probably go crazy with

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.380 
65 fov you can probably go crazy with
this<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.620> go<00:03:38.860> up<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.430> hundred<00:03:40.060> or<00:03:40.090> something

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
this I go up to a hundred or something

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.150 
this I go up to a hundred or something
but<00:03:40.780> that's<00:03:41.650> just<00:03:42.280> ridiculously<00:03:43.739> bad<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:44.769> mean
