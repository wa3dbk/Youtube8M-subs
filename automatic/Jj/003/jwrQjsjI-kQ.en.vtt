hi<00:00:01.770> everyone<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.280> welcome<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:03.060> biology

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hi everyone and welcome to biology

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.559 
hi everyone and welcome to biology
professor<00:00:04.259> today<00:00:04.920> we're<00:00:05.130> talking<00:00:05.220> about

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
professor today we're talking about

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.360 
professor today we're talking about
sporulation<00:00:06.569> that<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.589> process<00:00:08.099> through

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
sporulation that is the process through

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.490 
sporulation that is the process through
which<00:00:08.400> certain<00:00:09.030> types<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.420> bacteria<00:00:09.960> can<00:00:10.230> go

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
which certain types of bacteria can go

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.789 
which certain types of bacteria can go
to<00:00:11.219> form<00:00:11.610> endospores<00:00:12.200> if<00:00:13.200> you're<00:00:13.349> interested

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
to form endospores if you're interested

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.980 
to form endospores if you're interested
in<00:00:13.889> learning<00:00:14.009> more<00:00:14.190> about<00:00:14.389> endospores<00:00:15.389> see<00:00:15.809> my

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
in learning more about endospores see my

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.279 
in learning more about endospores see my
video<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.070> topic<00:00:17.340> now<00:00:18.289> when

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
video on that topic now when

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.320 
video on that topic now when
environmental<00:00:20.279> conditions<00:00:20.880> become

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
environmental conditions become

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.359 
environmental conditions become
unfavorable<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.740> example<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
unfavorable for example when the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.820 
unfavorable for example when the
bacteria<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:24.180> experiencing<00:00:25.050> some<00:00:25.320> form<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
bacteria is experiencing some form of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.670 
bacteria is experiencing some form of
starvation<00:00:26.640> or<00:00:26.970> extreme<00:00:27.390> temperatures<00:00:27.990> it

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
starvation or extreme temperatures it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.209 
starvation or extreme temperatures it
may<00:00:28.980> begin<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.429> process<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:30.029> score<00:00:30.630> ulation

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
may begin the process of score ulation

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.030 
may begin the process of score ulation
this<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.430> when<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:33.200> replication<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.440> DNA

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
this is when you have replication of DNA

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.959 
this is when you have replication of DNA
so<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> bacterial<00:00:37.170> cell<00:00:37.410> wall<00:00:38.190> plasma

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
so you have a bacterial cell wall plasma

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.500 
so you have a bacterial cell wall plasma
membrane<00:00:39.390> cytoplasm<00:00:40.200> inside<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.579> some

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
membrane cytoplasm inside that and some

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
membrane cytoplasm inside that and some
DNA<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.890> DNA<00:00:49.579> also<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> plasma

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
DNA then the DNA also the plasma

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.110 
DNA then the DNA also the plasma
membrane<00:00:51.629> against<00:00:52.379> pinching<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.579> separate

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
membrane against pinching in to separate

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.150 
membrane against pinching in to separate
off<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> little<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> cytoplasm<00:00:55.800> as

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
off a little bit of the cytoplasm as

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.880 
off a little bit of the cytoplasm as
well<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> newly<00:00:56.969> replicated<00:00:57.120> DNA<00:00:57.890> this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
well as the newly replicated DNA this

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130

pinching<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> plasma<00:01:00.449> membrane<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
pinching in at the plasma membrane is

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
pinching in at the plasma membrane is
the<00:01:01.320> beginning<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> formation<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the beginning of the formation of a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.719 
the beginning of the formation of a
spore<00:01:03.570> septum<00:01:09.860> then<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.310> later

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
spore septum then you have later

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600 
spore septum then you have later
completion<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> spore<00:01:13.229> septum<00:01:13.680> from<00:01:14.070> more

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
completion of the spore septum from more

plasma<00:01:15.240> membrane<00:01:15.630> tension

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
plasma membrane tension

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.310 
plasma membrane tension
this<00:01:17.700> results<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.270> something<00:01:18.630> called<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
this results in something called the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.340 
this results in something called the
forespore<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> precursor<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> spore

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
forespore so the precursor of the spore

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.880 
forespore so the precursor of the spore
or<00:01:22.380> end<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.950> score<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.900> composed<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.310 
double membrane and then this pink layer
that<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.130> see<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.700> peptidoglycan<00:01:30.509> so

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that you see is peptidoglycan so

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.160 
that you see is peptidoglycan so
peptidoglycan<00:01:32.180> fills<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.600> space<00:01:33.869> between
