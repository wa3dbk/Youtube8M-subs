first I'm going to show you guys how to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.740 
first I'm going to show you guys how to
make<00:00:54.170> these<00:00:54.470> fabric<00:00:54.980> covered<00:00:55.340> bins<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.390> start

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
make these fabric covered bins so start

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.300 
make these fabric covered bins so start
off<00:00:56.810> with<00:00:56.990> your<00:00:57.110> cardboard<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:57.770> you're<00:00:58.040> going

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
off with your cardboard and you're going

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.370 
off with your cardboard and you're going
to<00:00:58.520> mark<00:00:58.820> how<00:00:59.000> tall<00:00:59.360> you<00:00:59.540> want<00:00:59.630> your<00:00:59.840> bin<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.230> be

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
to mark how tall you want your bin to be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.800 
to mark how tall you want your bin to be
then<00:01:00.680> once<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.190> connect<00:01:01.550> those<00:01:01.700> lines<00:01:02.090> mark

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
then once you connect those lines mark

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.510 
then once you connect those lines mark
how<00:01:03.020> wide<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.560> want<00:01:03.590> your<00:01:03.770> bin<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.220> be<00:01:04.340> the

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
how wide you want your bin to be the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.400 
how wide you want your bin to be the
width<00:01:04.730> of<00:01:04.910> your<00:01:05.180> bin<00:01:05.390> depends<00:01:05.900> on<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.200> width

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
width of your bin depends on the width

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.810 
width of your bin depends on the width
of<00:01:06.530> your<00:01:06.590> locker<00:01:06.950> because<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:07.550> want<00:01:07.730> the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
of your locker because you want the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.390 
of your locker because you want the
locker<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.330> be<00:01:08.420> able<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.720> close<00:01:09.190> here<00:01:10.190> I'm

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
locker to be able to close here I'm

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.890 
locker to be able to close here I'm
cutting<00:01:10.760> out<00:01:10.850> that<00:01:11.060> rectangle<00:01:11.630> with<00:01:11.750> an

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
cutting out that rectangle with an

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.750 
cutting out that rectangle with an
exacto<00:01:12.380> knife<00:01:12.530> but<00:01:12.800> later<00:01:13.040> I<00:01:13.160> found<00:01:13.490> out<00:01:13.700> that

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
exacto knife but later I found out that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.390 
exacto knife but later I found out that
using<00:01:14.300> scissors<00:01:14.540> was<00:01:14.900> much<00:01:15.170> easier<00:01:15.200> next<00:01:16.100> I

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
using scissors was much easier next I

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.610 
using scissors was much easier next I
made<00:01:16.729> another<00:01:17.150> one<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.570> those<00:01:17.690> rectangles<00:01:18.440> by

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
made another one of those rectangles by

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:29.510 
made another one of those rectangles by
chasing<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.310> cutting<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:19.820> out<00:01:19.910> again

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.410 

once<00:01:30.520> you're<00:01:30.670> done<00:01:30.820> cutting<00:01:31.090> out<00:01:31.270> these

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
once you're done cutting out these

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.480 
once you're done cutting out these
rectangles<00:01:32.049> you<00:01:32.200> now<00:01:32.350> have<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.920> back<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.400> the

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
rectangles you now have the back and the

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.280 
rectangles you now have the back and the
front<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.850> your<00:01:34.090> little<00:01:34.390> shelf<00:01:34.689> now<00:01:34.930> it's<00:01:35.080> time

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
front of your little shelf now it's time

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.170 
front of your little shelf now it's time
to<00:01:35.320> make<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.680> sides<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.310> make<00:01:36.460> it<00:01:36.610> easier<00:01:36.970> I'm

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
to make the sides to make it easier I'm

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.539 
to make the sides to make it easier I'm
just<00:01:37.450> using<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:38.320> leftover<00:01:38.680> cardboard<00:01:39.310> from

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
just using the leftover cardboard from

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.399 
just using the leftover cardboard from
when<00:01:39.759> I<00:01:39.790> cut<00:01:40.210> out<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.330> back<00:01:40.630> in<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.930> front<00:01:40.960> so

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
when I cut out the back in the front so

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.080 
when I cut out the back in the front so
that<00:01:41.439> I<00:01:41.619> already<00:01:42.009> have<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.430> measurements<00:01:42.970> of

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
that I already have the measurements of

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.950 
that I already have the measurements of
how<00:01:43.330> tall<00:01:43.659> I<00:01:43.689> need<00:01:43.990> it<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.259> be

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.330 

once<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.140> laid<00:01:50.350> out<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.680> should<00:01:50.890> have<00:01:51.070> four

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
once you laid out you should have four

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.010 
once you laid out you should have four
pieces<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:51.730> look<00:01:52.120> a<00:01:52.300> little<00:01:52.420> something<00:01:52.870> like

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
pieces that look a little something like

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.490 
pieces that look a little something like
this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
this

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.650 
this
all<00:01:53.620> that's<00:01:54.070> left<00:01:54.370> is<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.760> bottom<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.390> make

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
all that's left is the bottom so to make

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.210 
all that's left is the bottom so to make
the<00:01:55.810> bottom<00:01:56.110> I<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.260> laid<00:01:56.710> out<00:01:56.860> all<00:01:57.040> the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
the bottom I just laid out all the

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.400 
the bottom I just laid out all the
pieces<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.790> then<00:01:57.880> trace<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:58.690> rectangular

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
pieces and then trace the rectangular

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.070 
pieces and then trace the rectangular
hole<00:01:59.830> that<00:02:00.040> was<00:02:00.160> in<00:02:00.370> the<00:02:00.520> center

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.750 

so<00:02:04.080> now<00:02:04.260> we<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.920> flattened<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.460> version

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
so now we have the flattened out version

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.809 
so now we have the flattened out version
of<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.540> rectangular<00:02:07.140> prism<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:08.369> wrap<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
of a rectangular prism to wrap the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.669 
of a rectangular prism to wrap the
cardboard<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.450> we<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.810> made<00:02:10.080> I'm<00:02:10.380> just

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
cardboard that we just made I'm just

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.380 
cardboard that we just made I'm just
tracing<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.280> flipping<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.910> up<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.270> then

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
tracing it flipping it up and then

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.660 
tracing it flipping it up and then
tracing<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.020> again<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.709> you're<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.550> to

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
tracing it again and you're going to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.699 
tracing it again and you're going to
want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.030> cut<00:02:15.270> around<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.930> outline<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.380> you

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
want to cut around the outline that you

I'm going to be using a hot glue gun to
glue<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.290> fabric<00:02:37.469> onto<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.189> cardboard<00:02:38.700> so

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
glue the fabric onto the cardboard so
I'm<00:02:39.719> just<00:02:40.049> gluing<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.650> edge<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:41.159> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
I'm just gluing the edge of the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.160 
I'm just gluing the edge of the
cardboard<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.969> then<00:02:42.090> folding<00:02:42.599> down<00:02:42.870> that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
cardboard and then folding down that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.660 
cardboard and then folding down that
little<00:02:43.379> flap<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.829> we<00:02:44.219> made<00:02:44.459> earlier<00:02:46.670> once

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
little flap that we made earlier once

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.949 
little flap that we made earlier once
that's<00:02:47.969> glued<00:02:48.299> down<00:02:48.510> you're<00:02:48.719> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> want

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
that's glued down you're going to want

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.050 
that's glued down you're going to want
to<00:02:49.140> make<00:02:49.260> little<00:02:49.469> snips<00:02:49.950> right<00:02:50.430> there<00:02:50.730> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
to make little snips right there and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.390 
to make little snips right there and
then<00:02:51.900> you're<00:02:52.079> going<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.379> glue<00:02:52.739> those<00:02:52.980> little

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
then you're going to glue those little

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.059 
then you're going to glue those little
flaps<00:02:53.670> down

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.089 

and<00:02:58.900> finally<00:02:59.900> I'm<00:03:00.079> cutting<00:03:00.439> off<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.590> little

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099

and finally I'm cutting off that little
excess<00:03:01.579> fabric<00:03:01.819> bit<00:03:02.269> right<00:03:02.569> here<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.200> then

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
excess fabric bit right here and then

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:14.060 
excess fabric bit right here and then
just<00:03:03.769> gluing<00:03:04.069> that<00:03:04.370> whole<00:03:04.700> piece<00:03:04.969> down

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.650 

next<00:03:15.070> just<00:03:15.190> repeat<00:03:15.550> that<00:03:15.580> whole<00:03:15.940> process<00:03:16.480> on

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
next just repeat that whole process on

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:26.010 
next just repeat that whole process on
all<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.290> pieces<00:03:17.500> of<00:03:17.830> cardboard

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.820 

the<00:03:26.650> true<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.130> me<00:03:27.280> war<00:03:27.520> was<00:03:27.880> fought<00:03:28.300> for<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:29.110> it

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
the true to me war was fought for you it

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.580 
the true to me war was fought for you it
didn't<00:03:30.250> matter<00:03:30.640> then<00:03:31.330> like<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.930> does<00:03:32.200> right

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
didn't matter then like it does right

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.000 
didn't matter then like it does right
now<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:34.990> does<00:03:35.260> right<00:03:35.650> now

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.470 

when<00:03:40.010> all<00:03:40.250> your<00:03:40.430> pieces<00:03:40.610> of<00:03:40.790> cardboard<00:03:41.150> are

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
when all your pieces of cardboard are

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.479 
when all your pieces of cardboard are
covered<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.260> can<00:03:42.440> finally<00:03:42.709> put<00:03:43.099> your<00:03:43.250> bin

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
covered you can finally put your bin

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.759 
covered you can finally put your bin
together<00:03:43.909> so<00:03:44.659> when<00:03:44.930> you're<00:03:45.080> gluing<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.590> bin

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
together so when you're gluing the bin

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.740 
together so when you're gluing the bin
together<00:03:46.099> make<00:03:46.489> sure<00:03:46.519> you<00:03:46.879> press<00:03:47.180> hard<00:03:47.480> on<00:03:47.629> the

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
together make sure you press hard on the

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.509 
together make sure you press hard on the
pieces<00:03:47.989> so<00:03:48.409> that<00:03:48.440> your<00:03:48.799> bin<00:03:48.980> doesn't<00:03:49.220> fall

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
pieces so that your bin doesn't fall

00:03:49.519 --> 00:04:02.460 
pieces so that your bin doesn't fall
apart<00:03:51.400> machine

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.050 

tell<00:04:03.280> me

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
tell me

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.960 
tell me
and<00:04:05.650> then<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.770> can<00:04:06.920> just<00:04:07.070> glue<00:04:07.310> some<00:04:07.550> magnets

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
and then you can just glue some magnets

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.170 
and then you can just glue some magnets
on<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.180> back<00:04:08.450> of<00:04:08.630> your<00:04:08.750> bin<00:04:09.670> now<00:04:10.670> this<00:04:11.000> is

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
on the back of your bin now this is

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.060 
on the back of your bin now this is
optional<00:04:11.390> but<00:04:11.780> I<00:04:12.020> decided<00:04:12.350> to<00:04:12.530> make<00:04:12.800> some

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
optional but I decided to make some

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.760 
optional but I decided to make some
decorative<00:04:13.460> label<00:04:14.150> type<00:04:14.480> things<00:04:14.780> so<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.470> cut

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
decorative label type things so I cut

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.099 
decorative label type things so I cut
out<00:04:15.800> some<00:04:15.890> teal<00:04:16.340> paper<00:04:16.640> and<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.450> just<00:04:17.870> wrote<00:04:18.079> my

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
out some teal paper and I just wrote my

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.020 
out some teal paper and I just wrote my
name<00:04:18.410> on<00:04:18.620> it<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.890> stuck<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.400> on<00:04:19.519> with<00:04:19.700> some<00:04:19.850> hot

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
name on it and stuck it on with some hot

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.440 
name on it and stuck it on with some hot
glue<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.740> then<00:04:25.490> you're<00:04:25.610> done<00:04:25.820> that's<00:04:26.150> how<00:04:26.420> I

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
glue and then you're done that's how I

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.530 
glue and then you're done that's how I
made<00:04:26.810> my<00:04:26.960> magnetic<00:04:27.410> locker<00:04:27.860> shelf<00:04:28.310> but<00:04:29.120> if<00:04:29.330> you

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
made my magnetic locker shelf but if you

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.270 
made my magnetic locker shelf but if you
want<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.900> use<00:04:30.080> some<00:04:30.350> paper<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.860> cover<00:04:31.100> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
want to use some paper to cover the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.430 
want to use some paper to cover the
cardboard<00:04:31.760> instead<00:04:32.120> all<00:04:32.450> you<00:04:32.930> have<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.170> do<00:04:33.290> is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
cardboard instead all you have to do is

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.110 
cardboard instead all you have to do is
use<00:04:33.590> a<00:04:33.620> glue<00:04:33.920> stick<00:04:33.950> instead<00:04:34.460> of<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.730> glue<00:04:34.940> gun

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
use a glue stick instead of a glue gun

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.390 
use a glue stick instead of a glue gun
that<00:04:35.330> way<00:04:35.870> there<00:04:36.110> will<00:04:36.230> be<00:04:36.260> no<00:04:36.410> lumps<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.220> the

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
that way there will be no lumps in the

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.370 
that way there will be no lumps in the
paper<00:04:37.580> but<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.270> course<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.780> still<00:04:38.840> have<00:04:39.260> to

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
paper but of course you still have to

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.930 
paper but of course you still have to
use<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.530> glue<00:04:39.770> gun<00:04:39.800> to<00:04:39.980> attach<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.790> bin

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
use a glue gun to attach the bin

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.940 
use a glue gun to attach the bin
together<00:04:41.300> because<00:04:41.750> it's<00:04:41.990> stronger<00:04:44.800> so<00:04:45.800> yeah

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
together because it's stronger so yeah

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.650 
together because it's stronger so yeah
that's<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.400> that's<00:04:46.460> how<00:04:46.820> you<00:04:46.850> make<00:04:47.030> your<00:04:47.360> very

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
that's it that's how you make your very

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.470 
that's it that's how you make your very
own<00:04:47.900> magnetic<00:04:48.500> locker<00:04:48.950> shelves<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:49.790> thought<00:04:50.360> it

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
own magnetic locker shelves I thought it
