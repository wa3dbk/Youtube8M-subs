00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.959
 hello friends greet you claudia ruiz with 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.160
 the daily health report to overcome 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.750
 1640 m 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.370
 did you know that sugary drinks and 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.060
 soda are the culprits of the 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.130
 obesity epidemic let's see 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.960
 new research reinforces the 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.910
 thesis that soft drinks and 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.390
 sugary are the culprits of the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.370
 obesity epidemic here in the usa 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.010
 for the first time a study that covered 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.100
 more than 33 thousand Americans during 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.410
 several decades it redeems clear proof of 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.480
 that sugary drinks interact 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.579
 with genes that alter the weight and make 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.000
 that the risk of obesity exceeds the 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.129
 simple hereditary factor the conclusion 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.860
 is that these drinks are especially 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.600
 harmful to people 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.180
 predisposed by its people to rise from 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.750
 weight most people have when 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.760
 minus some of these genes likewise in 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.229
 two other important experiments are 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.990
 determined that children and 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.350
 adolescents gain little weight if they are 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.850
 they give free drinks of calories like 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.700
 alternative to sugary drinks that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.790
 usually take the results in 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.650
 set unambiguously indicate that 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.040
 people gain weight due to the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.850
 consumption of sugary drinks 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.729
 independently of other habits 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.840
 bad health like overeating and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.530
 do little 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.689
 exercise this according to scientists 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.969
 all these conclusions reinforce the 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.490
 campaigns in favor of the application of 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:43.280
 taxes on soft drinks the imposition 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.950
 limits to the sugar content in the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.259
 same as approved the new city 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.350
 york and the adoption of various policies 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.630
 to stop the consumption of those drinks 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.149
 the good news for the worshipers of 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.890
 the soda is that in these studies 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.500
 sugar- free drinks do not 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.350
 increased the risk of obesity 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.450
 it is possible to deceive the taste and satisfy 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.520
 the need for sweetness without paying with 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.840
 weight gain affirmed the researcher 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.580
 of obesity 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.070
 rudy leibel from the university of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.770
 columbia and who did not participate in the 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.930
 studies the studies were presented 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.209
 last Friday during a 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 lecture on obesity is antonio 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.260
 and disseminated on the Internet 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.780
 publication new england journal of 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.760
 medicine ' the research on 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.530
 genes close in particular a gap 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.290
 extensive in what is known about the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.480
 obesity was a huge three company 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.610
 studies that extended a long time 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.920
 and that independently and jointly 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.360
 they reached the same conclusions 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.100
 an investigation shows how the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.340
 combination of habits and inheritance 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.170
 redounds in sanity not necessarily 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.540
 who has many of these genes will be 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.570
 obese but who consumes many drinks 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.880
 sugary will inevitably make his luck was 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.520
 what the gears expert said about the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.680
 rockefeller university in new york 'and 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.320
 who did not participate in the investigation 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.000
 sugary drinks are the biggest 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.470
 individual source of calories in the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.240
 American diet 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.400
 and is designed more and more as 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.110
 responsible for obesity or excess 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.720
 weight of a third of children and 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.970
 adolescents and more than two thirds of 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.290
 adults in the usa and remember that if 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.750
 Do you want to take some care for your 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.750
 health you should visit your doctor 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.220
