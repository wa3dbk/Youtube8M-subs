00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
like to do Curt circular motions

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.240 
like to do Curt circular motions
especially<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.440> spot<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> crease

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
especially in the spot of the crease

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.770 
especially in the spot of the crease
that<00:02:59.280> you're<00:02:59.640> going<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.090> want<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.570> most

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780

that you're going and want the most
color<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.860> be<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.660> that's<00:03:04.050> just<00:03:04.230> gonna<00:03:04.500> get

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
color to be so that's just gonna get

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.890 
color to be so that's just gonna get
most<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.160> color<00:03:05.400> off<00:03:05.640> where<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.450> want<00:03:06.750> it

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900

most of the color off where you want it
to<00:03:07.380> be<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:09.269> circular<00:03:09.989> motions<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.330> then<00:03:12.330> you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
to be so circular motions and then you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.630 
to be so circular motions and then you
can<00:03:12.660> start<00:03:12.989> doing<00:03:13.170> windshield<00:03:13.830> wiper<00:03:14.100> or

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640
