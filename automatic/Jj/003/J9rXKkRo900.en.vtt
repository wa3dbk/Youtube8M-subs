00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380 
very effective I know some people on you
to<00:02:16.500> say<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:17.010> shouldn't<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.459> using<00:02:17.670> soap

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
to say that you shouldn't be using soap

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.840 
to say that you shouldn't be using soap
too<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.470> ham<00:02:19.769> bar<00:02:19.980> soap<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.519> wash<00:02:20.670> your

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
too just like ham bar soap to wash your

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.910 
too just like ham bar soap to wash your
gloves<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.360> disagree<00:02:22.050> i<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:22.350> it's<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.800> great

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
gloves I disagree i think it's a great

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.100 
gloves I disagree i think it's a great
way<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.760> i've<00:02:23.880> been<00:02:24.060> using<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.570> same<00:02:24.750> method

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
way and i've been using the same method

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.050 
way and i've been using the same method
for<00:02:25.290> about<00:02:25.440> two<00:02:25.680> years<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.100> my<00:02:26.519> books<00:02:26.820> have

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
for about two years and my books have

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.420 
for about two years and my books have
all<00:02:27.239> lies<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.720> need<00:02:27.930> at<00:02:28.440> least<00:02:28.500> two<00:02:28.920> seasons

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
all lies to need at least two seasons

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.970 
all lies to need at least two seasons
for<00:02:29.640> each<00:02:29.760> one<00:02:30.030> each<00:02:30.269> pair<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.500> do<00:02:31.620> think<00:02:31.890> I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
for each one each pair so I do think I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.979 
for each one each pair so I do think I
have<00:02:32.280> some<00:02:32.610> credibility<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:33.930> to

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
have some credibility you just have to

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.350 
have some credibility you just have to
give<00:02:34.050> them<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.410> nice<00:02:34.709> wash<00:02:35.190> then<00:02:35.640> make<00:02:36.330> sure

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
give them a nice wash then make sure

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
give them a nice wash then make sure
they<00:02:36.660> dry<00:02:37.730> never<00:02:38.730> put<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.090> gloves<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.510> like

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
can sounds like that's going to dry out

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.920 
can sounds like that's going to dry out
the<00:02:45.000> latex<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.840> crack<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.080> up<00:02:46.380> and

the latex and just crack it up and
someone<00:02:48.930> will<00:02:49.049> be<00:02:49.140> very<00:02:49.470> sad

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.720 

give<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:54.629> nice<00:02:54.810> squeeze<00:02:55.310> get<00:02:56.310> all<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.519> dirt

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
give it a nice squeeze get all the dirt

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.809 
give it a nice squeeze get all the dirt
out<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.580> just<00:03:00.180> do<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.200> couple<00:03:01.260> times

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
out and just do that a couple times

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.190 
out and just do that a couple times
until<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:02.879> really<00:03:03.360> think<00:03:03.629> you<00:03:03.720> got<00:03:03.870> all<00:03:04.049> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
until you really think you got all the

until you really think you got all the
dirt<00:03:04.409> out<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.069> think<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:06.209> think<00:03:06.390> your

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
dirt out and you think it you think your

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.770 
dirt out and you think it you think your
gloves<00:03:06.750> are<00:03:06.930> pain<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.670> may<00:03:08.909> take<00:03:09.150> maybe

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
gloves are pain and this may take maybe

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.720 
gloves are pain and this may take maybe
five<00:03:10.079> minutes<00:03:10.349> or<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.920> three<00:03:11.430> or<00:03:11.579> five

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
five minutes or you three or five

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.930 
five minutes or you three or five
minutes<00:03:12.090> prepared<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.890> know<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.549> little

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
minutes prepared I know it's a little

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.630 
minutes prepared I know it's a little
bit<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.269> hassle<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.920> worth<00:03:17.430> it

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
bit of a hassle but it is that worth it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.660 
bit of a hassle but it is that worth it
and<00:03:18.140> results<00:03:19.140> will<00:03:19.349> show<00:03:19.379> that<00:03:19.980> next<00:03:20.310> time<00:03:20.459> you

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
and results will show that next time you

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.880 
and results will show that next time you

what practice think we're just about
done<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:35.090> get<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.120> focus<00:03:36.720> that's<00:03:36.900> how<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
done so get that focus that's how the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.399 
done so get that focus that's how the
new<00:03:37.890> wool<00:03:38.700> that's<00:03:38.970> how<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.209> theme<00:03:39.629> loves<00:03:40.170> look

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
like and just compare yeah there's a big

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.970 
like and just compare yeah there's a big
difference<00:03:44.459> um<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.510> know<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.530> little<00:03:46.650> dirty

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
difference um I know it's a little dirty

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.589 
difference um I know it's a little dirty

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
still but I can't really do anything

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.420 
still but I can't really do anything
about<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.989> because<00:03:49.379> those<00:03:49.709> are<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:49.950> marks

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
about that because those are just marks

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.210 
about that because those are just marks
left<00:03:51.420> by<00:03:51.569> previous<00:03:51.659> use<00:03:52.409> and<00:03:52.739> I've<00:03:52.890> been<00:03:53.040> using
