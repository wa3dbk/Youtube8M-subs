00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
and I tried it myself and want to

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.750 
and I tried it myself and want to
address<00:00:11.270> it<00:00:11.570> a<00:00:11.720> lot<00:00:12.350> of<00:00:12.380> times<00:00:12.710> we<00:00:12.950> get<00:00:13.130> cars<00:00:13.460> in

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:13.760 
address it a lot of times we get cars in

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.730 
address it a lot of times we get cars in
or<00:00:13.940> we<00:00:14.059> have<00:00:14.210> customers<00:00:14.750> ask<00:00:14.960> about<00:00:15.290> cars<00:00:15.620> that

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
or we have customers ask about cars that

or we have customers ask about cars that
have<00:00:16.070> foggy<00:00:16.460> headlights<00:00:17.060> like<00:00:17.300> this<00:00:18.519> now

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
have foggy headlights like this now

have foggy headlights like this now
there's<00:00:19.789> a<00:00:19.849> solution<00:00:20.089> going<00:00:20.689> around<00:00:20.929> on<00:00:21.109> the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
there's a solution going around on the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.470 
there's a solution going around on the
internet<00:00:21.230> that<00:00:21.769> uses<00:00:22.189> deep<00:00:22.489> woods<00:00:22.789> off<00:00:23.060> bug

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
internet that uses deep woods off bug

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.559 
internet that uses deep woods off bug
spray<00:00:23.869> a<00:00:24.460> lot<00:00:25.460> of<00:00:25.579> people<00:00:25.909> wipe<00:00:26.119> it<00:00:26.300> on<00:00:26.419> their

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:26.569 
spray a lot of people wipe it on their

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.179 
spray a lot of people wipe it on their
headlights<00:00:26.989> and<00:00:27.319> they<00:00:27.409> say<00:00:27.619> it<00:00:27.769> looks<00:00:27.980> like

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
headlights and they say it looks like

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.819 
headlights and they say it looks like
brand-new<00:00:28.869> instead<00:00:29.869> of<00:00:29.989> looking<00:00:30.289> like<00:00:30.349> this

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
brand-new instead of looking like this

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.279 
brand-new instead of looking like this
in<00:00:32.290> fact<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:33.730> treated<00:00:34.730> this<00:00:34.879> one<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.359> it<00:00:36.079> does

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
in fact I treated this one and it does

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.009 
in fact I treated this one and it does
look<00:00:36.559> great<00:00:36.769> even<00:00:37.399> though<00:00:37.519> it<00:00:37.670> works<00:00:37.910> great<00:00:38.269> it

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
look great even though it works great it

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:40.750 
look great even though it works great it
doesn't<00:00:39.469> come<00:00:39.649> without<00:00:39.920> its<00:00:40.129> problems

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
doesn't come without its problems

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.630 
doesn't come without its problems
the<00:00:41.600> reason<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.260> off<00:00:42.440> works<00:00:42.859> is<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.160> chemical

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
the reason the off works is a chemical

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.479 
the reason the off works is a chemical
in<00:00:43.910> it<00:00:44.059> known<00:00:44.239> as<00:00:44.420> DEET<00:00:44.719> DEET<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:45.920> solvent

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
in it known as DEET DEET is a solvent

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.340 
in it known as DEET DEET is a solvent
that<00:00:46.640> actually<00:00:47.089> dissolves<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.719> thin<00:00:47.960> layer<00:00:48.140> of

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
that actually dissolves a thin layer of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.099 
that actually dissolves a thin layer of
the<00:00:48.500> plastic<00:00:49.010> off<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.399> headlight<00:00:50.359> and<00:00:50.570> that's

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
the plastic off the headlight and that's

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.439 
the plastic off the headlight and that's
what<00:00:51.289> takes<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.679> oxidation<00:00:52.219> away<00:00:52.670> that

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
what takes the oxidation away that

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.450 
what takes the oxidation away that
leaves<00:00:53.719> you<00:00:53.839> with<00:00:53.870> another<00:00:54.230> problem<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.920> layer

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
leaves you with another problem a layer

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.579 
leaves you with another problem a layer
of<00:00:55.640> semi<00:00:55.910> dissolved<00:00:56.510> plastic<00:00:57.050> that's<00:00:57.230> kind<00:00:57.469> of

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
of semi dissolved plastic that's kind of

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.669 
of semi dissolved plastic that's kind of
sticky<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.870> leaves<00:00:59.870> you<00:01:00.019> with<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.260> problem

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
sticky and leaves you with the problem

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.009 
sticky and leaves you with the problem
that<00:01:00.710> may<00:01:01.039> get<00:01:01.249> worse<00:01:01.460> again<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.749> there's

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
that may get worse again but there's

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.290 
that may get worse again but there's
some<00:01:03.140> experimentation<00:01:04.100> on<00:01:04.250> my<00:01:04.370> own<00:01:04.519> vehicle<00:01:04.850> I

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
some experimentation on my own vehicle I

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.390 
some experimentation on my own vehicle I
think<00:01:05.930> I've<00:01:06.080> figured<00:01:06.320> out<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.650> solution<00:01:07.100> that

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
think I've figured out a solution that

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.380 
think I've figured out a solution that
works<00:01:07.610> pretty<00:01:07.880> well<00:01:09.820> now<00:01:10.820> I'm<00:01:11.000> going<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.210> show

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
works pretty well now I'm going to show

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.990 
works pretty well now I'm going to show
you<00:01:11.450> how<00:01:11.690> this<00:01:11.900> method<00:01:12.170> works<00:01:12.760> first<00:01:13.760> thing

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
you how this method works first thing

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.760 
you how this method works first thing
you<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.540> take<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.020> deep<00:01:15.230> woods<00:01:15.530> off

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
you do is you take the deep woods off

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.700 
you do is you take the deep woods off
and<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.700> spray<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:17.330> on<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.870> paper<00:01:18.080> towel<00:01:18.440> you

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
and you spray it on a paper towel you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.290 
and you spray it on a paper towel you
don't<00:01:18.980> want<00:01:19.160> to<00:01:19.220> spray<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.490> directly<00:01:19.940> on<00:01:20.150> the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
don't want to spray it directly on the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
don't want to spray it directly on the
headlight<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.270> soaked<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.780> paper<00:01:23.990> towel

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
headlight so I soaked the paper towel

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.910 
headlight so I soaked the paper towel
and<00:01:24.620> then<00:01:25.160> I<00:01:25.250> wipe<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.550> headlight<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:27.740> can

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
and then I wipe the headlight you can

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.680 
and then I wipe the headlight you can
immediately<00:01:28.190> see<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.970> headlight<00:01:29.330> getting

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
immediately see the headlight getting

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.870 
immediately see the headlight getting
cleaner<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.260> clearer<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:31.460> looks<00:01:31.700> like

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
cleaner and clearer and it looks like

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.070 
cleaner and clearer and it looks like
it's<00:01:32.090> working<00:01:32.330> great<00:01:34.330> if<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.480> look<00:01:35.720> at<00:01:35.870> this

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's working great if you look at this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.200 
it's working great if you look at this
you<00:01:36.350> can<00:01:36.380> see<00:01:36.740> how<00:01:36.920> much<00:01:37.130> grime<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.060> old

you can see how much grime and old

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.210 
you can see how much grime and old
oxidation<00:01:39.020> is<00:01:39.110> coming<00:01:39.470> off<00:01:39.620> the<00:01:39.830> headlight

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
oxidation is coming off the headlight

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.800 
oxidation is coming off the headlight
it's<00:01:40.430> incredible<00:01:41.030> I'm<00:01:41.210> just<00:01:41.420> going<00:01:41.540> to<00:01:41.600> keep

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
it's incredible I'm just going to keep

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.870 
it's incredible I'm just going to keep
wiping<00:01:42.080> until<00:01:42.650> it<00:01:42.740> looks<00:01:42.950> pretty<00:01:43.250> good<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.520> is

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
wiping until it looks pretty good it is

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.610 
wiping until it looks pretty good it is
going<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.150> take<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.390> good<00:01:44.690> amount<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.080> off<00:01:45.260> but

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
going to take a good amount of off but

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.070 
going to take a good amount of off but
hey<00:01:45.770> it's<00:01:45.980> only<00:01:46.160> six<00:01:46.550> dollars<00:01:46.760> a<00:01:47.270> new<00:01:47.870> hauled

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
hey it's only six dollars a new hauled

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
light's going to be a hundred and fifty

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.920 
light's going to be a hundred and fifty
to<00:01:49.550> two<00:01:49.580> hundred<00:01:49.910> depending<00:01:50.210> on<00:01:50.600> what<00:01:50.750> vehicle

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
to two hundred depending on what vehicle

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.380 
to two hundred depending on what vehicle
you<00:01:51.290> drive<00:01:51.440> so<00:01:52.370> this<00:01:52.550> is<00:01:52.700> going<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:52.910> save<00:01:53.150> you<00:01:53.360> a

good<00:01:55.880> longer<00:01:57.790> alright<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.090> let<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.630> off<00:01:59.870> dry

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
good longer alright so I let the off dry

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.750 
good longer alright so I let the off dry
on<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.650> headlights<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> little<00:02:01.610> while<00:02:01.730> I

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
on the headlights for a little while I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.570 
on the headlights for a little while I
found<00:02:02.210> letting<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.810> dry<00:02:03.080> for<00:02:03.220> 20<00:02:04.220> or<00:02:04.250> 30

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
found letting it dry for 20 or 30

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.430 
found letting it dry for 20 or 30
minutes<00:02:04.820> seems<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.450> make<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.840> work<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.320> little

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
minutes seems to make it work a little

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.520 
minutes seems to make it work a little
bit<00:02:06.650> better<00:02:07.119> now<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.629> get<00:02:08.810> that<00:02:08.989> stickiness

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
bit better now to get that stickiness

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.760 
bit better now to get that stickiness
and<00:02:09.920> stop<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:11.240> layer<00:02:11.570> of<00:02:11.600> semi<00:02:12.320> melted

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
and stop that layer of semi melted

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.350 
and stop that layer of semi melted
plastic<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.340> talked<00:02:13.610> about

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
plastic I talked about

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.630 
plastic I talked about
I'm<00:02:14.420> going<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.600> use<00:02:14.750> white<00:02:14.990> vinegar<00:02:15.430> I'm<00:02:16.430> just

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
I'm going to use white vinegar I'm just

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.950 
I'm going to use white vinegar I'm just
going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.820> soak<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.180> paper<00:02:17.480> towel<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.870> the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
going to soak a paper towel in the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.740 
going to soak a paper towel in the
vinegar<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:19.340> I'm<00:02:19.880> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.090> drench<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
vinegar and I'm going to drench the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.270 
vinegar and I'm going to drench the
headlight<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.410> vinegar<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.800> couple<00:02:22.160> of

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
headlight in the vinegar a couple of

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.840 
headlight in the vinegar a couple of
times<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:29.890> tried<00:02:30.890> rubbing<00:02:31.190> alcohol

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
times I tried rubbing alcohol

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.790 
times I tried rubbing alcohol
I<00:02:32.090> tried<00:02:32.360> soap<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.930> water<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.500> I<00:02:33.560> found

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
I tried soap and water and I found

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.220 
I tried soap and water and I found
vinegar<00:02:34.340> was<00:02:34.520> about<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.940> only<00:02:35.210> thing<00:02:35.480> that

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
vinegar was about the only thing that

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.290 
vinegar was about the only thing that
killed<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.710> stickiness<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:38.090> off

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
killed the stickiness that the off

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.560 
killed the stickiness that the off
creates<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.760> doesn't<00:02:40.760> cause<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.180> headlight

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
creates and doesn't cause the headlight

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.440 
creates and doesn't cause the headlight
to<00:02:41.750> haze<00:02:41.930> up<00:02:42.200> immediately<00:02:42.790> now<00:02:43.790> after<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.180> rinse

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
to haze up immediately now after I rinse

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.970 
to haze up immediately now after I rinse
it<00:02:44.570> with<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.840> vinegar<00:02:45.200> I'm<00:02:45.590> just<00:02:45.800> going<00:02:45.950> to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
it with the vinegar I'm just going to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.980 
it with the vinegar I'm just going to
rinse<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.400> with<00:02:46.490> water<00:02:46.760> you're<00:02:47.690> into<00:02:47.900> that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
rinse it with water you're into that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.010 
rinse it with water you're into that
vinegar<00:02:48.440> away<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.240> in<00:02:50.240> just<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.570> second<00:02:50.930> I'll

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
vinegar away and in just a second I'll

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.770 
vinegar away and in just a second I'll
show<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.500> results<00:02:51.890> we<00:02:51.950> came<00:02:52.190> up<00:02:52.370> with<00:02:52.780> now

show you the results we came up with now
here's<00:02:54.020> a<00:02:54.080> look<00:02:54.260> at<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.530> finished<00:02:54.830> product

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
here's a look at the finished product

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.949 
here's a look at the finished product
after<00:02:55.489> we<00:02:55.760> treated<00:02:56.030> these<00:02:56.330> headlights<00:02:56.720> with

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
after we treated these headlights with

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.260 
after we treated these headlights with
the<00:02:57.080> off<00:02:57.200> bug<00:02:57.530> spray<00:02:57.860> they're<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.700> perfect

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
the off bug spray they're not perfect

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.640 
the off bug spray they're not perfect
like<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.450> brand<00:02:59.780> new<00:02:59.959> headlight<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:00.530> they

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
like a brand new headlight but they

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.320 
like a brand new headlight but they
certainly<00:03:00.950> look<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.520> hundred<00:03:01.820> times<00:03:02.030> better

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
certainly look a hundred times better

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.350 
certainly look a hundred times better
than<00:03:02.570> they<00:03:02.720> did<00:03:02.780> before<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.470> started<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:04.360> had

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
than they did before we started I had

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.970 
than they did before we started I had
some<00:03:05.540> pretty<00:03:05.660> good<00:03:05.900> success<00:03:05.959> using<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.860> off

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
some pretty good success using the off

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.710 
some pretty good success using the off

came out as well these are how the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.030 
came out as well these are how the
headlights<00:03:17.690> turned<00:03:17.989> out<00:03:18.170> on<00:03:18.350> my<00:03:18.530> personal

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
2006 Toyota Tundra they're certainly not

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.370 
2006 Toyota Tundra they're certainly not
perfect<00:03:22.430> but<00:03:23.180> they're<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.420> lot<00:03:23.690> clearer<00:03:24.080> and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
perfect but they're a lot clearer and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.990 
perfect but they're a lot clearer and
they<00:03:24.470> look<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.799> lot<00:03:25.100> nicer<00:03:25.340> than<00:03:25.790> they<00:03:25.940> did

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
they look a lot nicer than they did

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.390 
they look a lot nicer than they did
before<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.600> did<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.019> with<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.380> off<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.160> can

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
before I did it with the off now you can

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.009 
before I did it with the off now you can
see<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:28.640> had<00:03:28.880> some<00:03:29.030> really<00:03:29.180> good<00:03:29.420> results<00:03:29.660> for

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
see I had some really good results for

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.539 
see I had some really good results for
storing<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.470> headlights<00:03:30.830> on<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:31.160> PT

spray<00:03:34.910> by<00:03:35.870> no<00:03:35.930> means<00:03:36.320> am<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.620> trying<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:36.980> say

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
spray by no means am I trying to say

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.560 
spray by no means am I trying to say
this<00:03:37.340> is<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.610> perfect<00:03:37.820> method<00:03:38.360> to<00:03:38.450> restore

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
this is the perfect method to restore

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.479 
this is the perfect method to restore
headlights<00:03:38.989> or<00:03:39.410> even<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.709> best<00:03:39.920> method<00:03:40.340> out

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
headlights or even the best method out

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.430 
headlights or even the best method out
but<00:03:41.360> it's<00:03:41.510> certainly<00:03:41.900> cheaper<00:03:42.170> than

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
but it's certainly cheaper than

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.199 
but it's certainly cheaper than
replacing<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:43.070> headlights<00:03:43.459> or<00:03:43.700> taking<00:03:44.090> them

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
replacing the headlights or taking them

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.479 
replacing the headlights or taking them

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
to a detailer to be restored and it's

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.920 
to a detailer to be restored and it's
quite<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.760> bit<00:03:46.940> cheaper<00:03:47.269> than<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.480> lot<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.750> the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
quite a bit cheaper than a lot of the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.110 
quite a bit cheaper than a lot of the

kids on the market to restore the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.509

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
headlights in my case I thought it was

headlights in my case I thought it was
worth<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.910> try<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.600> I<00:03:53.959> think<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.320> found<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.739> way

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
worth the try and I think I found a way

worth the try and I think I found a way
