antennae and Dana's building you know I
think<00:00:57.340> you<00:00:57.550> helped<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.820> make<00:00:57.970> that<00:00:58.120> clear<00:00:58.480> so

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
think you helped to make that clear so

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.259 
think you helped to make that clear so
this<00:00:59.650> was<00:00:59.799> the<00:00:59.920> gizmo<00:01:00.339> that's<00:01:00.640> supposed<00:01:01.120> to

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
this was the gizmo that's supposed to

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.390 
this was the gizmo that's supposed to
feed<00:01:01.479> energy<00:01:01.720> to<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.350> destructor<00:01:03.070> form

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
feed energy to the destructor form

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.899 
feed energy to the destructor form
that's<00:01:04.059> that's<00:01:04.900> right<00:01:05.170> Peter

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
that's that's right Peter

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.200

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
well dr. Venkman well I had to get one

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.070 
well dr. Venkman well I had to get one
right<00:01:10.510> eventually

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
right eventually

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.789 
right eventually
didn't<00:01:11.799> I<00:01:11.860> have<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.100> just<00:01:12.280> math<00:01:13.409> or<00:01:14.409> I'm<00:01:14.619> just

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
didn't I have a just math or I'm just

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.230 
didn't I have a just math or I'm just
speculating<00:01:15.010> but<00:01:15.460> it's<00:01:15.610> possible<00:01:16.090> that

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
speculating but it's possible that

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.580 
speculating but it's possible that

stronger and stronger until they reach

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.550 
stronger and stronger until they reach
the<00:01:21.430> end<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.760> then<00:01:21.940> they<00:01:22.090> look<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:23.350> first

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
the end and then they look the first

the end and then they look the first
portal<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.369> library<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.450> second<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.470> museum

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
portal the library the second the museum

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.789 
portal the library the second the museum
and<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.790> third<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.540> sedgwick<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.260> that

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
and the third the sedgwick and that

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.980 
and the third the sedgwick and that
means<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.159> fourth<00:01:30.430> portal<00:01:30.790> must<00:01:31.000> be<00:01:31.180> right

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
means the fourth portal must be right

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.700 
means the fourth portal must be right
here<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.520> middle<00:01:33.820> of<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.120> Hudson<00:01:34.510> River<00:01:34.710> well

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
according to the mandala yes it may need

according to the mandala yes it may need
a<00:01:38.890> little<00:01:39.070> tweaking<00:01:39.840> No

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
plenty of bodies in that River could

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.420 
plenty of bodies in that River could

become ghosts but what does this have to

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
become ghosts but what does this have to
do<00:01:45.670> with<00:01:45.700> me

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
