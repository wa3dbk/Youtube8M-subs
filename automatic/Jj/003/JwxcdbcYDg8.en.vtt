00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.720

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.339
 video you like again it's new 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.710
 top talent is for those who do not know 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.349
 so this is a series but which players 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.910
 and very occasionally I pick up a club 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.650
 you what their strengths are in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 players case how much potential they have 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.920
 have the best way to use them 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.289
 the team in which I use them 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 I usually also show you clips from 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.800
 thing will see live for one 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 reproduction and I tell you so 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.369
 must get some furies or not that 's an idea 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.439
 of this series and in for this 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.150
 episode I had to think long before I 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.360
 would use and I finally went 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.329
 for hector caller who is a 17 year old 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.160
 spanish right back 56 wide the three star 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.629
 skills 3 star week for the medium i 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 the work great 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.660
 is good sofa gives my potential of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.879
 82 and it's a very good right back 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.200
 you can from jovian spring striker like 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.520
 be a biggest water and that is too 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.510
 certainly the case 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.280
 as you make him a bit 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.140
 trouble-free city is not synonymous 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.879
 really good looking but this is one of them 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 the most inexpensive and most talented 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.899
 options for the right back position 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.850
 it cost me a few hundred thousand 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.189
 maybe a million and this is her 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.560
 in my the fifth sixth season 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.810
 maybe it also with ac milan 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.490
 he is a substitute me he is 78 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.150
 know it now and you are the one 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 arguing he's great at the speed 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.830
 run very well from spectacle 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.009
 he can easily come by 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.799
 but he is not very strong his ball 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.570
 control and the dribbling are pretty good 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.490
 ali are city for these associations 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.740
 they were decent but slidedeck 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.150
 seventy one right now and I can 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.670
 definitely say that for you one 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.460
 very good player with some 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.259
 point is that he might miss some strength 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 for those who are very fond of the powerful 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.280
 and play and be more of the president 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.770
 that we are not really just things 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.990
 fit and speed is sure to be 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.060
 good points and how this is the only one 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.100
 game moment that I could find one and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.960
 I also have no will live clips of how 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.610
 comes that well now he is only 17 you always 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.700
 about and about barcelona by the way 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.290
 get it on loan for what and it 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.060
 case 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.860
 yes there are not many clips of it yet 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.460
 one or it is very, very low quality 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.470
 clips 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.540
 so i don't have picture say you are sitting here 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.610
 repeated just one xviii 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.800
 i played a one against roma and what i did 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.050
 guarantee it is the money is true 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.030
 he is growing fast, he is whole 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.460
 useful for gelatin such as brighton on 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.680
 one of other layers of english he divisions 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.820
 online speed is growing he never scores 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.260
 insufficient 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.550
 even if he went great game 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.710
 it always plays well enough 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.960
 he does his job she speed is one 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.580
 determining factor in every match and me 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.260
 you can definitely recommend to pick up 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.570
 if you have a club that has little money and or 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.250
 if you are looking for a good substitute the player 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.959
 well that was fabrics this one 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.090
 delivery and before I stop I want 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.680
 you ask i want one next time 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.690
 team by you have interesting there 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.950
 because I see a lot of people with players 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.280
 and I understand that people want players 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.080
 know 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.640
 but it might also seem like a hand 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.850
 for some people if you also some more 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.620
 teams know so you just know yes 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.910
 my world of hotkeys and so and maybe 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.740
 is that more pleasant than the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.050
 standard teams if you have an ipad 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.060
 detect saucy milan the chat headset goose 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.760
