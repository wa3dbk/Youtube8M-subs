00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
booted up here quicker so it was a

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.400 
booted up here quicker so it was a
little<00:01:35.460> bit<00:01:35.580> snappier<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.300> of<00:01:37.110> course

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
little bit snappier there of course

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.710 
little bit snappier there of course
there<00:01:37.830> are<00:01:37.920> some<00:01:38.040> other<00:01:38.220> things<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.120> I

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
there are some other things here like I

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
there are some other things here like I
always<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.440> setup<00:01:40.860> here

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
always have to do setup here

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.610 
always have to do setup here
when<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.550> boot<00:01:41.760> up<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.630> c1<00:01:43.410> which

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
when I boot up do you know the c1 which

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.260 
when I boot up do you know the c1 which
I'm<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:43.890> sure<00:01:44.040> why<00:01:48.980> maybe<00:01:49.980> I<00:01:50.190> should<00:01:50.760> research

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
I'm not sure why maybe I should research

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.360 
I'm not sure why maybe I should research
that<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.900> mean<00:01:52.410> you<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:52.620> see<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.980> get<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> bigger

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
that I mean you can see you get a bigger

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.440 
that I mean you can see you get a bigger
display<00:01:53.760> here<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.350> note<00:01:55.890> 3<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
display here on the note 3 and like a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.760 
display here on the note 3 and like a
5.7<00:01:57.810> inch<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.380> play<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.860> versus<00:01:59.760> a<00:02:00.770> 5-inch

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
5.7 inch to play I think versus a 5-inch

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.650 
5.7 inch to play I think versus a 5-inch
display<00:02:01.860> camera<00:02:02.370> over<00:02:02.640> here<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.240> there's<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
display camera over here and there's a

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.090

lot<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.870> things<00:02:04.080> to<00:02:04.170> say<00:02:04.350> about<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.710> display

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
lot of things to say about the display

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.180 
lot of things to say about the display
especially<00:02:05.910> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.120> c1<00:02:06.660> I<00:02:06.900> really<00:02:07.800> hate<00:02:08.010> this

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
especially on the c1 I really hate this

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.540 
especially on the c1 I really hate this
device<00:02:08.580> because<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.480> viewing<00:02:09.750> angles

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
device because of the viewing angles

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.460 
device because of the viewing angles
it's<00:02:11.550> really<00:02:12.060> really<00:02:12.300> bad<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.900> better<00:02:13.140> than

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it's really really bad it's better than

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.820 
it's really really bad it's better than
then<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.670> original<00:02:15.920> Xperia<00:02:16.920> phone<00:02:17.220> but<00:02:18.180> still

then the original Xperia phone but still
I'm<00:02:19.830> not<00:02:19.980> sure<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.430> they<00:02:20.580> want<00:02:21.330> why<00:02:21.510> they

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
I'm not sure what they want why they

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.260 
I'm not sure what they want why they
can't<00:02:21.840> fix<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.700> since<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.850> my<00:02:24.000> camera

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
can't fix that and since like my camera

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.140 
can't fix that and since like my camera
doesn't<00:02:24.870> really<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.440> display<00:02:25.860> either

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
technology especially with this device

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.160

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
so I read some comments and you can see

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.270 
so I read some comments and you can see
here<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.080> I've<00:02:40.380> had<00:02:40.560> some<00:02:40.890> problems

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
here that then I've had some problems

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.940 
here that then I've had some problems
with<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.700> z1<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.530> want<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
with is z1 here and that is it want to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.560 
with is z1 here and that is it want to
turn<00:02:44.100> off<00:02:44.130> optimize<00:02:44.670> back<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.330> think

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
turn off optimize back like to think

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.780 
turn off optimize back like to think
that<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.470> could<00:02:46.770> cause<00:02:46.950> one<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.430> those<00:02:47.550> issues

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
that it could cause one of those issues

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.840 
that it could cause one of those issues
