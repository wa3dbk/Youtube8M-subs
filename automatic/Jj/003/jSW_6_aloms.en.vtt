00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.460
 in this video and we will try to explain what it is and how it works 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.649
 new dynamic energy saving system developed by giants 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.170
 most commonly known 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.579
 as andes 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:12.630
 basically 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.739
 for the user 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.650
 what you will get to see Cuba could control is 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.130
 this little niggle 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.590
 this software allows us to understand turn off there was choose people the extinct 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.400
 energy saving passes 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.030
 as well as we demonstrate at all times what is the real consumption of our 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.420
 processor i the amount of energy saves 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.550
 In this case, as you can see, what most strikes us is this 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.090
 small button 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.210
 this vote allows us to light up the energy saving system in this 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.649
 case as you can see that it is off 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.319
 what is active at all times is the measurement of actual consumption of 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:49.940
 our past 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.110
 As you can see right now it's a bit high because we've wanted 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.860
 force the gap area to see greater differences during the reactivation of 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.530
 this test 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.170
 we will proceed to pass a superti d union 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.890
 see what is the real performance and consumption 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.890
 of this processor with the kers system turned off 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.470
 As you can see, as soon as we activate it, the consumption until February is set at 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.470
 maximum coming home to the 42 parties 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.400
 We can also check what the performance is 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.390
 really processing without any energy saving technology 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.180
 activated 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.430
 to see if later it is worth having it activated by what it exhibited 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 is usually the heel of achilles d these new technologies 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.140
 we proceed to activate the leds system 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.210
 removing on the button 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.140
 you see that everything turns green 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.980
 and what are the ones that have guns on the screen 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.010
 well these pistons symbolize each of the six phases of feeding 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.880
 that this is his life this motherboard 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.800
 as you see right now only in the active what is what happens when 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.410
 this Tuesday is disabled 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.620
 when this evil is uninhabited 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.410
 all feeding phases that are receiving energy but not from 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.710
 an efficient way since the accused and scared to the maximum of its capacity 

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:15.629
 with this system what we get is that only the phases feed that 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.699
 are necessary that are active as you see at this time only 2 was 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.909
 locations 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.989
 We also see here the different levels of energy saving that 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.709
 provides this technology 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.319
 each of them with a point of advantage greater energy saving being 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.549
 level 1 the least energy saver 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.549
 offers and level 3 is the highest 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:37.489
 let's see now 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.599
 that the v core 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.029
 of the processor 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:45.419
 also has descended from the dark with 44 that showed us three clubs one with 104 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:46.950
 1 with 120 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.719
 that will be showing us now 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.719
 as you see a quite considerable voltage drop 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.719
 of course the consumption of our processor also drops 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:01.199
 but this amount will result in an equivalent loss of entrepreneurship 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.199
 let's go check it with a foot one month 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.479
 as you can see the consumption is processed of course has gone up well 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:13.939
 as his record 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.469
 but we will see what is the real performance that we are losing to see if 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.469
 this technology is relentless with smells 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.839
 well afterwards as you can see - the second I am in the fall of 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:32.009
 performance that we have had in a synthetic test 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:36.439
 this of course to the greatest enthusiasts and overclockers will seem 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.239
 a very considerable loss of performance 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.309
 but not sincerely 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:45.650
 to perform the accomplishment of daily tasks by more complex tasks of a 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:49.309
 normal user a reality in less than a second in this test can be 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:51.819
 consider almost negligible 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.889
 as you can see then the energy saving 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.590
 if it is considerable 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.590
 in the face of the loss of performance that we have 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.160
 in this way we can save 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.860
 not only in it not only in 0 2 missions to the atmosphere what is clear 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.720
 that worries us but something that worries us much more the bill see the 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.929
 electric bill at the end of the month 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:16.449
 let's hope it stays a little clearer what this system of 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.970
 energy saving and how it is managed
