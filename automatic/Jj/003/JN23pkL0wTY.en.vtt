the on city of Alliance and what this is
as<00:00:15.929> these<00:00:16.170> are<00:00:16.199> orchids<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:17.119> mainly<00:00:18.119> are<00:00:18.210> in

they are all blended together they're so

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.250 
they are all blended together they're so
hybridized<00:00:26.340> because<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.960> growing

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260

as<00:01:48.540> I'm<00:01:48.659> calling<00:01:48.840> them<00:01:49.079> these<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.829> just

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
as I'm calling them these are all just

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.460 
as I'm calling them these are all just
different<00:01:50.220> varieties<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.259> they're<00:01:52.259> just

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
different varieties and they're just

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.280 
different varieties and they're just
gorgeous<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:54.020> there's<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.229> a

bo ara there's a Tacoma Glacier I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.289 
bo ara there's a Tacoma Glacier I
there's<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.799> there's<00:01:59.369> several<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.880> the

there's just there's several just the
varieties<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> is

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
varieties and and what it is

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.999

well<00:02:02.490> they're<00:02:02.640> called<00:02:02.850> inter<00:02:03.090> generics<00:02:03.540> is

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
well they're called inter generics is

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.410 
well they're called inter generics is
their<00:02:05.009> parent<00:02:05.430> plants<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> lot<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> these

Tony are a little better with that but

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.150 
Tony are a little better with that but
the<00:03:21.810> intra<00:03:21.989> generics<00:03:22.440> do<00:03:22.920> need<00:03:23.130> that

the intra generics do need that

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.400 
the intra generics do need that
specialty<00:03:23.760> but<00:03:24.000> once<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.330> do<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.540> they

specialty but once you do that they

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.790 
specialty but once you do that they
react<00:03:25.739> very<00:03:25.770> nicely<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:27.050> they<00:03:28.050> are<00:03:28.260> very<00:03:28.530> good

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800
