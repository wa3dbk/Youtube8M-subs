00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
that was really interesting because I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.160

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that the kids got away and the whole

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.160 
that the kids got away and the whole
kids<00:01:41.040> thing<00:01:41.159> again<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> older

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
kids thing again I think this is older

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.389 
kids thing again I think this is older
what<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.530> don't<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:43.890> he's<00:01:44.009> gonna<00:01:44.159> keep

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
what I don't know if he's gonna keep

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.280 
what I don't know if he's gonna keep
doing<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> new<00:01:45.090> world<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
doing this with the new world like it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.749 
doing this with the new world like it
seems<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.710> though<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> last<00:01:47.220> arc<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
seems as though the last arc with the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.370 
seems as though the last arc with the
Fishman<00:01:48.060> Island<00:01:48.210> he<00:01:48.720> was<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.170> like

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
Fishman Island he was going for like

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.190 
Fishman Island he was going for like
civil<00:01:50.159> rights<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> know<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.299> guess

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
civil rights and like you know I guess

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.139 
civil rights and like you know I guess
trying<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.619> reenact<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.640> way<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> civil

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
trying to reenact and in a way the civil

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.060 
trying to reenact and in a way the civil
rights<00:01:54.240> movement<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:54.720> whatnot<00:01:54.869> with<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.799> art

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
rights movement or whatnot with this art

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.620 
rights movement or whatnot with this art
is<00:01:56.250> almost<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.700> though<00:01:56.820> he's<00:01:56.969> trying<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> show

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
is almost as though he's trying to show

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.990 
is almost as though he's trying to show
I<00:01:57.869> guess<00:01:58.140> child<00:01:58.409> abuse<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> stuff<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.939> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I guess child abuse and stuff like that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.789 
I guess child abuse and stuff like that
with<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> kids<00:02:00.810> being<00:02:00.990> addicted<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.500> drugs

next week after he just like we see kid
I<00:03:29.090> believe<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:29.900> was<00:03:30.320> basil<00:03:30.530> Hawking's

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
I believe that was basil Hawking's

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.280 
I believe that was basil Hawking's
beforehand<00:03:32.060> or<00:03:32.150> somebody<00:03:32.570> with<00:03:32.750> like<00:03:32.900> long

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
beforehand or somebody with like long

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.620 
beforehand or somebody with like long
hair<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.220> like<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> sword<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:35.000> think<00:03:35.480> that's

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
hair and like a sword I think that's

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.150 
hair and like a sword I think that's
Hawking's<00:03:36.079> I<00:03:36.260> don't<00:03:36.440> know<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.829> then<00:03:37.040> there

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
Hawking's I don't know and then there

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.500 
Hawking's I don't know and then there
was<00:03:37.250> like<00:03:37.400> two<00:03:37.640> other<00:03:37.850> people<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.180> think<00:03:38.390> we've

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
was like two other people I think we've

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.880 
was like two other people I think we've
seen<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:38.989> couldn't<00:03:39.260> really<00:03:39.410> recognize

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
seen and I couldn't really recognize

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.610 
seen and I couldn't really recognize
them<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:40.609> if<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:40.970> would<00:03:41.120> leave<00:03:41.750> me<00:03:41.810> who<00:03:42.380> they

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
the last panel and I think that was

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.590 
the last panel and I think that was
Hawking's<00:03:52.489> forgive<00:03:53.090> me<00:03:53.209> if<00:03:53.299> I'm<00:03:53.420> wrong
