00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.800 

one<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> things<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.670> like<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.240> p90

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
one of the things I like about the p90

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
one of the things I like about the p90
is<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.409> due<00:01:35.219> to<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.399> fact<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.030> have

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
is that due to the fact that you have

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.710 
is that due to the fact that you have
that<00:01:36.390> large<00:01:36.630> amount<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.200> ammo<00:01:37.799> per<00:01:37.979> clip<00:01:38.720> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
that large amount of ammo per clip you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.120 
that large amount of ammo per clip you
feel<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.110> you're<00:01:40.259> burning<00:01:40.560> through<00:01:40.829> your

you know off the first one to maybe two

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.280 
you know off the first one to maybe two
shots<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:18.130> over<00:02:18.760> long<00:02:18.940> distances<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.930> do<00:02:20.050> need

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
shots so over long distances you do need

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.949 
shots so over long distances you do need
to<00:02:20.380> do<00:02:20.500> pop<00:02:20.740> shots<00:02:21.100> however<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.420> doesn't<00:02:22.630> do

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
by shots from close range will take

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.070 
by shots from close range will take
about<00:03:24.250> four<00:03:24.910> bullets<00:03:25.299> four<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.780> five

about four bullets four to five

um<00:03:27.550> from<00:03:28.550> medium<00:03:28.940> range<00:03:29.180> we'll<00:03:29.420> take<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.660> off

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
um from medium range we'll take it off

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.290 
um from medium range we'll take it off
maybe<00:03:30.290> five<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:31.070> seven<00:03:31.700> depending<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.240> your

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
maybe five to seven depending on your

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.570 
maybe five to seven depending on your
opinion<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:32.830> long<00:03:33.830> ranges<00:03:34.310> seven<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:37.250> just

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
opinion that long ranges seven so just

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.460 
opinion that long ranges seven so just
keep<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:37.970> mind<00:03:38.330> when<00:03:38.810> you're<00:03:38.870> using<00:03:39.170> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
keep that in mind when you're using the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.670 
keep that in mind when you're using the
the<00:03:39.680> p90<00:03:40.510> some<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.660> negative<00:03:42.230> aspects

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
the p90 some of the negative aspects

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.490 
the p90 some of the negative aspects
with<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.340> p90<00:03:44.300> is<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.720> does<00:03:44.900> take<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.320> little

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
with the p90 is it does take a little

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.920 
with the p90 is it does take a little
bit<00:03:45.710> longer<00:03:45.860> to<00:03:46.130> reload<00:03:46.720> compared<00:03:47.720> to<00:03:47.750> the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
bit longer to reload compared to the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.680 
bit longer to reload compared to the
other<00:03:48.050> SMGs<00:03:48.710> that<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.190> have<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:49.610> this<00:03:49.730> game

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
other SMGs that you have in this game

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.440 
other SMGs that you have in this game
the<00:03:52.080> other<00:03:52.560> thing<00:03:52.950> that's<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:54.300> know<00:03:54.420> that's

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
the other thing that's you know that's

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.530 
the other thing that's you know that's
actually<00:03:54.990> pretty<00:03:55.110> nice<00:03:55.320> about<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:56.360> p90<00:03:57.360> being

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
actually pretty nice about the p90 being

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.510 
actually pretty nice about the p90 being
that's<00:03:57.720> an<00:03:57.900> SMG<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.890> really<00:03:59.130> don't<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
that's an SMG you really don't have the

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.900 
that's an SMG you really don't have the
problem<00:03:59.880> with<00:03:59.910> a<00:04:00.450> townsite<00:04:01.310> slowly<00:04:02.310> so<00:04:02.700> you

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
problem with a townsite slowly so you

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.520 
problem with a townsite slowly so you
doing<00:04:03.330> down<00:04:03.570> the<00:04:03.690> site<00:04:03.930> relatively<00:04:04.830> quick<00:04:05.100> um

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
doing down the site relatively quick um

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.610 
doing down the site relatively quick um
p90<00:04:07.530> does<00:04:07.830> have<00:04:08.510> some<00:04:09.510> serious<00:04:09.900> recoil<00:04:10.380> though

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
p90 does have some serious recoil though

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.860 
p90 does have some serious recoil though
so<00:04:10.890> after<00:04:11.130> your<00:04:11.400> first<00:04:11.580> maybe<00:04:12.060> want<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.720> know

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
so after your first maybe want you know

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.550 
so after your first maybe want you know
after<00:04:13.440> second<00:04:14.400> shot<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:15.870> will<00:04:16.080> bounce<00:04:16.260> all

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
after second shot it will bounce all

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.110 
after second shot it will bounce all
over<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.830> place<00:04:17.040> so<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.459> just<00:04:17.580> better<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.910> do

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
over the place so it's just better to do

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.270 
over the place so it's just better to do
pop<00:04:18.360> shots<00:04:18.720> over<00:04:19.049> long<00:04:19.170> distances<00:04:19.739> with<00:04:19.980> the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
pop shots over long distances with the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.740 
pop shots over long distances with the
p90<00:04:21.440> um<00:04:22.440> even<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.550> know<00:04:23.610> those<00:04:24.330> negative

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
p90 um even you know those negative

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.320 
p90 um even you know those negative
aspects<00:04:25.140> being<00:04:25.350> said<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:26.520> know<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.730> p90<00:04:27.270> is

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
aspects being said you know the p90 is

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.690 
aspects being said you know the p90 is
extremely<00:04:28.170> good<00:04:28.560> SMG<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.220> have<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.580> your
