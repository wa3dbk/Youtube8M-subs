00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.477
Mister, we're here because you have an important message to convey. 

00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:18.650
I must inform you that the contract between myself and Juventus

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.701
 which bound us for this year, has been rescinded by mutual consent. 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.583
At what point did you take this decision? 

00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:37.586
It's been a while that I've been developing my thoughts 

00:00:37.586 --> 00:00:43.177
and feelings that have brought me to this decision. 

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:46.824
You've always been connected to Juventus and to the black and white shirt. 

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:51.462
Do you think the past three years have been draining? 

00:00:51.673 --> 00:00:56.464
Would it have been the same no matter what club you were managing? 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:11.157
Let's say that winning is always tough and takes a lot of effort no matter where you are. 

00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:17.974
Inevitably when you're at a club as prestigious as Juventus, 

00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:23.407
which boasts such an illustrious winning tradition, there is an obligation to win 

00:01:23.407 --> 00:01:27.154
and that can be tougher than elsewhere. 

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:32.606
However, proven winners find it easier to deal with the effort 

00:01:32.684 --> 00:01:37.507
and the pressure that come with success. 

00:01:37.507 --> 00:01:43.039
There's a very prestigious coaching position vacant at the moment: the Italy job.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.372
Is that an option for you? 

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:50.967
At the moment all I'm thinking about is the present, 

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:54.996
and the decision taken. 

00:01:54.996 --> 00:02:00.137
What would you like to say to the Bianconeri fans right now? 

00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:07.587
I'd like to reiterate what they already know. 

00:02:07.587 --> 00:02:14.560
I send them my heartfelt thanks for everything 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.025
they have given me over the years. They always stuck by me, 

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:22.987
both during my three years as the coach and my time here as a player. 

00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:27.187
They always showed me their love 

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:31.486
and for that I thank them immensely. 

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:35.906
We should be proud of what we have achieved in these three years together 

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:40.810
because we made history by winning three straight league titles and two Super Cups, 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.474
racking up a record number of points in the process. No one can ever take that away from us. 

00:02:47.474 --> 00:02:55.148
I'd like to thank all the players I have worked with in these three years 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:03:01.143
because they helped me to be a successful coach. 

00:03:01.143 --> 00:03:08.363
They helped us to win and helped me to grow in all sorts of ways. 

00:03:08.446 --> 00:03:13.554
I thank the club, for it has always stood by me.

00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:19.490
I thank Andrea, who chose me three years ago in what 
was by no means an easy time for the Juventus. 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.048
I thank the technical staff, the kitmen, 

00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:28.845
the doctors and physios, the groundsmen, the chefs and everyone else 

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:33.636
who has worked with me to bring success to this Juventus team. 

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:37.522
What will you do tomorrow? 

00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:42.427
I'll think about that tomorrow.
