I was when I heard about and Roberto and

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.729 
I was when I heard about and Roberto and
everything<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:00.989> wasn't<00:04:01.260> really<00:04:01.350> following

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
everything I wasn't really following

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.140 
everything I wasn't really following
this<00:04:01.860> part<00:04:02.100> maybe<00:04:02.250> that's<00:04:02.489> why<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.670> believe<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
this part maybe that's why I believe the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.310 
this part maybe that's why I believe the
hype<00:04:03.330> but<00:04:04.040> anyway<00:04:05.540> we<00:04:06.540> know<00:04:07.019> what<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.230> guys

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
hype but anyway we know what you guys

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.199 
hype but anyway we know what you guys
think<00:04:07.590> about<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.310> quote<00:04:08.550> that<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:08.910> put<00:04:09.120> in

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
think about that the quote that I put in

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.259 
think about that the quote that I put in
a<00:04:09.269> title<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:10.220> Adrien<00:04:11.220> Broner<00:04:11.430> went<00:04:11.760> from<00:04:12.000> being

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
a title of Adrien Broner went from being

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.120 
a title of Adrien Broner went from being
the<00:04:12.540> next<00:04:12.690> Floyd<00:04:13.080> Mayweather<00:04:13.530> didn't<00:04:13.890> mean

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
the next Floyd Mayweather didn't mean

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.060 
the next Floyd Mayweather didn't mean
the<00:04:14.370> next<00:04:14.730> on<00:04:15.299> Roberto<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:16.019> I<00:04:16.260> was<00:04:16.530> cracking<00:04:16.799> up

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
cracking up it gave me a good laugh but

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.890 
cracking up it gave me a good laugh but
