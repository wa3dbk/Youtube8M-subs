00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.579
 the system as difficult for us to play a score of saint-etienne 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.339
 violin after two years of arrest in August 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.779
 dna of samples already said 100 million besides income on a 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.949
 partition of the largest country are finally there both 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.180
 see play it must be said that if he tried to 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.230
 to give back a little bit what I've seen more hear more 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.800
 disk 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.290
 so why not 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.590
 the agreement carries from his cell the village 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.050
 mons 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.270
 - the first observation on the day 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.160
 the estate seems 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.910
 it was not really the case 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.430
 at the first edition of tri-nations deciphering handshake in 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.840
 which I did not want to be able to say all the works for everyone 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.860
 can leave with him with an idea of ​​the work they had to do 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.120
 at the idea that gives an idea of ​​works that they go to play we feel 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.960
 that we created at home 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.940
 a quality of listening compared to what happens around six weeks 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.040
 developed a system to tune today 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.640
 louison started to come off a little bit the tradition they have some 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.299
 personal technical means to improve it 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.180
 and doubt 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.280
 they can all have come to the hands 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.700
 so enjoy this trend the enjoy the music that are all 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.680
 two very quickly 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.080
 m 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.980
 so I think he really has a big job also to listen to do the 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.420
 at home pieces and then 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.590
 since the efficient health system with a very short 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.940
 the orchestra experience it's true that I was running type dogs with them 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.720
 while six friends from Provence but you still have different 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.150
 because that of no one else the chief with us 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 if the mood also between 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.850
 it's even pretty impressive and intends to follow the constant flow of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.850
 take the advanced pretext 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.139
 it's such a thing it's 100% could not miss the camp 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.819
 at my age get to play 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.340
 within the investigated four musicians I would have never thought in the cabins 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.550
 on the one hand and then the first that it does not give pleasure and was 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.799
 dirty it drives to work and I realized progress made 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.209
 for over a month because I do it and 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.519
 it's a plus but 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.469
 in a tent set up in the signs and 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.809
 it is the quality site that the interested party had underlined m 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.809
 I appreciate their starting eleven 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.139
 the humor amateur tournament 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.219
 yes, but fans are the first supporter it says 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:01.239
 this is the part sometimes the least visible yet the music exists in a 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.109
 quoted because what is said 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.919
 also by all these amateur practices everywhere it's boring who likes music 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.769
 and who practice it I think it's very important to us the action the 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.079
 trending topics about this audience that's part of the interest 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.200
 come 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.200
 it starts bad mike moses that is renewed and how to explain this 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.799
 nature is for us 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.379
 one of the essential pillars of building a musical adventure
