00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello everybody, good morning, good afternoon, good evening. 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.830
 my name is good, this is the sertec channel 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.980
 maintenance these are my hands and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.309
 As you can see, we're back to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.500
 one more boxing and this time it was this 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.710
 I ordered here without having arrived and lived 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.689
 42 days to arrive was sent there by 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.869
 my chinese brothers 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.470
 So I'm going to open you already know what it is. 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.949
 and by title but I go I got it 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 I had to pick up the post today 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.480
 because they are tracking the order through 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.980
 post office 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.129
 and was there saying that he left for 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.320
 I did not wait until yesterday and all day 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.629
 How was it raining here? 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.789
 hence I think the guy is lazy of 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.739
 Work was not to deliver to 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.239
 merchandise later posted that in jail 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.059
 has been lost 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.070
 hence the post office, but nothing at all 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.230
 goods have lost the guy 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.120
 who was lazy that the character 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 laziness to deliver that was the truth 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.549
 and I saw you were going to have her in the agency 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.799
 of the post office but here it is and we go 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.799
 see what came here in this chat 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:27.979
 It 's a light package . 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:31.399
 I got here how it was that the boy is 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:38.470
 Of course here 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:38.470
 he declared as gift of course as gift 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:47.210
 stated that it is a led light emitting 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.729
 diode led neon led light 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.080
 declared that it was light not stated 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:02:00.500
 quantities are not 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:05.390
 the pv 10 40 400 grams and the value here is 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:10.810
 declared noda 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.810
 nothing of value and arrived was not taxed 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.450
 I 'll tell you later to see if 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:25.970
 we really have a thousand 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:27.980
 But I think it's got here. Let's not do it. 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.660
 mess since I do not work placement alone 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.420
 what new 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.310
 let's test right I lose 5 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:42.260
 millimeters really see from five 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:44.000
 millimeters and it is the one of high brightness 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.549
 Let's test to see if it really is 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.570
 I'll use this stuff if I avoid 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.010
 2032 here protest then I will have to 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.840
 be all and tell to see if 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:00.890
 we really have a thousand smaller terminal here 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:03.410
 kostchak erase some of the light to 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.380
 people have a notion of the intensity of 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.060
 led light glow ready lights off now 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.060
 let's see the brightness intensity 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:24.799
 what it really is it shines bright 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.959
 So it's coming back here, I'm with the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.870
 Lights here, it's complicated, I'll go later. 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.329
 I'll sort this out, I 'll go there tomorrow 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.470
 an original to pack here in the 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.920
 lighting 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.750
 but this is it here are the leds nÃ© 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.340
 then I'll have to test all provided 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.849
 are working 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.280
 He's coming here. I'm here with the antenna. 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:56.870
 the larger terminal 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:04:03.470
 it measures on average exactly 17 17 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:05.329
 mm the smaller it measures 15 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.299
 mm 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.099
 so if you 're watching, this is 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:16.699
 rushing by leds 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:20.599
 There I have to sell and I can. 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:26.389

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:29.780
 of you and I only send is over 100 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.270
 units in that unit intended for that 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.840
 come from other things too 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.539

 Do you want me to get to you? 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.260
 quantities from 1,000 also I 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.490
 classes will take place in 2010. 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.610

 I can diffuse a lot of things 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.340
