00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.050 
there I'll put the camera on this you
can<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.830> what<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.010> looks<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.370> before<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.790> cook

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
can see what it looks like before I cook

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.089 
can see what it looks like before I cook
it<00:02:43.579> and<00:02:44.579> see<00:02:45.239> it's<00:02:45.390> got<00:02:45.510> enough<00:02:45.950> fluffed<00:02:46.950> up

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
it and see it's got enough fluffed up

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.500 
it and see it's got enough fluffed up
aluminum<00:02:47.579> foil<00:02:47.849> all<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.120> way<00:02:48.209> around<00:02:48.299> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
aluminum foil all the way around the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.539 
aluminum foil all the way around the
edge<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.870> think<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.230> protect<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.010> won't<00:02:50.280> burn

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
edge I think to protect it so won't burn

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.819 
edge I think to protect it so won't burn
I<00:02:50.910> think<00:02:51.599> this<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.900> great<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:53.630> certainly<00:02:54.829> time

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
I think this is great but certainly time

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.420 
I think this is great but certainly time
will<00:02:56.099> tell<00:02:58.190> so<00:02:59.269> I'm<00:03:00.269> going<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.599> put<00:03:00.720> my<00:03:00.750> lid<00:03:01.079> on

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
will tell so I'm going to put my lid on

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.849 
will tell so I'm going to put my lid on
and<00:03:02.430> I'm<00:03:03.329> going<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.690> use<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:05.840> m1<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.680> did

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
and I'm going to use a m1 so like I did

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.400 
and I'm going to use a m1 so like I did
last<00:03:07.889> time<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:09.000> if<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.209> have<00:03:09.389> an<00:03:09.480> m2<00:03:09.959> you<00:03:10.230> can

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
last time but if you have an m2 you can

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.970 
last time but if you have an m2 you can
do<00:03:10.530> this<00:03:10.739> too<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.310> just<00:03:12.030> wouldn't<00:03:12.769> put<00:03:13.769> enough

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
do this too I just wouldn't put enough

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.099 
do this too I just wouldn't put enough
alcohol<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.299> donut<00:03:15.690> friend<00:03:15.870> I

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
alcohol in it so that the donut friend I

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.180 
alcohol in it so that the donut friend I
would<00:03:16.319> stay<00:03:16.590> with<00:03:16.940> just<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:18.060> center<00:03:18.420> part<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
would stay with just a center part of it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.979 
would stay with just a center part of it
because<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.880> seems<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.239> be<00:03:21.359> just<00:03:21.540> about<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
because this seems to be just about the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.849 
because this seems to be just about the
perfect<00:03:22.319> heat<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.100> part<00:03:23.720> without<00:03:24.859> the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
perfect heat for this part without the

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:34.129 
perfect heat for this part without the
donut<00:03:26.220> part<00:03:26.519> of<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.260> m2<00:03:32.389> okay<00:03:33.389> i'm<00:03:33.630> going<00:03:33.900> to

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
donut part of the m2 okay i'm going to

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:41.090 
donut part of the m2 okay i'm going to
set<00:03:34.950> my<00:03:34.980> stop<00:03:35.400> watch<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:37.579> in<00:03:38.579> probably<00:03:39.620> 16<00:03:40.620> 18

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
set my stop watch and in probably 16 18

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.930 
set my stop watch and in probably 16 18
minutes<00:03:41.519> i'll<00:03:42.480> turn<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.780> camera<00:03:43.230> back<00:03:43.260> on

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
minutes i'll turn the camera back on

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.610 
minutes i'll turn the camera back on
we'll<00:03:44.940> see<00:03:45.180> we've<00:03:45.389> got<00:03:45.420> i<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.260> got<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.440> good

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
we'll see we've got i just got a good

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:54.039 
we'll see we've got i just got a good
feeling<00:03:47.040> about<00:03:47.069> this<00:03:48.980> okay<00:03:50.120> it's<00:03:51.120> been<00:03:51.569> a

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
feeling about this okay it's been a

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.830 
feeling about this okay it's been a
little<00:03:55.049> over<00:03:55.230> 20<00:03:55.680> minutes<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.329> checked<00:03:57.329> it<00:03:57.569> with

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
little over 20 minutes I checked it with

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.069 
little over 20 minutes I checked it with
a<00:03:57.900> toothpick<00:03:58.230> at<00:03:59.359> 17<00:04:00.359> minutes<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:00.959> was

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
a toothpick at 17 minutes and it was

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.900 
a toothpick at 17 minutes and it was
still<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> little<00:04:01.709> bit<00:04:01.919> sticky<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.609> middle

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
still a little bit sticky in the middle

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.759 
still a little bit sticky in the middle
so<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.930> let<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.260> go<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.500> 22<00:04:05.069> minutes<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.769> before

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
so I let it go to 22 minutes and before

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.839 
so I let it go to 22 minutes and before
I<00:04:08.010> take<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.459> out<00:04:08.639> I<00:04:09.470> will<00:04:10.470> fix<00:04:11.010> camera<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.610> it<00:04:11.760> as

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
I take it out I will fix camera on it as

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:24.420 
I take it out I will fix camera on it as
you<00:04:11.909> can<00:04:12.090> see<00:04:12.239> what<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:12.480> looks<00:04:12.510> like

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.300 

how<00:04:26.050> my<00:04:27.050> goal<00:04:27.350> was<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:29.150> have<00:04:29.180> this<00:04:29.509> come<00:04:29.780> out

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
how my goal was to have this come out

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.700 
how my goal was to have this come out
just<00:04:31.310> like<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.669> would<00:04:31.850> out<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.210> other<00:04:32.710> at

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
just like it would out of the other at

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.400 
just like it would out of the other at
home<00:04:35.650> that's<00:04:36.650> kind<00:04:36.949> of<00:04:37.039> a<00:04:37.130> lofty<00:04:38.410> expectations

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
home that's kind of a lofty expectations

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.840 
home that's kind of a lofty expectations
but<00:04:40.479> I've<00:04:41.479> got<00:04:41.979> soon<00:04:42.979> back<00:04:43.310> downstairs

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
but I've got soon back downstairs

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.580 
but I've got soon back downstairs
waiting<00:04:44.120> for<00:04:44.479> this<00:04:44.570> so<00:04:44.870> you'd<00:04:45.199> better<00:04:45.380> come

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
waiting for this so you'd better come

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.219 
waiting for this so you'd better come
out<00:04:45.740> right<00:04:45.979> I<00:04:49.690> think<00:04:50.690> I'm<00:04:50.900> onto<00:04:51.080> something

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
out right I think I'm onto something

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.730 
out right I think I'm onto something
here<00:04:51.770> it's<00:04:52.699> certainly<00:04:53.320> more<00:04:54.320> than<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.590> little

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
here it's certainly more than a little

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.460 
here it's certainly more than a little
bit<00:04:54.949> hot<00:04:55.930> whoo<00:04:57.009> ok<00:04:58.009> that<00:04:58.759> give<00:04:58.970> up<00:04:59.180> fairly<00:04:59.479> well
