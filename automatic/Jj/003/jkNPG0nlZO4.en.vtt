00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
else which is of course also quite tiny

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.289 
else which is of course also quite tiny
so<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> stylus<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.119> possible

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so that's the stylus it's not possible

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.749 
so that's the stylus it's not possible
to<00:01:27.540> put<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> anywhere<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> dock<00:01:29.549> any

to put it anywhere here on the dock any

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
to put it anywhere here on the dock any
more<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.090> before<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.840> course<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.259> have

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
more like before but of course we have

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
more like before but of course we have
here<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.740> low<00:01:31.920> thinking<00:01:32.549> where<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.939> just

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
here this low thinking where we can just

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.969 
here this low thinking where we can just
put<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.869> shirt<00:01:34.079> or<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.649> have<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
put it on your shirt or if you have the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
put it on your shirt or if you have the
keyboard<00:01:35.399> there<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.939> actually<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> loophole

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
keyboard there is actually a loophole

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.510 
keyboard there is actually a loophole
right<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.649> put<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.310> inside

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
right here we can just put it inside

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520 
right here we can just put it inside
there<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.479> check<00:01:40.020> out<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.320> keyboard

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
there so we will check out the keyboard

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.780 
there so we will check out the keyboard
little<00:01:40.799> bit<00:01:40.890> later<00:01:41.070> which<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.490> course<00:01:41.520> not

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
little bit later which is of course not

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
little bit later which is of course not
inside<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.149> package<00:01:42.509> across<00:01:42.659> hundred<00:01:43.469> twenty

go all the way down like that so you

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.770 
go all the way down like that so you
don't<00:02:26.970> even<00:02:27.030> need<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.330> buy<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> keyboard

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
because it can open up the keyboard and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.120 
because it can open up the keyboard and
quite<00:02:29.340> easily<00:02:29.580> just<00:02:30.269> a<00:02:30.420> start<00:02:30.690> typing<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.410> on

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
quite easily just a start typing and on

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
still easy to connect like that you have

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.460 
still easy to connect like that you have
seen<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.240> magnetic<00:03:11.720> click<00:03:11.930> let<00:03:12.110> me<00:03:12.200> do<00:03:12.320> that

seen a magnetic click let me do that

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.510 
seen a magnetic click let me do that
again<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:15.020> just<00:03:15.080> clicks<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.920> can<00:03:16.220> use<00:03:16.340> it

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
again so it just clicks and can use it

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.560 
again so it just clicks and can use it
of<00:03:16.610> course<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.970> wave<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:17.240> different

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
of course it's a wave on different

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.360 
of course it's a wave on different
colors<00:03:17.840> we<00:03:18.260> can<00:03:18.410> close<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.860> up<00:03:18.980> or<00:03:19.190> what

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
colors we can close it up or what

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.330 
colors we can close it up or what
actually<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:19.790> ND<00:03:20.180> r<00:03:20.210> is<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:20.720> can<00:03:21.070> pull<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.190> up

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
actually in ND r is you can pull it up

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.760 
actually in ND r is you can pull it up
here<00:03:22.580> and<00:03:22.670> then<00:03:22.850> we<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.150> nice<00:03:23.420> little
