the<00:00:40.050> way<00:00:40.200> down<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:41.190> yarn<00:00:41.460> ball<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the way down to my yarn ball I like to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
the way down to my yarn ball I like to
thread<00:00:43.500> my<00:00:43.649> yarn<00:00:43.860> ball<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.280> before<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> tie<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
thread my yarn ball on before I tie it

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.500 
thread my yarn ball on before I tie it
on

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
on

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
on
let's<00:00:45.809> take<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> needle<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.649> you'll<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
let's take like a needle and you'll and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.200 
let's take like a needle and you'll and
then<00:00:47.190> put<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> line<00:00:47.700> through<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.940> needle

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
then put the line through the needle

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.119 
then put the line through the needle
head<00:00:48.329> push<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> needle<00:00:49.260> through<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> through

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
head push the needle through the through

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.340 
head push the needle through the through
the<00:00:50.219> yarn<00:00:50.370> ball<00:00:50.579> slides<00:00:51.449> down<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.960> leader<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the yarn ball slides down the leader and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
the yarn ball slides down the leader and
you<00:00:52.410> put<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> hook<00:00:53.239> it's<00:00:54.239> pretty

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
you put it right on the hook it's pretty

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
you put it right on the hook it's pretty
simple<00:00:54.870> second<00:00:55.739> way<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.550> I

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
simple second way I like to do it is I

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.680 
simple second way I like to do it is I
use<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.170> snap<00:00:58.170> swivel<00:00:59.120> right<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.539> can

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
use a snap swivel right there as you can

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.080 
use a snap swivel right there as you can
see<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:01.890> main<00:01:02.340> line<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.879> hook

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
see I put my main line on this hook

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.219 
see I put my main line on this hook
right<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.809> loop<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.199> here

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
right on this little loop right here

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.190 
right on this little loop right here
coming<00:01:04.949> down<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:05.250> your<00:01:05.280> off<00:01:06.119> your<00:01:06.360> rod<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
coming down off your off your rod you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
coming down off your off your rod you
have<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.650> snap<00:01:08.070> swivel<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.820> can

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
have your snap swivel right here you can

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.130 
have your snap swivel right here you can
use<00:01:09.060> different<00:01:09.270> way<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.659> whatever<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.990> like

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

use different way it's whatever you like
to<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.240> don't

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
to put on there you know you don't

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.789 
to put on there you know you don't
necessarily<00:01:12.479> use<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> tag<00:01:13.229> line<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> time

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
necessarily use a tag line all the time

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.039 
necessarily use a tag line all the time
you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.040> use<00:01:14.130> slinkys<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.180> whatnot<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you can use slinkys and whatnot then I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990 
you can use slinkys and whatnot then I
have<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.470> leader<00:01:17.220> line<00:01:17.430> coming<00:01:17.790> off<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
have my leader line coming off the
