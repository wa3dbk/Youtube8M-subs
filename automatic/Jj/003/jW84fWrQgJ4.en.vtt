00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.412
Today were gonna be showing you how to install
a pegboard.

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:09.400
Pegboard is a fantastic idea for storing all
your tools, making sure that you can find

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.100
them, and also so that they are not scattered
around on the ground.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.140
So the tools that were gonna be using today,
our power drills, our hammer drill, lot of

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.789
our equipment for measuring, our glasses,
now earmuffs, texters and pencils for marking

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.710
out, our screws, spaghetti, and obviously
our pre-cut pegboard, and our pre-cut timbers.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:39.070
You're first step is to drill into the bricks
and install you're wall plug.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.650
This stuff is called spaghetti or wall plug
and it give the screw to bite into.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.800
Got our drill, it's easy if you put the screw
in through the hole first and that way you

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.800
can line it up with the hole you've made in
the bricks.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.120
Take your second screw, again place the screw
into the hole.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.600
After that take your second piece of timber,
again already pre-cut, putting in the last

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.909
one.

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.850
And there you have the beginnings of your
frame.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.729
Alright, so what we're doing next is we're
gonna be putting our struts in.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.720
So making sure that you get it in line from
where your pegboard to be, pop it between

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.040
the two frames making sure that you use the
spirit levels, to plumb up with the best structural

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.579
integrity that it can.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.579
We also need to make sure that we're drilling
into the center of the brick and not hitting

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.479
into any mortar.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.819
As you can see the drill's gone straight to
the timber into the brick.

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.450
Take your spaghetti push it through until
you see a little bit of it to the back, makes

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.950
it easier finding the hole in the brick.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.540
We're using a hammer, gently tap the edge
of the spaghetti into the hole in the brick.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.709
Using that method, drill the rest of the holes
in the struts, put the spaghetti in, in that

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:28.159
way you can drill the screws in just like
we did from the beginning of the frame.

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.049
So once we drill all of our holes and put
all our spaghetti in were just gonna finish

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.670
off by popping the screws into the holes.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:48.129
And that's our finished frame, solid to the
wall.

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:54.920
To man the pegboard to timber, we're gonna
be using 30 mil chipboard screws.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.239
Make sure your timber's flush with your pegboard,
just adding more screws at the bottom.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.989
if you've got a particularly long pegboard,
might be a good idea to add some screws into

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.170
the middle as well.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.409
Now that we put our pegboard up, the next
step is to take our actual pegs and just pop

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.799
them in the holes in the pegboard.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:25.340
Start from one side, pop your peg in and grab
whatever tool you wanna put up.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.330
Starting off with my spirit level.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.760
Next I'm just gonna add my hammer.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.790
And a handy little tip is that once you've
hung your tools up you can actually use a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.180
texter to mark around your tools.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.969
This means you will always know where they
go, and which one's missing.

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.829
Now you finished your pegboard all your tools
nicely stored.
