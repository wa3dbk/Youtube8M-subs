no way to know until the baby was born
at<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.329> time<00:01:58.599> I<00:01:58.840> worked<00:01:59.170> with<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.469> woman<00:01:59.859> who

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
at the time I worked with a woman who

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.499 
at the time I worked with a woman who
was<00:02:00.459> also<00:02:00.700> going<00:02:00.969> through<00:02:01.240> IVF<00:02:01.689> and<00:02:03.240> she<00:02:04.240> was

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
was also going through IVF and she was

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.190 
was also going through IVF and she was
able<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.840> have<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.319> healthy<00:02:05.529> little<00:02:06.310> girl<00:02:06.429> and

able to have a healthy little girl and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.540 
able to have a healthy little girl and
one<00:02:08.200> day<00:02:08.410> we<00:02:08.619> were<00:02:08.649> walking<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.130> she<00:02:09.310> knew<00:02:09.399> my

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
one day we were walking and she knew my

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.400 
one day we were walking and she knew my
situation<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.270> she<00:02:10.360> said<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.050> know<00:02:11.080> I've<00:02:11.260> got

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
situation and she said you know I've got

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.980 
situation and she said you know I've got
these<00:02:11.560> embryos<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.370> my<00:02:13.300> partner<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.780> don't

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
these embryos and my partner and I don't

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.420 
these embryos and my partner and I don't
want<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.200> have<00:02:14.290> any<00:02:14.470> more<00:02:14.590> children

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
want to have any more children

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.979 
want to have any more children
would<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.939> be<00:02:16.060> interested<00:02:16.239> in<00:02:16.569> having<00:02:16.629> them

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
would you be interested in having them

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.250 
would you be interested in having them
and<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.010> thought<00:02:18.209> okay<00:02:19.209> yeah<00:02:19.629> sounds<00:02:20.079> like<00:02:20.109> a

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
and I thought okay yeah sounds like a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.740 
and I thought okay yeah sounds like a
good<00:02:20.379> deal<00:02:20.560> sure<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.849> was<00:02:21.969> a<00:02:22.030> process<00:02:22.480> you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
good deal sure and it was a process you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.030 
good deal sure and it was a process you
know<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:23.019> had<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:23.439> wait<00:02:23.560> until<00:02:23.709> we<00:02:23.920> were<00:02:24.010> ready

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
know we had to wait until we were ready

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.300 
know we had to wait until we were ready
to<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.519> it<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.480> actually<00:02:25.689> adopted<00:02:26.650> an<00:02:26.829> embryo

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
to do it so actually adopted an embryo

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.839 
to do it so actually adopted an embryo
well<00:02:27.969> she<00:02:28.120> donated<00:02:28.480> them<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.780> us<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:29.920> yeah<00:02:30.819> I

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
mean she you know out of the generosity

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.789 
mean she you know out of the generosity
of<00:02:33.639> her<00:02:33.819> heart<00:02:34.060> gave<00:02:34.150> them<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.719> absolutely<00:02:35.530> and

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
of her heart gave them to absolutely and

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.530 
of her heart gave them to absolutely and
somebody<00:02:36.129> you<00:02:36.340> knew<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:36.819> could<00:02:37.000> talk<00:02:37.269> to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
somebody you knew and could talk to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.199 
somebody you knew and could talk to
that's<00:02:37.810> really<00:02:38.200> really<00:02:38.829> so<00:02:39.129> interesting<00:02:39.670> dr.

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
that's really really so interesting dr.

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.089 
that's really really so interesting dr.
Kennedy<00:02:40.599> does<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:40.930> happen<00:02:41.139> much<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.769> mean<00:02:41.920> the

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
Kennedy does this happen much I mean the

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.420 
Kennedy does this happen much I mean the
whole<00:02:42.450> business<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.750> genetic<00:02:44.200> testing<00:02:44.739> the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
whole business of genetic testing the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.460 
whole business of genetic testing the
idea<00:02:45.760> has<00:02:46.000> always<00:02:46.299> been<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:46.900> early<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.379> a

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
idea has always been to know early in a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890 
idea has always been to know early in a
pregnancy<00:02:47.950> or<00:02:47.980> before<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.459> pregnancy<00:02:49.060> but<00:02:49.599> in

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
pregnancy or before a pregnancy but in

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.929 
pregnancy or before a pregnancy but in
her<00:02:50.169> case<00:02:50.200> of<00:02:50.379> course<00:02:50.769> she<00:02:50.980> couldn't<00:02:51.159> so<00:02:51.609> is

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:51.939 
her case of course she couldn't so is

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.379 
her case of course she couldn't so is
this<00:02:52.329> practice<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:53.049> accepting<00:02:53.769> an<00:02:54.389> adopted

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
this practice of accepting an adopted

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.020 
this practice of accepting an adopted
embryo<00:02:55.750> gaining<00:02:56.500> some<00:02:56.769> traction<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.609> think<00:02:57.939> it

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
embryo gaining some traction I think it

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.720 
embryo gaining some traction I think it
is<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.359> mean<00:02:58.569> one<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.019> our<00:02:59.409> kind<00:02:59.859> of<00:03:00.010> mantras<00:03:00.519> at

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
is I mean one of our kind of mantras at

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.159 
is I mean one of our kind of mantras at
our<00:03:00.969> clinic<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.419> that<00:03:01.569> there<00:03:01.719> are<00:03:01.750> many<00:03:01.959> ways

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:02.169 
our clinic is that there are many ways

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.740 
our clinic is that there are many ways
to<00:03:02.230> build<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.739> family<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.969> best<00:03:04.510> way<00:03:04.689> is

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
to build a family and that best way is

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.179 
to build a family and that best way is
going<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.019> be<00:03:05.109> different<00:03:05.319> for<00:03:05.739> every<00:03:06.010> patient

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
going to be different for every patient

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.610 
going to be different for every patient
every<00:03:06.639> couple<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.389> so<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.139> is<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.349> very

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
every couple and so this is a very

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.949 
every couple and so this is a very
unique<00:03:09.400> way<00:03:09.459> but<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.030> think<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.329> wonderful<00:03:10.810> way

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
unique way but I think a wonderful way

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.770 
unique way but I think a wonderful way
to<00:03:11.230> build<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.590> family<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.219> it's<00:03:13.030> something<00:03:13.599> I

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
to build a family and it's something I

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.809 
to build a family and it's something I
think<00:03:14.019> as<00:03:14.139> much<00:03:14.200> as<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.799> seems<00:03:15.069> like<00:03:15.340> something

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
think as much as it seems like something

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.699 
think as much as it seems like something
that<00:03:15.849> would<00:03:15.969> be<00:03:16.090> very<00:03:16.180> complicated<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:17.139> think

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
that would be very complicated I think

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.710 
that would be very complicated I think
the<00:03:17.829> complicated<00:03:18.400> part<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.819> that<00:03:18.849> process<00:03:19.569> of

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the complicated part is that process of

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.460 
the complicated part is that process of
finding<00:03:20.909> the<00:03:21.909> person<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.329> may<00:03:22.569> donate<00:03:23.260> that

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
finding the person that may donate that

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.140 
finding the person that may donate that

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 
that may be able to facilitate that

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.000 
that may be able to facilitate that
interaction<00:03:28.690> but<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.109> actual<00:03:29.440> medical
