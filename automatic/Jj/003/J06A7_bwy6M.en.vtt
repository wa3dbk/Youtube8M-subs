00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.779 
this is my Mighty Eagle I like the way
it<00:00:23.400> turned<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:23.880> except<00:00:24.449> for<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> white<00:00:25.080> part

it turned out except for the white part

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.439 
it turned out except for the white part
because<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.570> got<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.920> bit<00:00:29.189> dirty<00:00:29.580> well<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
because it got a little bit dirty well a

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.799 
because it got a little bit dirty well a
lot<00:00:31.260> dirty<00:00:31.619> but<00:00:32.399> that's<00:00:32.940> why<00:00:33.120> I'm<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:33.540> going

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
