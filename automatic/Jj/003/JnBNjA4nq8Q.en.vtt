times last year so I'll show you the
soil<00:01:24.840> mixture<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.439> anyway<00:01:25.710> there's<00:01:25.950> there's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
soil mixture I do anyway there's there's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.609 
soil mixture I do anyway there's there's
a<00:01:26.880> close-up<00:01:27.150> look<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> palm<00:01:27.930> sized<00:01:28.350> pot

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
a close-up look at the palm sized pot

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
a close-up look at the palm sized pot
right<00:01:28.829> now<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.400> how<00:01:29.520> Roo<00:01:30.210> found

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
right now and you can see how Roo found

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
right now and you can see how Roo found
it<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.530> root<00:01:31.710> bound<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.100> those<00:01:32.250> roots

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it is really root bound so those roots

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.100 
it is really root bound so those roots
got<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.850> stretched<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.689> moved<00:01:33.869> around

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
got to be stretched out and moved around

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
got to be stretched out and moved around
so<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> they<00:01:35.610> don't<00:01:35.759> keep<00:01:35.850> girdling

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so they so they don't keep girdling

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.380 
so they so they don't keep girdling
themself<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:40.310> there's<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.549> 1<00:01:41.700> gallon<00:01:41.939> tracky

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
themself so there's the 1 gallon tracky

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.649 
themself so there's the 1 gallon tracky
