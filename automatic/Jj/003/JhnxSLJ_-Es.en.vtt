actually<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.399> probably<00:02:10.700> started<00:02:10.849> first<00:02:11.480> off

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
what I always say is just use something

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.240 
what I always say is just use something
that<00:03:28.870> you've<00:03:28.959> already<00:03:29.260> got<00:03:29.440> or<00:03:29.650> something<00:03:30.069> not

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
too expensive to record if you enjoy it

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.319 
too expensive to record if you enjoy it
then<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:33.129> know<00:03:33.250> step<00:03:33.669> up<00:03:33.819> your<00:03:33.970> quality

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
quality that sent that build up slowly

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.929

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.399 
and I think that after that you should
just<00:04:33.819> be<00:04:33.939> good<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.419> took<00:04:34.599> me<00:04:34.659> two<00:04:34.900> years<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.199> get

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
just be good it took me two years to get

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.409 
just be good it took me two years to get
seven<00:04:35.740> thousand<00:04:36.099> subscribers<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.789> I<00:04:37.270> just

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
seven thousand subscribers and I just

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.670 
seven thousand subscribers and I just
carried<00:04:37.689> on<00:04:37.780> doing<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.110> because<00:04:38.199> I<00:04:38.349> enjoyed<00:04:38.650> it

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
carried on doing it because I enjoyed it

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.580 
carried on doing it because I enjoyed it
and<00:04:38.889> eventually<00:04:39.629> I've<00:04:40.629> quote-unquote<00:04:41.319> made

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
and eventually I've quote-unquote made

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.980 
and eventually I've quote-unquote made
it<00:04:41.770> somewhere<00:04:42.099> at<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.400> moment<00:04:42.819> so<00:04:42.900> that's<00:04:43.900> how

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
it somewhere at the moment so that's how

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.379 
it somewhere at the moment so that's how
I<00:04:44.050> did<00:04:44.169> it<00:04:44.409> anyway<00:04:44.789> yeah<00:04:45.789> those<00:04:46.060> were<00:04:46.240> some

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
I did it anyway yeah those were some

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.730 
I did it anyway yeah those were some
brilliant<00:04:46.840> words<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.229> I<00:04:47.259> think<00:04:47.439> between<00:04:47.590> the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
brilliant words and I think between the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.800 
brilliant words and I think between the
two<00:04:47.889> of<00:04:48.069> us<00:04:48.219> we've<00:04:48.400> covered<00:04:48.639> most<00:04:48.939> kind<00:04:49.659> of
