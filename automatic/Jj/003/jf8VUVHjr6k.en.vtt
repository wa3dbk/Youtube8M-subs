 Let's use it and then we'll start a good 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.159
 first a good stay is important 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.769
 like the type of game of preference 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:04.109
 were each tastier and such and there 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:04.109

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.170
 noting that the amount is all 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.159
 writing is defined in the case by placing 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.610
 two tablespoons a bit here in 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.470
 Truth one will choose dino red tea 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.280
 reason then I have a head had 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.490
 safe 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:30.750
 two tablespoons we have to like the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:42.580
 ok for 3 tablespoons of honey right 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:47.040
 stretch 2 3 tablespoons of honey one 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.040
 tablespoon of olive oil 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:01.000
 we emphasize extra virgin well arrives at 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.799
 spoon on behalf of a tablespoon of 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.179
 olive oil and then a spoonful of 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:13.330
 English Sauce Tea is the President who 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.980
 Do you like to add a balsamic vinegar ? 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.470
 I do not particularly like guess who brings 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.019
 lots of acidity a little spoon versa says 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.060
 addition to English tea already gives a 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.650
 touch of a different flavor I think 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.819
 That's good already. 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.150
 And then people after that is simply 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.950
 Let's move, let's move. 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.950

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.240
 side dish 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.700
 it fits nicely with chicken chicken 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.730
 fried chicken to the birdie it combines 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.120
 well, how 's it going with me? 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.460

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.460
 30 you know a lot about killing your life 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.560

 sao paulo to be filled full of the queue 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.110
