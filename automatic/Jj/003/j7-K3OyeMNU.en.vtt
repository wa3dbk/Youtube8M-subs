00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 One thing I would like your opinion 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.460
 mentioned that the so-called mixed 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.460
 numbers 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:34.590
 mixed numbers was once an example 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 52 but you know where 50 rule I have 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.129
 just made my effort too 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.200
 compare what the other situation 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:50.010
 you have learned that 52 was nothing 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.890
 other than five whole plus two 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 Of course that's right both 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.530
 add up to 523 so they could the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.059
 Other StÃ¶ttner to the five 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.390
 convert one third 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.030
 we know a whole has three titles too 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.600
 have five whole five times as much so 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:16.369
 I 'm easily kelly instead of five 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:19.830
 Write 15 thirds plus this doubt 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:23.310
 and they are known to be 17 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.390
 third and with this time I can yes 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.900
 also calculate correctly 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.079
 if I assume now that 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.720
 such mixed ones are in others 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.670
 tasks therefore follow within the four 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 basic arithmetic subtraction 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.000
 multiplication the mission of fractions 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.420
 then it makes sense always one 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.729
 mixed numbers in a real break 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.540
 to transform it with me easily 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.380
 can count 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.759
 just as I always get there I 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.860
 this path appears completely correct 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.060
 absolutely there is not to say but he 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.060
 is just beautiful 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.030
 I have one 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.520
 common earlier life 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.050
 behavioral mathematics teacher something else 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.270
 if I take care of it today 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.210
 I now have it hardly continue but today 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.110
 mammon exception you only need this 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:28.600
 all the time with this multi relationship 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:30.260
 and the 10 53 is 15 plus 2 17 trudel 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.440
 what more could you want 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.060
 and all the fish steps away fine 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.220
 no matter which one to cure the show 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.600
 not really complicated but we 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:51.140
 stay a few simple example 32x 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:54.170
 4 734 simple so the whole results 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:02.240
 in simple almonds and then on that as well 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:08.690
 I say 3 - 1 20 14 25 740 so whole 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:12.230
 number said men 53 is 15 plus this one 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:16.610
 Counter would be 17 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:24.100
 all this time three times this denominator 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:29.530
 3 times 7 are 21 funniest ones are 25 are 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:32.180
 that's as trick as you look at this 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.480
 make bills less expensive 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.480
 can
