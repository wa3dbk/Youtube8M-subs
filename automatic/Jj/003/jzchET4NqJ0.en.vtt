00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
breakwall as I say I'd get out right

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:57.530 
breakwall as I say I'd get out right

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.130 
here I'm going to show you just how well
the<00:03:00.250> breakwall<00:03:00.970> actually<00:03:01.390> works<00:03:01.690> we're<00:03:01.930> into

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the breakwall actually works we're into

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.630 
the breakwall actually works we're into
the<00:03:02.260> harbor<00:03:02.650> side<00:03:04.110> off<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.560> Manistee<00:03:06.220> River

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the harbor side off the Manistee River

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.030 
the harbor side off the Manistee River
manatee<00:03:07.270> harbor<00:03:10.260> but<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.410> can<00:03:11.560> see<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:11.830> waves

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
manatee harbor but you can see the waves

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.820 
manatee harbor but you can see the waves
are<00:03:12.280> actually<00:03:13.080> excuse<00:03:14.080> me<00:03:14.260> higher<00:03:14.470> than<00:03:14.740> the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
are actually excuse me higher than the

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.090 
are actually excuse me higher than the
breakwall<00:03:15.340> but<00:03:16.530> it's<00:03:17.530> doing<00:03:17.740> a<00:03:17.800> pretty<00:03:17.950> good

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
breakwall but it's doing a pretty good

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:26.970 
breakwall but it's doing a pretty good
job<00:03:19.200> stop<00:03:23.040> because<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.190> say<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.550> waves<00:03:25.980> have

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
job stop because I say the waves have

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.150 
job stop because I say the waves have
died<00:03:27.340> down<00:03:27.580> but<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.360> can<00:03:29.170> see<00:03:29.800> them<00:03:29.890> over<00:03:30.010> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
died down but I can see them over the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.430 
died down but I can see them over the
