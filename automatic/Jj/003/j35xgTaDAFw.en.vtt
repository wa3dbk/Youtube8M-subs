00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
lot of press but you still have to be

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.020 
lot of press but you still have to be
able<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.809> play<00:00:36.930> off<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.440> by<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:38.070> Bo<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.520> had

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
able to play off and by the way Bo I had

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.389 
able to play off and by the way Bo I had
him<00:00:39.300> evaluated<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:40.710> better<00:00:41.010> than<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
him evaluated as better than a

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
him evaluated as better than a
sixth-round<00:00:41.969> pick<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.629> he<00:00:42.719> has<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> really

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
sixth-round pick I think he has a really

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
sixth-round pick I think he has a really
good<00:00:43.379> chance<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> quality<00:00:44.910> press-man

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
