00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
another perfect launch tutorial this is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.650 
another perfect launch tutorial this is
the<00:00:19.350> Pagani<00:00:19.800> Zonda<00:00:19.949> blue<00:00:20.640> carbon<00:00:21.150> edition

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the Pagani Zonda blue carbon edition

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
the Pagani Zonda blue carbon edition
after<00:00:21.960> taking<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.590> few<00:00:22.800> test<00:00:23.070> runs<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
after taking a few test runs and

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.710 
after taking a few test runs and
crunching<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:24.269> numbers

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
crunching some numbers

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330 
crunching some numbers
I<00:00:24.930> believe<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.470> faster<00:00:25.949> than<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.160> original

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
I believe it's faster than the original

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.089 
I believe it's faster than the original
Zonda<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.660> release<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.380> car<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.920> my

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
Zonda the release on this car is in my

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.919 
Zonda the release on this car is in my
opinion<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:30.060> tougher<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.420> time<00:00:30.720> than

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
opinion a little tougher to time than

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.139 
opinion a little tougher to time than
the<00:00:31.050> original<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.160> gearshift<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.969> lot

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the original but the gearshift a lot

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.870 
the original but the gearshift a lot
slower<00:00:33.570> all<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.649> very<00:00:34.920> similar<00:00:35.430> but

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
slower all in all it's very similar but

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.780 
slower all in all it's very similar but
faster<00:00:36.390> times<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.960> easier<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.829> achieve<00:00:37.980> with

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
faster times are easier to achieve with

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.970 
faster times are easier to achieve with
the<00:00:38.910> blue<00:00:39.120> Zonda<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.989> releases<00:00:40.530> between<00:00:40.860> the

drop<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.379> launch<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:43.770> about<00:00:43.980> 34<00:00:44.600> 3,500<00:00:45.600> rpms

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
drop and launch at about 34 3,500 rpms

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
drop and launch at about 34 3,500 rpms
your<00:00:46.559> first<00:00:46.860> shift<00:00:47.160> will<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.460> late<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.879> then

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
your first shift will be late and then

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.240 
your first shift will be late and then
all<00:00:48.210> shifts<00:00:48.629> after<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.110> we'll<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.500> 8,000

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
all shifts after that we'll be at 8,000

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:15.780 
all shifts after that we'll be at 8,000
rpms<00:00:50.670> let's<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> look

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.760 

there<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.000> go<00:01:17.180> that's<00:01:17.660> how<00:01:17.870> you<00:01:17.960> launch<00:01:18.290> the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
there you go that's how you launch the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.490 
there you go that's how you launch the
blue<00:01:19.119> Zonda<00:01:20.119> like<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:20.510> said<00:01:20.690> before<00:01:20.900> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
blue Zonda like I said before the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.410 
blue Zonda like I said before the
release<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:22.100> a<00:01:22.159> little<00:01:22.580> bit<00:01:22.700> tougher<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.119> time

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
release is a little bit tougher to time

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.210 
release is a little bit tougher to time
than<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.780> original<00:01:24.320> but<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.560> shifts<00:01:25.130> are

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
than the original but the shifts are

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.330 
than the original but the shifts are
much<00:01:25.970> slower<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:26.840> all<00:01:27.140> in<00:01:27.440> all<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:27.890> think<00:01:27.950> it's

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
much slower so all in all I think it's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.150 
much slower so all in all I think it's
an<00:01:28.460> easier<00:01:28.790> car<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.360> race<00:01:29.600> but<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.800> don't<00:01:30.979> have

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
an easier car to race but you don't have

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.730 
an easier car to race but you don't have
to<00:01:31.280> take<00:01:31.460> my<00:01:31.640> word<00:01:31.910> for<00:01:31.940> it<00:01:32.330> check<00:01:33.050> it<00:01:33.259> out<00:01:33.410> let
