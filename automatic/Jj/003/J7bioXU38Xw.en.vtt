00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.510
 automatic automated 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.820
 this is not relevant what matters is that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.580
 now can be equipped with 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.859
 dogs called isa and crone 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.960
 marches alone an interesting option 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.140
 for those who want more comfort when driving 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.810
 and do not want to spend much but what is the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.859
 easy changeover is a manual 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.380
 automated clutch offered by GM 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.090
 in Germany since 2000 and now 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 arrived in Brazil 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.399
 I mean, it 's a normal girl's field. 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.440
 but with the electronic module that makes the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.960
 exchanges as if it were a transmission 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.200
 automatic release of the pedal 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.360
 clutch and if you want you can change 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.629
 manually 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.149
 the operation is simple to connect 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.149
 place the yen lever and step on the brake 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.910
 tightening the safety lock 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.750
 automatic switch lever for the 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.640
 left side and the letter appears on the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.630
 for more sporting exchanges 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.970
 push the button is ready just accelerate if 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.430
 do you want manual exchanges move 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.830
 lever to the left to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.189
 appears to be a figure representing the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.270
 gear engaged or moved forward or 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.400
 behind 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.009
 the system goes to the manual of the same 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.650
 simple way with the button is to be 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.340
 the manual mode is also tight . 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.590
 are made faster in the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.530
 automatic system also adapts to the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.780
 way to drive and press 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.070
 the throttle pedal to the bottom and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.270
 slows down if speed allows 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.960
 wonderful 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.829
 the march cause of the slowness of the electronic 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.490
 in print is that the car will brake 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.310
 especially when you want 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.280
 accelerations or resumes 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.890
 to reduce this characteristic both 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.200
 manual or automatic mode can 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.660
 relieve the foot of the accelerator as if 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.120
 was using the clutch pedal in the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.909
 change time 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.370
 or walk very quiet except for 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.340
 of the automated exchange amiri visited the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.849
 engine is the same as the other engine versions 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.659
 1.8 flex power a 112 horsepower when 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.879
 fueled with gasoline and 114 with alcohol 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.400
 as torque is equal to any 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.879
 differences are not noticed. 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.709
 when using one or the other and how 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.319
 because it is a manual gearbox 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.109
 does not cause loss of 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.720
 power or both automatic 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:50.959
 performance is practically equal to that of 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.819
 a common meriva for that and for the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.109
 automatic changes are made in the 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.629
 ideal moment 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.790
 in some cases the easytronic meriva may 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.180
 until it's more economical than normal 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.739
 but like this 1.8 flex power engine but 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.700
 no example of economy of 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.799
 fuel 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.799
 isi tronic also did not go well 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.040
 in this question in our test circuit 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:17.780
 is half the road and half the city she made 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.169
 6.1 km per liter of alcohol and 8.2 km per 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.169
 liter of gas
