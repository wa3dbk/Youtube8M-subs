00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
fishing and I've got a flipping stick

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.720 
fishing and I've got a flipping stick
right<00:03:57.239> here<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.980> flipping<00:03:59.310> sticks<00:03:59.549> are

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
right here and the flipping sticks are

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.039 
right here and the flipping sticks are
good<00:03:59.849> because<00:03:59.970> they're<00:04:00.269> very<00:04:00.419> stiff<00:04:00.870> they're

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
good because they're very stiff they're

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.830 
good because they're very stiff they're
almost<00:04:01.169> like<00:04:01.379> a<00:04:01.500> pool<00:04:01.799> cue<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:03.060> most<00:04:03.389> flipping

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
almost like a pool cue and most flipping

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.970 
almost like a pool cue and most flipping
sticks<00:04:04.109> are<00:04:04.290> collapsible

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
sticks are collapsible

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.860 
sticks are collapsible
so<00:04:05.549> instead<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.849> being<00:04:06.060> two-piece<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.720> can

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
so instead of being two-piece you can

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.509 
so instead of being two-piece you can
see<00:04:07.019> right<00:04:07.199> here<00:04:07.230> I'm<00:04:07.889> going<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.340> twist

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
see right here I'm going to just twist

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.089 
see right here I'm going to just twist
it<00:04:08.819> this<00:04:09.389> part<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.810> collapsible<00:04:10.379> because

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
it this part is collapsible because

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.770 
it this part is collapsible because
they're<00:04:11.280> anywhere<00:04:11.549> from<00:04:11.699> seven<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.239> seven<00:04:12.660> and

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
they're anywhere from seven to seven and

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.330 
they're anywhere from seven to seven and
a<00:04:12.810> half<00:04:12.840> feet<00:04:13.199> in<00:04:13.260> length<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.709> one<00:04:13.859> is<00:04:14.040> seven

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
a half feet in length this one is seven

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.710 
a half feet in length this one is seven
and<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.489> half<00:04:14.519> feet<00:04:14.879> so<00:04:15.150> when<00:04:15.269> you're<00:04:15.419> storing

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
like a telescopic rod you would pull it

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.900 
like a telescopic rod you would pull it
out<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.870> you'd<00:04:22.800> hold<00:04:23.039> it<00:04:23.190> there<00:04:23.340> now<00:04:23.760> if<00:04:23.820> you

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
out and you'd hold it there now if you

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.000 
out and you'd hold it there now if you

Aventis and this is loaded with 30-pound
titanium<00:04:43.860> braid<00:04:44.070> and<00:04:44.250> what<00:04:44.370> I've<00:04:44.490> done<00:04:44.669> at<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
titanium braid and what I've done at the

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.519 
titanium braid and what I've done at the
bottom<00:04:45.780> for

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:46.529 
bottom for

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.519 
bottom for
a foot<00:04:47.009> I've<00:04:47.399> actually<00:04:47.639> have<00:04:48.029> 20<00:04:48.689> or<00:04:48.809> 30<00:04:49.139> pound

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:49.529 
a foot I've actually have 20 or 30 pound

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:51.919 
a foot I've actually have 20 or 30 pound
fluorocarbon<00:04:50.159> leader<00:04:50.879> so<00:04:51.569> I've<00:04:51.629> got<00:04:51.779> a<00:04:51.809> very

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:51.929 
fluorocarbon leader so I've got a very

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:54.319 
fluorocarbon leader so I've got a very
nice<00:04:52.349> connection<00:04:52.649> there<00:04:53.129> and<00:04:53.249> then<00:04:53.999> a<00:04:54.119> loose

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:54.329 
nice connection there and then a loose

00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:56.089 
nice connection there and then a loose
knot<00:04:54.659> I<00:04:54.929> don't<00:04:55.079> if<00:04:55.139> you<00:04:55.169> can<00:04:55.259> see<00:04:55.529> that<00:04:55.709> knot<00:04:55.919> if

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
knot I don't if you can see that knot if

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.159 
knot I don't if you can see that knot if
I<00:04:56.279> pivot<00:04:56.999> see<00:04:57.239> that<00:04:57.389> there's<00:04:57.539> a<00:04:57.629> loop<00:04:57.929> there

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
I pivot see that there's a loop there

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.619 
I pivot see that there's a loop there
it's<00:04:58.649> a<00:04:58.829> loop<00:04:59.039> knot<00:04:59.279> and<00:04:59.609> I've<00:04:59.969> done<00:05:00.149> that<00:05:00.359> so

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
it's a loop knot and I've done that so

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.509 
it's a loop knot and I've done that so
that<00:05:00.779> that<00:05:01.079> flipping<00:05:01.469> jig<00:05:01.859> can<00:05:02.129> pivot<00:05:02.429> around

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:02.519 
that that flipping jig can pivot around

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:04.309 
that that flipping jig can pivot around
so<00:05:02.819> this<00:05:02.909> flipping<00:05:03.269> jig<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.569> great<00:05:03.809> on<00:05:04.049> this

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
so this flipping jig is great on this

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:06.409 
so this flipping jig is great on this
rod<00:05:04.589> but<00:05:04.799> it's<00:05:04.949> designed<00:05:05.279> to<00:05:05.399> penetrate<00:05:05.579> some

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
rod but it's designed to penetrate some

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.539 
rod but it's designed to penetrate some
of<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:06.629> heavier<00:05:06.899> cover<00:05:07.169> this<00:05:07.799> particular<00:05:08.369> rod

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:08.549 
of the heavier cover this particular rod

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:11.359 
of the heavier cover this particular rod
here<00:05:08.939> which<00:05:09.599> looks<00:05:10.229> like<00:05:10.529> a<00:05:10.559> normal<00:05:10.799> spinning

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:11.369 
here which looks like a normal spinning

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:13.309 
here which looks like a normal spinning
rod<00:05:11.549> is<00:05:11.699> actually<00:05:11.999> part<00:05:12.209> of<00:05:12.299> the<00:05:12.449> AR<00:05:12.749> type

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
rod is actually part of the AR type

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.049 
rod is actually part of the AR type
series<00:05:13.859> you<00:05:14.249> can<00:05:14.399> see<00:05:14.579> that<00:05:14.699> right<00:05:14.849> on<00:05:14.939> the

00:05:15.049 --> 00:05:15.059 
series you can see that right on the

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.389 
series you can see that right on the
side<00:05:15.299> and<00:05:16.049> it's<00:05:16.289> rated<00:05:16.499> for<00:05:16.649> pretty<00:05:17.069> heavy

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:17.399

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
line this is a seven foot one inch rod

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.869 
line this is a seven foot one inch rod
and<00:05:21.029> it's<00:05:21.259> rated<00:05:22.259> for<00:05:22.289> eight<00:05:22.679> the<00:05:22.979> 17<00:05:23.519> pound

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:23.879

test line and the art type is the most
serious<00:05:27.199> series<00:05:28.199> and<00:05:28.769> it's<00:05:29.279> one<00:05:29.549> piece<00:05:29.789> so

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:30.359 
serious series and it's one piece so

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:32.149 
serious series and it's one piece so
this<00:05:30.539> rod<00:05:30.809> actually<00:05:31.199> has<00:05:31.349> a<00:05:31.379> lot<00:05:31.589> of<00:05:31.739> backbone

this rod actually has a lot of backbone

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.819 
this rod actually has a lot of backbone
in<00:05:32.339> it<00:05:32.489> and<00:05:32.849> I<00:05:33.089> have<00:05:33.329> 20-pound<00:05:33.959> titanium<00:05:34.619> braid
