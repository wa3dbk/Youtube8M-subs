00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
front section and then again twist it to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.500 
front section and then again twist it to
the<00:01:03.000> back<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.650> always<00:01:05.010> add<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> strand<00:01:06.240> into

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the back so you always add a strand into

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.080 
the back so you always add a strand into
the<00:01:06.869> front<00:01:07.170> section<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.340> twist<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.850> to

the front section and then twist it to
the<00:01:09.119> back<00:01:09.390> section<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.159> repeat

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the back section and you just repeat

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.740 
the back section and you just repeat
that<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> way<00:01:12.240> down

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.440 

so<00:01:18.350> I'm<00:01:18.500> not<00:01:18.650> going<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:18.980> continue<00:01:19.370> adding<00:01:20.000> hair

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
so I'm not going to continue adding hair

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.300 
so I'm not going to continue adding hair
all<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.720> way<00:01:20.900> down<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.410> her<00:01:21.590> ear<00:01:21.800> I'm<00:01:22.100> just

all the way down to her ear I'm just

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.130 
all the way down to her ear I'm just
going<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.520> stop<00:01:22.760> about<00:01:23.030> right<00:01:23.330> there<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:23.900> then

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
going to stop about right there and then

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.500 
going to stop about right there and then
continue<00:01:24.710> with<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.860> regular<00:01:25.370> twist<00:01:25.790> down<00:01:26.450> a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
continue with a regular twist down a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.170

couple of inches

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.960 
couple of inches
and<00:01:29.660> then<00:01:30.440> I'm<00:01:30.830> going<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.220> have<00:01:31.400> her<00:01:31.580> hold<00:01:31.760> this

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
and then I'm going to have her hold this

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.180 
and then I'm going to have her hold this
for<00:01:32.270> me<00:01:32.450> while<00:01:32.660> I<00:01:32.690> work<00:01:32.960> on<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.290> other<00:01:33.500> twist

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
for me while I work on the other twist

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.400 
for me while I work on the other twist
just<00:01:34.580> so<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:34.970> doesn't<00:01:35.300> come<00:01:35.510> unraveled

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.650 

I'm<00:01:39.410> going<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.830> unclip<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:40.730> next<00:01:41.210> section

you<00:01:54.260> can<00:01:54.380> see<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.620> kind<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:55.040> did<00:01:55.190> it<00:01:55.220> in<00:01:55.400> a

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
you can see I kind of did it in a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.090 
you can see I kind of did it in a
rounded<00:01:55.940> shape<00:01:56.170> now<00:01:57.170> I'm<00:01:57.350> going<00:01:57.620> to<00:01:57.740> remove

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
rounded shape now I'm going to remove

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.840 
rounded shape now I'm going to remove
this<00:01:58.310> clip<00:01:58.610> here<00:01:58.910> in<00:01:59.120> the<00:01:59.390> front<00:02:00.430> I'm<00:02:01.430> going<00:02:01.729> to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
this clip here in the front I'm going to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.480 
this clip here in the front I'm going to
pull<00:02:02.090> all<00:02:02.330> of<00:02:02.390> this<00:02:02.810> hair<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.740> bangs<00:02:04.010> that<00:02:04.400> are

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
pull all of this hair the bangs that are

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.670 
pull all of this hair the bangs that are
here<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:04.820> front<00:02:05.000> as<00:02:05.360> well<00:02:05.600> as<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.080> twists<00:02:06.410> and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
here in front as well as the twists and

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.800 
here in front as well as the twists and
then<00:02:07.100> some<00:02:07.430> hair<00:02:07.640> here<00:02:07.910> from<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.209> other<00:02:08.390> side

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
then some hair here from the other side

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.080 
then some hair here from the other side
I'm<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.470> pull<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.770> all<00:02:09.950> over<00:02:10.340> here<00:02:10.610> into

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
I'm going to pull it all over here into

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.500 
I'm going to pull it all over here into
the<00:02:11.240> middle<00:02:11.480> kind<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.810> like<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:11.990> half<00:02:12.230> ponytail

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the middle kind of like a half ponytail

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.150 
the middle kind of like a half ponytail
okay<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.570> here's<00:02:14.930> what<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.140> looks<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
okay so here's what it looks like on the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.250 
okay so here's what it looks like on the
side<00:02:16.430> at<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:16.820> point<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.480> can<00:02:17.810> see<00:02:18.020> I

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
side at this point as you can see I

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.590 
side at this point as you can see I
basically<00:02:18.740> just<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.670> top<00:02:20.000> half<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.480> her

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
basically just have the top half of her

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.230 
basically just have the top half of her
hair<00:02:20.630> all<00:02:21.110> together<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:22.760> I'm<00:02:22.880> going<00:02:23.120> to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
hair all together and now I'm going to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.390 
hair all together and now I'm going to
make<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.420> French<00:02:23.750> braid<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.770> I'm<00:02:24.890> splitting

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
make a French braid so I'm splitting

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.840 
make a French braid so I'm splitting
this<00:02:25.550> into<00:02:25.940> three<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.520> then<00:02:28.520> I'm<00:02:28.670> just

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
this into three and then I'm just

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.280 
this into three and then I'm just
braiding<00:02:29.090> normally<00:02:29.720> I'm<00:02:29.900> bringing<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
braiding normally I'm bringing the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.150 
braiding normally I'm bringing the
outside<00:02:30.470> strands<00:02:31.370> over<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.880> middle

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
outside strands over the middle

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.330 
outside strands over the middle
and<00:02:34.930> I'm<00:02:35.930> going<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.200> be<00:02:36.350> taking<00:02:36.680> pretty<00:02:36.950> large

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
and I'm going to be taking pretty large

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:49.990 
and I'm going to be taking pretty large
sections<00:02:38.530> down<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> bottom<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:49.610> now<00:02:49.790> that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
sections down to the bottom and now that

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.940 
sections down to the bottom and now that
I've<00:02:50.090> added<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.630> all<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.200> hair<00:02:51.500> I'm<00:02:51.740> just

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
I've added in all of that hair I'm just

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.980 
I've added in all of that hair I'm just
going<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.220> regular<00:02:52.820> braid<00:02:53.150> down<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
going to regular braid down to the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.890 
going to regular braid down to the
bottom<00:02:57.310> before<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.550> tie<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:58.910> off<00:02:59.330> I'm<00:02:59.690> going

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
bottom before I tie that off I'm going

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.690 
bottom before I tie that off I'm going
to<00:03:00.020> go<00:03:00.110> back<00:03:00.290> through<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.680> stretch<00:03:01.220> out<00:03:01.460> these

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
to go back through and stretch out these

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.910 
to go back through and stretch out these
strands<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> braid<00:03:03.140> has<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.410> thicker

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
strands so that the braid has a thicker

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:13.180 
strands so that the braid has a thicker
appearance<00:03:11.260> okay<00:03:12.260> now<00:03:12.530> I'm<00:03:12.680> going<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:12.980> take

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
appearance okay now I'm going to take

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.610 
appearance okay now I'm going to take
this<00:03:13.310> braid<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.970> bring<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.300> up<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.840> around

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
this braid and bring it up and around

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.430 
this braid and bring it up and around
and<00:03:15.970> before<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.210> tuck<00:03:17.480> these<00:03:17.630> ends<00:03:18.050> in<00:03:18.170> I'm

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
and before I tuck these ends in I'm

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.590 
and before I tuck these ends in I'm
going<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:18.890> pin<00:03:19.190> Biff<00:03:19.550> on<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.970> side<00:03:20.210> just<00:03:20.450> so

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
going to pin Biff on the side just so

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.800 
going to pin Biff on the side just so
that<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.840> will<00:03:20.960> stay<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.440> place<00:03:21.740> so<00:03:22.810> you're

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
that it will stay in place so you're

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.450 
that it will stay in place so you're
probably<00:03:23.960> only<00:03:24.320> going<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.770> need<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.950> couple<00:03:25.280> of

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
probably only going to need a couple of

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.130 
probably only going to need a couple of
bobby<00:03:25.730> pins<00:03:25.850> you<00:03:26.330> just<00:03:26.510> want<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.750> pin<00:03:26.900> along

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
bobby pins you just want to pin along

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.770 
bobby pins you just want to pin along
the<00:03:27.290> edge<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.830> braid<00:03:28.160> and<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:29.360> make<00:03:29.540> sure

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
the edge of that braid and to make sure

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.460 
the edge of that braid and to make sure
it<00:03:29.930> stays<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.740> always<00:03:31.190> try<00:03:31.400> to<00:03:31.430> cross<00:03:31.820> my<00:03:32.120> pins

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.100 

so<00:03:38.400> after<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.880> get<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.210> so<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:39.990> feels

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
so after you get that so that it feels

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.960 
so after you get that so that it feels
pretty<00:03:40.440> secure<00:03:40.980> now<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.310> want<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.640> take<00:03:41.820> these

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
pretty secure now you want to take these

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.480 
pretty secure now you want to take these
ends<00:03:42.240> and<00:03:42.450> tuck<00:03:42.630> them<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.320> what<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:43.920> am

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
ends and tuck them in and what I am

ends and tuck them in and what I am
going<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.820> do<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.210> just<00:03:45.450> reach<00:03:45.690> right<00:03:45.960> up<00:03:45.990> here

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
going to do is just reach right up here

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.140 
going to do is just reach right up here
where<00:03:46.470> these<00:03:46.650> twists<00:03:47.160> are<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.790> kind<00:03:48.000> of

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
where these twists are and kind of

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.840 
where these twists are and kind of
create<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> little<00:03:48.870> hole<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:50.010> just<00:03:50.490> push<00:03:50.670> them

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
create a little hole and just push them

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.780 
create a little hole and just push them
right<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.630> there<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.310> then<00:03:53.310> you'll<00:03:53.460> want<00:03:53.640> to

right in there and then you'll want to
bobby<00:03:54.000> pin<00:03:54.330> them<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.630> place

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
bobby pin them in place

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.580 
bobby pin them in place
so<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.100> they<00:03:56.220> don't<00:03:56.370> pop<00:03:56.670> out<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:58.170> I'm<00:03:58.350> going

so that they don't pop out so I'm going
to<00:03:58.650> place<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.950> pin<00:03:59.340> right<00:03:59.370> here<00:03:59.940> kind<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:00.720> at<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
to place a pin right here kind of at the

need<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:18.090> sometimes<00:04:18.750> I've<00:04:18.930> found<00:04:19.200> while<00:04:19.410> doing

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
need to sometimes I've found while doing

need to sometimes I've found while doing
this<00:04:19.830> hairstyle<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.489> it<00:04:20.580> gets<00:04:20.730> kind<00:04:20.970> of

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
this hairstyle that it gets kind of

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.150 
this hairstyle that it gets kind of
saggy<00:04:21.330> down<00:04:21.660> here<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.200> so<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.350> usually<00:04:22.590> pin<00:04:22.950> not

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
saggy down here and so I usually pin not

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:39.580 
saggy down here and so I usually pin not
braid<00:04:23.400> right<00:04:23.550> there<00:04:23.790> in<00:04:23.910> place<00:04:24.180> as<00:04:24.420> well
