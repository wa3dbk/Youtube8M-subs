00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.220
 frankly not 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.030
 besides river which I have in some 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.299
 point an absolute impartiality from the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 plane of the feeling of action fighting 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100
 It represents good I tell you I'm coming 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 to consult boedo neighbors and I come 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.310
 to raise a very serious issue in case 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.529
 we have few problems with the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 insecurity with violence in the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.490
 Buenos Aires city in Argentina in 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.800
 general adds to a conflict between 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 own boedo neighbors some 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 supporters of san lorenzo and others who 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.090
 they may or may not be but they want 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.860
 protect their homes they want it not to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.219
 they devalue their properties they want 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.680
 do not come down your buildings because 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.289
 there are two towers built in front of 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 carrefour that would be the place that is going to 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.059
 expropriate to build a stadium that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.539
 they are towers built with materials in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.699
 standard form for humble people of 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.990
 low resources and that ultimately will 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.760
 suffer 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.470
 the damages before the assumption that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.770
 that builder not in how many more floors 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.790
 or less around 30 floors he test is 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.830
 the next I intervene in this 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.470
 through good offices in a 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.720
 start the sole purpose of trying to 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.220
 stop an escalation of violence there 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 in the neighborhood so he decided 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.480
 send a letter to the president of the 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.230
 institution and Mr. lammens 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.940
 requesting that they arbitrate the 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.580
 mechanisms to prevent acts of 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.100
 violence and threats of assumptions 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.810
 fans of san lorenzo always talking 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.670
 in the field of the hypothetical against 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.460
 neighbors who laughed raise actions 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.100
 judicial to stop the construction 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.930
 of the stadium to achieve 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.850
 unconstitutionality of the law that 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.430
 sanctioned in the legislature of the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.290
 Perez seconds a month and a half ago that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.570
 was enacted and published 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.750
 about 20 days the problem 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.840
 is that this conflict is 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.970
 generating violence my impression is that 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.610
 there are aspects that are not being 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.070
 contemplating that is saying is being raised 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.009
 a negotiation with carrefour starting 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.610
 of the letter of the law itself but not 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.950
 is observing the situation of the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.450
 clear neighbors 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.709
 he does not want to compensate him to carrefour 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.730
 as is appropriate, we talk about a 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.140
 expropriation for the sake of utility 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.540
 public a priori without entering, let's say 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.489
 Prejudice about the scope of the law 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.769
 about the foundation we believe 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.540
 that there is no public utility in this 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.640
 expropriation reason why 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.040
 carrefour would be harmed by the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.069
 sanction of this law and would have the right 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.720
 to make a compensatory claim but 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.299
 going to the specific issue of the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.280
 neighbors there is no study about the 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.680
 environmental impact that has been 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.470
 with a view to the possible construction of 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.470
 this stadium we know that there is talk of a 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.180
 sports center talks about schools but 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.440
 the reality of the background everyone 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.680
 we know is that you want to build a 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.380
 stadium and ultimately if this does not 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.000
 solve the club authorities with 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.620
 the representatives of the neighbors with 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.480
 the representatives of carrefour through 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.760
 of tripartite negotiations 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.459
 should be engaged is going to define the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.709
 justice what justice defines can 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.209
 get to be in favor of san lorenzo that 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.040
 the stadium is built but at the same time 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.180
 against san lorenzo if it is built 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.180
 because it will generate damage 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.200
 then we think that here you have to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.390
 Pride of sanity has to be avoided 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.370
 act of violence in coercion the 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.769
 intimidation the neighbors too 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.510
 they have to add up their efforts 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.269
 to reach a negotiation 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.129
 eventually perhaps san lorenzo manages 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.379
 extend the scope of your 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.590
 compensation and pay the neighbors 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.569
 for its properties at real value what 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.790
 same to carrefour not to the value that 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.489
 establishes the law but a real value there 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.549
 a lot to talk about but basically my 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.250
 intervention is to try to avoid 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.859
 that this focus of violence is followed 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.109
 expanding is so perfect good very 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:10.900
 clear fabiÃ¡n bergenfeld we will see how 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:14.950
 how this movie continues thanks 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.389
 good if the proposals is unclear whether 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.879
 what he explained 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.769
 the doctor is opposed to the hubbub 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.789
 and enthusiasm that had known the 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.729
 people of san lorenzo that in the 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.749
 legislature had held the sanction 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.120
 of the law the doctor talked about 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:30.729
 which implies the return of land to 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.629
 lorenzo surely if the neighbors go to 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:37.229
 justice will be this 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.229
 well thank you very much
