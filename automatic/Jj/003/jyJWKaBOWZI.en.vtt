00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello today I show you how I feel 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.509
 this would have made a little here 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.460
 a bit more demanding than that 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.610
 you need the last one again 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 took in a millimeter thick a couple 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.470
 stones or beads or something like that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.170
 you would like to have a round pliers 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.529
 and a side cutter one 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.340
 nail file maybe a pen and a 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.980
 first of all I have the ruler 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.720
 Rat measured to 16 centimeters around the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.720
 then shortened with the side cutter 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.700
 then I have 6 cm with the and 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.239
 Collect the first bend in the wire 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.239
 made 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.839
 and at 25 centimeters I have the 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.710
 wire again in the other direction 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.370
 elevated 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.649
 the 25 centimeters are the width of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.629
 the jam because in the end then I have 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.489
 the one end of what's going on out there 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.869
 I made the first one around me 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.869
 have again born around it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.610
 that will be something like that 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:19.430
 I then pressed around the pen around it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.430
 so that it just gets this round shape 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.200
 and then served with the tour 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.360
 inflected it with the oakley then 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.590
 really stops on the ear and I rum 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.590
 slips or falls off 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.890
 I have the grads down then 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.060
 bent with the then later on the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.060
 earlobes on lies 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.890
 then I have the shorter end of the advice 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.890
 made a little evil 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.160
 I have the longer end of the wire 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.110
 then three of my ornaments 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.550
 plugged and again with a 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.550
 completed 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.560
 and that's how it looks
