 bread maker to knead 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.790
 the dough I put the Teutons program dough 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:12.040

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:12.040

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.610
 now i will put the dough kneaded and 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:30.400
 It was paying but slowly adding 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:33.220
 flour I added almost all the flour 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.380
 I had three glasses of sifted flour 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.420
 Now I will look how much I 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.420
 need more added remaining flour 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.000
 sifted another half cup sprinkle the table 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.650
 flour 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.710
 we got a pretty cool dough 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.500
 like dumplings in total i 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:08.739
 added somewhere else a glass of flour because 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.989
 what you saw and now i will i gave 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.800
 dough to rest after you got in the way 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.800
 10 minutes 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.550
 Now we divide it into small ones 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.550
 fragments 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:52.500
 we will get such balls 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:57.270
 quite a lot now we are kneading 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.640
 these balls give them a great shape 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.560
 if you have succeeded 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.120
 quite the same in size too 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.590
 no big deal we will be for everything 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.480
 just tell if you have a big 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.880
 surface you can make balls 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.220
 more that you will roll a 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.220
 if you have less space, better is less 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.959
 leave the balls to lie down for five minutes too 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.330
 maybe 67 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.000
 so they rested then the dough will be 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.080
 better roll out if you start 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.670
 we put in the dough kotova immediately then she 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.670
 after you interfered she won't 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.670
 you will be hard to resist him throw 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.030
 roll each ball into a small one 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.280
 reservoir on thin classes somewhere up 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.430
 one millimeter 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.980
 add more flour to our leaf and 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.130
 we will still dry ie we 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.900
 roll out every ball roll out 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.329
 layer and then leave to dry on 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.040
 five to ten minutes on each side 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.000
 the longer you roll the tastier 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.000
 will baklava 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.600
 dry each layer for 5-10 minutes 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.940
 each side and so continue here at 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.030
 I have one leaf already dried up if you 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.100
 you see that he is a little bit well and not a hundred 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.000
 percent 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:38.130
 dry dough a little bit such a bunch then 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.750
 you can powder a little more 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.390
 we start to turn off 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:49.940
 somewhere in 3-4 centimeters 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.940
 wrap rolls rolls down like this 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:14.509
 so the last bit of grease 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:17.259
 water and wrap cut our reservoir 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.259
 diagonally 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.430
 try to do a good way if 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.590
 Well, make a small cut then they 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.319
 will not be very beautiful not very good 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:39.340
 see here and now we are 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.949
 we deploy them here on such rugs 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.280
 and spread somewhere on the powder and 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.169
 flour place 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.259
 while the rest of the layers dry start 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.419
 fry our baklava in oil i 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.460
 I use about half a liter floor 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:59.039
 liter of oil 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.039
 help the fork open the petals 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.819
 something seems to me that they are so good a 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:12.280
 that's better you can see so well 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:15.039
 You can fry several pieces at once if 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.930
 your petals suddenly stuck together 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.979
 disorder is nothing to worry about 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.430
 just more for you 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:26.789
 a little work and hassle look like 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:29.199
 beautifully they unfold in oil here 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:32.110
 fry them about that 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:35.860
 colors and lay out the natra slag to 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.289
 glass of excess oil in the meantime prepare 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:46.289
 syrup 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:46.289
 add sugar and add water and 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.490
 cook it on medium heat 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.949
 Now we will lower each piece 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:56.539
 syrup syrup at us boiled somewhere minutes 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.490
 ten 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:02.759
 the syrup we get is quite painful 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:07.560
 when he is well when he is already frozen i 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:16.729
 did so every phrase 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:16.729
 a few pieces then sprinkle with sesame 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:29.090
