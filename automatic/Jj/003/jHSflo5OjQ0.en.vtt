00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
yeah i got it 13-inch macbook pro this

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.380 
yeah i got it 13-inch macbook pro this
is<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.660> bigger<00:02:15.660> one<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:17.060> specs<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.270> this

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
is the bigger one the specs on this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.900 
is the bigger one the specs on this
thing<00:02:18.660> are<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> four<00:02:19.140> gigabyte<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.800> memory

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
thing are the four gigabyte of memory

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.060 
thing are the four gigabyte of memory
250<00:02:20.910> gigabyte<00:02:21.090> hard<00:02:21.480> drive<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:22.770> know<00:02:22.860> all<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
250 gigabyte hard drive you know all the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.470 
250 gigabyte hard drive you know all the
rest<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.430> think<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.790> stuff<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.240> same

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
rest I think of this stuff is the same

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
rest I think of this stuff is the same
as<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.690> other<00:02:24.959> one<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.380> it's<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> bigger

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
as the other one but it's the bigger

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.449 
as the other one but it's the bigger
process<00:02:26.700> or<00:02:26.880> more<00:02:27.120> memory<00:02:27.480> bigger<00:02:27.840> hard<00:02:28.080> drive

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
process or more memory bigger hard drive

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.280 
process or more memory bigger hard drive
so<00:02:29.459> I'm<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.970> get<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.720> thing<00:02:30.780> open<00:02:31.110> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
so I'm going to get this thing open and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.620 
so I'm going to get this thing open and
set<00:02:31.530> up<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.980> then<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.700> wanted<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.090> protect<00:02:33.420> it

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
set up and then I wanted to protect it

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.270 
set up and then I wanted to protect it
so<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.260> went<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.720> speck<00:02:36.720> seethru<00:02:37.320> for<00:02:38.130> it

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
so I went with the speck seethru for it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.710 
so I went with the speck seethru for it
probably<00:02:39.090> end<00:02:39.209> up<00:02:39.300> going<00:02:39.360> with<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:41.720> incipio

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
probably end up going with a incipio

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.840 
probably end up going with a incipio
feather<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.680> eventually<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.640> wanted

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
feather for it eventually but I wanted

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.280 
feather for it eventually but I wanted
something<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.209> away<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.540> protect<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.230> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
something right away to protect it so I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.650 
something right away to protect it so I
at<00:02:46.380> least<00:02:46.470> pick<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.890> up<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.060> let<00:02:48.570> me

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
at least pick that up and then let me

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.479 
at least pick that up and then let me
just<00:02:48.810> send<00:02:48.959> my<00:02:49.080> camera<00:02:49.440> around<00:02:49.590> cuz<00:02:49.950> i<00:02:50.250> got
