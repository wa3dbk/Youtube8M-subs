00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.370
 but this new one is welcome here 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.080
 video and good because this time they 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.689
 I bring a gameplay or rather two 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.220
 times of revolution and it's good more than 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.869
 nothing is to tell you a little about the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.750
 why I have not raised what they are 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.579
 Naruto gameplays in this case then 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.619
 let's say I focused a lot on what 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.210
 that was the xbox one with what it was 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 advanced warfighter with what was jaime 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.839
 with what was this gta iv good I think 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.920
 that already gave me to know mentioned the 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:38.160
 fact that encourages you to see so much not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.320
 retain the channel yesterday I tried 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.140
 pick up a little bit what is the game and I 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.830
 I came across an impressive amount of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.960
 this type of games definitely if 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.210
 something that characterized storm 3 was that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.239
 I enjoyed the game so much 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.890
 I did not suffer to what this is to climb the 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.960
 game us to the wta is that it did not cost me 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.610
 absolutely nothing upload it catches them 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.339
 some come forward brought them the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.129
 game however I realize that here 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.170
 in revolution stresses me enough 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.509
 obviously I'm pretty rusty in what 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.420
 which is what the game is not like or not 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.590
 I'm as polished as before and good 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.120
 Well, I also told him to give a lot 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.300
 continuity and that has a lot to do not 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.950
 however good something important or something 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.360
 yes, yes, it makes me pretty 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.010
 fact that people start playing 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.020
 in that sense obviously they are not all 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.970
 no but this is going to reduce 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.620
 considerably what are the series 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.750
 that I have planned here for the channel 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.180
 this one you know I had I think four 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 series planned here this and well then 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.690
 nothing will reduce what are this 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.430
 Well, the series 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.080
 let's leave it in what it is to be a pro 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.580
 and what is the capes so good 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.590
 Well, in this video, I'm asking you 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.380
 please leave me in the comments that is 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.000
 that will be a pro they want to see remember 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.920
 how was the dynamics more or less 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.690
 let's leave what is this memory 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.010
 of why he was going to be good with 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.130
 online gameplays the truth is that it is 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.780
 quite annoying then then let's say 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.790
 that in that sense, I do prefer 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.750
 rest a little bit I will do I will 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.030
 record what has been the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.060
 survival is what they are 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.440
 the tournaments that I will record it 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.879
 because besides good I want to get him out 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.580
 all the achievements to this game that good 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.440
 It's the only one I'm missing 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.000
 the naruto games then I'm going to 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.260
 devote to record a bit of that so that 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.390
 come back in chicago here on the canal 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.910
 I hope you like it then, now 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.440
 so do not forget to leave me here in 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.990
 the comments as he mentioned what 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.630
 is the series not the series the character that 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.520
 they want to see what this is not a lie 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.140
 here this being a pro then what is 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.660
 what they want to see in combat with 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.950
 regarding what this character is not or 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.720
 the character that you choose 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.220
 obviously also found the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.020
 characters that are already chosen for 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.730
 for the capes and well what I already 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.410
 was made here to make a pro and 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.610
 something that is very similar to the storm 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.380
 before, I think we're not going 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.090
 to bring in this case for example the use 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.370
 of the ninja career maybe yes because if 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.990
 carme a little bit this but for example 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.820
 I use the reinforcements as well and not what 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.320
 let's go so dare to take into account what 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.550
 are the previous episodes so they 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.650
 I ask that you please visit them 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.570
 here to the channel that is good they were taken 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.490
 studies in what was these three and in 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.410
 what they were generating so that they 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.490
 give a checada and well then do not leave me 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.080
 here in the comments something that of 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.959
 suddenly it has already been done or something 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.280
 not like that and good for after 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.770
 that game that you saw right now 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.810
 that it went pretty bad I got serious 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.240
 but obviously I do not like to play 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.670
 well I do not like to play like that because 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.210
 I have fun I stress too much 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.580
 have to play too much 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.730
 let's say too offensive this and 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.950
 put me in a plan too west then 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.170
 too much attack not yet mind the 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.150
 departures to see luxurious I believe the fact 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.130
 how good will I take it off like 15 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.320
 seconds and I do not get down then it's 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.610
 absolutely nothing of life but not 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.020
 so think a little bit about me 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.550
 suffering at the time of being playing 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.170
 This type of games in which 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.660
 Well, if it costs me a lot of work 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.790
 the fact of being able to play this 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.470
 way not then a people then I hope 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.270
 that you liked the video I hope that 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.550
 you liked the game and what good 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.590
 this second game and well then not 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.560
 forget to leave your like I say goodbye 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.450
 we see the next and bye 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.650
 carries in unix 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.650
 I fall
