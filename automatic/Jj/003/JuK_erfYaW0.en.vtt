00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
want it too far back or they'll be too

want it too far back or they'll be too
dark<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> sense<00:01:26.729> too<00:01:26.940> much<00:01:27.090> ahead<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.539> them

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
dark if the sense too much ahead of them

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.840 
dark if the sense too much ahead of them
too<00:01:27.960> much<00:01:28.110> towards<00:01:28.590> me<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:29.369> gonna<00:01:29.550> flatten

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
too much towards me it's gonna flatten

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.800 
too much towards me it's gonna flatten
the<00:01:30.000> light<00:01:30.149> out<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.630> very

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the light out and not be very

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.930 
the light out and not be very
interesting<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.890> Sun<00:01:32.190> needs<00:01:32.399> to<00:01:32.520> be<00:01:32.610> just

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
interesting the Sun needs to be just

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.899 
interesting the Sun needs to be just
behind<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> creates<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.110> nice<00:01:34.289> rim<00:01:34.909> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
behind them so it creates a nice rim the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.850 
behind them so it creates a nice rim the
only<00:01:36.119> way<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.300> control<00:01:36.690> this<00:01:36.899> natural<00:01:37.740> light

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
only way to control this natural light

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.219 
only way to control this natural light
is<00:01:38.069> to<00:01:38.280> move<00:01:38.550> our<00:01:38.789> subject<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.569> rotate<00:01:40.080> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
is to move our subject to rotate the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.559 
is to move our subject to rotate the
scene<00:01:40.470> rotate<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> wagon<00:01:41.880> our<00:01:42.030> people<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.479> the

scene rotate the wagon our people in the

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.600 
scene rotate the wagon our people in the
gravesite<00:01:43.080> I<00:01:43.350> rotated<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.130> grave<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
gravesite I rotated the grave and the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.249 
gravesite I rotated the grave and the
people<00:01:44.909> several<00:01:45.180> times<00:01:45.509> until<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> got<00:01:46.079> the

13th of a second we're using 320 as our
ISO<00:02:14.340> I'm<00:02:15.240> going<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.570> lengthen<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> shutter

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
ISO I'm going to lengthen the shutter

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.590 
ISO I'm going to lengthen the shutter
now<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.920> keep<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.280> sky<00:02:17.550> looking<00:02:17.880> good<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.480> we

now to keep the sky looking good and we
don't<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.840> much<00:02:18.960> time<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.350> we're<00:02:19.440> gonna

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
don't have much time so we're gonna

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
face in the same position as a Sun so it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.350

here's our image with the strobe light
on<00:02:40.590> her<00:02:40.800> face<00:02:41.010> I've<00:02:41.340> got<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.580> CTO<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.750> do<00:02:42.900> this

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
on her face I've got a CTO on I do this

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.810 
on her face I've got a CTO on I do this
just<00:02:43.380> because<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.709> want<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.070> warm<00:02:44.400> her<00:02:44.580> face

just because I want to warm her face
then<00:02:45.060> later<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.570> can<00:02:45.900> dial<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.500> warmth<00:02:46.950> out

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
then later I can dial that warmth out

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.280 
then later I can dial that warmth out
and<00:02:47.340> Roth<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:48.030> gives<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.390> nice<00:02:48.510> blue<00:02:48.840> sky<00:02:49.110> in

wagon it feels very comfortable I'm
going<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.150> use<00:03:12.269> the<00:03:12.420> natural<00:03:12.600> light<00:03:12.900> as<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.019> fill

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
going to use the natural light as a fill

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.570 
going to use the natural light as a fill
light<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.560> then<00:03:13.650> drag<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.040> shutter<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.400> burn

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
in the sky we didn't have a lot of time

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.490 
in the sky we didn't have a lot of time
to<00:03:18.390> pull<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.630> off<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:19.049> had<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.320> shoot

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
to pull this off so we had to shoot

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.039 
to pull this off so we had to shoot
really<00:03:19.709> quick<00:03:20.209> here's<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.360> image<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.780> way<00:03:21.900> we

really quick here's the image the way we

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.110 
really quick here's the image the way we
shot<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.410> out<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.620> location<00:03:22.880> we're<00:03:23.880> going<00:03:23.910> to

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
shot it out on location we're going to

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.880 
shot it out on location we're going to
take<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.450> into<00:03:24.600> Photoshop<00:03:24.840> remove<00:03:25.620> about<00:03:25.860> a

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
take it into Photoshop remove about a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.160 
take it into Photoshop remove about a
thousand<00:03:26.459> degrees<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.940> warmth<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:28.049> will

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
thousand degrees of warmth that will

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.780 
thousand degrees of warmth that will
neutralize<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.799> faces<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.250> give<00:03:29.459> us<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.640> nice

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
neutralize the faces and give us a nice

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.280 
neutralize the faces and give us a nice
blue<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.239> background<00:03:30.450> that'll<00:03:30.959> take<00:03:31.170> us

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
blue in the background that'll take us

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.720 
blue in the background that'll take us
to<00:03:31.440> our<00:03:31.530> final<00:03:31.709> image<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:34.370> really<00:03:35.370> love<00:03:35.549> this

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.160 
to our final image I really love this
shot<00:03:35.910> we<00:03:36.030> did<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.299> just<00:03:36.510> natural<00:03:36.959> light<00:03:37.080> it

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
shot we did with just natural light it

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.140 
shot we did with just natural light it
has<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.290> great<00:03:37.560> feel<00:03:37.799> I<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.760> image<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.120> I

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
has a great feel I like the image but I

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.610 
has a great feel I like the image but I
feel<00:03:39.330> like<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.570> needs<00:03:39.600> something<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.410> went

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
feel like it needs something so I went

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.310 
feel like it needs something so I went
to<00:03:40.709> Nick<00:03:40.920> color<00:03:41.190> effects<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.760> used<00:03:41.970> Pro<00:03:42.209> 4<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:43.049> I

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
to Nick color effects I used Pro 4 and I

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.690 
to Nick color effects I used Pro 4 and I
added<00:03:43.530> some<00:03:43.650> tonal<00:03:44.040> contrast

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
added some tonal contrast

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.310 
added some tonal contrast
I<00:03:44.730> love<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.330> looking<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.840> gives<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.200> the
