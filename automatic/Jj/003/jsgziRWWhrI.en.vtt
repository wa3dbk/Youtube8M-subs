you know over i think i have close to
100<00:06:25.570> apps<00:06:25.750> installed<00:06:26.230> so<00:06:27.040> it<00:06:27.160> does<00:06:27.280> get<00:06:27.430> a

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
100 apps installed so it does get a

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.700 
100 apps installed so it does get a
little<00:06:27.610> bit<00:06:27.820> sluggish<00:06:28.090> loading<00:06:28.660> it<00:06:28.930> up<00:06:29.050> but

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
little bit sluggish loading it up but

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.890 
little bit sluggish loading it up but
once<00:06:29.950> it<00:06:30.070> does<00:06:30.280> it's<00:06:30.910> just<00:06:31.120> check<00:06:31.300> boxes<00:06:31.690> to

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
once it does it's just check boxes to

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.420 
once it does it's just check boxes to
show<00:06:32.050> the<00:06:32.200> ones<00:06:32.350> that<00:06:32.530> you<00:06:32.680> want<00:06:32.890> to<00:06:32.980> be<00:06:33.070> hidden

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
show the ones that you want to be hidden

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.340 
show the ones that you want to be hidden
and<00:06:33.580> then<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:34.780> will<00:06:34.930> reload<00:06:35.260> itself<00:06:35.650> and

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
and then it will reload itself and

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.080 
and then it will reload itself and
they<00:06:36.770> won't<00:06:36.980> show<00:06:37.160> up<00:06:37.280> in<00:06:37.430> your<00:06:37.460> menu<00:06:37.790> which<00:06:37.940> is

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
they won't show up in your menu which is

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.630 
they won't show up in your menu which is
awesome<00:06:38.360> so<00:06:39.230> if<00:06:39.650> you've<00:06:39.950> got<00:06:40.250> a<00:06:40.280> whole<00:06:40.460> lot<00:06:40.610> of

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640 
awesome so if you've got a whole lot of

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.080 
awesome so if you've got a whole lot of
apps<00:06:40.880> you<00:06:41.060> can<00:06:41.120> just<00:06:41.420> kind<00:06:41.630> of<00:06:43.090> check

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
apps you can just kind of check

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.460 
apps you can just kind of check
different<00:06:44.450> things<00:06:44.720> to<00:06:44.870> make<00:06:45.080> sure<00:06:45.260> that

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
different things to make sure that

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.690 
different things to make sure that
they're<00:06:46.780> not<00:06:47.780> going<00:06:47.930> to<00:06:47.990> show<00:06:48.170> up<00:06:48.460> if<00:06:49.460> it's

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
they're not going to show up if it's

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.090 
they're not going to show up if it's
ones<00:06:49.940> that<00:06:50.150> you<00:06:50.390> either<00:06:51.080> for<00:06:51.680> instance<00:06:51.980> I<00:06:52.070> have

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
ones hidden that I have a shortcut on

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.830 
ones hidden that I have a shortcut on
the<00:06:54.560> home<00:06:54.740> screen<00:06:55.000> or<00:06:56.000> on<00:06:56.060> one<00:06:56.450> of<00:06:56.540> my<00:06:56.660> home

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.240 
the home screen or on one of my home
screen<00:06:57.050> so<00:06:57.290> obviously<00:06:57.650> I<00:06:57.740> don't<00:06:57.830> really<00:06:58.040> need

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
screen so obviously I don't really need

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.360 
screen so obviously I don't really need
it<00:06:58.580> to<00:06:59.000> show<00:06:59.180> up<00:06:59.270> in<00:06:59.360> my<00:06:59.480> main<00:06:59.690> menu<00:07:00.020> as<00:07:00.140> well<00:07:00.370> so

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370 
it to show up in my main menu as well so

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.710 
it to show up in my main menu as well so
that's<00:07:01.490> really<00:07:01.670> handy<00:07:01.910> and<00:07:02.270> then<00:07:02.420> some<00:07:02.540> of<00:07:02.600> the

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 
that's really handy and then some of the

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.120 
that's really handy and then some of the
other<00:07:02.840> stuff<00:07:02.930> that's<00:07:03.320> just<00:07:03.590> kind<00:07:03.770> of<00:07:03.800> silly

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
other stuff that's just kind of silly

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.910 
other stuff that's just kind of silly
that<00:07:04.340> I<00:07:04.370> don't<00:07:04.610> ever<00:07:04.730> use<00:07:05.000> I<00:07:05.870> can<00:07:06.770> actually

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
that I don't ever use I can actually

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.800 
that I don't ever use I can actually
have<00:07:07.280> hidden<00:07:07.490> so<00:07:07.820> that<00:07:08.000> it<00:07:08.120> doesn't<00:07:08.300> again

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
have hidden so that it doesn't again

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.900 
have hidden so that it doesn't again
junk<00:07:09.080> up<00:07:09.230> my<00:07:10.390> my<00:07:11.390> main<00:07:11.600> menu<00:07:11.930> so<00:07:12.830> I<00:07:13.520> could

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
junk up my my main menu so I could

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.120 
junk up my my main menu so I could
probably<00:07:14.150> go<00:07:14.510> ahead<00:07:14.660> and<00:07:14.750> hide<00:07:14.990> the<00:07:15.260> default<00:07:15.830> I

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.130 
probably go ahead and hide the default I

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.680 
probably go ahead and hide the default I
think<00:07:16.700> that's<00:07:16.850> the<00:07:17.060> default<00:07:17.240> I<00:07:17.450> have<00:07:17.570> two

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
think that's the default I have two

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.810 
think that's the default I have two
galleries<00:07:18.080> this<00:07:18.290> is<00:07:18.440> the<00:07:18.620> sense<00:07:18.980> gallery<00:07:19.550> and

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
galleries this is the sense gallery and

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.330 
galleries this is the sense gallery and
then<00:07:20.330> I<00:07:20.390> have<00:07:20.570> the<00:07:20.720> the<00:07:21.290> default<00:07:21.740> Android

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.340 
then I have the the default Android

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.560 
then I have the the default Android
gallery<00:07:22.730> which<00:07:22.970> is<00:07:23.120> so<00:07:23.360> much<00:07:23.540> better<00:07:25.000> so<00:07:26.000> I<00:07:26.390> can

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570 
gallery which is so much better so I can

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.240 
gallery which is so much better so I can
do<00:07:26.690> that<00:07:26.870> and<00:07:27.140> it's<00:07:27.620> going<00:07:27.710> to<00:07:27.770> ask<00:07:27.890> me<00:07:27.950> fall<00:07:28.160> to

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250 
do that and it's going to ask me fall to

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.170 
do that and it's going to ask me fall to
restart<00:07:28.670> it<00:07:28.820> and<00:07:29.230> then<00:07:30.230> when<00:07:30.410> I<00:07:30.440> do<00:07:30.530> that<00:07:31.180> now

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.180 
restart it and then when I do that now

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:38.190 
restart it and then when I do that now
you'll<00:07:32.450> notice<00:07:32.660> that<00:07:32.840> I<00:07:35.980> have<00:07:36.980> far<00:07:37.400> fewer
