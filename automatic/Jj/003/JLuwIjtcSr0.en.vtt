to scramble the eggs so that one thing
you<00:02:37.769> have<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.129> really<00:02:38.519> careful<00:02:38.700> that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
you have to be really careful that

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.140 
you have to be really careful that
whenever<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.870> mix<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:41.760> should<00:02:41.940> come

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
whenever you mix this this should come

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.150 
whenever you mix this this should come
back<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.540> room<00:02:42.720> temperature<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.440> not<00:02:43.620> mix<00:02:43.980> in

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
back to room temperature and not mix in

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.960 
back to room temperature and not mix in
hot<00:02:44.549> melted<00:02:45.030> chocolate<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.590> eggs<00:02:46.970> so

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
hot melted chocolate in the eggs so

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.550 
hot melted chocolate in the eggs so
which<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.299> why<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.510> was<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.989> first<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.349> read

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
which is why this was the first is read

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.100 
which is why this was the first is read
it<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.920> then<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.670> followed<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.239> with<00:02:51.269> beating

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
it and then I followed it with beating

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.770 
it and then I followed it with beating
the<00:02:52.260> eggs<00:02:52.670> okay<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.940> now<00:02:54.060> what<00:02:54.269> we<00:02:54.420> will<00:02:54.480> do<00:02:54.630> is

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
the eggs okay so now what we will do is

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.520 
the eggs okay so now what we will do is
we<00:02:55.049> will<00:02:55.079> take<00:02:55.349> in<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.560> refined<00:02:56.069> flour<00:02:57.530> take

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
we will take in the refined flour take

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.670 
we will take in the refined flour take
in<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.860> cocoa<00:02:59.190> powder

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
in the cocoa powder

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.259 
in the cocoa powder
this<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.829> unsweetened<00:03:02.220> cocoa<00:03:02.730> powder<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
this is unsweetened cocoa powder and

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.550 
this is unsweetened cocoa powder and
also<00:03:04.200> some<00:03:04.410> coffee<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:06.060> all<00:03:06.569> of<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:06.959> we<00:03:07.319> see

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
also some coffee and all of this we see

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.699 
also some coffee and all of this we see
winter<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:08.239> why<00:03:09.239> coffee<00:03:09.569> because<00:03:10.470> that

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
winter this why coffee because that

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.170 
winter this why coffee because that
little<00:03:10.950> bit<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.099> coffee<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.670> going<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:11.970> give<00:03:12.150> us

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
little bit of coffee is going to give us

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.520 
little bit of coffee is going to give us
a<00:03:12.569> slight<00:03:12.989> kick<00:03:13.319> in<00:03:13.560> flavor<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.810> won't<00:03:16.049> get<00:03:16.319> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
a slight kick in flavor you won't get a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.740 
a slight kick in flavor you won't get a
strong<00:03:17.220> flavor<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.730> coffee<00:03:18.000> in<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.420> but<00:03:18.630> it

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
strong flavor of coffee in it but it

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.800 
strong flavor of coffee in it but it
will<00:03:18.840> enhance<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.410> flavor<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.950> chocolate

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
will enhance the flavor of chocolate

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:28.280 
will enhance the flavor of chocolate
okay

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.040 

what<00:03:29.290> we<00:03:29.500> are<00:03:29.590> left<00:03:29.770> is<00:03:30.190> with<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.600> walnuts

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
what we are left is with the walnuts

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.020 
what we are left is with the walnuts
these<00:03:32.230> are<00:03:32.410> finely<00:03:32.770> chopped<00:03:33.070> walnuts<00:03:33.430> will

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
these are finely chopped walnuts will

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.960 
these are finely chopped walnuts will
mix<00:03:34.360> most<00:03:34.900> of<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.290> in<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.620> batter<00:03:35.860> and<00:03:36.160> we

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
mix most of it in the batter and we

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.140 
mix most of it in the batter and we
leave<00:03:37.270> some<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:38.620> us<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:39.010> pour<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.430> top<00:03:39.700> so

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
leave some for us to pour it on top so

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.210 
leave some for us to pour it on top so
now<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.810> we<00:03:40.990> have<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.350> is<00:03:41.560> we<00:03:41.800> have<00:03:42.010> to

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
now all that we have to do is we have to

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.470 
now all that we have to do is we have to
fold<00:03:43.120> this<00:03:43.390> in<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:45.370> this<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.700> known<00:03:45.880> as<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.210> cut

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
fold this in so this is known as the cut

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.090 
fold this in so this is known as the cut
there<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.900> fold<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:48.970> cut<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.920> is

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
there and fold this is cut and this is

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.820 
there and fold this is cut and this is
fold<00:03:51.460> okay<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.990> is<00:03:53.110> another<00:03:53.320> way<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.620> you

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
fold okay this is another way that you

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.330 
fold okay this is another way that you
can<00:03:54.040> do<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.490> number<00:03:55.180> eight<00:03:55.950> so<00:03:56.950> number<00:03:57.310> eight

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
can do is number eight so number eight

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.970 
can do is number eight so number eight
is<00:03:57.700> like<00:03:58.360> this

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.250 

since<00:04:04.550> we<00:04:04.700> have<00:04:04.819> not<00:04:04.970> added<00:04:05.300> any<00:04:05.630> baking<00:04:06.050> power

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
since we have not added any baking power

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.199 
since we have not added any baking power
to<00:04:06.410> this<00:04:06.590> do<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.190> have<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.490> be<00:04:07.580> really<00:04:08.000> careful

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
to this do you have to be really careful

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.850 
to this do you have to be really careful
while<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.720> do<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.990> folding<00:04:09.380> because

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
while you do the folding because

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.070 
while you do the folding because
whatever<00:04:10.310> air<00:04:10.700> incorporation<00:04:11.480> is<00:04:11.630> being<00:04:11.840> done

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
whatever air incorporation is being done

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.590 
whatever air incorporation is being done
is<00:04:12.319> done<00:04:12.560> due<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.010> eggs<00:04:13.250> so<00:04:13.790> do<00:04:14.000> not<00:04:14.180> over

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
is done due to the eggs so do not over

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.690 
is done due to the eggs so do not over
fold<00:04:15.020> this<00:04:15.230> or<00:04:15.470> else<00:04:15.920> we<00:04:16.130> lose<00:04:16.400> all<00:04:16.640> the

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
fold this or else we lose all the

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.390 
fold this or else we lose all the
aeration<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.750> has<00:04:18.019> happened<00:04:18.380> so<00:04:18.590> far<00:04:18.799> just

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
aeration that has happened so far just

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.699 
aeration that has happened so far just
make<00:04:19.640> sure<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.239> mix<00:04:20.570> well<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.290> that<00:04:21.440> all

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
make sure that you mix well so that all

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.610 
make sure that you mix well so that all
the<00:04:21.980> flour<00:04:22.370> gets<00:04:23.180> well<00:04:23.750> mixed<00:04:24.260> into<00:04:24.470> the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
the flour gets well mixed into the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.250 
the flour gets well mixed into the
batter

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
batter

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.750 
batter
okay<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.500> see<00:04:27.740> this<00:04:27.919> this<00:04:28.130> mixture<00:04:28.520> is

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
okay so you see this this mixture is

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
okay so you see this this mixture is
done<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.570> now<00:04:30.310> let's<00:04:31.310> pour<00:04:31.700> this<00:04:32.030> batter<00:04:32.360> into

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
done and now let's pour this batter into

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.240 
done and now let's pour this batter into
a<00:04:32.960> cake<00:04:33.260> tin<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.860> have<00:04:34.669> a<00:04:34.700> square<00:04:35.090> cake<00:04:35.390> tin<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:36.250> am

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
a cake tin I have a square cake tin I am

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.980 
a cake tin I have a square cake tin I am
now<00:04:37.610> going<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:37.820> fill<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.240> batter<00:04:38.450> right<00:04:38.690> up<00:04:38.840> to

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
now going to fill the batter right up to

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.480 
now going to fill the batter right up to
the<00:04:39.050> brim<00:04:39.260> why<00:04:39.590> because<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.160> is<00:04:40.310> going<00:04:40.400> to

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
the brim why because this is going to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.510 
the brim why because this is going to
rise<00:04:40.760> quite<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.120> bit<00:04:41.419> and<00:04:41.570> secondly<00:04:42.400> we<00:04:43.400> have

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
rise quite a bit and secondly we have

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.610 
rise quite a bit and secondly we have
grieved<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.150> with<00:04:44.330> butter<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.870> dusted<00:04:45.260> with

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
grieved this with butter and dusted with

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.700 
grieved this with butter and dusted with
refined<00:04:46.040> flour<00:04:47.710> now<00:04:48.710> this<00:04:49.130> goes<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:52.300> and

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
refined flour now this goes in and
