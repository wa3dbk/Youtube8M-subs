you can actually see it and see if that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
you can actually see it and see if that
happens<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:58.020> tiny

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
little tug as you can see just to make

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.200 
little tug as you can see just to make
sure<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:47.070> was<00:01:47.280> staying<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.149 
sure that it was staying on there and
I'm<00:01:48.509> kind<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.810> zooming<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:50.420> okay<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:52.159> there's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
I'm kind of zooming in okay so there's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.560 
I'm kind of zooming in okay so there's
that<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.149> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> go<00:01:54.479> ahead

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570

and cut the other one from the basic the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.230 
and cut the other one from the basic the
bifurcating<00:02:00.840> area<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.280> splits<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
bifurcating area so it splits in two and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
bifurcating area so it splits in two and
then<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.530> cut<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.890> other<00:02:05.040> ear<00:02:05.280> butt<00:02:05.490> off
