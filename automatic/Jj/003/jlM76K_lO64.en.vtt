00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:17.240
 last video I shot about three 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:21.300
 months ago and today I decided to take off 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:25.189
 Another video in the comments I wrote 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.519
 many requests for what topic to shoot video and 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:32.250
 I chose this topic how to install 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.110
 cards for counter strike global 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.020
 offencive 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:42.660
 in my case on the pirated version if 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.910
 you will be interested to write in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.219
 comments and i will shoot a video like 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.789
 make yourself a pirated version of the working 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:58.199
 pirated version of counter strike global 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.719
 offencive and so to install the card 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.719
 you first need the card itself 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.240
 card must be made with 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:13.659
 the bsp extension is not necessary for you 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.170
 there must be one file you can 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.500
 be a few two or three my case 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:26.350
 the card is small and it takes only 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 just one file and we start for that 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:36.850
 need to go to your location 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.399

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.300
 set further go 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.300
 counter-strike 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.690
 maps 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.440

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:04.110
 so just how to start it look 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.939

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:15.840
