00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
because it's different than just curling

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
because it's different than just curling
your<00:00:50.789> hair<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> regular<00:00:51.510> curling<00:00:51.870> iron

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
your hair with a regular curling iron

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560 
your hair with a regular curling iron
and<00:00:52.260> using<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> clamps<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.219> section<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.329> hair

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and using the clamps I section my hair

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.959 
and using the clamps I section my hair
off<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.890> towards<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> bottom<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
off and towards the bottom you can do a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
off and towards the bottom you can do a
little<00:00:57.120> bit<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.390> thicker<00:00:57.570> sections<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.800> at

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
little bit of thicker sections but at

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.490 
little bit of thicker sections but at
the<00:00:59.129> top<00:00:59.480> you<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> little<00:01:01.379> bit

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the top you want them to be a little bit

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.609 
the top you want them to be a little bit
closer<00:01:01.710> together<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.780> section<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
closer together so I section it out to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
closer together so I section it out to
about<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.040> much<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.549> much<00:01:05.610> hair<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.270> then

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
about that much that much hair and then

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.960 
about that much that much hair and then
I<00:01:07.110> use<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> curling<00:01:07.920> iron<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> wand<00:01:08.760> I

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
I use the curling iron like a wand I

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.789 
I use the curling iron like a wand I
don't<00:01:09.150> use<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> clamp<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.619> is

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
don't use the clamp at all what I do is

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.590 
don't use the clamp at all what I do is
I<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.100> wrap<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.810> around<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
I just wrap it around like that and it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.880 
I just wrap it around like that and it
kind<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.229> um<00:01:17.600> twists<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> try<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> untwist<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
kind of um twists so I try to untwist it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.910 
kind of um twists so I try to untwist it
as<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.340> wrapping<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.820> around<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:22.049> barrel<00:01:22.409> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
as I'm wrapping it around the barrel so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
as I'm wrapping it around the barrel so
when<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.159> try<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.430> you'll<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:24.450> able<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> see

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
when you try it you'll be able to see

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.210 
when you try it you'll be able to see
what<00:01:24.900> I'm<00:01:24.990> talking<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> strands

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
what I'm talking about but the strands

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.460 
what I'm talking about but the strands
kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> twist<00:01:26.970> together<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.049> gets<00:01:28.290> really

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
kind of twist together so it gets really

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.649 
kind of twist together so it gets really
hot<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:28.950> fast<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.820> don't<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.450> need

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
hot really fast so you don't really need

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.170 
hot really fast so you don't really need
to<00:01:30.720> leave<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.380> long<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:31.970> see<00:01:32.970> there

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
to leave it in that long but see there

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
to leave it in that long but see there
it<00:01:33.270> goes<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.900> bottom<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> little

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it goes and then the bottom is a little

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
it goes and then the bottom is a little
bit<00:01:34.799> straighter<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.420> to
