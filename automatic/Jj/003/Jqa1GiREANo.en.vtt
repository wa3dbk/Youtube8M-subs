00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.259
 how are you welcome to this tutorial in 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.080
 this time we are going to draw a text 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.240
 cartoony in flash good is very 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.850
 simple what we are going to do is take the 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.660
 brush tool and let's 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.020
 write a text I like to take more or 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.800
 less so the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.600
 the shape of the letters 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.300
 draw them to your liking and good 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.700
 so this is sorry, notice here 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.700
 we have in normal paint ok 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.720
 well I write it an efe 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.720
 and let's put it like that 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 I have been pretty bad air 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.170
 yes 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.590
 here it 's good it 's getting pretty 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.690
 ugly I admit 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.690
 but it is a sample not 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.360
 you have to do yours a little bit 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.040
 better than mine 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.870
 and avoid you being like this for the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.440
 well well more or less like that and we're going to 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.710
 add a couple of lines down 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.110
 it's a cartoonish text so there's no 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.690
 problem if you do not 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 perfect ok we select everything 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.740
 selection tool selections 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.600
 everything presses the f 8 key and we put it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.960
 text 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.900
 okay 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.950
 we double click the symbol sends us to 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.470
 the text scene only us 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.690
 we place we leave a frame and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.150
 we press efe 6 we leave a frame and 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.820
 we press between 6 we leave a frame 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.980
 and we press efe 6 well with this 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.450
 will suffice 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.509
 we go to the first 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.760
 and a little thing that I forgot to tell you is 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.970
 that the colors 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.830
 before we are going to color everything 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.170
 before why 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.930
 color in white I recommend that you 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.940
 the colors of light white that you 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.970
 you can use any color but you are going 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.550
 to mix with the original color not well 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.500
 in what I will be selected 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.990
 selection tool plus taking each 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.270
 letter press shift to go 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.520
 selecting each letter 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.860
 and you start coloring with a color 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:40.690
 let's say red like this 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.690
 the z control because we're going to do this 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.560
 sorry sorry I forgot a detail 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.630
 when selecting the tool 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.500
 of the brush will look like a kind 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.680
 of circle here you press 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.460
 paint selection and begin to grate what 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.170
 Yes now 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.030
 I do not like you just paint the area 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.170
 inside the letters because you 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.710
 you selected 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.940
 this is how the letters are 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.360
 perfect 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.000
 then here you do the same thing 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.440
 selecting with shift the fill of 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.400
 the letters and you start to give a color to 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.400
 each of the letters 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.500
 ok this is going to give a pretty effect 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.900
 caricaturesco the letters well let's 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.450
 do a little faster 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.690
 and select the fillings of each one 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.590
 here here here and here and now we are going to 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.700
 give it an effect like 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.700
 vertical no 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.550
 I would like to add a thicker brush 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.879
 to save time 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:08.120
 and there we go adding colors 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:10.010
 here like doing the last thing at the end I 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.380
 I think it would also be good to add 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.900
 the full color more however I 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.620
 here we are going to add the goal with the 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.620
 full color 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.930
 what are we going to color 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.280
 add the and so sssss and oil 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.860
 perfect 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.750
 but then let's remark a little 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.220
 more that they do not remain then targets almost 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.409
 so we will have a pretty good effect 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.769
 caricature 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.869
 we press efe 6 where we did not put a 

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:48.070
 keyframe is to say in all 

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:51.040
 white boxes 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.390
 and we're going to select everything with the 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.460
 Selection Tools 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.110
 logically we pick here 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.580
 and today is to close this 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:07.140
 ok here I am going to soften the one I place myself 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.240
 in the other he selected his notice twice 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.889
 1 2 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.889
 create a keyframe here 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.330
 softens once 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.820
 once here softened twice 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.360
 12 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.480
 I go to this and softened only one 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.480
 time 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.260
 once there is 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.600
 ok here he selected and softened one and two 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.910
 times 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.390
 now let's see the result of what 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.470
 we have been doing and what text 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.430
 we obtain 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.870
 a pretty striking text that I believe 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.639
 that will be useful if you want 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.669
 make comic strips 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.379
 comedies I do not know what you like me 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.240
 I think this text is going to serve you 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.789
 very dynamic both the fund and the 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.539
 outline so I think it's going to give you 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.099
 a good option 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.169
 you can also play with the background and that 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:12.310
 it's a few scratches 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.380
 and enjoy this 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:18.970
 what I mean from the good background here 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:21.010
 let's create 5 blank frames and 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.070
 the good background I mean you make a 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:26.120
 background as well as frame by frame 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.529
 here a f 7 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.649
 and I do not know here a 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:36.670
 with the small regional ones with the 

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:39.850
 brush like this and remember here to have normal 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.249
 and here about four regions that is a 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.269
 space 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:44.269
 those others here 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.439
 then here you leave a space that you create 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:53.899
 other how are we improving so believe me 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:58.180
 that is improving over time their 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:58.180
 animations then good 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:04.780
 here nothing else is a matter of you 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:07.729
 you add what are keyframes 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.030
 ching here is 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.780
 I forgot a detail 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.780
 this 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.060
 let's also add the same thing 

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.060
 we did in the other 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.570
 softened forgiveness to interpolation to 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.540
 save some interpolation we select 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:29.290
 everything and let's say a smoothing 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.290
 12 ok 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:40.210
 12 softened here about 23 warned and we 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.210
 there is a result more or less like this 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.070
 good is an idea of ​​how you can be 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.930
 your text with an outline just like you 

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.420
 you can add here a background I do not know of a 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.480
 colour 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:58.580
 or another one a color background 

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.580
 different for variable 

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.530
 and that's it 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.420
 so the text could not be but good 

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.220
 I leave it to your creativity 

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.160
 that would be all our doctoral I hope 

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.270
 I have served you 

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.270
 and see you
