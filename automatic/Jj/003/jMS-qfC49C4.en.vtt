00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
having a look at this scrolling which is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.010 
having a look at this scrolling which is
definitely<00:00:31.650> something<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:33.540> number<00:00:33.840> of

people have asked for let's have a look

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.290 
people have asked for let's have a look

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
at the list of video add-ons we're going

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.900 
at the list of video add-ons we're going
to<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.480> scrolling<00:00:48.809> through<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.289> list<00:00:49.910> is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to see scrolling through that list is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.000 
to see scrolling through that list is
nice<00:00:51.770> nice<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.800> fluid<00:00:54.020> it's<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.140> laggy<00:00:55.469> at

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
nice nice and fluid it's not laggy at

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.740 
nice nice and fluid it's not laggy at
all<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> made<00:01:02.550> sure<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.910> adjust<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.359> display

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
all so I made sure to adjust the display

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
all so I made sure to adjust the display
refresh<00:01:04.199> rate<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.769> match<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.159> video<00:01:05.430> there's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
refresh rate to match the video there's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
refresh rate to match the video there's
a<00:01:06.390> lot<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> people<00:01:06.900> asked<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.229> refresh<00:01:07.950> rate

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
a lot of people asked about refresh rate

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
a lot of people asked about refresh rate
switching<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.170> let's<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> look<00:01:10.830> at

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
switching so let's go have a look at

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.850 
switching so let's go have a look at
some<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> video<00:01:12.060> playback<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.530> I've<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
some of the video playback so I've got a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460 
some of the video playback so I've got a
USB<00:01:17.490> device<00:01:18.060> connected<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> whole

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
USB device connected here with a whole

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.640 
USB device connected here with a whole
bunch<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.860> samples<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> let's<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.320> look<00:01:22.409> at

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
bunch of samples so let's have a look at

00:01:22.650 --> 00:02:14.370 
bunch of samples so let's have a look at
a<00:01:22.680> 4k<00:01:24.170> h.264<00:01:25.170> file

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:26.949 

okay<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:20.390> let's<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.120> look<00:02:25.690> some<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.840> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
okay so let's have a look some of the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.680 
okay so let's have a look some of the
other<00:02:27.170> files<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:28.610> I<00:02:28.820> have<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.500> if<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.680> pick<00:02:30.980> a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
other files that I have so if we pick a

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.949 
other files that I have so if we pick a
24<00:02:32.690> framerate<00:02:33.970> video<00:02:34.970> so<00:02:35.300> this<00:02:35.450> is<00:02:35.570> Big<00:02:35.750> Buck

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
24 framerate video so this is Big Buck

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.920 
24 framerate video so this is Big Buck
Bunny<00:02:35.990> 24<00:02:36.860> frames<00:02:37.209> we<00:02:38.209> can<00:02:38.360> see<00:02:38.570> that<00:02:38.750> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
Bunny 24 frames we can see that the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.770 
Bunny 24 frames we can see that the
display<00:02:39.260> rate<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.650> correctly<00:02:40.040> switched<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.880> 24

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
display rate is correctly switched to 24

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.930 
display rate is correctly switched to 24
hurts<00:02:42.050> there<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:49.130> once<00:02:49.340> again<00:02:49.520> video

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
hurts there and once again video

00:02:49.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
hurts there and once again video
playback<00:02:50.300> is<00:02:50.660> really<00:02:51.020> smooth

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.500 

that's<00:03:11.890> not<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.250> say<00:03:12.460> that<00:03:12.730> all<00:03:12.910> files

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
that's not to say that all files

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.730 
that's not to say that all files
playback<00:03:14.080> nicely<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:14.710> if<00:03:14.770> we<00:03:14.860> look<00:03:15.040> at<00:03:15.480> h.265

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.010 

we<00:03:20.740> can<00:03:20.920> see<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:21.510> whilst<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:23.170> runs<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.810> is

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
we can see that whilst it runs it is

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.570 
we can see that whilst it runs it is
laggy<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:29.170> we<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.410> see<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.680> CPU<00:03:30.190> there<00:03:30.460> is

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
laggy and we can see the CPU there is

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.220 
laggy and we can see the CPU there is
high<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.000> it's<00:03:31.150> all<00:03:31.270> being<00:03:31.450> Dakota<00:03:31.840> device

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
high so it's all being Dakota device

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:42.200 
high so it's all being Dakota device
software<00:03:33.690> we've<00:03:34.690> got<00:03:34.810> some<00:03:35.050> audio<00:03:35.680> break<00:03:36.040> up

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.370 

so<00:03:43.210> a<00:03:43.240> number<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.750> people<00:03:43.870> will<00:03:44.140> be<00:03:44.230> interested

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
so a number of people will be interested

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.630 
so a number of people will be interested
in<00:03:44.950> whether<00:03:45.160> or<00:03:45.370> not<00:03:45.460> it'll<00:03:46.000> handle<00:03:46.450> 3d<00:03:47.140> videos

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
in whether or not it'll handle 3d videos

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.260 
in whether or not it'll handle 3d videos
so<00:03:48.640> if<00:03:49.570> we<00:03:50.050> have<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> look<00:03:50.710> here<00:03:51.040> I've<00:03:51.310> got<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> big

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
so if we have a look here I've got a big

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:00.510 
so if we have a look here I've got a big
buck<00:03:52.450> bunny<00:03:52.480> at<00:03:52.900> above<00:03:53.140> below<00:03:53.500> 3d<00:03:53.920> format<00:03:59.520> so

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
buck bunny at above below 3d format so

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.730 
buck bunny at above below 3d format so
you<00:04:00.550> can<00:04:00.790> see<00:04:01.000> here<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.270> there's<00:04:01.690> no<00:04:01.840> no

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
you can see here that there's no no

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.839 
you can see here that there's no no
issue<00:04:03.040> decoding<00:04:03.790> it

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.490 

and<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:08.940> video<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.270> nice<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.900> smooth<00:04:10.230> there

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
and the video is nice and smooth there

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.850 
and the video is nice and smooth there
and<00:04:10.739> clearly<00:04:10.950> being<00:04:11.190> decoded<00:04:11.520> by<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.709> GPU<00:04:13.709> on

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
and clearly being decoded by the GPU on

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.680 
and clearly being decoded by the GPU on
the<00:04:13.980> unit<00:04:20.000> so<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.030> concludes<00:04:21.329> my

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
the unit so that concludes my
