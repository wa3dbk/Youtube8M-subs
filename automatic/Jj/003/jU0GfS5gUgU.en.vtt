most<00:00:30.130> importantly<00:00:30.759> is<00:00:31.000> it<00:00:31.329> going<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.779> break

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
most importantly is it going to break

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:41.610 
most importantly is it going to break
down<00:00:37.470> but<00:00:38.470> do<00:00:38.680> you<00:00:38.830> really<00:00:39.010> need<00:00:39.370> a<00:00:39.610> 4x4<00:00:40.360> if<00:00:41.320> you

down but do you really need a 4x4 if you

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.920 
down but do you really need a 4x4 if you
live<00:00:41.770> in<00:00:41.800> sticks<00:00:42.250> or<00:00:42.580> regularly<00:00:43.330> tow<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.630> horse

Santa<00:00:47.110> Fe<00:00:47.140> would<00:00:47.770> be<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:47.950> good<00:00:48.100> choice<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.570> if

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
Santa Fe would be a good choice but if

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.500 
Santa Fe would be a good choice but if
most<00:00:50.440> of<00:00:50.620> your<00:00:50.680> driving<00:00:50.980> is<00:00:51.190> around<00:00:51.400> town<00:00:51.730> this

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
most of your driving is around town this

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.750 
most of your driving is around town this
too<00:00:52.780> will<00:00:52.930> drive<00:00:53.200> Ford<00:00:53.530> Kuga<00:00:53.980> has<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.520> same

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
too will drive Ford Kuga has the same

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.340 
too will drive Ford Kuga has the same
higher<00:00:54.970> driving<00:00:55.360> position<00:00:55.810> but<00:00:56.140> it's<00:00:56.260> a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
higher driving position but it's a

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
higher driving position but it's a
cheaper<00:00:56.710> alternative

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.740

survey of car reliability and we found
the<00:02:32.290> four<00:02:32.500> by<00:02:32.650> fours<00:02:32.920> are<00:02:33.160> usually<00:02:33.610> among<00:02:33.970> the

worst offenders for breakdowns and
