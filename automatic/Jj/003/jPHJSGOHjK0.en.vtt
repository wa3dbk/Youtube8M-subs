00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.830
 an important early diagnosis for 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.400
 any illness because it allows 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.290
 carry out faster treatments and 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.549
 avoid complications or or 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.010
 even facilitate a healing 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.050
 faster or guarantee a survival 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.529
 longer in the case of diseases 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.939
 more serious 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.779
 this also applies certainly to the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.750
 chronic inflammatory diseases 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.599
 intestinal diseases of which today May 11 yes 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.920
 celebrates the world day here in Rome 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.109
 and we have the opportunity to talk with 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 doctor alessandro armuzzi responsible 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.230
 of the diagnostic operating unit e 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.329
 therapy of these pathologies 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.790
 some that are then crohn and la 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 fundamentally network ulcerative colitis 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.719
 of the Columbus integrated complex 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 of the Catholic university 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.710
 the music speaker with his help we would like 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.680
 so let's understand what the signs are i 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.399
 symptoms that should make you light up 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.230
 light bulb alarm a person so 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.879
 such as to induce him to undergo then 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.680
 diagnosis and checks to see if then 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.600
 actually has one of these two 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.039
 pathologies we mentioned here is there 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.809
 a common symptomatology or are 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.850
 quite different but there are gods 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.439
 overlapping symptoms being 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.250
 affecting inflammatory diseases 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.100
 the gut 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.439
 but if we think of ulcerative colitis la 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.689
 first thing that a patient feels 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.700
 at the time of onset of symptoms and 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.799
 diarrhea with blood while for chrome 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 the symptomatology can be much more 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.000
 nuanced and the delay of the years can be 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.439
 also be much heavier than 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.630
 to that of ulcerative colitis 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.829
 but let's see them separately let's start 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.350
 from the hill you've already told us 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.270
 a little something what happens 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.880
 the first symptoms are precisely the first signs 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.950
 that the indy the patient of the hills there 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.130
 vast majority of the beginnings of 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.479
 direct disease with sweets and rose is 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.880
 rectal bleeding accompanied by 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.299
 diarrhea that scares the patient 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.700
 take it to the doctor and then the colonoscopy 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.329
 to the exam that 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.320
 and hinge that allows to make diagnosis 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.590
 for what concerns the reception 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.659
 error is a diarrhea and a fact so 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.939
 frequent that lasts as many days as you do 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.200
 presents certainly not are diseases 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.880
 chronic inflammatory therefore not 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.799
 so let's talk about the skin area but yes 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.769
 presents and how to present in a way 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.290
 sneaky with 12 discharge a day sometimes 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.910
 in a sudden and more and more severe way 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.910
 with a lot more discharge per day but it is 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.849
 just the blood light that causes the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.330
 patient run to the doctor to be able 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.880
 ask for exams to get there 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.110
 precisely formulate what is assumed 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.030
 from many diagnostic views 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.970
 here are the tests for colitis 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.709
 Ulcerative beyond blood tests 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.180
 municipalities that are common to both 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.930
 fairly common diseases and the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.000
 colonoscopy 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.980
 the exam is fundamental that allows 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.380
 together with histological examination to do 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.690
 ulcerative colitis and therefore diagnosis 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.489
 a certain examination of the rai eto or is there or not 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.920
 there is the pathology 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.910
 let's go to the crohn here instead 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.280
 situation in point it to 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.720
 symptomatology as the chrono is presented 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.370
 it is much more varied 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.280
 first because the localizations of 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.829
 diseases can be various 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.930
 the sometimes blurred symptoms can 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.450
 overlapping is often similar to that of 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.220
 an irritable colon so diarrhea mal 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.540
 of belly are fairly common symptoms 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.670
 in the general population 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.709
 and clear that then when to this diarrhea 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.340
 repeated stomach ache accompanies you 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.680
 maybe a weight loss at low temperature 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.430
 prolonged sense of asthenia these are 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.980
 the first let's say first signs 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.359
 symptoms that the patient must carry 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.370
 go to your doctor 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:32.349
 and still ask for a series of exams 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.629
 of various types that can help you do 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.459
 this kind of years that is often one 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.989
 more delayed diagnosis than that 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.969
 of the patient with ulcerative colitis 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.280
 because a more complex pathology is one 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.900
 complex pathology so here it is tests 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.670
 lecce has already said that there are many such 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.049
 they are essentially looking at the exams 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.950
 also here for the patient with illness 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.230
 of crohn 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.389
 you can start with the common exams of 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.879
 blood as I said before for colitis 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.159
 ulcer that can show one 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.540
 an anemia a iron deficiency anemia a 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.700
 increase in inflammation markers 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.189
 systemic but then are the exams 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.109
 instrumental that lead to making diagnosis e 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.359
 ultrasound of intestinal loops in 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.200
 exam that can be used in first 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.430
 instance is not invasive does not involve 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.889
 radiation and therefore in fact hands 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.560
 expert help then anyway 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.470
 locate locate the diseased area 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.690
 inflammation is inflamed in the patient who 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.639
 reports these sites but it is always the 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.400
 colonoscopy also in this case that 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.530
 allows in most cases of 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.650
 reach see visions do i 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.199
 biopsy samples which then confirm or 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.000
 minus the definitive diagnosis of this 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.289
 type of patient 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.419
 so here is what the 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.889
 message for patients but also e 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.539
 especially for the family doctor of 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.280
 face these situations properly 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:50.320
 behave in front of a symptomatology 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.240
 repeated increasing 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.890
 do not always confuse with a possible one 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.610
 functional pathology such as the colon 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:04.510
 irritable but try to identify 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.430
 first with non-invasive methods that 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.860
 type of patient who must then proceed 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.390
 to invasive instrumental examinations that are 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.860
 fundamental just to make diagnosis of 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.770
 crohn's disease and why it is important 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.750
 quickly identify as soon as possible 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.550
 possible these two diseases but why 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.010
 are diseases that progress in 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.710
 time and more the intervention is early with i 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.720
 necessary drugs and before you can 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.580
 contain the symptoms to try to 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.980
 slow down the progression towards the 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.600
 chronicity of injuries also that is 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.760
 characteristic especially in the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.510
 Crohn's disease and characteristic 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.160
 precisely in progressing over the years towards 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.460
 a very high risk of intervention 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.460
 surgical
