they come looking for anything they can

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.910 
they come looking for anything they can
find<00:00:21.660> when<00:00:22.080> they're<00:00:22.260> starving

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920

find when they're starving
including<00:00:23.760> your<00:00:23.939> Abba<00:00:24.150> biting<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.930> makes

sense<00:00:25.470> we<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.830> seen<00:00:26.070> deer<00:00:26.400> before<00:00:26.609> yeah<00:00:27.029> it's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
sense we have seen deer before yeah it's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.970 
sense we have seen deer before yeah it's
such<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.720> surprising<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.619> has<00:00:28.769> never

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
such a surprising that this has never

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.710 
such a surprising that this has never
happened<00:00:29.099> before<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.970> six<00:00:30.210> winners<00:00:30.420> that

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
happened before and the six winners that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.450 
happened before and the six winners that
we're<00:00:30.929> finding<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.859> depend<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
we're finding it can depend on the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.490 
we're finding it can depend on the
amount<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.850> snow<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.450> depend<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> deer

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
amount of snow it can depend on the deer

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
amount of snow it can depend on the deer
density<00:00:35.070> sometimes<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.000> move<00:00:36.300> into<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
density sometimes they just move into a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.810 
density sometimes they just move into a
certain<00:00:37.050> area<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.920> what<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.280> gonna<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.670> is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
certain area but what we're gonna do is

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.760 
certain area but what we're gonna do is
we're<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> put<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.570> deer<00:00:40.079> netting<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
we're going to put up deer netting and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.709 
we're going to put up deer netting and
that's<00:00:41.250> physically<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> keep<00:00:42.480> them

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that's physically going to keep them

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.840 
that's physically going to keep them
from<00:00:42.960> getting<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.590> tree<00:00:43.860> okay<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.250> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
from getting to your tree okay so is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
from getting to your tree okay so is
that<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.989> look<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.230> construction<00:00:46.829> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
that going to look like construction so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.400 
that going to look like construction so
it<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> permanent<00:00:48.079> obstruction<00:00:49.079> no

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it is not a permanent obstruction no

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.869 
it is not a permanent obstruction no
it's<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> look<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.219> bad

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
it's not going to look that bad

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.389 
it's not going to look that bad
and<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.660> seasonal<00:00:52.260> from<00:00:52.649> December<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.219> April

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and it's seasonal from December to April

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.639 
and it's seasonal from December to April
every<00:00:54.270> year<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.719> keep<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:55.110> away<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
every year to keep them away from the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.729 
every year to keep them away from the
tree<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:56.489> before<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.570> look<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.590> this

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
tree now before we do that look at this

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
tree now before we do that look at this
tree<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.250> looks<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.609> nice<00:00:59.910> and<00:00:59.969> healthy<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
tree it looks so nice and healthy on the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.200 
tree it looks so nice and healthy on the
top<00:01:01.079> yes<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> look<00:01:02.010> how<00:01:02.190> chewed<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.030> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
down here left on its own this is just

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.490 
down here left on its own this is just
going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> keep<00:01:06.240> growing<00:01:06.510> out<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.229> bottom

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
going to keep growing out in the bottom

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560 
going to keep growing out in the bottom
will<00:01:07.770> never<00:01:08.010> catch<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.060> tree<00:01:09.330> will

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
will never catch up and the tree will

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.690 
will never catch up and the tree will
not<00:01:09.780> look<00:01:10.020> great<00:01:10.290> what<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.830> want<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.520> come

in<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:11.850> some<00:01:12.150> hand<00:01:12.450> pruners<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> cut<00:01:13.350> back

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
in with some hand pruners and cut back

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.560 
in with some hand pruners and cut back
the<00:01:13.920> top<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> tree<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.700> slow<00:01:15.150> down<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the top of the tree and slow down that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.780 
the top of the tree and slow down that
growth<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> let<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.740> bottom<00:01:17.100> catch<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.610> with

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
growth and let the bottom catch up with

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.940 
growth and let the bottom catch up with
it

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.140 
it
now<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.220> again<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.460> want<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> remember

now here again I want you to remember

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
now here again I want you to remember
that<00:01:21.330> pruning<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.290> getting<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> haircut

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that pruning is like getting a haircut

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.820 
that pruning is like getting a haircut
if<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.450> badly<00:01:24.659> sooner<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.380> later<00:01:25.530> it'll

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
if you do it badly sooner or later it'll

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.039 
if you do it badly sooner or later it'll
grow<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.630> wouldn't<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:29.780> now<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> other

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
grow out I wouldn't know now the other

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
grow out I wouldn't know now the other
thing<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.320> remember<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.460> shady

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
thing to remember that this is the shady

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.580 
thing to remember that this is the shady
side<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> tree<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.350> usually

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
side of the tree right so I usually

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
side of the tree right so I usually
prune<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.430> lighter<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> shady<00:01:36.180> side

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
prune a little lighter on the shady side

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.760 
prune a little lighter on the shady side
of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.689> tree<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.350> not<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
of the tree because it's not going to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.410 
of the tree because it's not going to
get<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.159> much<00:01:38.310> Sun<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.820> gonna<00:01:39.060> grow<00:01:39.240> as

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
get as much Sun it's not gonna grow as
