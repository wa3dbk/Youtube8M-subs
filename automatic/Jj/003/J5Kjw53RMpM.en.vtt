went on for way too long I kept talking
loss<00:00:12.870> firing<00:00:13.259> guns<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.769> can<00:00:13.980> pair<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.870> so

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
loss firing guns so you can pair it so

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.010 
loss firing guns so you can pair it so
I'll<00:00:16.080> try<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.320> again<00:00:17.840> here's<00:00:18.840> all<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I'll try it again here's all the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.070 
I'll try it again here's all the
different<00:00:19.289> guns<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.369> menu<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:21.080> plus

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
different guns in the menu here plus

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560 
different guns in the menu here plus
actually<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.890> more<00:00:23.130> because<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.180> can't<00:00:24.390> fit

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
actually one more because I can't fit

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.550 
actually one more because I can't fit
them<00:00:24.660> all<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.949> nine<00:00:26.099> slots<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.910> I

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
them all in in the nine slots which I

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.330 
them all in in the nine slots which I
find<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.000> bit<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> an<00:00:30.179> accomplishment<00:00:31.340> so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
find to be a bit of an accomplishment so

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.049 
find to be a bit of an accomplishment so
first<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> AK<00:00:33.239> good<00:00:33.899> all-around<00:00:34.170> gun<00:00:35.059> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
first is the AK good all-around gun and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.170 
first is the AK good all-around gun and
fire<00:00:36.329> rate<00:00:36.600> good<00:00:36.809> accuracy<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.640> damage<00:00:41.180> mp5

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
fire rate good accuracy the damage mp5

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.229 
fire rate good accuracy the damage mp5
is<00:00:42.620> fairly<00:00:43.620> similar<00:00:45.980> it's<00:00:46.980> got<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> those

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
is fairly similar it's got one of those

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.220 
is fairly similar it's got one of those
so<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.629> easy<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.590> aim<00:00:50.430> accurately<00:00:51.050> okay<00:00:52.050> less

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so it's easy to aim accurately okay less

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.479 
so it's easy to aim accurately okay less
accuracy<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.949> bit<00:00:53.370> less<00:00:53.489> damage<00:00:55.160> sniper<00:00:56.160> rifles

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
accuracy a bit less damage sniper rifles

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.260 
accuracy a bit less damage sniper rifles
pretty<00:00:56.670> good<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.780> bullets<00:00:58.079> fire<00:00:58.260> fast<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
pretty good it the bullets fire fast so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.000 
pretty good it the bullets fire fast so
far<00:01:00.270> away<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:01.289> perfectly<00:01:01.770> accurate

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
far away and it's perfectly accurate

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.030 
far away and it's perfectly accurate
when<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.579> zoomed<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.619> gotta<00:01:04.619> stop<00:01:04.799> talking

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
when it's zoomed in I gotta stop talking

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.270 
when it's zoomed in I gotta stop talking
one<00:01:05.159> fired<00:01:06.590> but<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.710> perfectly<00:01:08.070> accurate

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
one fired but it's perfectly accurate

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.450 
one fired but it's perfectly accurate
when<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.880> zoomed<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.320> losses<00:01:10.320> accuracy<00:01:10.860> when

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
when it zoomed in losses accuracy when

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.170 
when it zoomed in losses accuracy when
it's<00:01:11.610> something<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.909> tho<00:01:12.710> much<00:01:13.939> but<00:01:14.939> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it's something out tho much but you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.710 
it's something out tho much but you
won't<00:01:15.360> be<00:01:15.450> able<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.780> snipe<00:01:16.140> stuff<00:01:17.570> from<00:01:18.570> this

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
won't be able to snipe stuff from this

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.600 
won't be able to snipe stuff from this
far<00:01:18.930> away<00:01:21.140> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.380> between<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> new

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
far away kind of in between is the new

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.450 
far away kind of in between is the new
SGU<00:01:23.790> 552<00:01:25.070> it's<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> zoom<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:27.030> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.470 

but<00:01:30.460> it's<00:01:30.580> also<00:01:30.730> no<00:01:30.970> faster<00:01:31.420> firing<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.270> it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
but it's also no faster firing and it

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.570 
but it's also no faster firing and it
has<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.720> same<00:01:34.900> accuracy<00:01:35.230> whether<00:01:36.040> you<00:01:36.250> did<00:01:36.520> or

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
has the same accuracy whether you did or

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.830 
has the same accuracy whether you did or
not<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.970> bit<00:01:37.210> more<00:01:37.360> accurate<00:01:37.840> than<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.080> AK<00:01:39.840> this

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
not a bit more accurate than the AK this

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.330 
not a bit more accurate than the AK this
one<00:01:41.140> is<00:01:41.410> the<00:01:41.890> newest<00:01:42.130> gun<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.540> Gatling<00:01:43.870> gun<00:01:44.340> it

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
one is the newest gun the Gatling gun it

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.470 
one is the newest gun the Gatling gun it
fires<00:01:45.970> 20<00:01:46.390> shots<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.720> second<00:01:48.360> fairly<00:01:49.360> low

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
fires 20 shots a second fairly low

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.090 
fires 20 shots a second fairly low
damage<00:01:49.690> which<00:01:50.260> doesn't<00:01:50.680> matter<00:01:50.830> at<00:01:50.980> all

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
damage which doesn't matter at all

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.850 
damage which doesn't matter at all
because<00:01:51.310> you're<00:01:51.580> firing<00:01:51.760> 20<00:01:52.030> shots<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.360> second

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
because you're firing 20 shots a second

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.440 
because you're firing 20 shots a second
but<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.950> has<00:01:54.100> horrible<00:01:54.460> accuracy<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.150> recoil

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
but it has horrible accuracy in recoil

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:04.160 
but it has horrible accuracy in recoil
unless<00:01:55.750> you're<00:01:55.930> ducking<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.350> staying<00:01:56.620> still

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.130 

but<00:02:05.170> when<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.440> are<00:02:05.650> it's<00:02:05.890> incredibly<00:02:06.700> deadly

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
but when you are it's incredibly deadly

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.390 
but when you are it's incredibly deadly
let's<00:02:08.140> see<00:02:08.320> if<00:02:08.380> you're<00:02:08.500> running<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:12.220> get

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
let's see if you're running we get

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.210 
let's see if you're running we get
horrible<00:02:13.360> accuracy<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:13.990> recoil<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.680> you

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
horrible accuracy in recoil and you

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.460 
horrible accuracy in recoil and you
ready<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.520> handle<00:02:15.760> very<00:02:16.000> quickly<00:02:16.240> oh<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:17.320> if

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
ready to handle very quickly oh and if

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.680 
ready to handle very quickly oh and if
you<00:02:17.560> didn't<00:02:18.310> notice<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.760> has<00:02:18.790> no<00:02:19.150> reload<00:02:19.450> time

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
you didn't notice it has no reload time

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.710 
you didn't notice it has no reload time
so<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.800> can<00:02:20.860> go<00:02:21.040> through<00:02:21.370> as<00:02:22.090> many<00:02:22.300> bullets<00:02:22.630> as

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
so you can go through as many bullets as

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.400 
so you can go through as many bullets as
you<00:02:22.840> want<00:02:23.280> I've<00:02:24.280> been<00:02:24.400> able<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.910> go<00:02:25.000> through

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
you want I've been able to go through

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.030 
you want I've been able to go through
eleven<00:02:26.410> hundred<00:02:26.560> bullets<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.280> 56<00:02:27.880> seconds

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
eleven hundred bullets and 56 seconds

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.180 
eleven hundred bullets and 56 seconds
without<00:02:30.040> one<00:02:30.370> we<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.420> shotgun<00:02:32.190> in

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
without one we have the shotgun in

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.380 
without one we have the shotgun in

is what the flamethrower fires door and
you<00:04:09.460> also<00:04:09.640> place<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.210> down<00:04:10.390> on<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.570> ground

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
you also place it down on the ground

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.070 
you also place it down on the ground
like<00:04:10.900> this<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.700> when<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.450> light<00:04:13.630> it<00:04:13.660> up<00:04:13.840> it

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
like this and when you light it up it

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.130 
like this and when you light it up it
lights<00:04:14.740> 10<00:04:15.550> times<00:04:15.760> faster<00:04:16.180> than<00:04:16.209> anything

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
lights 10 times faster than anything

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
else that never burns out so you can

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.210

make<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.630> field<00:04:19.900> of<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.200> light<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.770> up<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.100> it'll

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
make a field of it light it up and it'll

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.280 
make a field of it light it up and it'll
be<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.370> good<00:04:21.549> trap<00:04:21.850> for<00:04:22.210> catching<00:04:22.840> somebody<00:04:22.990> or

some of these let me give my parachute

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:03.519 
some of these let me give my parachute
here<00:04:53.800> get<00:04:54.800> away<00:04:59.110> so<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.199> new<00:05:00.319> blows<00:05:00.620> up<00:05:02.529> five

here get away so the new blows up five

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.300 
here get away so the new blows up five
times<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:04.189> area<00:05:04.870> twice<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.050> radius<00:05:06.310> what
