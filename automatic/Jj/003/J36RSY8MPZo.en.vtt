00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.740
There are three main principles in Aikido
that you're going to come across a lot in

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.740
the Dojo.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.210
That's to blend, extend, and to lead your
partner.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.590
Aikido literally translates to the way of
harmonizing energy.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.040
That's not just a pretty name.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.850
That really comes across in how we interact
with each other and how we practice the martial

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.400
art in general.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.740
In order to think about blending, extending,
and leading let's take a look here.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.940
We're going to start with Gyaku Hanmi Katate
Dori, wrist grab.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.590
Again, the idea of blending is that I don't
want to fight directly along my partner's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.590
line of strength.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.190
If he's grabbing here my first reaction is
generally to either push or to pull away from

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.190
that.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.280
I don't want to fight directly with his line.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.260
So, what I'm going to do is, as his energy
is coming in this direction, I'm going to

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.910
blend and allow it to continue in that direction
so I don't end up fighting with it.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.520
As he's coming in this direction, Tenkan,
move out of the way of the line of his attack,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.410
and I should be able to put myself in a safer
position.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.580
Again, as his energy is coming down this direction,
step off the line of attack, and let the energy

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.980
continue to move.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.190
I should be in a better position.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.740
Blending is also considered a way of leading
my partner.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.600
I don't want to get in this position and pull.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.140
I don't want to contract.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.030
If we get in this position, extend to lead
my partner around.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.990
Blend, lead.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.300
Another way we can see this is in Morote Dori,
a two handed grab.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.740
In order, again, to not fight directly with
his power I want to find a way to point my

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.810
extension in the direction he's going.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.670
I can use that same body movement to extend,
blend, and lead my partner around.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.400
I cannot do this if I collapse.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:15.080
So, blend in the direction of his power, extend
to keep that shape, and lead your partner.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.050
Blend, extend, and lead.
