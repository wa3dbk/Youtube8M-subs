00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:15.190
 the burning is burning all good we're going to 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:17.590
 do mapuches put to your no pain is what 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.800
 which was the one used here in water from 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.580
 preference and we're going to cut it pretty 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.470
 vegetable of chayote and the vegetables that 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.240
 they are the ones that have the least with a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.250
 little less because if they are not going to stay 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.100
 with much chayote the vegetables that less 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.440
 have this obviously caloric contribution 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.440
 like they are the chayote that has a lot 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.899
 water and pumpkin and a mushroom that 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.429
 gives a lot after doing this 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.699
 we are going to put a little bit of 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:48.819
 egg to fish and the key to 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.530
 that gives us a lot of fat at the time of 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:58.210
 Fry them is that the oil is well 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:01:00.999
 hot but if it is not for breading it is 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.949
 what I am going to remember please the 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.690
 ingredients still very easy are 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.030
 about three cans of tuna 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.170
 we are going to use mushrooms in 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.640
 squares 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.320
 to the base in squares chayote in 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.030
 squares an egg and oats for 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.700
 obviously bathe very hot oil 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.280
 and some salt if you like to put 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.960
 and for the sauce is 5 tomatoes and consumes 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.490
 tomato is very easy and simple 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.530
 let's make a little ball that is very 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.250
 easy to make it as a meatball as a 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.189
 meatball and then you just leave it like that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.180
 and easily put it in the oil very 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.950
 hot 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.049
 You see the oil a little bit 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.030
 used because we already made some rods 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.149
 have the lists look at how easy it is 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.060
 grab it the tuna catch with the vegetables 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.549
 and unites especially for the egg as a 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.259
 little ball is like a meatball and the truth 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.659
 yes I loved it I did not know that 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.030
 really being very hot already the 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.500
 oil does not impregnate so much in the I think 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.979
 that in fact it's not going to have that much 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.490
 do you know it or is it ever penetrates 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.490
 the oil and it's still really super 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.140
 super this low in calories and very good 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.759
 to take care of all the food 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.769
 encouragement and silvia for how many people 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.640
 for how many people would this recipe be 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.710
 static 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.710
 for a family of five positions 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.630
 for one person 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.310
 three beautiful you have to feel 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.310
 satisfied but good 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.020
 it was hot 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:05.520
 and also the truth seems to me 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.580
 enough because it has the contribution of 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.209
 vegetable vegetable the contribution of oats 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:19.160
 and the area is a very complete reality and 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.160
 besides the mother that today 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.959
 my lady how she also likes tuna 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.959
 so lying in shorts 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.800
 vegetarian ceviche invented
