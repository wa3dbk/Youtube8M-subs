00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.649 

you

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.080 

and<00:01:32.020> it's<00:01:32.680> just<00:01:32.799> when<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.490> was<00:01:33.640> writing<00:01:33.789> a<00:01:33.909> song

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
and it's just when I was writing a song

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.270 
and it's just when I was writing a song
I<00:01:34.240> was<00:01:34.360> kind<00:01:34.570> of<00:01:34.630> trying<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.960> create<00:01:35.350> this<00:01:35.590> nice

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
I was kind of trying to create this nice

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.440 
I was kind of trying to create this nice
big<00:01:36.520> rock<00:01:36.880> vibe<00:01:37.649> with<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.850> got<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.030> little<00:01:40.299> bit

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
big rock vibe with it's got a little bit

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.700 
big rock vibe with it's got a little bit
of<00:01:40.539> counterpoint<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.200> which<00:01:41.350> I<00:01:41.470> talked

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
of counterpoint in it which I talked

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.880 
of counterpoint in it which I talked
about<00:01:41.770> earlier<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:43.030> basically<00:01:43.960> one<00:01:44.560> guitar

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
about earlier and basically one guitar

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.380 
about earlier and basically one guitar
is<00:01:45.039> going<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.220> be<00:01:45.310> moving

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.380 

very<00:01:51.390> simple<00:01:51.780> doing<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.860> 1<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> 5<00:01:54.090> chord

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
very simple doing a 1 to a 5 chord

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.639 
very simple doing a 1 to a 5 chord
progression<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.930> higher<00:01:55.079> one<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.500> going

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
progression and the higher one is going

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.170 
progression and the higher one is going
to<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.770> moving<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.490> voice<00:01:56.700> while<00:01:57.000> that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
to be moving down one voice while that

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.500 
to be moving down one voice while that
moves<00:01:57.390> up

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:12.740 

I<00:02:03.830> play<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.070> really

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.600 

creates<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.710> nice<00:02:13.890> dissonance<00:02:14.490> and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
creates this nice dissonance and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.970 
creates this nice dissonance and
resolution<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:16.170> I'm<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.380> second<00:02:16.710> time<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
resolution and I'm the second time that

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.030 
resolution and I'm the second time that
passes<00:02:17.400> through<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.360> rhythm<00:02:18.480> guitar

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.009 

goes<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.849> that<00:02:25.970> third<00:02:26.209> fret<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.629> gives<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:26.989> a

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
goes to that third fret and gives like a

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.860 
goes to that third fret and gives like a
pre<00:02:27.349> resolution<00:02:27.980> all<00:02:28.909> the<00:02:29.120> while<00:02:29.239> continuing

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
pre resolution all the while continuing

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.380 
pre resolution all the while continuing
to<00:02:29.900> this<00:02:30.290> droney<00:02:30.829> octaves<00:02:31.310> below<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.849> then

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
to this droney octaves below it and then

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:42.069 
to this droney octaves below it and then
we're<00:02:32.540> gonna<00:02:32.659> go<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.349> second<00:02:33.680> riff<00:02:41.079> it's

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
we're gonna go to the second riff it's

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.809 
we're gonna go to the second riff it's
kind<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.379> cool<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:42.680> melodic<00:02:43.159> motif<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.760> I

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
kind of cool little melodic motif that I

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.910 
kind of cool little melodic motif that I
came<00:02:44.030> up<00:02:44.180> with<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.349> singer<00:02:45.650> John

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
came up with that the singer John

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920 
came up with that the singer John
actually<00:02:46.340> used<00:02:46.579> in<00:02:46.970> his<00:02:47.299> vocal<00:02:47.629> pattern

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
actually used in his vocal pattern

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.660 
actually used in his vocal pattern
whenever<00:02:48.829> he<00:02:48.950> was<00:02:49.069> gonna<00:02:49.159> start<00:02:49.430> actually

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
whenever he was gonna start actually

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.319 
whenever he was gonna start actually

used that melody as an example for his

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.339 
used that melody as an example for his
vocal<00:02:55.640> line<00:02:55.819> it<00:02:56.750> worked<00:02:56.930> out<00:02:57.049> really<00:02:57.260> really

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
vocal line it worked out really really

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:58.990 
vocal line it worked out really really
well<00:02:57.709> especially<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.489> way<00:02:58.579> he<00:02:58.609> fit<00:02:58.909> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
well especially the way he fit the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.630 
well especially the way he fit the
lyrics<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.049> I'll<00:03:00.319> show<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:00.769> that<00:03:01.129> whole

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
lyrics to it so I'll show you that whole

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:15.510 
lyrics to it so I'll show you that whole
little<00:03:01.849> pattern<00:03:02.120> there

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.230 

so<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:16.610> kind<00:03:16.820> of<00:03:16.850> have<00:03:17.000> this<00:03:17.120> tiny<00:03:17.690> motif<00:03:19.240> and

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
so you kind of have this tiny motif and

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.710 
so you kind of have this tiny motif and
you<00:03:20.300> expand<00:03:20.660> upon<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.050> for<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.230> second<00:03:21.530> time

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.890 

then<00:03:26.720> from<00:03:26.990> there<00:03:27.200> we<00:03:27.680> go<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.900> modulation

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
then from there we go to a modulation

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.530 
then from there we go to a modulation
which<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.650> key<00:03:31.340> change<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:32.240> where<00:03:32.420> the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
which is a key change and where the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.930 
which is a key change and where the
beginning<00:03:32.690> octave<00:03:33.500> riff<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.490> riff<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:34.760> just

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
beginning octave riff the riff is just

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
beginning octave riff the riff is just
transposed<00:03:35.450> up<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:36.050> whole<00:03:36.320> step<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:37.430> step<00:03:37.960> and

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
transposed up a whole step to step and

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:48.540 
transposed up a whole step to step and
played<00:03:39.500> exactly<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.400> same

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.770 

this<00:03:49.550> time<00:03:49.730> when<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:49.940> ends<00:03:50.480> there's<00:03:50.720> a

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
this time when it ends there's a

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.090 
this time when it ends there's a
counterpoint<00:03:51.319> thing<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.620> happens<00:03:51.950> where

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
counterpoint thing that happens where

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.540 
counterpoint thing that happens where
one<00:03:52.250> guitar

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.100 

slides<00:03:56.240> up<00:03:56.450> while<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.780> other<00:03:56.870> one<00:03:56.990> goes<00:03:57.110> down

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
slides up while the other one goes down

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.590 
slides up while the other one goes down
if<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.710> get<00:03:59.860> this<00:03:59.980> sound

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
if you get this sound

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.400 
if you get this sound
you

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.500 

nice<00:04:08.100> little<00:04:08.280> -<00:04:08.670> third<00:04:08.820> at<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.000> end<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.300> kind

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
nice little - third at the end the kind

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.270 
nice little - third at the end the kind
of<00:04:09.570> stands<00:04:09.750> out<00:04:09.930> because<00:04:10.020> one<00:04:10.770> cool<00:04:10.950> thing<00:04:11.160> is

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
of stands out because one cool thing is

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.830 
of stands out because one cool thing is
there<00:04:11.460> hasn't<00:04:11.640> been<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:11.970> harmony<00:04:12.420> up<00:04:12.540> until

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
there hasn't been a harmony up until

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.060 
there hasn't been a harmony up until
then<00:04:13.020> and<00:04:13.290> then<00:04:13.380> when<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.590> get<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.740> that<00:04:13.830> point

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
then and then when you get to that point

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.470 
then and then when you get to that point
you<00:04:14.220> have<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.400> harmony<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.000> kind<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.180> jumps

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
you have a harmony so it kind of jumps

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.050 
you have a harmony so it kind of jumps
out<00:04:15.600> at<00:04:15.750> you<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.020> your<00:04:16.200> ears<00:04:16.920> hear<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
out at you and your ears hear it and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.030 
out at you and your ears hear it and
then<00:04:18.180> we<00:04:18.270> come<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.630> we<00:04:19.260> technically<00:04:19.739> called

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
then we come to a we technically called

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:35.440 
then we come to a we technically called
the<00:04:20.160> chorus

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.480 

and<00:04:36.450> I<00:04:36.570> can't<00:04:36.810> quite<00:04:37.620> remember<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:38.040> we<00:04:38.160> had<00:04:38.340> the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
and I can't quite remember if we had the

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.810 
and I can't quite remember if we had the
guitar<00:04:38.910> rhythm<00:04:39.540> first<00:04:39.930> or<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.260> drum<00:04:40.820> part

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
guitar rhythm first or the drum part

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.000 
guitar rhythm first or the drum part
first<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.870> think<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.320> actually<00:04:43.500> had<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:43.980> a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
first I think I actually had like a

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.160 
first I think I actually had like a
variation<00:04:44.610> in<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:44.790> riff<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:45.240> Ryan<00:04:45.750> put<00:04:46.050> like

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
variation in that riff and Ryan put like

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.640 
variation in that riff and Ryan put like
a<00:04:46.200> really<00:04:46.650> cool<00:04:46.830> you<00:04:47.490> know<00:04:47.580> snare<00:04:47.910> pattern

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
a really cool you know snare pattern

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.570 
a really cool you know snare pattern
syncopated<00:04:49.650> drum<00:04:49.890> beat<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.460> we<00:04:50.550> ended

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
syncopated drum beat to it and we ended

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.420 
syncopated drum beat to it and we ended
up<00:04:50.940> matching<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:52.350> snare<00:04:52.830> hits<00:04:53.040> and<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.280> bass

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
up matching the snare hits and the bass

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.790 
up matching the snare hits and the bass
drum<00:04:53.670> hits<00:04:53.820> with<00:04:54.480> that<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:54.990> what<00:04:55.530> could<00:04:55.680> have

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
drum hits with that so what could have

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.070 
drum hits with that so what could have
been<00:04:55.890> an<00:04:55.980> original<00:04:56.130> riff<00:04:56.520> of

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.969 

something<00:05:01.080> like<00:05:01.229> that<00:05:01.409> I<00:05:01.439> remember<00:05:01.800> what<00:05:01.889> it

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
something like that I remember what it

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.859

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.830 
with this little footwork and all that
so<00:05:36.370> there's<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.700> chorus<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.240> comes<00:05:37.420> in<00:05:37.600> with<00:05:37.810> a

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
so there's the chorus it comes in with a

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.130 
so there's the chorus it comes in with a
harmony<00:05:38.650> that's<00:05:38.830> just<00:05:39.130> in<00:05:39.370> minor<00:05:39.670> thirds<00:05:40.140> we

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
harmony that's just in minor thirds we

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.800 
harmony that's just in minor thirds we
break<00:05:41.380> out<00:05:41.560> of<00:05:41.590> that<00:05:42.390> back<00:05:43.390> into<00:05:43.600> that

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
break out of that back into that

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.520 
break out of that back into that
transposed<00:05:44.440> verse<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:46.000> that<00:05:46.720> minor<00:05:46.990> second

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
transposed verse of that minor second

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.830 
transposed verse of that minor second
and<00:05:47.650> that<00:05:48.220> comes<00:05:48.550> back<00:05:48.850> after<00:05:49.300> that<00:05:49.450> into<00:05:49.750> the

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
and that comes back after that into the

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.210 
and that comes back after that into the
other<00:05:49.960> verse<00:05:51.030> and<00:05:52.050> I<00:05:53.050> remember<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:53.530> originally

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
other verse and I remember I originally

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.250 
other verse and I remember I originally
didn't<00:05:54.430> like<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:55.000> way<00:05:55.090> that<00:05:55.270> flowed<00:05:55.600> I<00:05:55.810> wanted

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
didn't like the way that flowed I wanted

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.240 
didn't like the way that flowed I wanted
to<00:05:56.410> come<00:05:56.650> out<00:05:56.740> of<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:56.920> chorus<00:05:57.190> back<00:05:57.430> into<00:05:59.250> by

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
to come out of the chorus back into by

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.540 
to come out of the chorus back into by
itself<00:06:00.670> back<00:06:01.510> then<00:06:01.960> into<00:06:02.320> that<00:06:03.160> side<00:06:03.400> and

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
itself back then into that side and

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.800 
itself back then into that side and
flip-flopped<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.120> I<00:06:04.210> remember<00:06:04.480> talking<00:06:04.600> to

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
flip-flopped and I remember talking to

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.030 
flip-flopped and I remember talking to
guys<00:06:04.990> and<00:06:05.200> they're<00:06:05.290> like<00:06:05.410> no<00:06:05.530> no<00:06:05.560> they<00:06:05.800> didn't

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
guys and they're like no no they didn't

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.960 
guys and they're like no no they didn't
like<00:06:06.190> that<00:06:06.220> they<00:06:06.490> wanted<00:06:06.670> to<00:06:06.730> try<00:06:06.820> it<00:06:06.850> the

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
like that they wanted to try it the

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.700 
like that they wanted to try it the
other<00:06:07.030> way<00:06:07.210> and<00:06:07.240> I'm<00:06:07.750> glad<00:06:08.110> they<00:06:08.260> forced<00:06:08.530> me<00:06:08.590> to

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
other way and I'm glad they forced me to

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.960 
other way and I'm glad they forced me to
change<00:06:08.890> it<00:06:09.070> cuz<00:06:09.220> it's<00:06:09.340> so<00:06:09.490> much<00:06:09.640> better<00:06:09.820> that

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
change it cuz it's so much better that

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.120 
change it cuz it's so much better that
way<00:06:10.120> so<00:06:11.050> your<00:06:11.260> opinion<00:06:11.530> is<00:06:11.590> not<00:06:11.680> always<00:06:11.830> best

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
way so your opinion is not always best

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.810 
way so your opinion is not always best
and<00:06:12.520> then<00:06:13.120> we<00:06:13.630> go<00:06:13.750> from<00:06:13.870> there<00:06:14.050> to<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.740> verse<00:06:15.490> or

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
and then we go from there to a verse or

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.330 
and then we go from there to a verse or
a<00:06:16.720> bridge<00:06:17.380> riff<00:06:17.650> you<00:06:17.770> could<00:06:17.890> call<00:06:18.070> it<00:06:18.130> that<00:06:18.250> the

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
a bridge riff you could call it that the

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.280 
a bridge riff you could call it that the
bass<00:06:18.520> player<00:06:18.760> came<00:06:19.000> up<00:06:19.180> with<00:06:19.360> that<00:06:20.020> we<00:06:20.170> all

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
bass player came up with that we all

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.500 
bass player came up with that we all
ended<00:06:20.560> up<00:06:20.620> working<00:06:20.860> out<00:06:21.070> was<00:06:21.280> pretty<00:06:21.460> cool<00:06:21.730> he

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
ended up working out was pretty cool he

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:29.580 
ended up working out was pretty cool he
had<00:06:22.600> this<00:06:22.690> moving<00:06:23.020> bass<00:06:23.170> line

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.600 

and<00:06:30.190> took<00:06:31.120> that<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:31.389> just<00:06:31.570> added<00:06:31.990> some<00:06:32.919> notes

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
and took that and just added some notes

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.879 
and took that and just added some notes
up<00:06:33.880> on<00:06:34.060> top<00:06:34.330> I'm<00:06:35.230> kind<00:06:35.470> of<00:06:35.500> just<00:06:35.650> out<00:06:35.710> of<00:06:35.770> the

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
up on top I'm kind of just out of the

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:36.960 
up on top I'm kind of just out of the
blue<00:06:35.980> didn't<00:06:36.310> even<00:06:36.430> really<00:06:36.580> make<00:06:36.760> any<00:06:36.940> sense

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
blue didn't even really make any sense

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:47.480 
blue didn't even really make any sense
but<00:06:37.300> it<00:06:37.419> sounded<00:06:37.810> cool

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.439 

and<00:06:48.979> then<00:06:49.979> comes<00:06:50.250> the<00:06:50.370> solo<00:06:50.610> over<00:06:50.970> that<00:06:51.240> riff

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
and then comes the solo over that riff

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:52.790 
and then comes the solo over that riff
and<00:06:51.630> I<00:06:51.690> remember<00:06:51.900> having<00:06:52.050> trouble<00:06:52.470> trying<00:06:52.710> to

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
and I remember having trouble trying to

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.779 
and I remember having trouble trying to
figure<00:06:53.009> out<00:06:53.039> what<00:06:53.160> to<00:06:53.220> play<00:06:53.400> over<00:06:53.580> it<00:06:53.639> because

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
figure out what to play over it because

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.210 
figure out what to play over it because
there's<00:06:53.970> it's<00:06:54.330> not<00:06:54.509> real<00:06:54.770> common<00:06:55.770> and<00:06:56.099> there's

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
there's it's not real common and there's

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.279 
there's it's not real common and there's
no<00:06:56.340> real<00:06:56.580> actual<00:06:57.090> scale<00:06:57.690> and<00:06:57.900> key<00:06:58.050> that<00:06:58.199> you're

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
no real actual scale and key that you're

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.159 
no real actual scale and key that you're
gonna<00:06:58.380> find<00:06:58.620> in<00:06:58.830> that<00:06:59.720> but<00:07:00.720> I'm<00:07:00.900> gonna<00:07:01.050> go

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
gonna find in that but I'm gonna go

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:02.330 
gonna find in that but I'm gonna go
through<00:07:01.380> the<00:07:01.440> rest<00:07:01.530> of<00:07:01.650> the<00:07:01.740> song<00:07:01.919> first<00:07:02.069> and

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
through the rest of the song first and

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.920 
through the rest of the song first and
we'll<00:07:02.430> come<00:07:02.550> back<00:07:02.699> to<00:07:02.789> the<00:07:02.880> solo<00:07:03.090> later<00:07:03.360> so<00:07:03.870> I

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
we'll come back to the solo later so I

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.020 
we'll come back to the solo later so I
can<00:07:04.080> talk<00:07:04.199> about<00:07:04.229> that<00:07:04.470> more<00:07:04.710> in<00:07:04.770> depth<00:07:05.069> solo

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
can talk about that more in depth solo

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.620 
can talk about that more in depth solo
comes<00:07:06.300> up<00:07:06.539> we<00:07:06.780> have<00:07:06.930> some<00:07:07.110> breaks<00:07:08.150> then<00:07:09.150> a

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
comes up we have some breaks then a

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.379 
comes up we have some breaks then a
verse<00:07:09.990> comes<00:07:10.229> back<00:07:10.530> almost<00:07:10.830> as<00:07:11.160> a<00:07:11.389> chorus

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 
verse comes back almost as a chorus

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:20.719 
verse comes back almost as a chorus
afterthought<00:07:13.110> where<00:07:13.710> you<00:07:13.830> had<00:07:13.979> this<00:07:19.550> now<00:07:20.550> it's

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729 
afterthought where you had this now it's

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:22.219 
afterthought where you had this now it's
kind<00:07:20.910> of<00:07:20.970> expanded<00:07:21.479> upon<00:07:21.690> with<00:07:21.750> a<00:07:21.960> different

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229 
kind of expanded upon with a different

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:35.439 
kind of expanded upon with a different
motif

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:35.449 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:36.789 

so<00:07:35.599> it's<00:07:35.749> just<00:07:35.899> building<00:07:36.110> the<00:07:36.319> riff<00:07:36.499> whereas

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:36.799 
so it's just building the riff whereas

00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:38.289 
so it's just building the riff whereas
the<00:07:36.919> song<00:07:37.129> started<00:07:37.519> off<00:07:37.699> with<00:07:37.849> this<00:07:37.969> droney

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:38.299 
the song started off with this droney

00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:39.759 
the song started off with this droney
kind<00:07:38.599> of<00:07:38.689> thing<00:07:38.869> it's<00:07:39.049> gonna<00:07:39.169> end<00:07:39.439> with<00:07:39.709> a

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:39.769 
kind of thing it's gonna end with a

00:07:39.769 --> 00:07:41.469 
kind of thing it's gonna end with a
guitar<00:07:39.949> droney<00:07:40.399> kind<00:07:40.669> of<00:07:40.759> thing<00:07:40.939> that's

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 
guitar droney kind of thing that's

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.419 
guitar droney kind of thing that's
actually<00:07:41.689> built<00:07:42.049> on<00:07:42.169> something<00:07:42.409> else<00:07:42.679> and<00:07:42.979> how

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:43.429 
actually built on something else and how

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:47.919 
actually built on something else and how
we<00:07:43.489> had<00:07:46.119> that<00:07:47.119> little<00:07:47.299> part<00:07:47.509> is<00:07:47.599> gonna<00:07:47.749> come

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:47.929 
we had that little part is gonna come

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:52.869 
we had that little part is gonna come
back<00:07:48.079> again<00:07:51.159> so<00:07:52.159> everything's<00:07:52.429> kind<00:07:52.610> of<00:07:52.669> built
