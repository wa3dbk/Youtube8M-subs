00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.720
 motive has been that in the month of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.890
 I told them this and then put some 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.760
 pictures of my son so they can see this at 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.890
 baby that is 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.900
 who was born on December 5 and then 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.119
 I was very busy and did not have time 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.560
 to be uploading videos now well 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.549
 this I'm going to start with a is with a 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.549
 program with a 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.410
 with some lessons on how to learn to play 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.200
 keyboard but for beginners ok 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.890
 then this let's start from what 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.780
 most basic until as much as I know I am 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.170
 I do not know much but then this 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.870
 little that I will teach them and this 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.050
 well let's give is every I'll try 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:43.290
 every week to upload a new video and 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.240
 for those who have asked for tutorials 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.250
 I will try to put them there as 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.310
 soon possible and but in the classes they go 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.350
 to learn so much is that because this one 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 all I know has been a lot of land 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.660
 hot what they have asked me so is that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.910
 this is this these piano classes are going 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.460
 to go a little based on what the 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.280
 hot ground so this is why this 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 but also if you play cumbia played 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660
 this 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.069
 if you like cumbia if you like 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.439
 the hot earth if you like this 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.840
 everything related to the keyboard 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.450
 There you can learn true 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.849
 but this is going to be for beginners 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.950
 only if you are already an advanced and you 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.709
 like to post a comment or something is 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.650
 well that is no problem but that yes 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.950
 if there is an error or something in my tutorials 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.959
 do not put things as there are of you 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.450
 wrong here or start putting everything 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.180
 that because they already know that this is for 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.489
 beginners and I am not a person 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.010
 professional so you do not understand 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.389
 so we're going to start something else today 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.180
 has been putting some videos of the disc 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:59.790
 of me and my group of songs that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.949
 we recorded in the first single that's not 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.990
 forget to check those things 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:08.140
 videos that are already there 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.500
 I think I have uploaded two at the moment and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.000
 This one is there and they are ready and another 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.010
 thing 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.560
 do not forget to give a like to 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.950
 video subscribe 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.780
 and we already have 502 subscribers 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.790
 Now let's hope we keep moving forward 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.620
 raising that number and this one that 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.120
 let's continue to feel like this so throw in the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.430
 I'm going to carry you like that 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.430
 also and we will see you soon in the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.599
