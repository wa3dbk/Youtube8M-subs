00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 the dawn syndrome is an alteration 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.839
 genetics that causes disability 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.330
 cognitive is not a disease is a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.190
 condition in which the patient has 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.920
 more likely to present 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.800
 medical problems in the heart or the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.770
 digestive system ensures Nestor Sabbath 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.039
 that pediatrician and neonatologist of the sanatorium 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.230
 Adventist silver is a problem that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.269
 generates a series of difficulties in the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.640
 development of disorders and is 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.489
 determined by the surplus or by the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.760
 excess of genetic material in the parc 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.520
 21 of the chromosomes that we have 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.829
 normally the human being has 46 pairs 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.809
 of chromosomes in the case of the syndrome 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.210
 dawn there is a trisomy that is there is a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.760
 excess genetic material in the parc 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.760
 21 that's why it 's known or known 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.949
 down syndrome as trisomy the par 21 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 this form of excess material 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.820
 Genetic can be produced by three 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.829
 different mechanisms where 95% of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.220
 these 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.750
 this system this process is given a 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.610
 usual way in mothers who have 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.680
 ages over 40 bony years 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.290
 where the highest incidence is the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.570
 science showed that 98 percent of 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.920
 the cases are the result of an accident 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.229
 genetic the remaining 2% is a condition 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.330
 hereditary can not really be 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.100
 prevent yet science has not 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.689
 addressed treatments that may be 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.250
 preventive but if what can be 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.649
 do is what is called the diagnosis 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.229
 prenatal factor a predisposing factor 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.720
 genetic problem is the relationship between 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.060
 the frequency of the syndrome and the age of 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.030
 the woman or the man as a 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.490
 person ages there are more chances 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.280
 that the ovules and the sperm 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.360
 do not get the correct number of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.869
 Chromosomes studies made ensure 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.399
 that women up to 28 years old 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.100
 present lower risk of having a child 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.830
 with this syndrome from 35 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.369
 years a genetic study must be done 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.840
 of the baby at 40 years one in 100 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.670
 plus 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.730
 it can be from a child with a syndrome 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.069
 dawn in these cases it is suggested to do 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.160
 control studies or 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.260
 research the diagnoses are made by 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.170
 different methods one of them is a 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.000
 system that uses fetal ultrasound 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.100
 where what is called the 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.750
 nuchal translucency or a structure 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.620
 of the neck of the baby who has a 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.120
 specific measurement and that in the hands of 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.130
 experienced ultrasound can make a 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.870
 early diagnosis can be made 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.590
 chorionic villus biopsies that 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.780
 it is with a needle samples are taken from the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.600
 tissue that has to do with the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.690
 implantation of the fetus in utero and 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.390
 see in the chromosomes of that tissue and 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.860
 newer studies that allow 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.200
 find a substance that is called 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.380
 alpha fetoprotein in maternal blood or 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.660
 fetal cells circulating in the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.130
 Maternal blood can be captured and made 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.299
 a genetic study of those cells and 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.950
 determine if the product of that 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.080
 pregnancy 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.180
 a site with down syndrome or some 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.500
 another genetic pathology in fact these 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.239
 Studies are usually done when 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.220
 there are some suspicions for some 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.860
 antecedent generally the two 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.370
 first years of life are fundamental 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.900
 in the cognitive development of children 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.660
 especially those who have 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.910
 dawn syndrome encouragement affection 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.310
 medical accompaniment and studies 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.700
 made to rule out other 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.160
 Associated pathologies are indispensable 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.200
 to accompany this process for another 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.780
 side the earlier we begin to 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.459
 stimulate them and that means I insist a 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.049
 multidisciplinary team where it enters 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.560
 carve the psychologists the stimulators 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.540
 early pediatricians the family 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.910
 little dad mom brothers and the great 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.160
 family grandparents, uncles and others, if we can 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.180
 stimulate that development these guys 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.769
 they can reach a 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.470
 very important independence depends on 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.150
 degree of pathology affection for 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.000
 that a small one developed and 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.640
 adequately care is required and 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.310
 special attentions stimulation 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.940
 adequate and to attend normal colleges 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.610
 unicef medical checks 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.680
 since your immune system is more 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.299
 weak first of all I recommend that 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.130
 choose a pediatrician with experience 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.420
 handle guys with dawn syndrome there 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.650
 a series of studies that must be done 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.990
 you have to study thyroid hormone 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.280
 on a regular basis we have to do studies 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.020
 of x-ray when the child starts 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.640
 with physical activity an x-ray 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.660
 of the neck to determine if there is a 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.430
 problem that may cause damage in the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.400
 marrow is called atlanta dislocation cccs or 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.020
 idea and we should do regular studies 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.270
 to determine if there is disease 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.410
 celiac and eventually go see the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.880
 development guidelines that you have to 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.370
 stimulate especially in the area of 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.560
 language in muscle tone in the 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.290
 psychomotor and in everything that has 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.150
 to do with the normal issues of 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.860
 growth development nutrition and others 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.320
 it has been seen that children with syndrome 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.870
 of dawn tend to be overweight to be 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.940
 more obese then it's important that you 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.050
 incorporate a nutritionist or a person 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.540
 with experience of nutritional management 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.910
 to avoid these problems the 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.890
 schooling can even be 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.150
 conventional schooling there are countries 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.920
 where you are stimulating that the 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.690
 schooling is conventional with a 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.690
 parallel support to development
