00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.099
 the second stage of student progression and named off things 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.920
 the goal and to teach students a marked point thanks to the 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.720
 trajectory production for example 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.329
 four themes of work are discussed 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.429
 the service 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.429
 place the ball 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.220
 move 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.220
 hit the ball with the forehand 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.350
 the service and the cost that makes it possible to engage in foreign exchange 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.890
 it's the only shot where the ball must touch his own side before 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.890
 to cross the cut killer 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.590
 the student throws the ball vertically towards the bridge 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.750
 he hits the ball in the downswing of his trajectory so 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.330
 that they first touch his own camp and then the camp of 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.360
 the adversary 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.070
 it was forbidden to hit the ball above the table top 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.390
 the ball is hit in the back 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.220
 and slightly on the top 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.290
 there the plan bouncing anywhere on the opposing side and she can come out 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 side lines of the table after rebound 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 the student does not throw the ball before hitting it 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.310
 he positions his racket and the ball over the table having hit the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.240
 ball down and there you why 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.820
 m 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.110
 his first job to yield to do the services well so it's a 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.580
 puncture 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.510
 the American ping-pong that is to say that you are going to exchange the ball 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.310
 but every time you will have to make a rebound on your side 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.560
 girls 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.950
 so not every time you throw the ball at each other but typing the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 ball from your side okay 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.220
 ap 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.220
 ap 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.639
 we start with the second situation 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.109
 then laziness another gear always to learn the services for 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.599
 improving services to his ball in the head actually we are 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.870
 people of the day age 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.739
 and when you are good at you have to do a service they had to do 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.150
 the other team because we play white and chain like with a service
