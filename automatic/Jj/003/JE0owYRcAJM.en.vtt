00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
story this large upper low is going

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.780 
story this large upper low is going
nowhere<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.690> parked<00:00:48.930> over<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> Midwest<00:00:49.790> it

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
nowhere it is parked over the Midwest it

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.880 
nowhere it is parked over the Midwest it
is<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.970> stacked<00:00:51.480> system<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.290> surface<00:00:52.530> low

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
is a stacked system so the surface low

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.410 
is a stacked system so the surface low
is<00:00:53.010> pretty<00:00:53.250> much<00:00:53.400> underneath<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.240> the

severe weather and the low level Jeff
3040<00:04:17.549> maybe<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.849> 59<00:04:18.419> max<00:04:18.720> coming<00:04:19.109> through<00:04:19.260> there

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
3040 maybe a 59 max coming through there

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.860 
3040 maybe a 59 max coming through there
so<00:04:20.729> it's<00:04:20.910> going<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.090> be<00:04:21.180> pretty<00:04:21.389> much<00:04:21.449> like

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870
