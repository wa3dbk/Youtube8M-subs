you

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.000 

hey<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.230> John<00:00:16.440> Petrucci

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
hey this is John Petrucci

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.310 
hey this is John Petrucci
and<00:00:17.220> I'd<00:00:17.640> like<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> talk<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.840> very

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
and I'd like to talk about a very

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.710 
and I'd like to talk about a very
interesting<00:00:19.800> way<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.640> moving<00:00:21.240> across<00:00:21.599> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
interesting way of moving across the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320 
interesting way of moving across the
guitar<00:00:22.259> neck<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:23.669> reason<00:00:24.000> why<00:00:24.119> it's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
guitar neck and the reason why it's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.350 
guitar neck and the reason why it's
interesting<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.169> because<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.400> sound<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:27.150> what

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
interesting is because the sound of what

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.870 
interesting is because the sound of what
you're<00:00:27.509> playing<00:00:27.750> doesn't<00:00:28.470> quite<00:00:28.680> equate<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you're playing doesn't quite equate to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.850 
you're playing doesn't quite equate to
the<00:00:30.119> motion<00:00:30.509> that<00:00:30.630> your<00:00:30.750> hands<00:00:31.230> are<00:00:31.380> making

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
the motion that your hands are making

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.490 
the motion that your hands are making
and<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.970> we're<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> talk<00:00:33.420> about<00:00:33.540> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and what we're going to talk about is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
and what we're going to talk about is
playing<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.399> sending<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:35.969> descending

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
playing in an a sending and descending

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.510 
playing in an a sending and descending
Way<00:00:36.630> from<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.649> low<00:00:37.920> string<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:39.809> high<00:00:40.020> position

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
Way from a low string in a high position

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
Way from a low string in a high position
down<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> high<00:00:42.059> string<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.690> low<00:00:42.870> position

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
down to a high string in a low position

00:00:43.050 --> 00:01:14.960 
down to a high string in a low position
and<00:00:44.570> back<00:00:45.570> up

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.710 

with<00:01:15.970> this<00:01:16.210> lick<00:01:16.720> we<00:01:17.020> are<00:01:17.290> in<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:18.100> minor<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:18.760> I'm

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
with this lick we are in a minor and I'm

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.290 
with this lick we are in a minor and I'm
actually<00:01:19.900> starting<00:01:20.320> on<00:01:20.560> E<00:01:20.880> which<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:21.910> really

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
actually starting on E which is really

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.180 
actually starting on E which is really
of<00:01:22.510> no<00:01:22.720> consequence<00:01:23.410> because<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:24.010> going

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
of no consequence because this is going

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.700 
of no consequence because this is going
to<00:01:24.280> kind<00:01:24.910> of<00:01:25.000> rip<00:01:25.180> by<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.720> what<00:01:26.560> we're<00:01:26.680> doing

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
to kind of rip by and what we're doing

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.570 
to kind of rip by and what we're doing
is<00:01:27.040> we're<00:01:27.220> taking<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.910> concept<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.720> the

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
is we're taking the concept of the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.060 
is we're taking the concept of the
groups<00:01:30.580> of<00:01:30.760> six<00:01:31.060> notes<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.830> we're<00:01:32.830> still

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
groups of six notes and we're still

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
groups of six notes and we're still
working<00:01:33.280> off<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:33.970> but<00:01:34.240> what<00:01:34.510> we're<00:01:34.660> doing

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
working off of that but what we're doing

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.330 
working off of that but what we're doing
instead<00:01:35.710> of<00:01:35.770> taking<00:01:36.310> them<00:01:36.490> in<00:01:36.760> a<00:01:37.000> motion<00:01:37.450> on

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
instead of taking them in a motion on

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.430 
instead of taking them in a motion on
the<00:01:39.340> same<00:01:39.550> set<00:01:39.790> of<00:01:39.910> strings<00:01:40.240> or<00:01:40.630> an<00:01:40.960> emotion

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
the same set of strings or an emotion

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.190 
the same set of strings or an emotion
through<00:01:41.980> a<00:01:42.010> scale<00:01:42.460> or<00:01:42.700> in<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.750> motion

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
through a scale or in a motion

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.650 
through a scale or in a motion
diagonally<00:01:44.890> this<00:01:45.190> way<00:01:45.250> we're<00:01:46.150> moving<00:01:46.510> them

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
diagonally this way we're moving them

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.230 
diagonally this way we're moving them
diagonally<00:01:47.350> this<00:01:48.010> way<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.520> this<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:48.910> how<00:01:49.060> you

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
diagonally this way and this is how you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.000 
diagonally this way and this is how you
do<00:01:49.480> that<00:01:49.510> so<00:01:49.870> you<00:01:49.930> take<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.260> first<00:01:50.290> group<00:01:50.830> in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
do that so you take the first group in

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.980 
do that so you take the first group in
this<00:01:51.550> case<00:01:51.790> it's<00:01:52.060> going<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.240> be<00:01:52.300> all<00:01:52.510> natural

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
this case it's going to be all natural

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.620 
this case it's going to be all natural
notes<00:01:53.170> so<00:01:53.380> there's<00:01:53.620> no<00:01:53.770> more<00:01:53.950> f-sharp<00:01:54.630> it's

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
notes so there's no more f-sharp it's

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.270 
notes so there's no more f-sharp it's
going<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.870> be<00:01:55.930> an<00:01:56.020> F<00:01:56.110> natural<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:59.040> well<00:02:00.040> before

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
going to be an F natural so well before

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.830 
going to be an F natural so well before
I<00:02:00.460> even<00:02:00.580> play<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.970> pattern<00:02:01.150> let<00:02:01.480> me<00:02:01.570> show<00:02:01.750> you

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
I even play the pattern let me show you

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.030 
I even play the pattern let me show you
where<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.050> shapes<00:02:02.290> come<00:02:02.590> from<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:02.950> then

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
where the shapes come from and then

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.840 
where the shapes come from and then
we'll<00:02:03.160> do<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.370> pattern<00:02:03.550> so<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.640> first

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
we'll do the pattern so that's the first

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.120 
we'll do the pattern so that's the first
one<00:02:07.060> now<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.690> way<00:02:07.870> you<00:02:07.930> get<00:02:08.230> to<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.440> next<00:02:08.619> set

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
one now the way you get to the next set

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.530 
one now the way you get to the next set
is<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.260> stay<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.440> position<00:02:11.860> that

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
is that you stay in the position that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.760 
is that you stay in the position that
you<00:02:13.540> started<00:02:13.959> in<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.680> then<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:16.360> move<00:02:16.720> down<00:02:17.110> to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
you started in and then you move down to

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.650 
you started in and then you move down to
the<00:02:17.920> next<00:02:18.310> available<00:02:18.550> note<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> key<00:02:19.420> and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
the next available note in the key and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.720 
the next available note in the key and
you<00:02:20.200> play<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.560> shape<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.070> position

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
you play the shape in that position

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.460 
you play the shape in that position
remember<00:02:22.209> conform<00:02:22.750> your<00:02:22.900> fingers<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
remember conform your fingers to the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.000 
remember conform your fingers to the
notes<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.459> scale<00:02:24.790> so

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.500 

all<00:02:30.010> right<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:30.549> in<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.760> position<00:02:31.239> you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
all right and then in this position you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.750 
all right and then in this position you
move<00:02:31.689> down<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:32.920> next<00:02:32.950> available<00:02:33.400> note

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
move down to the next available note

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:44.910 
move down to the next available note
would<00:02:33.879> be<00:02:33.969> a<00:02:34.000> B<00:02:36.959> next<00:02:37.959> available<00:02:38.140> note<00:02:43.920> alright

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
would be a B next available note alright

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.050 
would be a B next available note alright
so<00:02:45.099> here<00:02:45.280> are<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.430> shapes<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:50.819> then<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:51.909> just

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
so here are the shapes and then I just

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.479 
so here are the shapes and then I just
applied<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.450> sequence<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.379> it<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.739> in<00:02:54.370> this

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
applied a sequence to it and in this

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.899 
applied a sequence to it and in this
case<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:55.180> are<00:02:55.209> in<00:02:55.810> five<00:02:56.230> four<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.799> it's<00:02:57.790> going

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
case we are in five four and it's going

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.300 
case we are in five four and it's going
to<00:02:57.969> sound<00:02:58.510> like<00:02:58.659> this<00:02:58.859> I'm<00:02:59.859> going<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.099> pick

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
to sound like this I'm going to pick

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.949 
to sound like this I'm going to pick
sixteenth<00:03:00.879> notes<00:03:01.120> are<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:01.389> still<00:03:01.629> hearing

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
sixteenth notes are you still hearing

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.530 
sixteenth notes are you still hearing
one<00:03:02.620> E<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.799> a<00:03:03.069> two<00:03:03.099> E<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.459> A<00:03:03.760> three<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.000> and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
one E and a two E and A three and and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.009 
one E and a two E and A three and and
you're<00:03:05.019> also<00:03:06.060> constantly<00:03:07.060> picking<00:03:07.480> down<00:03:07.780> up

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
you're also constantly picking down up

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:08.550 
you're also constantly picking down up
down<00:03:08.230> up

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
down up

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.860 
down up
so<00:03:08.680> alternate<00:03:09.280> picking<00:03:09.970> strictly<00:03:10.510> throughout

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
so alternate picking strictly throughout

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.449 
so alternate picking strictly throughout
so<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:11.500> first<00:03:11.739> part<00:03:11.919> of<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.099> pattern<00:03:12.280> goes

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
so the first part of the pattern goes

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.849 
so the first part of the pattern goes
and<00:03:15.459> then<00:03:16.389> we're<00:03:16.750> going<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.900> move<00:03:17.409> to<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> next

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
and then we're going to move to the next

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.159 
and then we're going to move to the next
position<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:18.549> play<00:03:18.790> two<00:03:19.540> notes<00:03:19.569> from<00:03:20.109> that

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
position and play two notes from that

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:25.830 
position and play two notes from that
position<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:24.430> then<00:03:25.000> we<00:03:25.150> start<00:03:25.389> the<00:03:25.419> pattern

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
position and then we start the pattern

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:42.670 
position and then we start the pattern
on<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.959> next<00:03:26.260> set

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.320 

so<00:03:43.680> one<00:03:43.860> thing<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.069> note<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.580> after<00:03:45.030> we<00:03:45.150> play

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
so one thing to note is after we play

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.780 
so one thing to note is after we play
the<00:03:45.480> first<00:03:45.720> pattern<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:48.450> next<00:03:48.840> two<00:03:49.080> notes

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
the first pattern the next two notes

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.470 
the first pattern the next two notes
that<00:03:50.870> complete<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.110> group<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.440> five<00:03:53.330> set<00:03:54.330> up

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
that complete the group of five set up

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.570 
that complete the group of five set up
the<00:03:54.690> next<00:03:54.959> position<00:03:55.230> alright<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.400> when<00:03:56.550> you

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
the next position alright so when you

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.229 
the next position alright so when you
played<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:58.800> don't<00:03:58.980> want<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.190> play<00:03:59.370> those<00:04:00.180> two

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
played you don't want to play those two

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.150 
played you don't want to play those two
notes<00:04:00.569> in<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.870> same<00:04:01.019> position<00:04:01.470> you're<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.769> to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
notes in the same position you're in to

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.520 
notes in the same position you're in to
actually<00:04:02.610> switch<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.690> next<00:04:03.930> position<00:04:04.050> and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
actually switch to the next position and

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.680 
actually switch to the next position and
then<00:04:04.650> play<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.130> appropriate<00:04:05.360> notes<00:04:06.360> with<00:04:06.569> the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
then play the appropriate notes with the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:19.670 
then play the appropriate notes with the
right<00:04:06.840> fingers<00:04:13.790> shift<00:04:17.900> and<00:04:18.900> we're<00:04:19.139> resolving

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
right fingers shift and we're resolving

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.610 
right fingers shift and we're resolving
it<00:04:23.300> alright<00:04:24.300> so<00:04:24.330> now<00:04:24.630> I'm<00:04:24.870> going<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:25.260> show<00:04:25.560> you

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
it alright so now I'm going to show you

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.430 
it alright so now I'm going to show you
a<00:04:26.100> similar<00:04:26.540> concept<00:04:27.540> but<00:04:27.990> this<00:04:28.110> time<00:04:28.290> we're

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
a similar concept but this time we're

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.950 
a similar concept but this time we're
going<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.590> start<00:04:28.919> on<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:30.030> higher<00:04:30.210> strings<00:04:30.570> and

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
going to start on the higher strings and

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.280 
going to start on the higher strings and
we're<00:04:31.950> going<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.100> play<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.370> succession<00:04:32.880> of

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
we're going to play a succession of

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.020 
we're going to play a succession of
descending<00:04:34.290> notes<00:04:34.560> even<00:04:35.100> though<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.820> looks

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
descending notes even though it looks

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.060 
descending notes even though it looks
like<00:04:36.120> we're<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.510> sending<00:04:37.110> on<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.440> guitar<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:37.770> we

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
like we're a sending on the guitar so we

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.520 
like we're a sending on the guitar so we
start<00:04:38.310> on<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.490> high<00:04:38.639> E<00:04:39.030> string<00:04:39.479> and<00:04:40.020> we<00:04:40.110> end<00:04:40.320> on

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
start on the high E string and we end on

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.530 
start on the high E string and we end on
the<00:04:40.620> low<00:04:40.800> E<00:04:41.040> string<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:41.850> is<00:04:41.970> also<00:04:42.180> in<00:04:42.360> the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
the low E string and this is also in the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:56.029 
the low E string and this is also in the
key<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:42.930> minor<00:04:53.900> ok<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:54.960> all<00:04:55.410> of<00:04:55.650> these<00:04:55.770> notes

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
key of a minor ok so all of these notes

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.850 
key of a minor ok so all of these notes
are<00:04:56.250> in<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.430> key<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:57.030> a<00:04:57.900> minor<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:58.500> they're<00:04:58.710> all

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
are in the key of a minor so they're all

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.390 
are in the key of a minor so they're all
natural<00:04:59.370> notes<00:04:59.550> and<00:05:01.010> here<00:05:02.010> are<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.250> different

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
natural notes and here are the different

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.060 
natural notes and here are the different
6<00:05:03.330> note<00:05:03.840> shapes<00:05:04.229> so<00:05:04.410> you<00:05:04.440> can<00:05:04.650> see<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.979> way

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
6 note shapes so you can see the way

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.830 
6 note shapes so you can see the way
they<00:05:05.220> outline<00:05:05.610> so<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.000> first<00:05:06.240> one<00:05:11.720> now<00:05:12.720> we're

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
they outline so the first one now we're

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.620 
they outline so the first one now we're
gonna<00:05:12.930> take<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:14.090> shape<00:05:15.090> and<00:05:15.360> we're<00:05:15.479> going<00:05:15.600> to

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
gonna take that shape and we're going to

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:26.450 
gonna take that shape and we're going to
move<00:05:15.870> up<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.380> the<00:05:16.470> next<00:05:16.650> position

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.160 

all<00:05:26.970> right<00:05:27.060> so<00:05:27.210> every<00:05:27.390> time<00:05:27.540> we're<00:05:27.750> shifting

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
all right so every time we're shifting

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.470 
all right so every time we're shifting
up<00:05:28.350> we're<00:05:29.190> changing<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.730> shape<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.120> conform

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
up we're changing the shape to conform

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.360 
up we're changing the shape to conform
to<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.720> scale<00:05:31.080> and<00:05:31.290> even<00:05:31.920> though<00:05:32.160> we're

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
to the scale and even though we're

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.970 
to the scale and even though we're
traveling<00:05:32.880> up<00:05:33.230> towards<00:05:34.230> the<00:05:34.410> pickups<00:05:34.800> of<00:05:34.920> the

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
traveling up towards the pickups of the

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:44.860 
traveling up towards the pickups of the
guitar<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.940> notes<00:05:36.270> are<00:05:36.570> actually<00:05:37.160> descending

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.810 

and<00:05:45.870> then<00:05:46.020> I<00:05:46.260> just<00:05:46.410> applied<00:05:46.920> a<00:05:46.950> pattern<00:05:47.460> to<00:05:47.670> it

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
and then I just applied a pattern to it

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.280 
and then I just applied a pattern to it
so<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.060> pattern<00:05:48.450> is<00:05:48.600> a<00:05:48.690> sixteenth<00:05:49.200> note

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
so the pattern is a sixteenth note

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:59.360 
so the pattern is a sixteenth note
pattern<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.650> thing<00:05:58.830> that's<00:05:58.980> a<00:05:59.070> little

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
pattern and the thing that's a little

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.010 
pattern and the thing that's a little
bit<00:05:59.520> tricky<00:05:59.820> if<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.150> tap<00:06:00.360> your<00:06:00.390> foot<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.900> this

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
bit tricky if you tap your foot to this

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.340 
bit tricky if you tap your foot to this
is<00:06:01.290> that<00:06:01.790> since<00:06:02.790> the<00:06:03.000> notes<00:06:03.240> are<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:03.930> groups<00:06:04.200> of

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
is that since the notes are in groups of

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.320 
is that since the notes are in groups of
three<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:04.980> I'm<00:06:05.430> playing<00:06:05.700> a<00:06:05.850> sixteenth<00:06:06.270> note

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
three and I'm playing a sixteenth note

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.390 
three and I'm playing a sixteenth note
pattern<00:06:06.840> it's<00:06:07.410> going<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.680> sound<00:06:07.860> a<00:06:08.010> little<00:06:08.220> bit

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
pattern it's going to sound a little bit

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.970 
pattern it's going to sound a little bit
syncopated<00:06:09.180> so<00:06:09.420> the<00:06:09.870> best<00:06:10.050> thing<00:06:10.260> to<00:06:10.290> do<00:06:10.560> is<00:06:10.830> to

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
syncopated so the best thing to do is to

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.840 
syncopated so the best thing to do is to
try<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.220> tap<00:06:11.610> and<00:06:12.710> accent<00:06:13.710> maybe<00:06:14.100> every<00:06:14.460> four

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
try to tap and accent maybe every four

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.280 
try to tap and accent maybe every four
to<00:06:15.000> eight<00:06:15.150> notes<00:06:15.480> and<00:06:15.840> then<00:06:15.930> you'll<00:06:16.080> really

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
to eight notes and then you'll really

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:26.900 
to eight notes and then you'll really
hear<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:16.830> syncopation<00:06:24.980> alright<00:06:25.980> so<00:06:26.190> the

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
hear the syncopation alright so the

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.820 
hear the syncopation alright so the
reason<00:06:27.210> I<00:06:27.270> bring<00:06:27.390> that<00:06:27.450> up<00:06:27.600> is<00:06:27.870> because<00:06:27.900> you

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
reason I bring that up is because you

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.850 
reason I bring that up is because you
might<00:06:29.010> have<00:06:29.480> the<00:06:30.480> tendency<00:06:31.080> since<00:06:31.500> the<00:06:31.650> notes

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
might have the tendency since the notes

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.120 
might have the tendency since the notes
are<00:06:32.040> grouped<00:06:32.310> in<00:06:32.780> sixes<00:06:33.780> or<00:06:34.020> threes<00:06:34.440> to<00:06:34.770> feel

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
are grouped in sixes or threes to feel

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.340 
are grouped in sixes or threes to feel
it<00:06:35.340> as<00:06:35.490> like<00:06:36.060> a<00:06:36.240> triplet<00:06:36.750> and<00:06:36.900> it's<00:06:37.080> hard<00:06:37.290> to

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
it as like a triplet and it's hard to

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.810 
it as like a triplet and it's hard to
kind<00:06:37.620> of<00:06:37.650> get<00:06:37.830> out<00:06:37.950> of<00:06:38.040> that<00:06:38.100> headspace<00:06:38.520> you

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
kind of get out of that headspace you

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.530 
kind of get out of that headspace you
almost<00:06:39.030> want<00:06:39.300> to<00:06:39.390> hear<00:06:39.900> this<00:06:44.150> it's<00:06:45.150> important

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
almost want to hear this it's important

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.140 
almost want to hear this it's important
that<00:06:45.570> it's<00:06:45.810> not<00:06:45.980> written<00:06:46.980> that<00:06:47.160> way<00:06:47.430> and<00:06:47.730> this

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
that it's not written that way and this

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.350 
that it's not written that way and this
is<00:06:48.210> really<00:06:48.810> cool<00:06:49.080> exercise<00:06:49.790> to<00:06:50.790> do<00:06:50.940> anyway<00:06:51.300> to

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
is really cool exercise to do anyway to

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.420

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
knowledge so remember group it in

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:05.700 
knowledge so remember group it in
sixteenth<00:06:55.830> notes

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.650 

and<00:07:06.710> it's<00:07:06.860> interesting<00:07:07.099> to<00:07:07.430> note<00:07:07.460> where<00:07:08.210> the

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
and it's interesting to note where the

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.189 
and it's interesting to note where the
downbeats<00:07:09.169> are<00:07:09.349> they're<00:07:09.710> not<00:07:09.740> going<00:07:10.039> to<00:07:10.160> be

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
downbeats are they're not going to be

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.330 
downbeats are they're not going to be
where<00:07:12.199> you<00:07:12.349> would<00:07:12.470> think<00:07:12.500> they<00:07:12.860> would<00:07:13.039> be<00:07:13.160> like

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
where you would think they would be like

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.730 
where you would think they would be like
at<00:07:13.460> the<00:07:13.580> top<00:07:14.060> of<00:07:14.330> the<00:07:14.539> grouping<00:07:15.440> it's<00:07:15.590> not

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
at the top of the grouping it's not

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.990 
at the top of the grouping it's not
going<00:07:15.860> to<00:07:15.919> be<00:07:18.009> yet<00:07:19.009> cetera<00:07:19.370> is<00:07:19.430> gonna<00:07:19.639> be<00:07:19.819> in

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
going to be yet cetera is gonna be in

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.539 
going to be yet cetera is gonna be in
