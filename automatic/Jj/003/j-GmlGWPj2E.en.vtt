00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:13.500
 this video on a great weather 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:19.189
 unfortunately we want to have one here today 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.490
 Round to drive around the Steinhuder Meer 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.830
 something to maybe salt 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.349
 Thematically, it should be about whether today 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.750
 just after a heavy one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.219
 Motorcycle accident stops or how to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 this behavior should have been stopped 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.090
 so hard for me to say right now 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.030
 because I do not have a serious one either 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.850
 motorcycle accident I had already can think of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.649
 Imagine work colleagues from me to 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.910
 example of it out of the curve 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.129
 has flown two ribs 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.670
 broken said at the first half 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.340
 hour 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.790
 he is driving now he has been longer 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.780
 I can not do any more locally 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.520
 I do not know if you are watching 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.250
 Motorcyclist through it's up 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.019
 you can let it be 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.670
 always what went out of his turn 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.260
 then blame it yourself because 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.680
 he drove too fast because of the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.320
 wicor enke taken 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.479
 what else we were at the customer 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.060
 and he was also a motorcyclist and that 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.910
 I know that in the traffic jam or at one 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.250
 traffic light is the bulli in the rear 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:29.200
 with the paraplegic even if he 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.320
 one would not have been paraplegic 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.130
 Of course, then always afraid that it 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.800
 Decorate something like that again and introduce you 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.470
 where you pass out where you are powerless 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.729
 Protect what you are somewhere 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.310
 can be best real against 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.979
 put on and then you have something to do there 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.750
 see that for a long time for that 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.520
 Motorcyclists still recommend 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.960
 not to be the last to get stuck in traffic 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.300
 That's why I am also in favor of this petition 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.070
 drive through because of traffic jams and so on and 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.800
 immediately 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.289
 because everybody is in jam anyway 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.660
 then you drive in the middle and 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.660
 finish is set and therefore 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.640
 that should have stayed where 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.690
 should wait for me a book or 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.330
 otherwise any vehicles truck behind 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.980
 fall for also no case to 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.630
 come that one currently in summer 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.030
 sweats as ole also rains the best 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.100
 I will not stay that way either 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.120
 stand 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.830
 if you already have experience with something 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.650
 have something of course no wish then 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.060
 I'll write the comments 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.100
 of course, I'll look at everything as always 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.660
 and also when I reply to yours 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.209
 Comments do not reply then you should 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.650
 you look if you can answer 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.870
 we can not turn off the the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.280
 strangers can then answer you 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.800
 I can not comment on you 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.510
 back to us 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.610
 if you watch 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.200
 I write correctly the comments 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.970
 can answer but only thumb 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.150
 Give up and down because they just 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.610
 turned off that me and the stranger 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.320
 I can also answer them 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:19.840
 i would paint a serious car accident like that 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:21.580
 I was 19 years old while I was 19 years old 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.350
 the time where i got my abi exams 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:30.040
 have written and there's me with the 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.100
 1er bmw before annoying side driven if 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.430
 out of over total damage and everything me 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.069
 had come to happiness vorrang 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.600
 Price and there must clearly say that 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.709
 I already first 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.209
 and I still think it's very 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.470
 strange if someone quickly 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.320
 Junctions on drives together 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.500
 and honestly I do not know 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.070
 if i gave this accident with motor 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.780
 would then when I as a seconded 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.940
 yes, how it would have happened to me then 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.090
 I honestly say so often 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.890
 apart from bruises nothing and 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.260
 my girlfriend at the time was almost 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.090
 Nothing that had an elbow like this 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.580
 little bit more but then stop too 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.910
 someone would not have us so off the motorcycle 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.910
 brought 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:30.370
 in front of me has also today birthday 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:37.260
 yes, what is the scooter driver doing wrong? 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:39.730
 direction and the distributed st 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.120
 nothing yet seen from the stony sea 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.840
 here the pillar is already a bit 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.840
 lead for weeks 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.009
 through the 0 on what I still tell 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.569
 you have to do it well yesterday 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:59.060
 mcdonald's we stood in front there and 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:02.110
 We always holds a hand or behaves 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:05.530
 on a parking lot for this all 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.530
 purposefully too 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.710
 you can always call me 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.710
 are being revised 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.920
 connect everywhere I hope in any case 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.740
 that you liked this video though 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:26.240
 their environment, they would be built and 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.240
