hybrid concept I what small honk and
actually<00:01:38.910> blew<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.480> hey<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.440> are<00:01:40.500> in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
actually blew it up hey your we are in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.060 
actually blew it up hey your we are in
Texas<00:01:41.100> bigger<00:01:41.370> is<00:01:41.580> better<00:01:42.440> so<00:01:43.440> now<00:01:43.650> that<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
Texas bigger is better so now that the

to<00:01:49.500> refuse<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.220> complexities<00:01:50.940> from<00:01:51.270> our

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to refuse the complexities from our

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.710 
to refuse the complexities from our
rohan<00:01:51.870> time<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.770> took<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.340> whole<00:01:54.240> set<00:01:54.510> C

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
rohan time we took out the whole set C

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.110 
rohan time we took out the whole set C
we<00:01:55.080> took<00:01:55.230> out<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:55.530> mixing<00:01:55.890> valve<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.760> took<00:01:56.910> out

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
we took out the mixing valve we took out

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.210 
we took out the mixing valve we took out
the<00:01:57.300> water<00:01:57.630> pressure<00:01:57.870> sensing<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:58.650> basically

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
the water pressure sensing and basically

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.550 
the water pressure sensing and basically
the<00:01:59.580> modulation<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.750> made<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.200> really

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the modulation that made it a really

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.490 
the modulation that made it a really
simple<00:02:01.980> device<00:02:02.370> so<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.660> is<00:02:03.690> perfect<00:02:04.080> for

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
simple device so this is perfect for

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.230 
simple device so this is perfect for
