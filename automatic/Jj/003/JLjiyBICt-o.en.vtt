around to trying it because I think when

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080

it came out I didn't really trust

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.860 
it came out I didn't really trust
mascara<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:31.020> do<00:00:31.140> anything<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.740> my<00:00:31.890> lashes<00:00:32.129> I

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
mascara to do anything for my lashes I

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.850 
mascara to do anything for my lashes I
still<00:00:33.870> doubt<00:00:34.739> most<00:00:35.280> mascara<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.200> felt

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
still doubt most mascara but as I felt

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.569 
still doubt most mascara but as I felt
some<00:00:38.010> good<00:00:38.160> products<00:00:38.579> along<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.970> way<00:00:39.120> um<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
some good products along the way um and

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.000 
some good products along the way um and
this<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.960> probably<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> them<00:00:43.910> so

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
this was this is probably one of them so

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.350 
this was this is probably one of them so
let's<00:00:47.010> open<00:00:47.130> this<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> brush<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:51.120> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
let's open this up and the brush as you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.729 
let's open this up and the brush as you
can<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.350> small<00:00:54.350> almost<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.530> mean

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
can see it's really small almost I mean

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.670 
can see it's really small almost I mean
it's<00:00:56.460> still<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.879> normal<00:00:57.420> mascara<00:00:57.840> brush<00:00:58.140> but

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it's still a normal mascara brush but

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's still a normal mascara brush but
just<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.420> sheer<00:01:01.079> size<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
just a way that the sheer size of it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.389 
just a way that the sheer size of it
almost<00:01:01.949> reminds<00:01:02.460> me<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.910> him<00:01:03.350> maybelline<00:01:04.350> lash

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
and then I first got this to it when

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.580 
and then I first got this to it when
most<00:01:10.650> mascaras<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.730> there's<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.600> much<00:01:12.630> product

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
most mascaras it there's so much product

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
most mascaras it there's so much product
in<00:01:13.800> here<00:01:14.280> or<00:01:14.430> maybe<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.730> brush<00:01:14.940> is<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.120> big

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
in here or maybe the brush is so big

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.040 
in here or maybe the brush is so big
like<00:01:16.380> pulling<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> out<00:01:17.220> take<00:01:18.120> a<00:01:18.180> lot<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.480> effort

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
like pulling it out take a lot of effort

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.410 
like pulling it out take a lot of effort
but<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.160> it<00:01:20.370> comes<00:01:20.580> out<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.940> easily<00:01:20.970> I

but this one it comes out so easily I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.380 
but this one it comes out so easily I

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
thought I got bad too maybe I did but

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.990 
thought I got bad too maybe I did but

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890

you<00:02:17.220> know<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.700> small<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.470> pretty<00:02:19.799> good<00:02:19.860> job

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you know so small it a pretty good job

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.010 
you know so small it a pretty good job
getting<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.660> know

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
getting the you know

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.890 
getting the you know
the<00:02:22.770> inner<00:02:22.920> corners<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.270> outer<00:02:24.420> corners

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the inner corners and the outer corners

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.540 
the inner corners and the outer corners
of<00:02:25.020> my<00:02:25.050> eyes<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:26.240> also<00:02:27.240> my<00:02:27.420> bottom<00:02:27.780> lashes<00:02:28.550> it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
of my eyes and also my bottom lashes it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.740 
of my eyes and also my bottom lashes it
wasn't<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.240> very<00:02:30.660> dramatic<00:02:31.550> effect<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.940> think

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
wasn't a very dramatic effect I think

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.120 
wasn't a very dramatic effect I think
the<00:02:33.840> picture<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.230> also<00:02:34.440> going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> show<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.070> I

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the picture is also going to show that I

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.940 
the picture is also going to show that I
didn't<00:02:35.430> really<00:02:35.610> add<00:02:35.850> too<00:02:36.060> much<00:02:36.180> volume<00:02:36.540> or<00:02:37.050> or

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
didn't really add too much volume or or

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.010 
didn't really add too much volume or or
lengthen<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.850> whole<00:02:39.150> lot<00:02:39.860> but<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.920> think<00:02:41.370> that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
lengthen the whole lot but I think that

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.540 
lengthen the whole lot but I think that
for<00:02:43.020> getting<00:02:43.350> building<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.890> little<00:02:44.160> lashes

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
for getting building that little lashes

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.690 
for getting building that little lashes

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
this did a pretty good job and a lot of

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.280 
this did a pretty good job and a lot of
girls<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.420> said<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.870> use<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.530> as<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.920> primer

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
girls have said to use this as a primer

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.630 
girls have said to use this as a primer
for<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.350> more<00:02:53.300> dramatic<00:02:54.300> mascara<00:02:55.290> like<00:02:55.710> covered

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
for a more dramatic mascara like covered

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.280 
for a more dramatic mascara like covered
or<00:02:56.760> lash<00:02:56.970> blast<00:02:57.390> or<00:02:58.760> l'oreal<00:02:59.760> voluminous<00:03:00.290> or

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
or lash blast or l'oreal voluminous or

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.580 
or lash blast or l'oreal voluminous or
just<00:03:01.830> something<00:03:02.370> some<00:03:02.550> other<00:03:02.640> mascara<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> I

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
just something some other mascara so I

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.970 
just something some other mascara so I
think<00:03:04.830> as<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> mascara<00:03:06.090> base<00:03:06.510> or<00:03:06.990> as<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.470> very

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
think as a mascara base or as a very

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.260 
think as a mascara base or as a very
light<00:03:08.520> mascara<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.540> did<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.690> pretty<00:03:09.960> good<00:03:10.110> job<00:03:10.170> I

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
light mascara it did a pretty good job I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.450 
light mascara it did a pretty good job I
definitely<00:03:12.270> needed<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.440> little<00:03:13.680> brush<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.280> get

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
definitely needed a little brush to get

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.790 
definitely needed a little brush to get
into<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.910> lane<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.330> them<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.290> parts<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.650> my

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
into the lane of them the parts of my

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.050 
into the lane of them the parts of my
eyes<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.400> other<00:03:17.640> mascaras<00:03:18.240> can't<00:03:18.540> get<00:03:18.840> there

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
eyes that other mascaras can't get there

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.500 
eyes that other mascaras can't get there
and

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.730 

and<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:25.440> think<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:25.890> you're<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.280> kind<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.790> lazy

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
and I think if you're just kind of lazy

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.440 
and I think if you're just kind of lazy
you<00:03:28.740> know<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.120> prolly<00:03:30.240> just

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
you know you just you can prolly just

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.240 
you know you just you can prolly just
put<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.620> gives<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> nice

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
put this on and it gives you a nice

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.270 
put this on and it gives you a nice
natural<00:03:32.630> lash<00:03:33.630> them<00:03:33.900> look<00:03:34.110> I'm<00:03:34.770> it's<00:03:34.980> not<00:03:35.100> you

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
natural lash them look I'm it's not you

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.710 
natural lash them look I'm it's not you
know<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.490> not<00:03:35.640> dramatic<00:03:35.880> if<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.420> really

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
know it's not dramatic if you really

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.780 
know it's not dramatic if you really
want<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.960> play<00:03:37.080> up<00:03:37.200> your<00:03:37.290> eyes<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:38.520> probably

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
this one but because this that this does

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.010 
this one but because this that this does
is<00:03:43.920> such<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> good<00:03:44.400> job<00:03:44.610> getting<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.360> all<00:03:45.780> the
