 four months writing and working 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.920
 to produce 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.580

 as a prominent Latino leader on the 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.130
 of the congressional hispanic caucus 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.540
 institute during its passage through the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.040
 carpet these were his words 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.040
 prior to receiving your acknowledgment 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.430
 only for this 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:48.590
 I always feel very grateful but 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.720
 for the prizes of the party and for a 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.770
 side the sector is always super super 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.810
 happy and honored at the same time is 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.850
 nervous about everything that is months and a half 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.130
 of the end but this 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.070
 I do not do the work that I do so that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.200
 and I talk about immigration reform made 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.760
 a studio the white house 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.769
 Y 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.159
 this year in 2013 and the benefits 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:24.689
 economic that the country would receive 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:29.640
 they make this reform over 700 million 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:32.549
 dollars I think that in these times only 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.640
 we are coming out of the crisis see that 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.129
 still you feel that this will be a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.230
 version to which he knows very little about his 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.060
 father as his brother shared this 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.519
 moment with the crisis is extremely 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.040
 important does more for her but for 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.980
 the whole Latino family 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.690
 and what you have to be present and I said 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.940
 that can be a father who is 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.700
 proud of his children and the achievements 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.359
 that he has obtained in the foster care where 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.359
 want to go 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.990
 also because it is very important 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.360
 brotherhood of my children is incomparable 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.860
 the renowned actress shares a moment 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.120
 very particular with her little valentina 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:21.810
 pigeon that last week supervises 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.190
 because I get nervous before talking 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.170
 to the public always and she was 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.450
 very nervous of the neighbor because there will be 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.240
 in front of the blood to the school nothing 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.470
 more first ignore all all 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:41.280
 groups is a project that we made to 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.640
 talk to the school but what is your 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.910
 project of our favorite things and 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.910
 the twin flutes as with guacamole 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.510
 who are Mexican because I had to 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.730
 presentation of these flowers then 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.860
 that lets me know 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.860
 how you feel also Mexican 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.040
 It's also American, you also have to 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.040
 understand what you want to say 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.840
 the husband fans 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.840
