the bobby pin and then go ahead and do
the<00:01:51.329> same<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> other<00:01:51.810> side<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.860> that's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
the same with the other side and that's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.480 
the same with the other side and that's
it<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.509> done<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.049> loved<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it it's all done I loved it it's a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.090 
it it's all done I loved it it's a
success

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.190 

this<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> second<00:02:01.880> one<00:02:02.030> it's<00:02:02.299> supposed<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.020> be

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
this is a second one it's supposed to be

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.289 
this is a second one it's supposed to be
sort<00:02:03.530> of<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.710> twist<00:02:04.009> updo<00:02:04.340> that's<00:02:04.700> really<00:02:05.149> easy

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
sort of a twist updo that's really easy

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.899 
sort of a twist updo that's really easy
to<00:02:05.540> do<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:06.350> would<00:02:06.439> probably<00:02:06.680> only<00:02:06.979> take<00:02:07.369> five

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
to do that would probably only take five

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.719 
to do that would probably only take five
minutes<00:02:07.939> at<00:02:08.509> best<00:02:08.800> what<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:09.950> do<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.429> put

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
minutes at best what you do is you put

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.760 
minutes at best what you do is you put
split<00:02:11.120> your<00:02:11.270> hair<00:02:11.450> up<00:02:11.630> and<00:02:11.840> go<00:02:12.500> ahead<00:02:12.620> and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
split your hair up and go ahead and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.339 
split your hair up and go ahead and
twist<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:13.340> until<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:14.420> could<00:02:14.569> start<00:02:14.840> twisting

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
twist it until you could start twisting

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.040 
twist it until you could start twisting
it<00:02:15.470> into<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.800> tiny<00:02:16.160> little<00:02:16.400> bun<00:02:16.730> at<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.720> nape<00:02:17.900> of

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
it into a tiny little bun at the nape of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.830 
it into a tiny little bun at the nape of
your<00:02:18.110> neck<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.709> then<00:02:19.580> what<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> did<00:02:20.330> was<00:02:20.630> go

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
your neck and then what I did was go

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.410 
your neck and then what I did was go
ahead<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.290> put<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> bobby<00:02:21.739> pin<00:02:21.890> right<00:02:22.420> into

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
ahead and put a bobby pin right into

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.410 
ahead and put a bobby pin right into
there<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:26.890> then<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:27.920> took<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.670> other<00:02:28.880> side<00:02:29.269> and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
there and then I took the other side and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
there and then I took the other side and
do<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.540> same<00:02:29.660> thing<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.560> twist<00:02:30.950> twist<00:02:31.280> twist

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
do the same thing so I twist twist twist

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.270 
do the same thing so I twist twist twist
until<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.660> could<00:02:33.080> start<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.500> put<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.739> into<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.010> bun

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
until I could start to put it into a bun

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.789 
until I could start to put it into a bun
and<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:38.120> instead<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:38.690> making<00:02:39.140> its<00:02:39.290> own<00:02:39.530> bun

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
and then instead of making its own bun

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.830 
and then instead of making its own bun
you<00:02:40.069> wrap<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.370> around<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:41.000> other<00:02:41.090> bun<00:02:41.540> and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
you wrap it around the other bun and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.220 
you wrap it around the other bun and
then<00:02:42.440> pin<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:43.010> into<00:02:43.310> place<00:02:43.690> this<00:02:44.690> one<00:02:44.989> was

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
then pin that into place this one was

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.589 
then pin that into place this one was
okay<00:02:45.950> didn't<00:02:46.640> really<00:02:46.910> do<00:02:47.060> what<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.239> wanted<00:02:47.540> to

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
okay didn't really do what I wanted to

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.960 
okay didn't really do what I wanted to
do<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.019> started<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.410> fall<00:02:48.620> apart

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
do and it started to fall apart

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.630 
do and it started to fall apart
unfortunately<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> idea<00:02:51.590> for<00:02:52.160> this<00:02:52.340> i

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
unfortunately so the idea for this i

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.360 
unfortunately so the idea for this i
found<00:02:53.060> i<00:02:53.330> think<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.690> cosmopolitan<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:55.250> go

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
found i think on cosmopolitan and you go

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.830 
found i think on cosmopolitan and you go
ahead<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.790> braid<00:02:56.090> both<00:02:56.330> sides<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.780> your

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
ahead and you braid both sides of your

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.930 
ahead and you braid both sides of your
hair<00:02:57.049> just<00:02:57.200> regular<00:02:57.709> braid<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.610> that's<00:02:58.760> why<00:02:58.910> i

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
hair just regular braid so that's why i

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.600 
hair just regular braid so that's why i
did<00:02:59.180> i<00:02:59.209> braided<00:02:59.599> both<00:02:59.900> sides<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.560> then<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.799> tied

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
did i braided both sides and then I tied

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.050 
did i braided both sides and then I tied
them<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.620> then<00:03:03.950> what<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.220> do<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.609> you<00:03:05.030> take

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
them up and then what you do is you take

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.690 
them up and then what you do is you take
a<00:03:05.269> flat<00:03:05.600> iron<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.920> go<00:03:07.100> ahead<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.400> just

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
a flat iron and you go ahead and just

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.240 
a flat iron and you go ahead and just
keep<00:03:08.060> going<00:03:08.510> over<00:03:08.810> those<00:03:09.200> braids<00:03:09.650> for<00:03:10.220> a

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
keep going over those braids for a

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.400 
keep going over those braids for a
couple<00:03:10.730> minutes<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:11.239> think<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.510> did<00:03:11.690> about<00:03:11.810> three

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
couple minutes I think I did about three

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.559 
couple minutes I think I did about three
to<00:03:12.530> five<00:03:12.709> minutes<00:03:12.769> on<00:03:13.250> both<00:03:13.430> sides<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.030> of

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
to five minutes on both sides and of

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.449 
to five minutes on both sides and of
course<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:14.959> curled<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.380> end<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.799> kind<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.310> match

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
course I curled the end so kind of match

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.970 
course I curled the end so kind of match
the<00:03:16.700> rest<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.450> then<00:03:18.290> after<00:03:18.920> you're

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the rest of it and then after you're

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.610 
the rest of it and then after you're
done<00:03:19.180> ironing<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.989> go<00:03:21.140> ahead<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.500> take

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620
