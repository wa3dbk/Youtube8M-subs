the 50s the X is really far back that's
about<00:02:22.630> right<00:02:22.840> here<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.410> consequently<00:02:24.450> these

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
about right here so consequently these

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.030 
about right here so consequently these

could<00:05:22.090> really<00:05:22.210> be<00:05:22.449> better<00:05:22.629> about<00:05:22.840> this<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.229> if

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
could really be better about this is if

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:24.899 
could really be better about this is if
it<00:05:23.470> was<00:05:23.560> a<00:05:23.590> sunburst<00:05:24.099> I<00:05:24.370> mean<00:05:24.520> if<00:05:24.610> there's<00:05:24.819> two

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
it was a sunburst I mean if there's two

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.999 
it was a sunburst I mean if there's two
sunburst<00:05:25.360> then<00:05:26.110> that<00:05:26.289> would<00:05:26.409> be<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.889> know

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
sunburst then that would be you know

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.529 
sunburst then that would be you know
that<00:05:27.220> big<00:05:27.400> it<00:05:27.580> I<00:05:27.729> just<00:05:27.940> have<00:05:28.120> to<00:05:28.240> take<00:05:28.360> this

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
that big it I just have to take this

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.230 
that big it I just have to take this
guitar<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.129> I'm<00:05:30.129> going<00:05:30.460> off<00:05:30.580> with<00:05:30.849> it<00:05:31.000> but

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.020 
guitar and I'm going off with it but
unfortunately<00:05:31.750> it's<00:05:32.289> the<00:05:32.349> natural<00:05:32.530> shock<00:05:33.030> so

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
unfortunately it's the natural shock so

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.330 
unfortunately it's the natural shock so
I<00:05:34.060> just<00:05:34.330> never<00:05:34.509> get<00:05:34.750> a<00:05:34.810> sound<00:05:35.080> that's<00:05:35.229> good<00:05:35.500> you

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
know it's a sunburst guitar would I

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.709 
know it's a sunburst guitar would I
suppose<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.460> could<00:05:39.639> spray<00:05:39.879> paint<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.389> a<00:05:40.509> little

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
suppose I could spray paint it a little

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.619 
suppose I could spray paint it a little
bit<00:05:40.960> go<00:05:41.830> ahead<00:05:41.860> and<00:05:42.159> you<00:05:42.219> know<00:05:42.370> for<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.389> black

we're<00:05:43.900> in<00:05:44.050> but<00:05:44.349> it's<00:05:44.979> just<00:05:45.099> not<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.520> same<00:05:45.699> as

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
we're in but it's just not the same as

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.879 
we're in but it's just not the same as
when<00:05:46.240> it's<00:05:46.389> done<00:05:46.599> somebody's<00:05:47.349> to<00:05:47.500> Fishtown
