it does all this until the last last
couple<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.410> poles<00:00:43.620> haven't

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.880 

I'm<00:00:53.660> gonna<00:00:53.870> say<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.079> last<00:00:54.290> couple<00:00:54.560> of<00:00:54.650> bulls

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
I'm gonna say the last couple of bulls

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.410 
I'm gonna say the last couple of bulls
have<00:00:55.040> drifted<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:55.550> right<00:00:55.790> this<00:00:56.000> time<00:00:56.060> he

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
have drifted to the right this time he

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.720 
have drifted to the right this time he
keeps<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:56.780> pretty<00:00:56.870> much<00:00:57.110> dead<00:00:57.350> center<00:00:57.730> Mills

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
keeps it pretty much dead center Mills

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.640 
keeps it pretty much dead center Mills
had<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:58.940> boater<00:00:59.239> go<00:00:59.480> sour<00:00:59.809> on<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.230> had<00:01:00.350> a<00:01:00.380> fuel

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
had a boater go sour on it had a fuel

had a boater go sour on it had a fuel
problem<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.220> see<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.550> black<00:01:01.760> smoke<00:01:01.790> puffs

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
problem you see the black smoke puffs

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.329 
problem you see the black smoke puffs
out<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.720> it<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.020> went<00:01:03.170> down<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.500> track<00:01:03.739> and

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
out of it and went down the track and

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.770 
out of it and went down the track and
that<00:01:04.519> just<00:01:04.820> showing<00:01:05.059> you<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.269> he's<00:01:05.540> probably

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
that just showing you that he's probably

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.110 
that just showing you that he's probably
pumping<00:01:06.590> too<00:01:06.740> much<00:01:06.920> fuel<00:01:07.280> in<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.610> cylinders

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
pumping too much fuel in the cylinders

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.150 
pumping too much fuel in the cylinders
part<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.420> its<00:01:08.540> not<00:01:08.690> burning<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.770> puffs<00:01:09.979> out

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
part of its not burning and it puffs out

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.620 
part of its not burning and it puffs out
the<00:01:10.369> smoke<00:01:10.640> they're<00:01:10.880> flooding<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.270> cylinders

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
the smoke they're flooding the cylinders

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.060 
the smoke they're flooding the cylinders
on<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:12.020> just<00:01:12.260> didn't<00:01:12.560> run<00:01:12.680> well

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
on it it just didn't run well

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.370 
on it it just didn't run well
watch<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.670> back<00:01:14.300> motor<00:01:14.690> and<00:01:14.869> I<00:01:14.900> think<00:01:15.170> that's

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
watch the back motor and I think that's

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.930 
watch the back motor and I think that's
where<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.890> see<00:01:16.070> some<00:01:16.250> black<00:01:16.610> smoke

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
where it is you see some black smoke

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.430 
where it is you see some black smoke
coming<00:01:17.119> out<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.510> cylinders<00:01:17.990> he's

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
coming out of the cylinders he's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.560 
coming out of the cylinders he's
flooding<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:18.979> engine<00:01:19.130> down<00:01:19.610> it's<00:01:20.150> smothering

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
flooding the engine down it's smothering

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.600 
flooding the engine down it's smothering
it<00:01:20.690> now<00:01:20.840> too<00:01:21.110> much<00:01:21.290> fuel<00:01:21.619> is<00:01:21.770> not<00:01:22.190> hooking<00:01:22.490> up

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
it now too much fuel is not hooking up

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.219 
it now too much fuel is not hooking up
well<00:01:23.180> you<00:01:23.210> call<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:23.720> right<00:01:23.869> look<00:01:24.110> at<00:01:24.200> that

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
well you call that right look at that

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.130 
well you call that right look at that
black<00:01:24.470> smoke<00:01:24.650> he's<00:01:25.220> also<00:01:25.399> got<00:01:25.759> a<00:01:25.790> fit<00:01:26.149> wheel<00:01:26.810> on

it you see it just kind of kind of

it you see it just kind of kind of
hesitate<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:03.129> little<00:03:03.190> bit<00:03:03.489> getting<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.120> little

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
hesitate a little bit getting a little

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.910 
hesitate a little bit getting a little
background<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:05.019> it<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.260> way<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.590> does<00:03:05.739> the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
background of it the way it does the

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.039 
background of it the way it does the
power<00:03:06.129> drops<00:03:06.489> goes<00:03:06.819> away<00:03:07.030> from<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.569> much

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
power drops goes away from it it is much

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.119 
power drops goes away from it it is much
like<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.349> sieve

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129

picks up and runs again I think it's a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.080 
picks up and runs again I think it's a
fuel<00:03:11.680> distribution<00:03:12.340> problem<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.730> look<00:03:12.849> for<00:03:13.000> it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
fuel distribution problem I look for it

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.580 
fuel distribution problem I look for it
because<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.360> worked<00:03:13.599> out<00:03:13.810> when<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.200> happens

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
because it worked out when that happens

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.720 
because it worked out when that happens

I<00:06:16.449> was<00:06:16.659> trying<00:06:16.900> to<00:06:16.960> decide<00:06:17.259> to<00:06:17.409> hit<00:06:17.500> the<00:06:17.650> brake

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
I was trying to decide to hit the brake

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.529 
I was trying to decide to hit the brake
how<00:06:18.039> much<00:06:18.250> to<00:06:18.430> hit<00:06:18.550> it<00:06:18.669> and<00:06:19.060> I<00:06:19.150> think<00:06:19.210> that's

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
how much to hit it and I think that's

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.689 
how much to hit it and I think that's
about<00:06:19.659> when<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.259> box<00:06:20.440> is<00:06:20.620> topping<00:06:21.009> and<00:06:21.159> I

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
about when the box is topping and I

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.100 
about when the box is topping and I
really<00:06:22.000> didn't<00:06:22.270> wasn't<00:06:22.570> paying<00:06:22.719> attention

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110
