00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
yeah that was like probably about 13

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.229 
yeah that was like probably about 13
years<00:00:42.300> ago<00:00:42.690> now<00:00:43.110> nowadays<00:00:43.829> people<00:00:44.550> don't<00:00:44.820> use

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
years ago now nowadays people don't use

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.940 
years ago now nowadays people don't use
these<00:00:45.420> type<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> televisions<00:00:46.230> anymore<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
these type of televisions anymore and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.350 
these type of televisions anymore and
they<00:00:47.250> try<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.610> rid<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.789> them<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.210> no<00:00:48.329> one

they try to get rid of them but no one
wants<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:48.930> because<00:00:49.170> they're<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.530> large<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

this one is somewhere between a hundred
and<00:00:56.340> fifty<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.120> about<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> hundred<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> seventy

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.799 
and fifty to about a hundred and seventy
pounds<00:01:01.160> now<00:01:02.160> how<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.820> topic<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.359> came

up<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.260> whole<00:01:04.439> video<00:01:05.129> adapter<00:01:05.640> thing<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
up with the whole video adapter thing is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.219 
up with the whole video adapter thing is
someone<00:01:06.240> asked<00:01:06.510> me<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> question

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
someone asked me a question

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.850 
someone asked me a question
back<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.890> December<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> last<00:01:08.520> year<00:01:09.320> about<00:01:10.320> the

the<00:01:11.549> cubby<00:01:11.880> truck<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.420> QB<00:01:12.869> truck<00:01:13.140> however<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the cubby truck or QB truck however you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.120 
the cubby truck or QB truck however you
want<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> pronounce<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.979> there<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
want to pronounce it and there is a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
want to pronounce it and there is a
particular<00:01:17.610> pin<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.140> does

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
particular pin on here that does

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.700 
particular pin on here that does
something<00:01:19.860> called<00:01:20.100> CV<00:01:20.930> BS<00:01:21.930> which<00:01:22.350> stands<00:01:22.619> for

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
something called CV BS which stands for

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.330 
something called CV BS which stands for
composite<00:01:23.400> video<00:01:23.780> broadcast<00:01:24.780> signal<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
composite video broadcast signal of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
composite video broadcast signal of
course<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.700> don't<00:01:26.759> know<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.509> answer<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.110> but

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
course I don't know the answer to it but

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
course I don't know the answer to it but
I<00:01:28.259> know<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.189> converters<00:01:29.970> out

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
I know that there are converters out

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.319 
I know that there are converters out
there<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.650> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> similar

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
there that can kind of do a similar

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.859 
there that can kind of do a similar
thing<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> got<00:01:35.759> two<00:01:36.000> different<00:01:36.150> items<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
thing so I got two different items and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.780 
thing so I got two different items and
this<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.259> does<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.040> work<00:01:39.710> this<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> VGA<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
this one does not work this is a VGA to

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.260 
this one does not work this is a VGA to
s-video<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.899> also<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:47.270> composite

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
s-video and there's also a composite

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.399 
s-video and there's also a composite
video<00:01:48.509> end<00:01:49.759> that<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.119> plug<00:01:51.810> into<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.110> TV

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
video end that you can plug into your TV

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.770 
video end that you can plug into your TV
it<00:01:53.040> doesn't<00:01:53.369> work<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:56.219> VGA<00:01:56.640> signal

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
it doesn't work because the VGA signal

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.560 
it doesn't work because the VGA signal
directly<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.060> the<00:02:00.060> TV<00:02:00.390> doesn't

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
directly the the the TV doesn't

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
directly the the the TV doesn't
understand<00:02:01.049> VJ<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.590> only<00:02:01.799> understands<00:02:02.520> RCA

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
understand VJ it only understands RCA

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.120 
understand VJ it only understands RCA
and<00:02:03.360> there's<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:04.020> no<00:02:04.259> conversion<00:02:04.740> that's

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and there's really no conversion that's

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.930 
and there's really no conversion that's
done<00:02:05.369> when<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> comes<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> other<00:02:06.990> end<00:02:07.940> now

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
done when it comes out the other end now

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.350 
done when it comes out the other end now
if<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.119> had<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.539> VGA<00:02:09.929> port<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:11.610> output

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
if you had a VGA port that can output

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.640 
if you had a VGA port that can output
RCA

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
RCA

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.970 
RCA
then<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.299> work<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.470> cubby<00:02:16.680> truck

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
then this would work but the cubby truck

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.399 
then this would work but the cubby truck
doesn't<00:02:17.489> do<00:02:17.579> that<00:02:17.730> through<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.569> VGA<00:02:18.959> port

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
doesn't do that through the VGA port

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.440 
doesn't do that through the VGA port
which<00:02:20.250> brings<00:02:20.579> us<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.750> converter<00:02:22.500> box

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
which brings us to the the converter box

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.420 
which brings us to the the converter box
which<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:26.030> small<00:02:27.030> box<00:02:28.099> over<00:02:29.099> here<00:02:29.129> you

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
which is this small box over here you

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.979 
which is this small box over here you
got<00:02:29.549> buttons<00:02:29.939> on<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.299> side<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.950> zoom<00:02:32.189> button

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
got buttons on one side the zoom button

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.080 
got buttons on one side the zoom button
that<00:02:33.989> kind<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.290> toggles<00:02:34.859> overscan<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
that kind of toggles overscan that's the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.759 
that kind of toggles overscan that's the
important<00:02:36.569> one<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.329> some<00:02:39.510> red<00:02:39.769> switches

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
important one you have some red switches

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.830 
important one you have some red switches
if<00:02:41.640> they're<00:02:41.939> both<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.629> down<00:02:42.810> position

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
if they're both in the down position

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.830 
if they're both in the down position
that<00:02:43.709> does<00:02:43.859> American<00:02:44.340> televisions<00:02:44.909> and<00:02:45.180> if

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
that does American televisions and if

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.809 
that does American televisions and if
they're<00:02:45.989> both<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> up<00:02:46.859> position<00:02:47.069> that

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
they're both in the up position that

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.830 
they're both in the up position that
does<00:02:48.060> European<00:02:48.930> television<00:02:49.260> standards<00:02:50.840> then

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
does European television standards then

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.440 
does European television standards then
you<00:02:51.989> have<00:02:52.139> VGA<00:02:52.379> out<00:02:52.829> s-video<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> middle

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
you have VGA out s-video in the middle

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.729 
you have VGA out s-video in the middle
and<00:02:54.659> then<00:02:55.290> all<00:02:55.650> importantly<00:02:56.459> is<00:02:56.959> video<00:02:57.959> out

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
and then all importantly is video out

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.910 
and then all importantly is video out
which<00:02:59.639> is<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.030> yellow<00:03:00.569> plug<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.739> goes

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
which is this yellow plug and it goes

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.170 
which is this yellow plug and it goes
into<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.340> yellow<00:03:02.939> plug<00:03:03.239> on<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:04.109> television

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
into the yellow plug on the television

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.059 
into the yellow plug on the television
so<00:03:06.180> let's<00:03:06.689> plug<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:09.709> this<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.889> the

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
so let's plug this in this is the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:27.980 
so let's plug this in this is the
default<00:03:11.579> Android<00:03:12.030> image<00:03:12.389> that<00:03:12.659> it<00:03:12.750> comes<00:03:12.930> with

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.590 

and<00:03:29.040> probably<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.490> display<00:03:30.970> doesn't<00:03:31.330> look

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
and probably the display doesn't look

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.870 
and probably the display doesn't look
good<00:03:32.110> at<00:03:32.320> all<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:32.710> the<00:03:32.830> video<00:03:33.100> but<00:03:33.580> it's

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
good at all on the video but it's

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.510 
good at all on the video but it's
actually<00:03:34.300> viewable<00:03:35.080> I<00:03:35.350> wouldn't<00:03:36.130> recommend

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
actually viewable I wouldn't recommend

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.540 
actually viewable I wouldn't recommend
