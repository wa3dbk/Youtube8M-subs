00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:12.370
 This time, I would like to talk about the post-flower management of the Strepto car path 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:16.070
 In Streptomyces car path now this say 8 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:21.530
 I think that in many cases has been around in 'em entered 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:25.460
 It seems like generations after buying it, and it looks like this for about 23 months 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:32.470
 The leaves are very big and flowers 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:35.510
 I think that comes finished live yes So-conditioned quad was over flowers 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.980
 Picking flowers and organizing stocks 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.890
 I think I want to talk 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.190
 Phew 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:51.940
 I'm picking flowers but Strepka Pass is the person who is the origin of this large leaf 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.930
 Extending the flower stalk out stems from the time of the people of yes original 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.590
 I went extend the jar in ahead 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.590
 I agree 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.440
 There are about 10 flowers 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.610
 When one flower is over, the next one blooms and the next one is old, and so on. 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.030
 Well about school 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:16.230
 Terrible will end the role of the Konohana Ward machine When you no longer yes than come with magic and species 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.830
 It is important to keep it 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.280
 This flower will catch you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.650
 I'm going to drink rock key If all the flowers have been avoided 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.650
 Return to the origin of the flower stem 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:41.200
 Because it is a plant which blooms one after another, I think that many things that the flower is over will come out to the whole stock 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.740
 I will organize all this 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.130
 Yes next is the arrangement of teeth yes 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.100
 If you are growing Strepto Carpas 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 Leaves to come full wooded tend to flower is a little hard luck 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.560
 Yes to 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.560
 The bud is this 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.320
 In the plant to come up to the voice from the direction of the original tooth 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:13.170
 It is said that there are too many big leaves 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:18.410
 Big leaf in to or could not see after the Yes I'm difficult to increase flower bud 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.840
 And large will continue to drop from the color of the bad leaves 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.670
 For example 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.310
 2 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.819
 For example 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.650
 Yes such Fu to those damaged cutting edge is a little 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:35.110
 And the color faded 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:40.329
 That's because the end of this is a bit lighter than the one here 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:43.969
 It is from those of the original tooth, which will continue to drop preferentially the 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.060
 You can take fallen to easily Fu say 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:51.620
 Large Hatcher par and in 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.120
 The stretched it Happaita do bad nutrient of leaf color 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.120
 We will drop it preferentially 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.670
 This way in the form of a star leaves much bigger than any time 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.290
 And the end of the flower 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.420
 Picked and a 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:18.239
 Fertilizer You may want to give fertilizers of good ingredients to the flowers . 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:21.299
 Good to the skin from being overgrown only leaves and give something fertilizer of foliage plants that leaves 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.319
 Give me a feed rich in ingredients and 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.470
 If it can be done 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.700
 When we repot in big bowl 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.110
 It is getting more and more coming up 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.450
 By say 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.700
 Streptocar's 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.700
 Management after flower is above
