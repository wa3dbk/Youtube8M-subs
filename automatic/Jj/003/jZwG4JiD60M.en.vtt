00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.090
 after nine years and five games of 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.769
 halo is already between us the beta of 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.940
 what is the new bungee bet 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.750
 after leaving the master boss behind 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.750
 from me 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.040
 finally we can try first hand 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.040
 part of what this game has to 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.200
 offer that is freedom a lot of action and 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.410
 giant monsters but let's not get ahead 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.410
 events 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.880
 of this wine situates 700 years in the future 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.250
 in a world where a strange moon 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.350
 call to the traveler perched on the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.270
 Earth bringing a new life to our 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.070
 solar system what allowed the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.900
 humanity throw itself into the conquest of 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.430
 space 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.379
 but that utopia broke at the time 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.629
 that the enemies of the 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.180
 traveler that was dedicated to exterminate 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.710
 everything they found in their path 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.990
 standing one last human city 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.230
 created under the protection of that strange 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.120
 Moon 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.220
 now our mission as guardians 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.260
 will be to protect this city while 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.910
 we travel on other planets trying 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.620
 unravel how to end the threat 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.620
 that looms over us 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.690
 The first thing we will have to do to 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.120
 begin our adventure will be to create 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.950
 our character for it we will have 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.479
 three classes that will be what they define 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.120
 just a little bit our way of game 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.220
 because they are a bit because the weapons that 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.750
 we will find are not specific to 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.850
 class and the ability to go 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.250
 personalizing our character will be 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.050
 is what really allows us 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.480
 adapt it to our style but not for 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.120
 that we will stop reviewing the classes 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.100
 titans brute force for those 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.900
 players who walk unceremoniously and 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.570
 to which the word coverage sounds 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.190
 cake your defender skill is perfect 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 to create a shield that protects a 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.390
 ally while you take advantage of the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.330
 strong shield to go to distribute by 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.060
 reason 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.070
 hunter is a useful class both long 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.290
 distance for its accuracy as to short 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.880
 thanks to skills like gunslinger that 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.280
 allows to invoke a weapon of short range 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.020
 but lethal or acrobat the edge that 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.780
 allows to load the blade of the weapon with 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.610
 electricity the negative part of this 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.650
 class is that it does not possess the resistance in 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.480
 the shield that the titan has 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.790
 that would be used more for raids 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.640
 fast between the enemy 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.409
 the arcane power sorcerer channeled from 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.420
 the light of the traveler as you can 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.819
 imagine the light in destiny is very 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.739
 important and the sorcerer benefits 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.719
 of his abilities in his control to 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.390
 improve things like your resistance and the 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.430
 regeneration is the typical character 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.049
 made to maintain coverage that does not 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.980
 that's why it stops having a capacity 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.290
 lethal commendable 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.060
 we have several breed options in the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.860
 that can eradicate every class and a 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.330
 surprising amount of options 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.610
 customization where we can 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.680
 modify its color and physiognomy with 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.140
 predefined options races 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.879
 available are humans who are the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.640
 usual representation of the past 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.530
 inhabitants of the earth insomnia a 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.060
 mysterious race from which they have not 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.860
 unveiled many details 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.280
 the typical glamorous race that we 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.160
 remember the elves 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.170
 and the exo machines that I do not know 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.910
 they have given many details more than bungee 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.840
 has been inspired by the master teacher and 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.090
 terminator to create them 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.069
 once we created our character and 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.550
 we are prepared to take our 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.590
 role as guardians 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.510
 all right 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.280
 both the mode of exploration that we 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.290
 will allow you to discover the scenarios and 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.060
 missions like story mode are the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.430
 suitable ways for us to do to the 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.170
 character and let's discover what it is 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.780
 what benefits us the most at the time 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.700
 to play 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.860
 We have several types of weapons 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.200
 available that will be divided into the weapon 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.270
 primary secondary and special and 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.760
 we will find a great variety of them 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.069
 in the beta we can only equip the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.110
 weapons up to level 8 that is the cap but 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.910
 even if we reach this level we will see 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.560
 that the fight remains balanced and that 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.500
 some special enemies will follow 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.630
 being a challenge 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.730
 during our trip we will find 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.380
 also cryptograms that the tower we 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.380
 decrypt to validate the redundancy 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.699
 oh my god what the hell is that and that 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.889
 They allow us access to weapons and 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.540
 special or unusual armor with 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.550
 the characteristic that evolve 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.949
 allowing us to improve them as we 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.900
 we are using them this will allow us 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.430
 fall in love with one of these pieces and 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.430
 use it until we get bored 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.050
 apart from the scan mode and the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.930
 history mode of stem and will have 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.969
 several multiplayer modes one 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.439
 cooperative called assault in which we 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.439
 we will face waves of enemies 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:53.180
 together with two colleagues this will be done 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.099

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.930
 competitive that I could not miss and that 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.490
 we will carry out in the crucible of 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.919
 moment we will be limited to a single 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.840
 control game mode where we should go 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.759
 taking points from the map but once 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.879
 launched the game we can enjoy 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:18.949
 from other pvp modes going back to the topic 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.900
 of the locations in this mode of 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.599

 moon this competitive mode is expected 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.000
 have sands scattered throughout the 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.030
 solar system thing that we can not 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.430
 Wait to see 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.380
 during the battles in the crucible we will go 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.300
 gathering points and rising rank that 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.400
 will be used to buy armors and 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.440
 special weapons although it will not be so 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.270
 easy we are facing a 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.220
 balanced multiplayer in which 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.260
 we will lose the heavy weapons every time 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.000
 that reappears moss we will cross with 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.130

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.360
 beta but I hope to be more sacred 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.040
 continuously in a multiplayer not os 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.050
 Take away the desire to enjoy this 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.330
 game or its graphic section very 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.940
 showy care fruit at the time of 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.100

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.690
 the libri and friends will be 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.850

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.880
 life to the scenarios

 Definitely destiny is a game that 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.550
 point ways and with this vein and try 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.200
 reaffirm its intention to create a 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.760
 new social experience in games 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.100
 of action in which the players 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.840
 coincide in a natural way by exploring the 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.840
 vast universe that has created bungee 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.120
 I hope you have chosen wisely 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.240
