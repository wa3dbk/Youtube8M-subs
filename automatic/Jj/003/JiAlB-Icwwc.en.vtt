it would have made it more not as dry

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.480 
it would have made it more not as dry
maybe<00:05:18.569> they<00:05:18.720> overcook<00:05:19.289> the<00:05:19.470> eggs<00:05:19.650> I<00:05:20.039> don't

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
maybe they overcook the eggs I don't

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.430 
maybe they overcook the eggs I don't
know<00:05:20.580> how<00:05:20.759> they<00:05:20.909> prepare<00:05:21.659> the<00:05:21.780> eggs<00:05:21.930> here<00:05:22.259> I

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.820 
know how they prepare the eggs here I
always<00:05:22.979> it's<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.370> liquid<00:05:23.550> egg<00:05:23.900> so<00:05:24.900> I<00:05:25.229> don't<00:05:25.770> know
