00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
can't be away from her for too long so

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.509 
can't be away from her for too long so
I've<00:02:18.820> sort<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.180> put<00:02:19.420> off<00:02:19.450> my<00:02:19.780> own<00:02:19.959> life<00:02:20.519> goals

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.610 
I've sort of put off my own life goals
in<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.940> interim<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.330> decided<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.840> maybe<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
in the interim I decided that maybe it

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.460 
in the interim I decided that maybe it
would<00:02:23.769> be<00:02:23.800> fun<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.430> become<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.970> YouTube<00:02:25.300> partner

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
would be fun to become a YouTube partner

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.840 
would be fun to become a YouTube partner
so<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> did<00:02:26.920> all<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.340> things<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.640> were

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
so I did all the things that were

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.910 
so I did all the things that were
necessary<00:02:28.000> i<00:02:28.510> took<00:02:28.989> all<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> copyrighted

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
necessary i took all the copyrighted

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.800 
necessary i took all the copyrighted
information<00:02:30.010> off<00:02:30.580> my<00:02:30.910> channel<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.690> was

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
information off my channel and it was

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.300 
information off my channel and it was
usually<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.320> background<00:02:32.800> song<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.280> i

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
usually like a background song that i

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.830 
usually like a background song that i
had<00:02:33.459> used<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> picture<00:02:34.269> that<00:02:34.450> didn't<00:02:34.690> belong

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
had used or a picture that didn't belong

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.900 
had used or a picture that didn't belong
to<00:02:35.080> me<00:02:35.200> i<00:02:35.410> referenced<00:02:36.160> everything<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.790> my

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
to me i referenced everything in my

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.970 
to me i referenced everything in my
videos<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.780> then<00:02:38.140> i<00:02:38.170> applied<00:02:38.500> for<00:02:38.530> google

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
videos and then i applied for google

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.460 
videos and then i applied for google
adsense<00:02:39.190> two<00:02:40.030> things<00:02:40.360> happened<00:02:40.870> there<00:02:41.200> were

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
adsense two things happened there were

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.280 
adsense two things happened there were
videos<00:02:42.190> where<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:42.880> used<00:02:43.239> classical<00:02:43.750> music<00:02:44.170> in

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
videos where I used classical music in

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.140 
videos where I used classical music in
the<00:02:44.380> background<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.670> actually<00:02:45.850> thought

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
the background and I actually thought

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.940 
the background and I actually thought
there<00:02:46.360> was<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.510> rule<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.440> use<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.709> piece

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
there was a rule like if you use a piece

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.560 
there was a rule like if you use a piece
of<00:02:47.980> music<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.579> was<00:02:48.670> composed<00:02:49.060> by<00:02:49.180> somebody

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
of music that was composed by somebody

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.789 
of music that was composed by somebody
who's<00:02:49.750> been<00:02:49.780> deceased<00:02:50.230> for<00:02:50.260> more<00:02:50.680> than

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
who's been deceased for more than

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.440 
who's been deceased for more than
hundred<00:02:51.100> years<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.519> thought<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.120> was<00:02:52.180> kind<00:02:52.390> of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
hundred years I thought it was kind of

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.720 
hundred years I thought it was kind of
like<00:02:52.570> free<00:02:52.930> game<00:02:53.140> apparently<00:02:53.769> it's<00:02:54.130> not<00:02:54.370> that

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
like free game apparently it's not that

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.539 
like free game apparently it's not that
way<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.870> orchestra<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.799> plays<00:02:57.130> that

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
way so the orchestra that plays that

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.910 
way so the orchestra that plays that
piece<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.820> music<00:02:58.329> copyrights<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.530> version

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
piece of music copyrights that version

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.200 
piece of music copyrights that version
of<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.850> piece

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
of the piece

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.240 
of the piece
music<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.690> they<00:03:01.810> play<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.440> I've<00:03:03.070> got<00:03:03.220> a

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
them all so I had a huge disagreement

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.420

with<00:03:16.360> Google<00:03:16.720> about<00:03:17.140> like<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.950> ads<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.340> were

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.180 
with Google about like the ads that were
on<00:03:18.610> my<00:03:18.730> channel<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.270> they<00:03:19.840> ended<00:03:20.200> up<00:03:20.320> like

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
on my channel and they ended up like

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.820 
on my channel and they ended up like
deactivating<00:03:22.000> my<00:03:22.030> account<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.840> as<00:03:23.410> soon<00:03:23.530> as<00:03:23.710> I

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
deactivating my account and as soon as I

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.890

wanted<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:24.460> I<00:03:24.640> tried<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.120> appeal<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.810> it

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
wanted to like I tried to appeal and it

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.420 
wanted to like I tried to appeal and it
didn't<00:03:26.080> work<00:03:26.140> out<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:26.710> I<00:03:26.740> was<00:03:27.070> kind<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.310> like

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
though a couple of my friends were

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.270 
though a couple of my friends were
talking<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:35.140> me<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.500> said<00:03:35.800> that<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.010> should

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
thought it was a great idea something

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.390 
thought it was a great idea something
fun<00:03:40.180> for<00:03:40.210> me<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.570> do<00:03:40.720> in<00:03:41.050> between<00:03:41.590> now<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:42.190> when
