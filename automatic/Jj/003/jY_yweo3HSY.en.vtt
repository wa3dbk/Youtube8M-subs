00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.889
 hello welcome to medication and ya.com 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.630
 today we are going to make a prawns fideuá 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.270
 they were going to be rolls but I have not found 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.550
 so I have not changed it and we're going to 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.100
 make a fideuá of prawns and see what 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.660
 easy how rich and in less than half an hour 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.550
 we started the list of ingredients as 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.109
 always in the blog thousand and kitchens 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.480
 dot com 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.999
 we will start suffering what is one of the 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.029
 little eyes and onion we put a little 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:34.520
 of oil in our in our paella pan 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.079
 and we started lowering the fire a little 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.100
 because I had it high enough so that 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.780
 It will heat well what is my bathtub and 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.780
 we will throw the garlic and the onion 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.140
 for a while when it is halfway through 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.330
 write our onion what are we going to 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.250
 do is add the squid that 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.980
 they bought here also to put it in my 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.010
 prawn fideua because it gives you a little taste 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.370
 very good and today is the little fish all 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.370
 come in well 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 and we keep doing 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.650
 I was doing homework and I've 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.210
 made a fish stock I already have it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.340
 here I have my shrimp head broth 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.620
 and fish stock I will answer what 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.450
 first broth of funds and what more 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.580
 Missing you by completing fish 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.040
 but it's important to have a bottom of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.930
 prawn heads we do a little bit of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.970
 Turtles a stick and salts of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.740
 wonder and we can have it in the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.530
 Freezer waiting for the day you give 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.110
 our site what is more music 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.450
 revolts we will suffer well well well what 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.920
 what is yours 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.360
 our onion is well fried, we 're going to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.090
 add are our ranges I will give 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.090
 two laps and I'm going to take them out 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.090
 simply 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:57.710
 and to which smaller dish are large 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.110
 the bigger the better we will give footprints 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.180
 once we have the prawns a little 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.930
 made just simply a little bit what 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.930
 let's do is 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.890
 we'll get it out I'm going to make it a success 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.890
 also a little bit because I'm going to put 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:22.730
 we already know a little bit more about 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.540
 the prawns and sauté and tomato 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.540
 in sin 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.500
 because the project does not make sense 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.250
 because if we do not burn paprika and we 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.680
 I will put the videos of fideuà of four 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.439
 laps so that the videos in the taste 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.969
 of all squid as much as tomato 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.969
 like half 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.709
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.709
 put our broth 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.860
 for two people more or less is a 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.720
 liter of water but as always we will 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.250
 I say do not worry because the recipe or 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.030
 be the ingredients will be in mini 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.030
 dotcom cookers 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.220
 we will put in what is the broth and now 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.080
 we'll wait a little bit when it starts 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.400
 boil I will add the prawns now 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.470
 we open 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.090
 the water as you see is already living not what 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.610
 you see why you are far away and we do not 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.230
 reach the view but fix it demille the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.970
 water you are already seeing so what is 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.849
 I'm going to do is go back to throwing my both 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.250
 so that they leave all the flavor in 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.260
 our fideuá you will really see that 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.239
 the fideuà is super simple and comes out super 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.150
 rich is of range I have never done 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.780
 but hey it's never too late 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.520
 lately I am doing many 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.890
 new recipes so that 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.750
 and the other day we came out very very 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.820
 good and this is also going to 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.510
 Great out well I'll leave 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.510
 here my beds 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.920
 and we will continue with the following as 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.719
 jorgito course I do not like long side 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.879
 of fish però adorable jolie then 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.829
 we usually accompany the length of 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.049
 fish was expanded I will do it with what 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.930
 let it be accompanied with one with a 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:15.019
 alioli as the jolie is done, so not 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.519
 I know because as they say no if I really do 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.250
 that I know because I've done several 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.090
 but they say that if they look at you it gives bad 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.370
 luck and it is cut in this case you are me 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.660
 seeing the whole world so I'm going 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.280
 I reported them if I cut that I'm going to 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.740
 do then do everything I have no more 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.050
 remedy so it's super simple 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.180
 make an analysis in theory the only thing that 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.199
 we have to put is chopped garlic 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.970
 and a little bit of salt separate the yolk from 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.919
 here the clear one the clear one we will use it 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.530
 to make a dessert and the yolk to 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.490
 our aioli before putting in the yolk 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.350
 what we have to do is explain 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.259
 well well well our cited I have put 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.110
 salt so that the ior and is not very bland and 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:58.940
 so that the garlic does not jump then in 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.940
 theory is vital in the field 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:14.160
 and when we have it chopped what we're going 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.289
 to do is add our egg 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.380
 and start moving 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:21.480
 we take our oil 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.380
 it's worth now I'm back that I 've been left without 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.960
 oil and we are going it little by little 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.700
 It is important to put it in a nursery 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.620
 because that way we control the amount of 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.260
 oil that we are throwing and while 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.360
 we are watching our our fideuá 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.610
 it smells great pity that no 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.610
 You can make it smell because it smells super 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.610
 well and you have to move with patience 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.150
 I have not had the aioli 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:55.280
 the theory is true when there are people 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.280
 looking at the jolie you do not get 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.080
 good as it is for jorge libia jorge him 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.650
 like everything I do, I'm sure not 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.440
 it does not matter, it has not come out very liquid 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.770
 but it has not come out either 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.710
 how I had to get out good was from 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.770
 wait does not say the least bad theory 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.840
 that the fideuà has left us like this is that 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.449
 as I come and I do not like it either 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:27.280
 I care male and I will not do another 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:29.949
 but lie good does not matter I have some 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.550
 photos in the blog where yes I 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:36.220
 came out the jolly you can review it as 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.650
 You see the caldito is almost consuming 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.270
 almost already the point as soon as 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.819
 consume what we can still do is 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:45.490
 put out the fire and let it rest 5 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:47.949
 minutes ok I pick up the table a little and 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.319
 then we come back once it has rested on 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.780
 our fideuá 5 minutes the only thing that 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:55.060
 we have to look at what good looks so 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.520
 except that it has come out of the 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.020
 jolie better we do not talk the only thing that we 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.150
 remains to be done is to put it in the 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.550
 stage before the photo to upload long 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.950
 and I wait for you in the next recipe 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.210
 puntocom I promise that I will leave the 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.210
 jolly see you later
