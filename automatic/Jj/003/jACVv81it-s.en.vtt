00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello girls good then the video of 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.910
 Today I 'm going to teach you how to do the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.380
 suede fingernails being super 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:18.690
 used right now in and for that we'll go 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.029
 need a suede color glaze 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.119
 in case I'm using this here da 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.099
 color is still difficult 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:32.790
 black and the whole girl here I beat 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.130
 I bought this little speck of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.450
 suede in the gallery is for those who live here 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.899
 in porangatu 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.020
 to disneyland arom and this place study 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.140
 There you have it if you do not live in Porangatu or 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 It's just you in a cosmetics store that 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 comes from make-up stuff for one that goes 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.460
 have a I do not understand me eat I stayed 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.510
 The tripod over where I'm going will focus. 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.539
 All right then 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.270
 I'll talk by applying two layers. 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.280
 it is important that the color of the enamel is 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:13.560
 equal to suede because if any 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:16.729
 Place to stay Yes, it's suede. 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.729
 to realize 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.980
 it's very strange to record fingernail tutorial 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.409
 center more after the first layer 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.890
 in vain to parade just a little bit to 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:42.729
 to dry I took everything normal cuticle 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:45.869
 zach taquari kate and I think it's already 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 at the time of the second call 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.890
 so I can second layer is important 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.890
 You have to go through a love quote. 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.869
 to the dream still a little wet then 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.210
 that you make satire whistle access in the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.460
 Enamel because otherwise the shirt will also 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.280
 cross here from the side and is a bag for 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.590
 take her here from the side 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.320
 Then you'll get a little bit of 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.230
 suede if you bought in the bag the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:20.580
 because not only that the girl you put 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.580
 a bowl and dive in here 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:31.709
 should be so you press at all 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:39.190
 places of the nail to secure well and 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:44.640
 That's how it goes. 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:52.720
 you left here you can put it back 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:55.200
 In the little pot, my god, I'm out of the fire. 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:01.209
 was realizing 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:09.730
 So close , I'll spare a little just to 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:13.810
 right thing and take it from there now I come 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.709
 with the toothpick just certain that the fields 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.709
 suede 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:34.250
 so yes there 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.930
 hence the girl who stayed here in 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:45.320
 up then you take it there with water there 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:49.040
 now in F is normal you become 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:55.490
 put the cotton on the toothpick the paste 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:59.770
