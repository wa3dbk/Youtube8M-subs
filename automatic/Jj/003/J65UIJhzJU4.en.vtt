00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.210
 tied to alice she site accessibility and 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.100
 content quality 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.990
 hi moz fans and welcome to 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.279
 the next issue of the sideboard fraday on 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.650
 this week I'm going to try 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.300
 disassemble and understand the question which if 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.580
 you interact with the world of seo and 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.189
 probably heard many times from the outside 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.680
 world outside seo and i think that recent 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.880
 the question on quora is wonderful 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.390
 formulated and only a few people 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.920
 thought about this question and so 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.010
 Is mircea tied to easy availability 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.580
 site and gradual creation 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.980
 quality and relevant content 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.320
 Well I suppose that is what I have 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.140
 in view of why we then filmed these hundreds 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.550
 freeride sideboard releases 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.170
 of course this is a fair question and I 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.120
 I can agree with the people who are his 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.230
 ask 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.420
 since when i look at new 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.160
 practice I understand that we all 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.770
 dwell on these standard 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.509
 moments we say type what am i 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.950
 I assume that the scope of advertising depends 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.810
 just from finding the right one 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.040
 to the audience and then from filing the right ones 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.659
 ads that we can afford 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.700
 allow to reach from target 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.710
 audience and then make an announcement 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.800
 to your audience drew on them 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.840
 attention that as much and yes and no advertising 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.909
 really incredibly difficult 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.950
 There is a huge variety of complex 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.110
 key points here you can it 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.180
 over and over again as if 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.550
 making a car would mean making and 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.440
 x and being a photographer is not true here. 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.049
 there is always a certain complexity 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.030
 but I will explain why this happens with us 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.040
 there are two points in fact i am 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.950
 heard maximum one more key point 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.900
 this is a keyword research and so we 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.000
 we have a very accessible site with good 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.710
 relevant content we follow 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.510
 keywords and positioning on 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.470
 market and it's all seo 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.390
 until the answer is no this is just the tip of the iceberg 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.130
 this is what you can only do for 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.260
 order to at least try 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.940
 seo optimization in order to 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.709
 try to raise your rating and 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.030
 attract potential traffic which 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.920
 will increase the site shows these three points 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.849
 very different from art and science 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.700
 seo world it happens because 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.400
 good relevant content 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.459
 even rarely produced is enough 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.470
 for good competitive ranking 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.360
 also site accessibility is key 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.150
 moment but it does not increase 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.310
 ratings of your site is not 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.260
 help you designing your site 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.849
 can be very affordable and you can 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.459
 be in the top 10 on many key 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.040
 queries but it will not affect 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.890
 seo and your research traffic 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.959
 keywords and targeting are also important but 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.720
 these are also only components of one 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.640
 whole strategy pomatrosil and threw in 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.860
 world power doesn't work you need 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.170
 track your positions and know which ones 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.739
 requests and pages in did not analyze us 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.810
 search 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.549
 really brings you quality 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.709
 traffic to the site you need 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.829
 identify new keywords and 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.860
 observe the actions of competitors 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:14.170
 where they bypass you is constant 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.709
 practice is the case when you need 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:22.769
 say well, I understand, and so do not need 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.120
 create meaningful content what's up 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.510
 quality content will help you with this 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.900
 he will help your optimization but only 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.030
 then when this significance gives high 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.030
 probability of interaction and reposting 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.750
 if significant is that we 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.209
 released something beautiful and incredible 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.819
 attractive but nobody cares 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.799
 then nobody will consider such content 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.540
 especially useful or will be considered but 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.549
 people will not be interested in doing it 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.620
 repost no one will strengthen this 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:58.540
 content in any way yourself 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.950
 tell a friend to mail or 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.989
 bring people to your site 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.609
 give you a link or share in 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.389
 social media there is no gain 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.819
 social media will not 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.130
 spread and now you are lost at 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.290
 you have meaningful content but it is not 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.829
 degree of significance which is well affected 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.810
 on seo 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.660
 the reason is that the links are still 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.289
 just have a huge weight in the ranking 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.260
 and any thing i will underline this word any 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.840
 thing that promotes or slows down 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.510
 reference weight growth will help or 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.890
 hurt your seo it has 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.139
 certain meaning when you are about it 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.319
 think but seo 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.819
 these are undoubtedly competing practices you 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:42.009
 can not just take a mate and 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.169
 quit as I said your competitors 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.270
 will always strive to catch up with you or 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.849
 overtake you if you don't move 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:53.349
 further along the correct trajectory of someone 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:55.840
 you will surely catch up with this law in the world 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.060
 seo and thousands of companies that 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.680
 involved in this world always in 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:06.219
 I understand this race well. 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.409
 hard to realize we said that seo is 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.539
 any thing related to the increase 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:13.990
 reference mass but in reality 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.779
 seo is any effort that takes into account 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.979
 search engines when ranking any 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:21.069
 search engine effort 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:26.379
 system when ranking is included in the set 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:29.110
 seo practices and all that people or 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.550
 technologies do to influence these 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.849
 ranking algorithms 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.800
 this is the basis of seo practices precisely because 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.800
 this industry is so big 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.069
 that is why seo is neuropsychology 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.490
 seo is all this conversion optimization 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:48.759
 booking sat it analytics force it 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.129
 product everything from advertising seo it also 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:53.139
 fill in the blanks and if these spaces 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:54.819
 is that something that is positive 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:00.399
 affects the success of your site 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:02.229
 in a direct and indirect way, that's why 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:06.099
 this is a huge area 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:09.669
 this is why seo is very difficult and 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:13.649
 problematic so also unfortunately 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:17.860
 people try to dwell on narrow seo 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:20.370
 it does not work it does not work and it 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.949
 destroys any practices 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.659
 destroy investments and works against 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.960
 the things we created to 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:32.370
 improve seo and when someone from your 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.419
 commands or your client tells you type 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.979
 you do seo 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.189
 why are you telling us how to lead 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:41.110
 our facebook page why are you 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:41.740
 tell us how to change our campaign 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.430
 branding 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.430
 or advertising 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.060
 so here is why i hope you send 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.980
 this video to these people is possible you 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.720
 show them this chart and can you 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.610
 it will be easier to explain to them and 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.590
 more clear on this all I hope we 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.630
 meet you next week on 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.320
 the next issue of the Fridayboard 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.320
 until
