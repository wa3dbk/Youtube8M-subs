now this patient presented to us with

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.860 
now this patient presented to us with
pain<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.339> epigastrium<00:00:06.029> radiating<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.779> the

back and a patient is a known alcoholic
and<00:00:10.230> we<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> CT<00:00:11.490> image<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.880> front<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.240> us

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
and we have a CT image in front of us

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.500 
and we have a CT image in front of us
let<00:00:13.410> us<00:00:13.440> see<00:00:13.679> what<00:00:13.950> are<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.130> CT<00:00:14.400> findings<00:00:14.849> now

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
let us see what are the CT findings now

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.300 
let us see what are the CT findings now
look<00:00:18.510> at<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> CD<00:00:19.140> image<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:20.010> will<00:00:20.130> see

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
look at the CD image and you will see

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.540 
look at the CD image and you will see

normally let us look at the next image
now<00:00:46.730> we<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:48.000> again<00:00:48.270> diffuse<00:00:48.719> bulkiness

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
now we can see again diffuse bulkiness

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.500 
now we can see again diffuse bulkiness
of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> pancreas

most of the parenchyma appeals to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
most of the parenchyma appeals to
enhance<00:00:53.250> although<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.329> are<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.600> few<00:00:54.629> areas

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
enhance although there are a few areas

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.319 
enhance although there are a few areas
of<00:00:55.379> reduced<00:00:55.559> enhancement<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
of reduced enhancement there is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.369 
of reduced enhancement there is
increased<00:00:57.930> peri<00:00:58.199> pancreatic<00:00:58.859> stranding<00:00:59.340> and

again perinephric fat hello is spare and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
again perinephric fat hello is spare and
there<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.470> thickening<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.920> anterior

on that score
now<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.600> grade<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.230> pancreatitis<00:02:48.650> into<00:02:49.040> mild

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
now you grade the pancreatitis into mild

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.520 
now you grade the pancreatitis into mild
moderate<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.850> severe<00:02:50.210> with<00:02:50.660> 8<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.110> 10<00:02:51.320> being

moderate and severe with 8 to 10 being
the<00:02:51.620> severe<00:02:52.430> grading<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.390> very

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
the severe grading so it is very

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.180 
the severe grading so it is very
important<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.930> understand<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.830> this<00:02:54.980> is

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
important to understand that this is

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.530 
important to understand that this is
what<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.550> smaller<00:02:55.820> nowadays<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.450> is

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
what we smaller nowadays that is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.300 
what we smaller nowadays that is
