00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.430
 it's been flying for so long I visited the site and olivier sauli member 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.430
 precious mythical 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.029
 and even if you are present today at the four corners of our 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.849
 world 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.060
 it produces olivettes mainly on the edges of the Mediterranean 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.119
 in the valley of the baux de provence the olive tree has long found here 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 a land conducive to its development 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.100
 planted in this region 4000 years ago it adapted to stony soil 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.830
 it arrives from the alpilles to such an extent that its olive grove has become the most 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.860
 important of France 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.200
 the olive tree and 7 september 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.879
 who could have planned 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.519
 agent agents 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.450
 where other fruit trees he could not move 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.040
 in general parallel we spoke india in the valley of leases why we have 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.469
 a big concentration 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.719
 beaulieu in the valley 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.239
 for the good and simple reason it is that you have tested at such a height 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.640
 distinguishes limestone land we have sin waow or wood you 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.820
 could not take me one will not be able to produce lolivier the heat a ground 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.590
 laughed at 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.930
 a-data zac of asia where different pleasures if you listen to togo 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.410
 will be sentenced in Germany 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.900
 but m to do our normal productions that is to say that some 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.360
 profitability 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.060
 at the end of the night was said larry will do 10 to 15 pounds of fruit 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.170
 mandela in addition to a good shot at the bottom of the voluminous union in addition to you to 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.260
 maintain it in addition to the size and the liveliest in produce 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.270
 but is discreet it happened oven 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.690
 the olive tree can reach 5 to ten meters in height 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.110
 but to facilitate its maintenance and fruit harvesting 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.200
 thanks to a suitable size it is maintained she is the author of three 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.550
 points this week 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.550
 it is eternal but its development eq very slow 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.430
 there is a hole or raspberry hard and in this with a gray bark on the surface 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 cracked v 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.340
 its evergreen foliage 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 but every three years or so during the summer drought leaves 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.819
 yell Swiss take down the tree 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.449
 the blooming volume lasts only one week between June 6 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:16.099
 the flowers will present themselves 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.099
 they are small oval white 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.709
 they are very slightly at the dojo but very sensitive to the cold it opens 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:30.799
 only 5% of the flowers throughout history is a pretty fruit 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.489
 the training period of Lille is between the month of June from the month 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.609
 November 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.629
 she is green at the beginning of her growth 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.949
 10:15 am the rich audio 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.309
 and say goodbye to its full maturity 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.020
 but to which we never have black and according to the varieties 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.110
 German remained Lyon lille or violaceous but you arrive in the month of 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.650
 December the general street 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.899
 mambÃ© the funds all having more or less a 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.089
 the same aspect 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.419
 there are some who go out a big step quite law it's a question 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.279
 varieties but this arrival at maturity 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.489
 with a salt-based preparation 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.749
 you can take away your bitterness and make it edible 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.819
 but because of its high fat content 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.059
 eighteen percent on average at its primary use 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.059
 remains the manufacture of olive oil 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:23.379
 in the valley of the baux de provence several species of olive tree make up 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.989
 all the orchards 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.359
 it is not uncommon to find trees that will give birth to 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.129
 different olive varieties on the same plot 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.390
 I pale his conductive roommate did it also pasqua 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.670
 there are varieties that sell no more or less two or three for this case the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.930
 longer or shorter term 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.030
 then the lot of peasant women will have to ensure a certain stability 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.329
 and there but it's going to be a big verbal salah alas do not mix 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.169
 firstly it favors pollination it is necessary to say one thing 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.210
 and that the olive tree 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.409
 of this pollinator talked about scandal 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.429
 it's the drama 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:56.680
 the taste of him the sticky of terminals 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.470
 and when English bottled and people do not eat at home it's 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.950
 the art of the millmaker, that is to say, to make these wood assemblies to sums 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.429
 spoken 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:07.490
 % I believe that success 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.740
 % of angoulÃªme men I think that already the goal of the miller 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.410
 assumes firm in the assembly with one and the bitterest and the sweetest place 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.100
 the most holy bar hazard dan dah the most fruity and six in a row and he came to 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.270
 judge and it is he who decides 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.279
 in addition to these four varieties 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.279
 we find in smaller quantities the prettiest 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.520
 when you know that it takes 5 to 7 kilos of fruit to make a liter 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.419
 oil 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.780
 as soon as the wind of the winter euros one manually picks up 70 kilos per 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:38.529
 day 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.099
 we understand that the olive harvest and a patient work 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.099
 and that Lille is a reward that must be known in time 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.759
 currently the most used method for harvesting begins 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.759
 always by installing nets at the foot of my bed 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:01.430
 with a comb the olives recoiffe the branches of the tree 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.430
 to reap the benefits 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.039
 so from November each olive growers 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.090
 individuals or professionals than the olives of his July orchard carrying 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.229
 following the mill 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.719
 standing there will then be the delicate task of transforming the fruit of the 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.020
 big city harvest of the island
