00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.750
 in this time trial of 33 km 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.040
 today the team fdj.fr had not 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.110
 big thing to gain not much 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.849
 lose either marc madiot so 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 decided to do a great exercise 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 nature a particular exercise on this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.390
 course where there were two ribs but 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.460
 also two fairly technical descents 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.260
 an exercise where it was necessary for some 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
 ie arnold jeannesson and jérémy 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 roy change bike and for others 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.470
 keep the same is the case in particular 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.969
 of alexandre genies on arrival all the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.350
 world was generally quite 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.420
 satisfied yeah I 'm in the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.860
 first from I 'll know that tonight 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.840
 if I had a good time if I already 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.879
 one minute 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.149
 loewe vestra montsarrac it's a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.890
 reference in the field since it has 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.129
 does 2 or third paris nice year 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.649
 past I mean it's a chrono 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.610
 ok it was difficult m is en route 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.460
 with fatigue 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.579
 so I did what I could 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.930
 scared in the descent anyway 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.520
 I was a bit on the brakes at first 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.710
 downhill I was pretty technical but 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.970
 good I think will be the same for all 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.060
 world we went there were frights 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.650
 today I have not I have not recognized the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.530
 course so we do not know too much where 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.760
 we're not going where we put our feet 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.570
 is good the echoes that I had it's 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.439
 that we had to pay attention to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.880
 communal and the saints because 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.180
 it was mostly him ashes that are 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.869
 tricky and and dangerous so 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.230
 main today it was 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.140
 take risks especially 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.610
 it was fast and of course falling 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.260
 because a lot of runners 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.630
 apparently are scared during the 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.480
 chrono and other runners fell 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:39.880
 in training so principal it was 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.470
 to arrive to arrive properly on the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 in front of the clock what yes then alex 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.260
 today the sensations of this chrono 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.690
 I left I left their 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.580
 pace with the ceram so tried to 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.290
 manage my effort 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.060
 good it was not made easy 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.760
 many it was ohlala the top of the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.680
 second climb who was who were 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.230
 hard and it was fake dishes he 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.460
 do not waste time on 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.100
 good here in the room I'm when 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.030
 even satisfied with the time after 15 days 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.550
 racing is true that the sensations 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.780
 it's not it's not the best but I'm good 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.540
 thought for everyone the same 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.040
 mortars I have a little cheese and 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.810
 everyone was talking about downhill 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.190
 that his thought yeah I find that 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.090
 interesting and simple like that it allows 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.740
 of that allows climbers and as I have 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.380
 a little weak and was not 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.100
 to waste too much time on 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.050
 stretches where they always do 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.980
 to pedal so it's also interesting 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.780
 then it goes faster thank you 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.830
 well yeah I took a good storm I was 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.840
 soaked 1 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.239
 but a lot of a lot of fleet is going 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.920
 enormously I saw more sarred he is 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.739
 everywhere on the road and still going the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.090
 rain my worst it's refreshing but there 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.239
 had good gusty headwind 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.459
 and it was not easy to fight 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.120
 that if you had to change bikes you 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.370
 would have done no no not at all 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.220
 get wet for me I'm over at 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.650
 comfortable it's not the concern bobo it's 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.959
 pity because I wanted to do 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.010
 the clock correctly it's true that 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.220
 to take conditions like that 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.840
 discourages a little then in the head one 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.080
 we lose a little bit of the race so 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.239
 think a little energy wasted but good 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.230
 it's not the game I think I 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.540
 gone on a good pace even though after the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.390
 first descent I had rain so 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.709
 after 18th time in the second 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.299
 intermediate so we imagine it's 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.349
 the result of the lowest in the 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.140
 descent I had to lose a lot of 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.019
 time I did not know it any more 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.660
 was going tricky there he started to 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.500
 raining pile at the moment 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.390
 so I arrived the road of the blow low 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.609
 was very fat so I felt good 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.170
 that it slipped I had to miss several 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.190
 turns out the end foot I made a 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.880
 little anything but hey I could 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.609
 not do much better 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.790
 and then after down on the boss been a little 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.329
 deconcentrated so I threw a little 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.340
 demoralized 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.840
 but good after everyone and I try 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.170
 to do it well but good with the rain 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.220
 in water the road was soaked in more 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.170
 with the headwind relies in the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.340
 face is not the ideal 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.079
 after I climbed as I could and then 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.459
 I finished as I could but after 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.710
 after the first descent it was in 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.109
 my head is finished unlike 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.950
 a little bit and then jérémy 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.280
 there was also alexander who had 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.740
 spotted the time during the year so 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.750
 he knew that the descent was rolling 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.860
 and that you had to change your bike so 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.080
 but he had advised me 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.760
 so I trusted them and then 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.230
 I did a bit like I changed 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.880
 bike and I think that's for sure it was 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.080
 interesting after that's for sure if I went 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.540
 spotted the clock I could have gone down 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.980
 much faster yet but well here 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.660
 when we do not play the win we try 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.040
 also to ensure not to do low 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.720
 like jean christophe péraud this morning 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.310
 what can we lose everything on a 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.660
 day and then I have not been looking 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.200
 really the limits in the last 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.790
 descent 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.650
 Jeremy Roy who had been the best of 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.600
 the team finishes today a little more 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.330
 far as some of his teammates to at 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.980
 almost 3 minutes 30 of the favorites in this 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.690
 which concerns alexandre genies who 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.160
 had not changed bike and arnold 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.190
 jeannesson who had changed his bike 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.230
 they finish respectively 26 and 24th 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.880
 of this chrono for the little story 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.169
 will remember that they are even before the 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.250
 French champion of the discipline 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.250
 sylvain chavanel
