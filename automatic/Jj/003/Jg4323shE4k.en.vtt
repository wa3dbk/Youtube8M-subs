00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.760 
propellant and to get to the altitude
I'm<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> add<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.390> salt<00:01:16.170> rocket

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I'm going to add a little salt rocket

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.340 
I'm going to add a little salt rocket
booster<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.820> will<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.540> basic

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
booster here that will be my very basic

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
booster here that will be my very basic
rocket<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.009> down<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
rocket you see down here it's going to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.859 
rocket you see down here it's going to
cost<00:01:21.270> me<00:01:22.460> 1297<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:24.119> funds<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.610> out<00:01:26.610> of

cost me 1297 of my funds and out of

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.600 
cost me 1297 of my funds and out of
12,000<00:01:28.009> 293<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.220> I'm<00:01:29.430> doing<00:01:29.909> pretty<00:01:30.299> well<00:01:30.570> here

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
12,000 293 so I'm doing pretty well here

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.130 
12,000 293 so I'm doing pretty well here
now<00:01:32.610> we're<00:01:32.790> ready<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.180> launch<00:01:33.479> there's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.900> few

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

parachute<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:29.190> what<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> want<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.610> do<00:02:30.760> is

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
parachute and what I want to do is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.300 
parachute and what I want to do is
hopefully<00:02:31.690> land<00:02:31.930> close<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.740> Space<00:02:33.040> Center

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
hopefully land close to the Space Center

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.080 
hopefully land close to the Space Center
because<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:34.690> costs<00:02:35.410> be<00:02:35.680> funds<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.730> put<00:02:36.910> this

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
because it costs be funds to put this

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.840 
because it costs be funds to put this
rocket<00:02:37.570> together<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.170> launch<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.830> if<00:02:39.580> I

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
rocket together and launch it and if I

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.660 
rocket together and launch it and if I
recover<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.570> then<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.170> get<00:02:41.440> funds<00:02:41.800> back<00:02:42.220> for<00:02:42.610> the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
recover it then I get funds back for the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.060 
recover it then I get funds back for the
bits<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:42.940> I've<00:02:43.090> recovered<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:44.380> let's<00:02:44.590> hope

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
bits that I've recovered so let's hope

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.580 
bits that I've recovered so let's hope
that<00:02:45.370> as<00:02:45.880> much<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.480> too<00:02:46.750> makes<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.290> back

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
that as much of this too makes it back

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.250 
that as much of this too makes it back
to<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.220> Space<00:02:48.520> Center<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:49.000> as<00:02:49.390> one<00:02:49.750> piece<00:02:50.020> as

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
to the Space Center in as one piece as

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.970 
to the Space Center in as one piece as
possible<00:02:51.840> there<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:53.140> go<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.470> looks<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.830> we're

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
possible there we go it looks like we're

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.430 
possible there we go it looks like we're
going<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.190> land<00:02:54.370> just<00:02:54.910> outside<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.840> astronaut

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
course get our science which we've had

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.850 
course get our science which we've had
as<00:03:12.280> before<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.570> now<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.959> tells<00:03:14.140> us<00:03:14.410> what<00:03:14.620> we've

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
as before but now it tells us what we've

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.250 
as before but now it tells us what we've
recovered<00:03:15.250> from<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:15.880> particular<00:03:16.260> launch

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
recovered from this particular launch

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.039 
recovered from this particular launch
and<00:03:17.620> you<00:03:18.459> see<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:19.150> we're<00:03:19.360> getting<00:03:19.510> this<00:03:19.840> at

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
and you see that we're getting this at

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.050 
and you see that we're getting this at
ninety-eight<00:03:20.799> percent<00:03:21.040> value<00:03:21.459> because<00:03:21.880> we

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
ninety-eight percent value because we

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.360 
ninety-eight percent value because we
landed<00:03:22.510> within<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.959> boundaries<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.709> the
