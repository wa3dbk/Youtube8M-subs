this it it fits into an attic with these

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.770 
this it it fits into an attic with these
things<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:32.270> we<00:00:33.270> had<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> put<00:00:33.660> in

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
things like that and we had to put in

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.740 
things like that and we had to put in
new<00:00:33.960> floors<00:00:34.350> which<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> long<00:00:35.340> story<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
new floors which is a long story and the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.950 
new floors which is a long story and the
the<00:00:37.530> end<00:00:37.680> result<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.879> all<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> doors

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the end result was that all of the doors

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.200 
the end result was that all of the doors
had<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.500> trimmed<00:00:40.860> because<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.790> hardwood

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
had to be trimmed because the hardwood

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.610 
had to be trimmed because the hardwood
floors<00:00:42.450> were<00:00:42.629> thicker<00:00:42.870> than<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> laminate

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
floors were thicker than the laminate

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.979 
floors were thicker than the laminate
making<00:00:44.219> every<00:00:44.489> door<00:00:44.670> too<00:00:44.910> long<00:00:45.149> when<00:00:45.840> they

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
making every door too long when they

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
making every door too long when they
trimmed<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.039> did<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> poor<00:00:47.489> job<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
trimmed this one they did a poor job and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.700 
trimmed this one they did a poor job and
it<00:00:48.270> didn't<00:00:48.570> fit<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.440> when<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.680> were

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it didn't fit so when we were

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.200 
it didn't fit so when we were
desperately<00:00:50.219> trying<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.760> ready<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
desperately trying to get ready for the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.549 
desperately trying to get ready for the
paintball<00:00:51.600> trip<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.079> things<00:00:52.230> from<00:00:52.379> the

paintball trip and get things from the
Attic<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.340> actually<00:00:53.520> stuck<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> shovel

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
Attic we actually stuck a shovel

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.510 
Attic we actually stuck a shovel
underneath<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.440> thing<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.309> see

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
underneath this thing and you can see

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.950 
underneath this thing and you can see
the<00:00:56.670> bottoms<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.120> chipped<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> stuff

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the bottoms all chipped up and stuff

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
the bottoms all chipped up and stuff
which<00:00:58.559> doesn't<00:00:58.829> matter<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.730> was<00:00:59.879> too

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
which doesn't matter because it was too

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.110 
which doesn't matter because it was too
long<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> i<00:01:01.520> thought<00:01:02.520> i'd<00:01:02.670> show<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.879> guys

what the scoop is now when the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
what the scoop is now when the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that they didn't know this inspired the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.179 
that they didn't know this inspired the
video<00:01:09.260> what<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.409> did<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> they<00:01:10.740> took<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
video what they did is they took the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
video what they did is they took the
doors<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:11.729> pushed<00:01:12.000> him<00:01:12.150> across<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.450> table

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
saw six doors and that meant that every

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.660 
saw six doors and that meant that every
door<00:01:15.900> had<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.350> repainted<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.490> when

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
door had to be repainted because when

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.980 
door had to be repainted because when
you<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> door<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.570> push<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.900> across

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you take a door and you push it across

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
you take a door and you push it across
something<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.070> gets<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.460> dirty<00:01:20.729> and

something it gets all dirty and
scratched<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:22.680> better<00:01:23.310> idea<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.720> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
straight edge on your table saw and then

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.450 
straight edge on your table saw and then
glue<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.659> place<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:55.680> nice<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460

important<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.430> long<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.880> then

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
important this will be long and then

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.459 
important this will be long and then
you'll<00:02:00.840> take<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.380> circular<00:02:02.040> saw<00:02:03.290> hang<00:02:04.290> out

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you'll take your circular saw hang out

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.690 
you'll take your circular saw hang out
right<00:02:04.649> there<00:02:04.710> hope<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.430> do

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.420 

it<00:02:11.700> pushes<00:02:12.150> along<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.930> when<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.010> cut<00:02:14.250> it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
it pushes along here and when you cut it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.449 
it pushes along here and when you cut it
you'll<00:02:14.909> cut<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.420> length<00:02:15.920> if<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.980> can<00:02:17.250> see

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
you'll cut this length if you can see

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.910 
you'll cut this length if you can see
how<00:02:17.579> this<00:02:17.760> works<00:02:18.019> you'll<00:02:19.019> cut<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.709> size

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
how this works you'll cut this to size

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.030 
how this works you'll cut this to size
so<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:20.549> you<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.879> every<00:02:21.510> time<00:02:21.720> forever<00:02:22.349> your

so now you know every time forever your

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.860 
so now you know every time forever your
blade<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.730> run<00:02:23.939> right<00:02:24.180> where<00:02:24.690> this

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
blade is going to run right where this

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.170 
blade is going to run right where this
thing<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.129> other<00:02:26.340> nice<00:02:26.610> side<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.090> it

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
thing is and the other nice side of it

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.330 
thing is and the other nice side of it
is<00:02:27.299> when<00:02:27.510> I'm<00:02:27.629> finished<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:28.860> won't<00:02:29.069> have<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
is when I'm finished we won't have to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.610 
is when I'm finished we won't have to
repaint<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:30.030> door<00:02:30.299> because<00:02:31.170> I'm<00:02:31.470> not

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
circular saws cut pretty straight I mean

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.250 
circular saws cut pretty straight I mean
they're<00:02:41.519> designed<00:02:41.849> four<00:02:42.030> straight<00:02:42.239> lines<00:02:42.450> but

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
they're designed four straight lines but

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.050 
they're designed four straight lines but
it's<00:02:43.379> also<00:02:43.560> rough<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.250> used<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.549> framing

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
it's also rough it's used in framing

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's also rough it's used in framing
it's<00:02:45.209> used<00:02:45.390> in<00:02:45.540> construction<00:02:45.989> but<00:02:46.739> if<00:02:46.829> you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
it's used in construction but if you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.680 
it's used in construction but if you
want<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.190> use<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.430> something<00:02:47.670> finer<00:02:48.120> then

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690

then I moved it to talk take this quite
a<00:03:28.980> bit<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.190> place<00:03:30.109> like<00:03:31.109> so

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.809 

I<00:03:39.209> have<00:03:39.959> more<00:03:40.200> than<00:03:40.409> once<00:03:40.620> put<00:03:41.370> these<00:03:41.519> clamps

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
I have more than once put these clamps

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.880 
I have more than once put these clamps
in<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.209> this<00:03:42.420> but<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:43.230> won't<00:03:43.409> work<00:03:43.560> because

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
in like this but that won't work because

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.949 
in like this but that won't work because
you<00:03:44.099> saw<00:03:44.310> will<00:03:44.489> hit<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:45.450> got<00:03:45.629> to<00:03:45.750> do<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
you saw will hit it you got to do the

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:54.710 
you saw will hit it you got to do the
low<00:03:46.079> profile<00:03:46.500> side<00:03:46.769> on<00:03:47.069> top<00:03:53.510> there<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.599> go

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
low profile side on top there you go

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.140 
low profile side on top there you go
like<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.489> now<00:03:56.489> I'll<00:03:56.849> plug<00:03:57.269> in<00:03:57.420> my<00:03:57.569> soul<00:03:57.930> and<00:04:02.150> I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
like that now I'll plug in my soul and I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.030 
like that now I'll plug in my soul and I
should<00:04:03.329> really<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.689> wearing<00:04:04.049> hearing

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
should really be wearing hearing

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.860 
should really be wearing hearing
protection<00:04:05.159> and<00:04:05.790> eye<00:04:05.879> protection<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.659> such

protection and eye protection and such

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.789 
protection and eye protection and such
