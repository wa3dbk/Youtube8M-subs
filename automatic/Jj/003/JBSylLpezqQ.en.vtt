all<00:00:13.590> right<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.360> let's<00:00:15.360> go<00:00:15.509> back<00:00:15.719> over<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:16.020> our

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
all right so let's go back over to our

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.220 
all right so let's go back over to our
design<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.800> we've<00:00:17.789> got<00:00:18.029> background<00:00:18.960> image

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
design and we've got background image

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.189 
design and we've got background image
and<00:00:19.439> our<00:00:19.980> wrapper<00:00:20.279> background<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.840> now<00:00:22.020> it's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
and our wrapper background and now it's

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779 
and our wrapper background and now it's
time<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.650> start<00:00:22.920> grabbing<00:00:23.340> some<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> other

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
time to start grabbing some of the other

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.290 
time to start grabbing some of the other
images<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.990> we'll<00:00:25.140> use<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.699> our<00:00:26.699> design<00:00:27.029> if

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
images that we'll use for our design if

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.730 
images that we'll use for our design if
I<00:00:27.420> click<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.689> slideshow<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.230> gonna<00:00:28.380> show<00:00:28.590> me

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
I click on slideshow it's gonna show me

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.040 
I click on slideshow it's gonna show me
the<00:00:28.769> pictures<00:00:29.960> that<00:00:30.960> I'm<00:00:31.080> using<00:00:32.600> for<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> six

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the pictures that I'm using for the six

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.750 
the pictures that I'm using for the six
slides<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:35.010> slideshow<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
slides in my slideshow on this

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.180 
slides in my slideshow on this
particular<00:00:36.030> site<00:00:36.420> each<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.770> these<00:00:37.890> needs

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
particular site each one of these needs

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.240 
particular site each one of these needs
to<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.370> its<00:00:38.550> own<00:00:38.640> slice<00:00:38.989> so<00:00:39.989> let<00:00:40.860> me<00:00:40.980> just

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
to be its own slice so let me just

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.600 
to be its own slice so let me just
quickly<00:00:41.700> turn<00:00:42.030> those<00:00:42.210> off<00:00:42.360> again<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.550> now<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
quickly turn those off again and now I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.090 
quickly turn those off again and now I
grab<00:00:45.000> my<00:00:45.030> slice<00:00:45.870> tool<00:00:46.170> again<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.010> actually

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
grab my slice tool again and actually

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.990 
grab my slice tool again and actually
what<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.579> gonna<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> I'm<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.789> gonna

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
what I'm gonna do here so I'm just gonna

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.250 
what I'm gonna do here so I'm just gonna
grab<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.390> tool<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> create

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
grab that tool and I'm going to create

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.790 
grab that tool and I'm going to create
the<00:00:56.010> small<00:00:56.340> slice<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.420> around<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.500> image

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the small slice I can around this image

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.209 
the small slice I can around this image
now<00:00:59.420> what<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.379> forced<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.100> in

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
now what I'm going to be forced to do in

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.539 
now what I'm going to be forced to do in
my<00:01:02.309> CSS<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:05.840> is<00:01:07.220> to<00:01:08.220> create<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
my CSS because of this is to create a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.450 
my CSS because of this is to create a
div<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.180> exactly<00:01:09.900> fits<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.650> not<00:01:11.159> hard<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
div that exactly fits here not hard to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.179 
div that exactly fits here not hard to
do<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> way<00:01:13.200> we'll<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.070> do

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
do but this is the way we'll have to do

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.520 
do but this is the way we'll have to do
it<00:01:14.220> for<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.840> other<00:01:15.960> way<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.500> this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it for now the other way to do this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.410 
it for now the other way to do this
would<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.580> rid<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> background

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.950 

and<00:01:22.430> make<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.670> slice<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> transparent

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and make this slice into a transparent

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.859 
and make this slice into a transparent
PNG<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:26.430> problem<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.299> they're

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
PNG the problem with that is they're

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.359 
PNG the problem with that is they're
much<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:28.920> bigger

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
much much bigger

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.660 
much much bigger
let<00:01:29.790> me<00:01:29.880> demonstrate<00:01:30.740> if<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.430> slice

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
let me demonstrate if I take that slice

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.090 
let me demonstrate if I take that slice
as<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:34.560> JPEG<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.700> 11<00:01:36.240> kilobytes<00:01:36.950> however<00:01:37.950> is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
as a JPEG it is 11 kilobytes however is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.760 
as a JPEG it is 11 kilobytes however is
a<00:01:38.130> PNG<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.960> hundred<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.290> fifty-six

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
a PNG it's a hundred and fifty-six

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.350 
a PNG it's a hundred and fifty-six
kilobytes<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.880> there's<00:01:42.060> lots<00:01:42.180> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
kilobytes now there's lots of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
kilobytes now there's lots of
compression<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.899> can<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.770> can

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
compression I can do with this and I can

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
compression I can do with this and I can
mess<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.460> until<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.149> lower

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
mess with this until I get it lower

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.370 
mess with this until I get it lower
I<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:46.140> back<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> eight<00:01:48.030> hour<00:01:48.380> PNG

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
I can back that down to a eight hour PNG

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.100 
I can back that down to a eight hour PNG
eight<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.159> 41<00:01:50.820> kilobytes<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.600> that's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
eight and it's 41 kilobytes but that's

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.010 
eight and it's 41 kilobytes but that's
still<00:01:52.350> nowhere<00:01:52.740> near<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.280> good<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:54.210> JPEG<00:01:54.780> at

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
still nowhere near as good as a JPEG at

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.340 
still nowhere near as good as a JPEG at
11:00<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.909> I'm<00:01:57.180> gonna<00:01:57.329> stick<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> JPEG

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
11:00 and so I'm gonna stick with a JPEG

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.920 
11:00 and so I'm gonna stick with a JPEG
and<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> put<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> background<00:02:00.689> back

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and I'm going to put the background back

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.920 
and I'm going to put the background back
in<00:02:01.729> let's<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.939> take<00:02:03.090> another<00:02:03.119> peek<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:03.780> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
in let's just take another peek at that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.370 
in let's just take another peek at that
just<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> make<00:02:04.409> sure<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:06.360> JPEG<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.960> 16

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
just to make sure and this JPEG is 16

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.350 
just to make sure and this JPEG is 16
kilobytes<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:08.190> size<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.759> I'm<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.090> six

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
kilobytes in size so I'm gonna have six

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.809 
kilobytes in size so I'm gonna have six
of<00:02:09.479> those<00:02:09.599> loading<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.709> page<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.610> not

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
of those loading on the page it's not

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.870 
of those loading on the page it's not
too<00:02:12.000> bad<00:02:12.209> not

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
too bad not

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.850 
too bad not
heavy<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.900> I'm<00:02:13.960> ready<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.320> can<00:02:14.530> save<00:02:14.710> this

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
heavy so I'm ready to I can save this

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.950 
heavy so I'm ready to I can save this
right<00:02:15.040> now<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.700> instead<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.150> HTML<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:16.900> images

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
right now and instead of HTML and images

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.890 
right now and instead of HTML and images
I'm<00:02:17.350> gonna<00:02:17.500> say<00:02:17.650> images<00:02:18.100> only<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.900> selected

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
I'm gonna say images only and selected

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.340 
I'm gonna say images only and selected
slice<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.470> I'm<00:02:21.430> gonna<00:02:21.610> call<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:22.120> slide<00:02:22.990> one

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
slice and I'm gonna call this slide one

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.440 
slice and I'm gonna call this slide one
and<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:24.400> gonna<00:02:24.520> throw<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:25.090> into<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and it's gonna throw that into the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.630 
and it's gonna throw that into the
images<00:02:25.840> directory<00:02:26.200> for<00:02:26.530> me<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.860> slide<00:02:27.340> one

images directory for me as slide one
underscore<00:02:28.270> zero<00:02:28.750> four<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.190> preview<00:02:31.060> it

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
underscore zero four and if I preview it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.240 
underscore zero four and if I preview it
I<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.900> there<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:32.920> we<00:02:32.980> come<00:02:33.130> back

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
I can see it there so if we come back

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.200 
I can see it there so if we come back
over<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.490> my<00:02:33.580> photoshop<00:02:34.150> file<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:36.030> show<00:02:37.030> the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
over to my photoshop file and show the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.430 
over to my photoshop file and show the
next<00:02:37.450> one<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:38.350> can<00:02:38.650> redo<00:02:39.130> what<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.210> did<00:02:40.440> make

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
next one I can redo what I just did make

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.930 
next one I can redo what I just did make
sure<00:02:41.620> that's<00:02:41.740> selected<00:02:42.160> make<00:02:42.670> sure<00:02:42.820> it's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
sure that's selected make sure it's

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.910 
sure that's selected make sure it's
still<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> jpg<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.410> call<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:44.950> slide<00:02:45.340> 2<00:02:46.210> now

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
still a jpg and call it slide 2 now

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.570 
still a jpg and call it slide 2 now
again<00:02:47.920> back<00:02:48.190> over<00:02:48.490> here<00:02:48.820> I'm<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.110> have

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
again back over here I'm going to have

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.730 
again back over here I'm going to have
slide<00:02:51.580> 1<00:02:51.940> underscore<00:02:52.600> o<00:02:52.630> for<00:02:52.960> slide<00:02:53.440> to

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
slide 1 underscore o for slide to

slide 1 underscore o for slide to
underscore<00:02:54.160> o4<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:55.750> can<00:02:56.050> see<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.320> preview

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
underscore o4 and I can see the preview

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.010 
underscore o4 and I can see the preview
is<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.070> it's<00:02:57.190> exactly<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.730> same<00:02:57.970> size<00:02:58.240> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
is and it's exactly the same size the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.110 
is and it's exactly the same size the
the<00:02:59.650> beauty<00:02:59.920> of<00:03:00.010> doing<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.430> way<00:03:00.490> is<00:03:00.640> my

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
the beauty of doing it this way is my

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.170 
the beauty of doing it this way is my
images<00:03:01.630> will<00:03:01.810> always<00:03:02.380> be<00:03:02.650> exactly<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:04.150> same

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
images will always be exactly the same

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.390 
images will always be exactly the same
size<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.020> my<00:03:05.170> CSS<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.920> be<00:03:06.040> very<00:03:06.340> precise<00:03:06.760> and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.580 

it<00:03:12.400> will<00:03:12.520> never<00:03:12.820> ever<00:03:13.120> move<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.660> image<00:03:13.960> out<00:03:14.350> of

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
it will never ever move the image out of

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.370 
it will never ever move the image out of
the<00:03:14.650> way<00:03:15.600> I'm<00:03:16.600> going<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.840> use<00:03:16.960> front-page

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
the way I'm going to use front-page

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.880 
the way I'm going to use front-page
slideshow<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.070> do<00:03:18.310> this<00:03:18.780> once<00:03:19.780> we're<00:03:19.990> done<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
slideshow to do this once we're done and

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.220 
slideshow to do this once we're done and
it's<00:03:24.070> going<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.280> do<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.460> great<00:03:24.820> job<00:03:25.090> again<00:03:26.050> of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
it's going to do a great job again of

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:44.720 
it's going to do a great job again of
putting<00:03:26.500> everything<00:03:26.740> where<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.490> needs<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.820> be

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.250 

so<00:03:45.730> we've<00:03:45.850> got<00:03:46.000> our<00:03:46.120> six<00:03:46.390> images<00:03:46.780> ready<00:03:47.050> for

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
so we've got our six images ready for

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.860 
so we've got our six images ready for
our<00:03:47.350> slideshow<00:03:47.860> so<00:03:48.550> let's<00:03:48.700> go<00:03:48.819> ahead<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.090> hide

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
our slideshow so let's go ahead and hide

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.070 
our slideshow so let's go ahead and hide
that<00:03:50.050> again<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.060> next<00:03:52.330> step<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.690> grab<00:03:52.840> our

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
that again the next step is to grab our

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.400 
that again the next step is to grab our
text<00:03:53.440> images<00:03:54.390> now<00:03:55.390> we<00:03:55.450> could<00:03:55.690> do<00:03:55.870> this<00:03:56.020> in<00:03:56.200> one

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
text images now we could do this in one

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.449 
text images now we could do this in one
large<00:03:56.680> image<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.970> we<00:03:58.750> wanted<00:03:59.020> to<00:03:59.340> and<00:04:00.340> it

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
large image if we wanted to and it

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.530 
large image if we wanted to and it
wouldn't<00:04:00.730> be<00:04:00.819> very<00:04:00.850> big

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
wouldn't be very big

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.559 
wouldn't be very big
let's<00:04:02.110> just<00:04:02.260> take<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.470> quick<00:04:02.620> peek<00:04:02.739> at<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.569> if

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
let's just take a quick peek at that if

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.160 
let's just take a quick peek at that if
I<00:04:04.720> come<00:04:04.930> across<00:04:05.020> here<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.670> create<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.700> slice

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
I come across here and create a slice

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.620 
I come across here and create a slice
that's<00:04:08.170> exactly<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.709> large<00:04:09.360> double<00:04:10.360> click

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
that's exactly that large double click

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.940 
that's exactly that large double click
it's<00:04:10.989> 365<00:04:11.739> by<00:04:12.130> 192<00:04:12.780> if<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.959> press<00:04:14.290> that<00:04:16.950> it's

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
it's 365 by 192 if I press that it's

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.730 
it's 365 by 192 if I press that it's
going<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.370> be<00:04:18.549> about<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.910> 4<00:04:19.299> kilobyte<00:04:19.660> JPEG<00:04:20.500> or<00:04:20.739> a

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
going to be about a 4 kilobyte JPEG or a

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.520 
going to be about a 4 kilobyte JPEG or a
14<00:04:23.740> kilobyte<00:04:24.250> PNG<00:04:25.000> now<00:04:25.840> this<00:04:26.050> isn't<00:04:26.350> bad

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
14 kilobyte PNG now this isn't bad

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.710 
14 kilobyte PNG now this isn't bad
because<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:26.950> can<00:04:27.130> use<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.280> transparent<00:04:27.970> PNG<00:04:28.270> to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
because I can use a transparent PNG to

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.290 
because I can use a transparent PNG to
go<00:04:28.810> across<00:04:29.350> each<00:04:29.560> one<00:04:29.830> to<00:04:30.490> create<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:30.910> links

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
go across each one to create the links

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.270 
go across each one to create the links
that<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.450> want<00:04:31.690> for<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.900> rollovers<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.650> want<00:04:33.220> to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
that I want for the rollovers I want to

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.400 
that I want for the rollovers I want to
keep<00:04:33.430> my<00:04:33.550> design<00:04:34.000> pretty<00:04:34.510> simple<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.960> my

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
keep my design pretty simple and my

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.719 
keep my design pretty simple and my
layout<00:04:35.710> pretty<00:04:35.919> simple<00:04:36.250> I'm<00:04:36.340> going<00:04:36.460> to<00:04:36.520> create

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
layout pretty simple I'm going to create

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.100 
layout pretty simple I'm going to create
these<00:04:37.030> in<00:04:37.330> three<00:04:37.720> slices<00:04:39.479> so<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.630> rollovers

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
these in three slices so the rollovers

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:54.860 
these in three slices so the rollovers
will<00:04:41.290> be<00:04:41.410> very<00:04:41.710> precise

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.909 

and<00:04:55.130> my<00:04:56.130> files<00:04:56.490> will<00:04:57.270> be<00:04:57.300> really<00:04:57.600> small<00:04:57.840> so<00:04:58.770> now

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
and my files will be really small so now

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.670 
and my files will be really small so now
I<00:04:58.949> can<00:04:59.220> press<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.080> have<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.410> make<00:05:04.560> these

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
I can press and I have to make these

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.650 
I can press and I have to make these
pngs<00:05:05.280> because<00:05:05.729> they<00:05:05.820> need<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.060> be<00:05:06.150> transparent

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
pngs because they need to be transparent

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.879 
pngs because they need to be transparent
so<00:05:06.690> they<00:05:06.840> can<00:05:06.960> overlay<00:05:07.260> over<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.500> background

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
so they can overlay over the background

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.070 
so they can overlay over the background
and<00:05:08.070> they're<00:05:08.790> really<00:05:08.940> small<00:05:09.240> just<00:05:09.690> four<00:05:09.900> K

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
and they're really small just four K

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.689 
and they're really small just four K
each<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:11.070> now<00:05:11.190> I'm<00:05:11.250> going<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.400> call<00:05:11.550> this

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
each so now I'm going to call this

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:22.520 
each so now I'm going to call this
adventure<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:16.919> call<00:05:17.160> this<00:05:17.370> one<00:05:21.380> click<00:05:22.380> on

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
adventure and I call this one click on

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.510 
adventure and I call this one click on
it<00:05:22.680> to<00:05:22.800> select<00:05:22.949> it

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
it to select it

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.730 
it to select it
change<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.180> PNG<00:05:24.650> call<00:05:25.650> it<00:05:25.770> discovery<00:05:26.340> and

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
change it to PNG call it discovery and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:35.920 
change it to PNG call it discovery and
do<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:28.919> same<00:05:29.130> thing<00:05:29.430> here<00:05:29.790> friendship<00:05:31.130> PNG

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.340 

and<00:05:38.210> Photoshop<00:05:39.210> is<00:05:39.240> going<00:05:39.479> to<00:05:39.540> append<00:05:40.139> the

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
and Photoshop is going to append the

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.190 
and Photoshop is going to append the
slice<00:05:40.889> number<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.700> each<00:05:41.820> one<00:05:42.030> of<00:05:42.060> these<00:05:42.240> so<00:05:43.169> I

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
slice number to each one of these so I

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.930 
slice number to each one of these so I
can<00:05:43.440> change<00:05:43.620> this<00:05:43.889> or<00:05:44.280> I<00:05:44.370> can<00:05:44.580> leave<00:05:44.729> it<00:05:44.850> the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
can change this or I can leave it the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.000 
can change this or I can leave it the
same<00:05:44.970> it's<00:05:45.450> really<00:05:45.750> no<00:05:45.870> big<00:05:46.050> deal<00:05:46.260> probably

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
same it's really no big deal probably

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.350 
same it's really no big deal probably
better<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.280> change<00:05:47.580> it<00:05:47.789> from<00:05:47.910> a<00:05:48.060> Google

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
better to change it from a Google

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.270 
better to change it from a Google
perspective<00:05:48.680> especially<00:05:49.680> when<00:05:49.979> you<00:05:50.070> start

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
perspective especially when you start

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.550 
perspective especially when you start
putting<00:05:50.430> all<00:05:50.639> text<00:05:51.090> in<00:05:51.210> okay<00:05:51.840> so<00:05:51.900> I've<00:05:52.139> got<00:05:52.350> my

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
putting all text in okay so I've got my

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.790 
putting all text in okay so I've got my
three<00:05:54.199> key<00:05:55.199> words<00:05:55.410> here<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:57.470> need<00:05:58.470> to<00:05:58.560> do<00:05:58.650> my

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
three key words here I need to do my

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.090 
three key words here I need to do my
logo<00:05:59.010> area<00:05:59.340> so<00:06:00.120> let's<00:06:00.300> go<00:06:00.419> ahead<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:00.690> do<00:06:00.780> that

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
logo area so let's go ahead and do that

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.529 
logo area so let's go ahead and do that
my<00:06:02.100> sponsorship<00:06:02.550> area<00:06:02.940> I<00:06:02.970> should<00:06:03.000> say<00:06:03.270> and

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
my sponsorship area I should say and

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.980 
my sponsorship area I should say and
again<00:06:04.530> what<00:06:05.190> I'm<00:06:05.280> gonna<00:06:05.400> do<00:06:05.580> here<00:06:05.880> is<00:06:05.910> just<00:06:06.060> get

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
again what I'm gonna do here is just get

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.589 
again what I'm gonna do here is just get
rid<00:06:07.139> of<00:06:07.200> the<00:06:07.320> background<00:06:10.849> grab<00:06:11.849> my<00:06:12.000> slice<00:06:12.300> tool

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
rid of the background grab my slice tool

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.469 
rid of the background grab my slice tool
and<00:06:13.050> I<00:06:13.139> know<00:06:13.200> I<00:06:13.830> know<00:06:14.580> this<00:06:14.849> logo<00:06:15.060> is<00:06:15.270> actually

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
and I know I know this logo is actually

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.240 
and I know I know this logo is actually
a<00:06:15.720> little<00:06:16.080> bit<00:06:16.229> bigger<00:06:16.410> than<00:06:16.650> what<00:06:16.919> I<00:06:16.950> have

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
a little bit bigger than what I have

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.800 
a little bit bigger than what I have
here<00:06:17.490> so<00:06:17.700> I'm<00:06:17.849> gonna<00:06:17.970> make<00:06:18.150> that<00:06:18.360> slice<00:06:18.660> about

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
here so I'm gonna make that slice about

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:26.930 
here so I'm gonna make that slice about
that<00:06:19.110> big<00:06:19.380> again<00:06:20.310> save<00:06:21.919> select<00:06:24.260> PNG<00:06:25.260> and<00:06:26.070> hit

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
that big again save select PNG and hit

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:34.290 
that big again save select PNG and hit
save

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.850 

so<00:06:35.300> that's<00:06:35.509> all<00:06:35.780> there<00:06:35.930> is<00:06:35.990> to<00:06:36.350> it<00:06:36.500> for<00:06:36.530> this

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
so that's all there is to it for this

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.430 
so that's all there is to it for this
part<00:06:37.160> of<00:06:37.340> the<00:06:37.580> design<00:06:38.060> I<00:06:38.300> something<00:06:39.080> to<00:06:39.199> do<00:06:39.290> my

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
part of the design I something to do my

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.870 
part of the design I something to do my
roll<00:06:39.620> overs<00:06:39.889> but<00:06:40.040> that's<00:06:40.220> really<00:06:40.460> simple<00:06:40.699> and

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
roll overs but that's really simple and

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.010 
roll overs but that's really simple and
you've<00:06:41.030> already<00:06:41.180> seen<00:06:41.479> how<00:06:41.570> we're<00:06:41.720> going<00:06:41.840> to

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
you've already seen how we're going to

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.560 
you've already seen how we're going to
do<00:06:42.169> those<00:06:42.350> because<00:06:43.220> all<00:06:43.400> I<00:06:43.430> need<00:06:43.759> to<00:06:43.880> do<00:06:44.030> now<00:06:44.240> is

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
do those because all I need to do now is

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.279 
do those because all I need to do now is
just<00:06:45.020> hide<00:06:45.530> everything<00:06:46.009> else<00:06:46.570> grab<00:06:47.570> my<00:06:47.840> tool

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
just hide everything else grab my tool

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:55.270 
just hide everything else grab my tool
and<00:06:48.650> create<00:06:49.610> a<00:06:51.669> new<00:06:52.669> slice<00:06:52.940> around<00:06:53.270> that<00:06:53.419> and<00:06:54.280> I

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
and create a new slice around that and I

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.469 
and create a new slice around that and I
would<00:06:55.430> repeat<00:06:55.580> that<00:06:55.729> for<00:06:56.030> the<00:06:56.060> rest<00:06:56.270> of<00:06:56.360> them

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 
would repeat that for the rest of them

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.439 
would repeat that for the rest of them
so<00:06:56.660> we<00:06:57.440> have<00:06:57.620> our<00:06:57.740> slices<00:06:58.039> let's<00:06:59.000> move<00:06:59.210> on<00:06:59.360> to

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
so we have our slices let's move on to

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:01.990 
so we have our slices let's move on to
the<00:06:59.600> next<00:06:59.780> section
