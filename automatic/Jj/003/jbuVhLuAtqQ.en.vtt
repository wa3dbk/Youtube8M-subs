00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.940
 very good to all and welcome to the day 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.769
 today I bring you a video very fast today 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.660
 and simple he taught us to make a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.120
 craft one day the same as you want 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.160
 call it I came up with seeing several 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.650
 crafts that I saw on the internet and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.410
 final combine the idea and what happened 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.720
 I'm going to teach now it's very simple like 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.859
 I have already said and I hope you like what 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.810
 I will teach how to do it is simply 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 Decorate hangers with paper and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.859
 glue and the result of milk I do not know 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.390
 yes it will look very good right now in 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.360
 camera but throughout the video the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.219
 you are going to be able to move well I do not know I think 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.870
 You can have a pretty original touch 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.750
 especially those girls that you have 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.489
 the clothes in the room on a donkey you have 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.950
 a dressing room without doors that look 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.750
 hangers I think they are pretty nice 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.489
 to give that special seat or even 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.620
 you can do the simply a hanger 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.170
 for some occasion some work like that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.750
 what do you want it to look like I do not know I think 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.670
 it's very beautiful it's very cheap seriously and 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.379
 It's very easy before, so I think that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.359
 encourage them to do it and like the video 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.129
 almost at the end of the video I'm going to leave you 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.899
 also some small ideas for what 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.430
 and use the hangers as a way 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.920
 decoration since maybe as well 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.090
 I do not have a donkey either and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.399
 these are the materials that you are going to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.470
 need some hangers as they are 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.470
 white or wooden printed paper with 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.710
 our favorite image scissors a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 hair brush and other foam rubber a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.760
 pencil 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 mount bots or white tail and I do co 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.330
 locate as a card the first 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.280
 step is to look for our images 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.080
 I loved the honeys I found in 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.490
 interest but you can look for it 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.659
 where you want and then simply 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.659
 you have to print them 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:55.979
 with the paper we have chosen we draw 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:57.570
 the silhouette and cut them the next 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.820
 step is to paint the surface of the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.159
 hanger with the mod post or the white tail 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 which is a kind of special glue 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.119
 for crafts I bought mine in 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.039
 ebay since they do not sell it in Spain 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.600
 I leave the link below if you are interested and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.580
 you have to leave a layer rather 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.270
 thick if it's too thin do not have 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.220
 results 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.230
 once we have put the glue on 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.360
 the hanger we take the image that we have 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.920
 chosen and we paste it taking into account 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.200
 that the image has to be towards 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.940
 below and when you are German on the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.530
 surface so that we do not have any 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.870
 class of lumps have more problems 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.060
 forward we take the card and perform 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.380
 the surface very smoothly now 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.390
 you just have to let the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.190
 glue act I recommend you and it is what 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.340
 that I had let it dry throughout 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.340
 one night 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.870
 the next day with a damp cloth 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.430
 we are going down the surface little by little 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.760
 until it is translucent as in the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.760
 video 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.220
 and now just when it's wet 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.020
 we have to have a lot of patience and now 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.610
 either with a cloth or with our own 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.800
 fingers we have to go rubbing the 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.420
 surface very gently until 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.280
 let's see that the first layer of the folio 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.800
 fade 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.910
 and as a final step we're going to give it a layer 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.580
 with the glue that we have used 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:40.530
 previously to fix the image and that 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:41.880
 last much longer and that's all you leave 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.810
 hanging a couple of hours so that it 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.810
 dry and ready 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.000
 and well that was the video I hope that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.440
 you liked it and if you have any kind 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.850
 of doubt you only have to leave me 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.470
 low in comments and I will try 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.690
 answer you as soon as possible 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.780
 I promise and if you are going to like it very much 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.580
 and are you going to put it into practice please 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.380

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.180

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.420
 craft that you would have taken a lot 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.160
 delusion 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.160
