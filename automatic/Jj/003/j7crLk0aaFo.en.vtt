 now you still need to know how the strength of your shirt is determined 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.240
 You have consisted of the five best cards for you 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.850
 the lowest end you can have is the high card

 these hands consist of two cards of the same values 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.290
 the higher the map, the higher the value of the yen 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.290
 a few gentlemen is therefore stronger than a few sixes 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.310
 then you guessed it already the role horse 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.460
 yes then two times two cards of the same values 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.460
 for example two fourths enschede 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.330
 same values 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.930
 for example, three tens 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.600
 now the interesting in this case can be the Swedish or the street 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 this and five cards of consecutive value for example 8 9 10 the farmer's wife 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 in connection with always you have to remember those things 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.460
 the cards do not require the same kind of work you can let two down 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.790
 have a heart 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.120
 the boss can serve as the highest or lowest card and 3 is the best region 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.080
 the basketing woman 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 and aas 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.609
 the next hensby is stronger than the regional bus bottle 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.500
 for example, those are the five cards of the same kind of five hearts 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.280
 the father of the card has no interest and they should not follow it either 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.300
 you have the strongest flax you have on the astense 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.060
 and she didn't 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.880
 arrived at the full house that is a combination of peel for time and one 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.660
 couple for example s three children admission 5 euros this will be a very strong hand 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.390
 with which a lot of pots can win, I also think there is a fullhouse 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.930
 late 19th and two facts stronger than a full house people think facts entrance 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.719
 10 euros that looks is for a red card of which you think three have the friezes 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.080
 there is even 23 being stronger than it persists 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.030
 and those are the absolute top first and foremost is the incident carint and afterwards 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.110
 say nothing but yourself that are four cards of the same values 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.149
 for example, four walls 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:40.039
 then the district is flores 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.959
 we have already been introduced to the region and the farc and the following and 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.489
 it is a combination of both that is also called flax flax 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.920
 those are the five consecutive cards of the same type of robots 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:57.830
 5 6 7 8 and 9 are the strongest risers in addition to state purchasing conditions 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:58.820
 logically 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.989
 from the strongest cards 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.319
 aalsmeer woman board and 10 if you have five cards from it 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.299
 same kind then you have the strongest possible hand in poker that is then 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.890
 again very different no hand can you still exist none 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.370
 if you have this card in your hands because the chance is small, extremely small 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.830
 let all those who beat him go over 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.450
 the lowest end is the shark card, followed by a few 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.679
 and then a double pair 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:33.869
 next in the list the prey is reduced so that is three cards of 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.009
 same values 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.800
 stronger than a trio reduced is discreet 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.380
 for example, the fifth consecutive cards are 4 5 6 7 and 8 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.989
 then a puddle follows that are again five cards of the same suit 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.949
 for example q5 heartily 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.359
 then the perseverance follows which is a combination of a free other side and a 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.829
 for example, pair three fifths and two aces 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.429
