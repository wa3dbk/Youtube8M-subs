00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
initially when I saw the flag thought it

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.410 
initially when I saw the flag thought it
was<00:00:16.830> Russia<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.490> like<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.699> may<00:00:18.000> take

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it's something like I've not done yet

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.500 
it's something like I've not done yet
either<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.530> fifa<00:00:40.829> 13<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.430> fifa<00:00:41.760> 14<00:00:41.969> let<00:00:42.300> alone

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
either on fifa 13 or fifa 14 let alone

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.229 
either on fifa 13 or fifa 14 let alone
on<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:43.410> youtube<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.190> i<00:00:44.219> would<00:00:44.640> definitely<00:00:44.670> like

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
on on youtube so i would definitely like

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.970 
on on youtube so i would definitely like
to<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.840> possibly<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:46.890> we

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
to do that if I possibly can then we

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
to do that if I possibly can then we
could<00:00:47.100> make<00:00:47.309> some<00:00:47.550> sort<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> mini<00:00:48.030> series<00:00:48.300> out

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
could make some sort of mini series out

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
could make some sort of mini series out
of<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> world<00:00:49.590> cup<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
of it for it for the world cup but of

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.420 
of it for it for the world cup but of
course<00:00:50.460> hopefully<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.629> next<00:00:52.320> summer<00:00:52.649> there

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
course hopefully by next summer there

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.069 
course hopefully by next summer there
will<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.610> some<00:00:53.940> sort<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.360> either<00:00:54.629> whether<00:00:54.899> it's

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
will be some sort of either whether it's

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
will be some sort of either whether it's
DLC<00:00:55.559> again<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.280> euro<00:00:56.430> 2012<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
DLC again like it was for euro 2012 or a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
DLC again like it was for euro 2012 or a
standalone<00:00:58.140> title<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
standalone title like it was for the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.090 
standalone title like it was for the
world<00:00:59.370> cup<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.699> 2010<00:01:00.270> there<00:01:00.870> may<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.739> extra

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
world cup in 2010 there may be an extra

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.340 
world cup in 2010 there may be an extra
fifa<00:01:02.399> title<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> world<00:01:04.080> cup<00:01:04.140> in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
fifa title for a for the world cup in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.830 
fifa title for a for the world cup in
2014<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.010> brazil<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.400> rio<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.850> hopefully<00:01:06.330> we'll

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
2014 in brazil in rio so hopefully we'll

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.270 
2014 in brazil in rio so hopefully we'll
have<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> wait<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.799> hopefully<00:01:08.130> there

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
have to wait and see but hopefully there

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
have to wait and see but hopefully there
will<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.430> something<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
will be something we can do for the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.570 
will be something we can do for the
world<00:01:10.500> cup<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.920> hopefully<00:01:11.250> rather<00:01:11.400> than

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
world cup but hopefully rather than

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
world cup but hopefully rather than
sooner<00:01:11.939> rather<00:01:12.210> than<00:01:12.420> later<00:01:12.540> maybe<00:01:12.900> we'll<00:01:13.110> get

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
sooner rather than later maybe we'll get

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.600 
sooner rather than later maybe we'll get
a<00:01:13.320> decent<00:01:13.530> international<00:01:14.159> management<00:01:14.310> offer

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
a decent international management offer

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.719 
a decent international management offer
between<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.619> start<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> world
