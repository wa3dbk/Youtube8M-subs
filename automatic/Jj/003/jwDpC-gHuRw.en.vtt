so<00:00:04.410> now<00:00:04.620> we're<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.279> to<00:00:05.340> take<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.520> look<00:00:05.730> at<00:00:05.850> the

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
so now we're going to take a look at the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.240 
so now we're going to take a look at the
Holy<00:00:06.359> stain<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.650> represents

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
Holy stain this represents

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.100 
Holy stain this represents
electro-harmonix<00:00:08.879> first<00:00:09.330> foray<00:00:09.690> into<00:00:10.080> the

electro-harmonix first foray into the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.080 
electro-harmonix first foray into the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
weird ads as two sections in this

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.919 
weird ads as two sections in this
section<00:00:14.700> over<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.509> two<00:00:15.690> great

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
section over here you have two great

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.780 
section over here you have two great
reverbs<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.860> a<00:00:16.890> room<00:00:17.160> reverb<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.700> a

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
reverbs you have a room reverb and a

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.880 
reverbs you have a room reverb and a
holla<00:00:18.029> reverb<00:00:18.450> you<00:00:18.840> also<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.230> tremolo<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
holla reverb you also have a tremolo and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.499 
holla reverb you also have a tremolo and
then<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> controllable<00:00:20.790> pitch<00:00:20.910> shifter<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
then a controllable pitch shifter and

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.600 
then a controllable pitch shifter and
the<00:00:21.689> pitch<00:00:21.899> shifter<00:00:22.230> can<00:00:22.410> go<00:00:22.590> from<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.279> third

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
the pitch shifter can go from a third

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.940 
the pitch shifter can go from a third
above<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.149> a<00:00:24.180> fourth<00:00:24.480> below<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:25.470> moving<00:00:25.739> over

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
above to a fourth below now moving over

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.530 
above to a fourth below now moving over
into<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.220> distortion<00:00:26.790> section<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.419> an

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
into the distortion section you have an

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.450 
into the distortion section you have an
analog<00:00:27.930> drive<00:00:28.259> and<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:29.040> also<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.430> a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
analog drive and you also have a

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.790 
analog drive and you also have a
distortion<00:00:30.059> and<00:00:30.270> a<00:00:30.360> fuzz<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.930> those<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.649> all

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
distortion and a fuzz and those are all

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.560 
distortion and a fuzz and those are all
controllable<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> tone<00:00:32.880> control<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
controllable with the tone control and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500 
controllable with the tone control and
you<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.050> choose<00:00:34.230> bright<00:00:34.590> dark<00:00:35.070> or<00:00:35.340> warm<00:00:35.760> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
you can choose bright dark or warm so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.640 
you can choose bright dark or warm so
taking<00:00:36.810> a<00:00:36.870> look<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.260> we're<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
taking a look at this we're going to

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.680 
taking a look at this we're going to
switch<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> fuzz<00:00:38.490> we're<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> use<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
switch to the fuzz we're going to use it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
switch to the fuzz we're going to use it
in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> dark<00:00:40.110> setting<00:00:40.650> keep<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> tone<00:00:41.220> right

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
in the dark setting keep the tone right

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.800 
in the dark setting keep the tone right
there<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.880> we're<00:00:41.970> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.120> keep<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.390> reverb

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
there and we're going to keep the reverb

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.240 
there and we're going to keep the reverb
out<00:00:42.990> for<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> minute<00:00:43.470> so<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.770> hear<00:00:43.950> just

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
out for a minute so you can hear just

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:57.369 
out for a minute so you can hear just
what<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.490> fuzz<00:00:44.670> sounds<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.120> by<00:00:45.270> itself

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.229 

that<00:00:58.379> sounds<00:00:58.649> pretty<00:00:58.710> cool<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.430> now<00:00:59.969> we're

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that sounds pretty cool and now we're

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.779 
that sounds pretty cool and now we're
going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.390> blend<00:01:00.839> in<00:01:01.219> probably<00:01:02.219> too<00:01:02.370> much<00:01:02.399> but

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
going to blend in probably too much but

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.509 
going to blend in probably too much but
I<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.059> lot<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.750> room<00:01:03.989> reverb<00:01:04.399> we<00:01:05.399> have

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I like a lot of the room reverb we have

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.070 
I like a lot of the room reverb we have
the<00:01:05.610> mouth<00:01:05.790> set<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.149> max<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.930> have

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the mouth set to max and then we have

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
the mouth set to max and then we have
the<00:01:07.229> mix<00:01:07.470> set<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> about<00:01:07.950> three<00:01:08.640> o'clock<00:01:08.670> which

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the mix set to about three o'clock which

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:23.550 
the mix set to about three o'clock which
is<00:01:09.270> probably<00:01:09.420> bout<00:01:09.600> seventy<00:01:09.930> five<00:01:10.049> percent

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.870 

now<00:01:24.560> let's<00:01:24.770> take<00:01:24.890> a<00:01:24.950> look<00:01:25.040> at<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.460> tremolo

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
now let's take a look at the tremolo

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.460 
now let's take a look at the tremolo
function<00:01:26.300> of<00:01:26.420> this<00:01:26.540> we're<00:01:26.750> going<00:01:26.870> to<00:01:26.930> keep<00:01:27.140> the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
function of this we're going to keep the

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.320 
function of this we're going to keep the
distortion<00:01:28.340> section<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.730> clean<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:29.240> can

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
distortion section to clean so you can

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.970 
distortion section to clean so you can
really<00:01:29.540> hear<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.810> tremolo<00:01:30.230> we<00:01:30.740> have<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
really hear the tremolo we have the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.430 
really hear the tremolo we have the
amount<00:01:31.310> set<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.640> quite<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> bit<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.720> mix<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.170> set

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
amount set to quite a bit the mix is set

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.110 
amount set to quite a bit the mix is set
to<00:01:33.560> quite<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.770> bit<00:01:34.010> volumes<00:01:34.490> down<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.730> little<00:01:34.940> bit

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
to quite a bit volumes down a little bit

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.820 
to quite a bit volumes down a little bit
should<00:01:35.630> be<00:01:35.690> a<00:01:35.720> nice<00:01:35.870> clean<00:01:36.170> tremolo<00:01:36.560> through

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
should be a nice clean tremolo through

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:51.160 
should be a nice clean tremolo through
that<00:01:37.040> see<00:01:37.910> what<00:01:38.030> that<00:01:38.150> sounds<00:01:38.420> like<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:51.080> now

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
that see what that sounds like so now

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.410 
that see what that sounds like so now
let's<00:01:51.320> bring<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.770> distortion<00:01:52.520> side<00:01:52.729> we're

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
let's bring in the distortion side we're

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.700 
let's bring in the distortion side we're
going<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.570> bring<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:53.930> in<00:01:54.140> we're<00:01:54.500> gonna<00:01:54.619> take

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
going to bring that in we're gonna take

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.999 
going to bring that in we're gonna take
the<00:01:54.940> vomit<00:01:55.940> maybe<00:01:56.869> back<00:01:57.200> off<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.649> mix<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
the vomit maybe back off the mix of the

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.620 
the vomit maybe back off the mix of the
tremolo<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.430> back<00:01:58.700> off<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.030> amount<00:01:59.360> so<00:01:59.509> it's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
tremolo and back off the amount so it's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.880 
tremolo and back off the amount so it's
a<00:01:59.690> little<00:01:59.869> slower<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.410> it's<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.590> little<00:02:00.800> more

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
a little slower so it's a little more

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:13.340 
a little slower so it's a little more
subtle<00:02:01.250> keep<00:02:02.180> things<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.570> that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.619 

hey

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.670 

so<00:02:21.629> let's<00:02:21.780> check<00:02:21.959> out<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.140> hall<00:02:22.439> reverb

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
so let's check out the hall reverb

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.050 
so let's check out the hall reverb
setting<00:02:23.159> on<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.370> thing's<00:02:23.579> it's<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.849> really

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
setting on this thing's it's a really

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.270 
setting on this thing's it's a really
beautiful<00:02:24.269> lush<00:02:24.900> sounding<00:02:25.260> reverb<00:02:25.620> I've<00:02:26.069> set

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
beautiful lush sounding reverb I've set

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.009 
beautiful lush sounding reverb I've set
the<00:02:26.400> distortion<00:02:26.819> section<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.239> clean<00:02:27.540> which<00:02:27.900> is

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
the distortion section to clean which is

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.869 
the distortion section to clean which is
basically<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.439> bypass<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.189> then<00:02:29.609> i<00:02:29.670> have<00:02:29.819> the

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
basically a bypass and then i have the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.670 
basically a bypass and then i have the
EQ<00:02:30.180> section<00:02:30.359> set<00:02:30.689> to<00:02:30.810> kind<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.140> dark<00:02:31.349> sound

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
EQ section set to kind of a dark sound

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.619 
EQ section set to kind of a dark sound
so<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.640> Hobby<00:02:32.969> verb<00:02:33.150> going<00:02:33.450> we<00:02:33.569> have

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
so we have the Hobby verb going we have

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.910 
so we have the Hobby verb going we have
a<00:02:33.689> generous<00:02:34.019> amount<00:02:34.109> of<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.469> let's<00:02:34.680> see<00:02:34.799> what

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
a generous amount of it let's see what

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:53.520 
a generous amount of it let's see what
it<00:02:34.950> sounds<00:02:35.250> like

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.390 

the<00:02:54.530> last<00:02:54.710> thing<00:02:54.770> we<00:02:54.860> were<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.010> look<00:02:55.130> at<00:02:55.250> with

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
the last thing we were to look at with

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.520 
the last thing we were to look at with
this<00:02:55.520> is<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.180> pitch<00:02:56.450> shift<00:02:56.810> section<00:02:57.350> which

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
this is the pitch shift section which

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.950 
this is the pitch shift section which
you<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:57.800> set<00:02:58.100> manually<00:02:58.550> on<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.540> face<00:02:59.780> plate

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
you can set manually on the face plate

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.360 
you can set manually on the face plate
of<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.260> but<00:03:00.440> also<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.740> can<00:03:00.890> plug<00:03:01.070> in<00:03:01.250> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
of this but also you can plug in the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.010 
of this but also you can plug in the
expression<00:03:01.700> pedal<00:03:02.120> which<00:03:02.570> is<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> same

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
expression pedal which is the same

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.480 
expression pedal which is the same
expression<00:03:03.440> pedal<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:03.860> use<00:03:04.010> with<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.220> hog

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
expression pedal that you use with a hog

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.850 
expression pedal that you use with a hog
and<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:05.120> can<00:03:05.270> control<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.020> pitch<00:03:06.230> going<00:03:06.620> from

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
and you can control the pitch going from

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.040 
and you can control the pitch going from
a<00:03:06.980> fourth<00:03:07.220> down<00:03:07.490> to<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> third<00:03:08.060> above<00:03:08.330> so<00:03:08.930> we

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
a fourth down to a third above so we

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.510 
a fourth down to a third above so we
have<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.260> expression<00:03:09.440> pedal<00:03:09.890> plugged<00:03:10.250> in

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
have the expression pedal plugged in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.060 
have the expression pedal plugged in
we're<00:03:11.060> set<00:03:11.210> to<00:03:11.240> fuzz<00:03:11.630> we're<00:03:12.200> set<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.410> warm<00:03:12.830> on

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
we're set to fuzz we're set to warm on

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.920 
we're set to fuzz we're set to warm on
this<00:03:13.310> side<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:13.880> I<00:03:14.240> think<00:03:14.450> we're<00:03:14.540> ready<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.720> go

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
this side and I think we're ready to go

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.360 
this side and I think we're ready to go
so<00:03:15.230> this<00:03:15.410> is<00:03:15.530> what<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:15.740> sounds<00:03:16.040> like<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.280> we

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
so this is what it sounds like and we

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.280 
so this is what it sounds like and we
have<00:03:16.520> we<00:03:16.970> have<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.180> mix<00:03:17.390> set<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.750> about<00:03:17.840> fifty

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
have we have to mix set to about fifty

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.260 
have we have to mix set to about fifty
percent<00:03:18.320> fifty<00:03:19.280> percent<00:03:19.490> original<00:03:19.910> signal

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
percent fifty percent original signal

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:39.760 
percent fifty percent original signal
fifty<00:03:20.600> percent<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:20.990> pitch<00:03:21.140> Bend

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.870 

so<00:03:40.770> these<00:03:40.890> things<00:03:41.040> all<00:03:41.250> sound<00:03:41.490> great<00:03:41.640> by

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
so these things all sound great by

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.520 
so these things all sound great by
themselves<00:03:42.300> but<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.780> magic<00:03:43.110> really<00:03:43.350> happens

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
themselves but the magic really happens

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.500 
themselves but the magic really happens
when<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.920> combine<00:03:44.040> them<00:03:44.459> pick<00:03:45.030> one<00:03:45.180> from<00:03:45.300> this

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
when you combine them pick one from this

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.330 
when you combine them pick one from this
side<00:03:45.720> pick<00:03:46.050> one<00:03:46.200> from<00:03:46.319> this<00:03:46.560> side<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.010> it's

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
side pick one from this side and it's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.790 
side pick one from this side and it's
going<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.520> sound<00:03:47.670> great
