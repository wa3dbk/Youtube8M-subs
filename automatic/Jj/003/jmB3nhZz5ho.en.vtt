the<00:01:14.250> best<00:01:14.400> weapon<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> game<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.900> second

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the best weapon in the game the second

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.740 
the best weapon in the game the second
best<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.159> second<00:01:17.490> gun<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> retro<00:01:18.330> Lancer<00:01:18.720> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
best the second gun the retro Lancer I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.999 
best the second gun the retro Lancer I
also<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.439> really<00:01:19.650> good<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
also think it's really good with a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.270 
also think it's really good with a
bayonet<00:01:20.310> instead<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> chainsaw<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
bayonet instead of like the chainsaw I

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
bayonet instead of like the chainsaw I
think<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.549> good<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.390> problem<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
think it's really good the problem is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
think it's really good the problem is
range<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.009> gun<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.430> very<00:01:26.700> limited<00:01:26.909> you
