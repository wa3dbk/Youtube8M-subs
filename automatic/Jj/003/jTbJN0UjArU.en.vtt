that wireframe for me again now if you
are<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.549> my<00:01:32.640> students<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> artist<00:01:33.479> to

the<00:01:33.720> Pittsburgh<00:01:34.549> you've<00:01:35.549> most<00:01:36.060> likely<00:01:36.180> been

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the Pittsburgh you've most likely been

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.819 
the Pittsburgh you've most likely been
shown<00:01:36.930> reat<00:01:37.229> apology<00:01:37.850> using<00:01:38.850> ZBrush<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
shown reat apology using ZBrush and

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.190 
shown reat apology using ZBrush and
ZBrush<00:01:40.829> has<00:01:41.040> some<00:01:41.340> some<00:01:41.759> nice<00:01:41.990> topology<00:01:42.990> tools

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
ZBrush has some some nice topology tools

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.520 
ZBrush has some some nice topology tools
but<00:01:43.409> they're<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:43.890> clunky<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:45.530> some

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
but they're a little bit clunky and some

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.109 
but they're a little bit clunky and some
folks<00:01:46.829> don't<00:01:47.009> take<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.430> them<00:01:47.549> right<00:01:47.670> away<00:01:47.820> just

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
folks don't take to them right away just

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.420 
folks don't take to them right away just
because<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.689> ZBrush<00:01:49.079> interface<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> little

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
because the ZBrush interface is a little

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.060 
because the ZBrush interface is a little
alien<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.350> an<00:01:52.530> alternative

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
alien so this is just an alternative

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.249 
alien so this is just an alternative
that<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.340> wanted<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> share<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.689> first<00:01:55.110> thing

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that I wanted to share so first thing

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.840 
that I wanted to share so first thing
you<00:01:55.320> got<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.860> load<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.280> high<00:01:56.520> poly

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you got to do is load in your high poly

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.359 
you got to do is load in your high poly
mesh<00:01:57.170> okay<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.829> ahead<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:58.979> select

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
mesh okay and if I go ahead and select

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.270 
mesh okay and if I go ahead and select
this<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.670> guy<00:02:00.530> you'll<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.100> go

still<00:02:11.980> sort<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.310> working<00:02:12.670> progress<00:02:12.910> in<00:02:13.330> ZBrush

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
still sort of working progress in ZBrush

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.220 
still sort of working progress in ZBrush
but<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.250> decimated<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.550> exported<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.570> lower

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
but I decimated it and exported a lower

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.260 
but I decimated it and exported a lower
poly<00:02:17.560> version<00:02:18.010> into<00:02:18.190> max<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.580> could<00:02:18.730> use<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.120> as

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
poly version into max I could use it as

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.900 
poly version into max I could use it as
an<00:02:19.510> example<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> let's<00:02:21.340> say<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.670> want<00:02:21.850> to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.800 
tutorials so okay step one instead of
drawing<00:03:33.340> on<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.700> grid<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.180> actually<00:03:34.420> want<00:03:34.780> to

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
drawing on the grid I actually want to

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.470

be<00:03:34.930> able<00:03:35.020> to<00:03:35.170> draw<00:03:35.380> polygons<00:03:35.950> onto<00:03:36.670> my<00:03:37.120> model

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
be able to draw polygons onto my model

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.420 
be able to draw polygons onto my model
so<00:03:37.660> I'm<00:03:37.780> gonna<00:03:37.900> come<00:03:38.110> up<00:03:38.200> here<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:39.070> this<00:03:39.190> little
