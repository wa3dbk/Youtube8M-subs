00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.740 
to be using um 10 bombers hiking buyers
and<00:00:39.059> 14<00:00:39.710> Hornets<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.239> pretty

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
and 14 Hornets on this one I'm pretty

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.319 
and 14 Hornets on this one I'm pretty
sure<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.559> use<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:45.000> think

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
sure you can use like I know I think

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.340 
sure you can use like I know I think
when<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> passed<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.170> ahead<00:00:46.379> level<00:00:46.710> 3<00:00:47.270> um<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
when I passed it ahead level 3 um a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.569 
when I passed it ahead level 3 um a
gunner<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.590> level<00:00:49.890> three<00:00:50.070> Hornets<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.550> I

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
gunner in a level three Hornets so I

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.950 
gunner in a level three Hornets so I
don't<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.480> level<00:00:51.750> four

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
don't think you have to have level four

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
don't think you have to have level four
to<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.469> since<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> little<00:00:53.550> farther

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to be it but since I'm a little farther

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.600 
to be it but since I'm a little farther
than<00:00:54.120> most<00:00:55.110> people<00:00:55.440> i<00:00:55.500> guess<00:00:55.829> since<00:00:56.399> I'm

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
than most people i guess since I'm

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.040 
than most people i guess since I'm
farther<00:00:56.910> than<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.180> mission<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.719> mission

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
farther than that mission that mission

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.670 
farther than that mission that mission
was<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.410> easier<00:00:58.680> now<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.859> i<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.190> a

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
was a little easier now that i have a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.529 
was a little easier now that i have a
level<00:01:01.680> four<00:01:01.890> guys<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.520> i'll<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.180> back<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
level four guys but i'll go back and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.240 
level four guys but i'll go back and
redo<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.799> i<00:01:04.860> did<00:01:04.949> i'm

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
redo it so you can see what i did i'm

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.380 
redo it so you can see what i did i'm
pretty<00:01:05.489> sure<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.939> how<00:01:06.060> i<00:01:06.090> did<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.299> last

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
pretty sure this is how i did it last

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.990 
pretty sure this is how i did it last
time<00:01:06.659> I'm<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.020> completely<00:01:07.409> sure<00:01:07.850> if<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.970> should

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
time I'm not completely sure if I should

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.330 
time I'm not completely sure if I should
work<00:01:09.360> basically<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.310> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
work basically on this one what I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.530 
work basically on this one what I
usually<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.820> try<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> take<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
usually do is try to take out the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.350 
usually do is try to take out the
Hornets<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:13.020> when<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> attack<00:01:14.100> people<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
Hornets first when I attack people so

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
Hornets first when I attack people so
this<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.100> there's<00:01:17.280> little

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this one you can see here there's little

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
this one you can see here there's little
space<00:01:17.729> opening<00:01:18.119> right<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> send<00:01:19.409> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
space opening right here so I send in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
space opening right here so I send in
some<00:01:19.740> Gunners<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.490> through<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.060> then

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
some Gunners to go through here and then

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.490 
some Gunners to go through here and then
they<00:01:21.270> take<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.229> for<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
they take up this and then go for this

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.890 
they take up this and then go for this
one<00:01:22.560> next<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.970> over<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.240> there<00:01:24.750> isn't

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
one next and then over here there isn't

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.460 
one next and then over here there isn't
a<00:01:25.140> space<00:01:25.380> next<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.270> flamethrower<00:01:27.470> so

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
a space next to this flamethrower so

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
a space next to this flamethrower so
what<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> did<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.250> took<00:01:29.280> some<00:01:29.610> bombers<00:01:30.000> and

bound<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.720> wall<00:01:31.040> because<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.130> does<00:01:32.310> take

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
bound up this wall because it does take

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.190 
bound up this wall because it does take
a<00:01:32.520> while<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.970> get<00:01:33.119> through<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.720> hope<00:01:33.960> 10

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
