00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.960
 two how to use his controller 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.859
 3.60 for johan cruijff on pc so 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.449
 super easy 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.160
 a two-step installation game 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.689
 super simple but to start I you 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.260
 present how money is used 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.300
 is in play 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.430
 so you see with the right joystick 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.500
 you see with the right gc we can be 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.600
 moved right there that's the joystick 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.480
 left we simply move 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.530
 with jump 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.620
 now that creative people can 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.629
 jump for to go with one of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.270
 two banks scared that we owe him we can 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.489
 do shift purposefully that is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.340
 that a tale is dull a robin for but 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.680
 it not fall with x renew 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 with the right trigger on 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.010
 can select different objects 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.400
 left there as famous sales 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 with left trigger places blocks 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 to destroy them the right trigger 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.700
 simply to select 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.590
 creative blocks that one presses on the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.900
 right joystick alone super simple in 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.990
 some nice stands 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.369
 finally the new piece here that see 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.049
 it's still pretty easy 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 of use passes like that if not for 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.290
 cover troops was beating in the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.900
 direction forward with the joystick 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.420
 left to talk with villagers 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.939
 but on the left suspects if not for 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.600
 the stuff in more detail but on the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.780
 stage this is very useful with the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.159
 select can include kinematic 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.659
 like that with by pressing rather on the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.180
 Left joystick we ask for a screenshot 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.490
 like that so we can observe that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.630
 move do description like his 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.549
 super blow game with the disappearance can 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.840
 do it up to change the view 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.830
 or in good for them the profile so here is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.500
 it's super healthy we take 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.780
 we put the blogs as it was read 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.260
 like that we fly over it's exactly the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.640
 same thing and no problem just 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.320
 we do not believe to unlock the nets and all 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.210
 so that's it for the presentation 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.860
 now to order series you 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.510

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.050
 that they do not have one is safe in the aude 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.850
 the group we expect a little bit and 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.959

 which has been downloaded is also 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.860
 on the desktop finally because the games 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.959
 downloaded to all makes 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.610
 extract once the file is 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.100

 inside the stuff then you can 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.790
 find the executable that is the same 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.050
 fruits like that open is saying yes a 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.570
 times here you go a file or

 close or public open and you have 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.540
 searched but graphics and not talking to us 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.750

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.959
 so introduced here dancers that's what 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.610
