00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.460
 operations 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.160
 yes you bought it in which year 2010 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.600
 September 11, 2001 with accor 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.930
 so what are these rooms outlander its 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.980
 150 6 uncertain yeah and you're using it 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.739
 for why exploitation no no no 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.610
 in fact no longer the system for maintenance 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.840
 and slugs after that lets me go 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.090
 search for you for example in case 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.860
 killer I have a small remark that 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.230
 that bring water a take a 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.440
 wheelbarrow because its laws to the mails your 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.210
 teeth and quiet after 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.620
 it allows me to go for a ride in 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.629
 a car in the village I 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.309
 several small fences down to that 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.630
 take the car is more pleasant 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.000
 to take the code that the car and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.140
 after make plain tower when 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.460
 do a tour of the plain is nice 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.990
 also good this year it's true 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.509
 that our years rites is lent 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.759
 the ideal but we always had a quad 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:22.899
 before changing dead we always have 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.130
 hands but if after a new look 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.530
 and what is it mostly to say 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.869
 quiet at the level of being able to go 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.479
 everywhere boxet what are you 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.960
 briconautes suite there we bought it from 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.909
 true enthusiasts be a confession a yeah 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:45.009
 what did you take concussion 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:48.429
 as an option almost ten years ago the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.729
 taxes nor shocking except in the winter and that 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:55.390
 it's essential as if we were going 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.880
 badly congested both with the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.899
 speed and cold and will make you and 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.009
 that's something 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.679
 indispensable 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.770
 and behind we did not take them but we 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.879
 has a system where six co driver and he wants 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.310
 he can put it now for 

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:11.590
 having too frank that's good because 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.360
 we also have fun a little bit is that 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.430
 snow do not want to make 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.830
 jokes slips and if we can not 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.730
 the heated handles we had 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.150
 a little afraid to go out 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.950
 at winter according to a winch 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.620
 also the brain homeland that 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.540
 after a winch goes it's really in case 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.819
 where went in summer to bruce ac 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.650
 that's how they sell it but 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.650
 we the key for our use 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.560
 because in fact we are a system 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.530
 cubicles in the locker room and 4 and one 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.030
 cow stuck in the cubicles on 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.390
 age we do not have the strength anymore 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.000
 had when we were 20 years old and we are 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.670
 than 2 on the rotations and it goes in 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.250
 do that we avoid calling for help 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.330
 and then to be able to do the job alone 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.190
 that is to say, we attach beyond 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.200
 clumsy h then slowly we got it 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.780
 slips under the couret rug and 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.700
 remote remote control north 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.019
 of course you have to climb it is a 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.870
 electric motor and electric motor 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.650
 rates yeah yeah more gently 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.660
 you need someone next to the bar is 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.269
 often when we do it in these cases 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.060
 it's really that some regrets t in 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.099
 or network situation is often she 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.900
 not move so true revolt has two 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.819
 hiccups creysse to the dough to break 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
 or when she gets up and then someone 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.720
 on the on the code 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.940
 good after what can we still 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.120
 say nothing second seat 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.030
 we took a second seat that is 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.579
 my wife she likes to come with my 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.819
 brother and to take to a person on 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.230
 headphones the soap box km cambrÃ©sis 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.609
 bakai is always driving it changes 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.760
 understands the small paths and then there 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:55.620
 how is the pontil far enough the bins 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.910
 well and the ideal is ideal because we 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.959
 can put both helmets sheryl crow 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.359
 offers can be your helmets and then 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.660
 them easily even something else 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:13.919
 the pomegranate skull and it's locked 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.739
 all is true that I practice so 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.739
 such take 3 blu am not an anti 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:25.560
 slugs and that would have been a vote on the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:27.419
 report ordered these halal menus I want 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.889
 your hook to draw a ball 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.639
 for a small trailer looked pretty 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.910
 but what is it worth 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.130
 a vettel practice has a little letter 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.410
 simple dead a little trailer that 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.380
 allows two cases to take the wheelbarrow 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:45.289
 to be born the calf in the little rumor 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:49.610
 short how they go maintenance this losc 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.860
 and time spent should not be neglected 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.939
 as it turns to the essence that the 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:02.749
 essence is so it's a way two-cylinder 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:07.479
 650 but it has a lot of punch 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:12.259
 scares in his name he is stable 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:14.300
 we are used to it since 90 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:19.759
 that three barracks as adequate from here 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.889
 so during the usual no and that's it 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.930
 there is weight on the front and not too much 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.249
 light of france acadie is heavy there 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.830
 is on the whole it is heavy and 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.809
 could get off the ground we can not get there 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.289
 not so easily that no no no no 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:35.860
 it's not worse 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:40.129
 yeah but well full well designed 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.449
 well finished I mean what are we 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.550
 learned how much tension we value 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:46.309
 also to protect the fires all that 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.059
 because my wine in the paths 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:51.740
 happens that the obstacle horse all 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:54.649
 to these things and I think it takes 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.569
 not neglect because it's expensive 

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:58.699
 all that is piece I would like to say 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:01.519
 still it's not close to a friend 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.909
 because it's better protected and then they 

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:05.749
 together 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:08.719
 it was sold well 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:12.620
 they were well advised of maintenance 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.879
 go we did the main thing is to 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.080
 say there are some gressing business 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:18.289
 air filter 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.849
 then after really go once a year 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:25.229
 we envision them in dying and vision 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.979
 at gps but comfortable especially 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.759
 comfortable 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:32.449
 easy to use after going here 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:35.699
 anti-slip that's not bad 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:41.150
 and which foot way quickly slipped 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:44.849
 canton when we come out good lighting 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.849
 and nothing to say that and when a calf in 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:50.190
 a black dress behind that is worth 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:53.039
 shoot street it's more simply I 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:57.990
 would like to say it's largely his 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:07:00.840
 powerful true that they are little says it 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.430
 rather it uses what it still 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.180
 mean I will not be directly the 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.740
 consumption but I played it's 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.279
 small machines that consume anyway 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.460
 must compare you must not hide it 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:13.460
 what
