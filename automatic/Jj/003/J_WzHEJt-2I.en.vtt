00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 As a general rule, the cargo may not 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.130
 stand out from the floor projection of 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.540
 a vehicle what is the perimeter of 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.090
 said vehicle 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.730
 exceptionally the load is allowed 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.010
 indivisible excels in those 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.830
 vehicles intended exclusively for 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 transport of goods vehicles 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.060
 intended for the transport of goods 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.820
 how are trucks and football is 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.189
 charging these vehicles when 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.449
 indivisible is to say that you can not 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.989
 chop as for example the beams the 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.750
 four light poles or pipes and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.839
 You can excel if the vehicle measures 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.080
 more than five meters two meters 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.870
 front and three meters behind and if the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.570
 vehicle is five meters or less 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.699
 may stand a third of the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.300
 measurements of the vehicle ahead and a 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.300
 third on the back 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.180
 in these same vehicles the cargo may 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.430
 protrude laterally on both sides 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.880
 of it as soon as it can excel 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.610
 so up to 40 centimeters per side 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.640
 but that yes as long as the width 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.460
 maximum of the vehicle including the load 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.460
 exceed 2 meters and 55 centimeters 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.490
 in those vehicles considered 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.299
 narrow is to say those whose width 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.450
 is less than one meter the load 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.450
 in front nothing will be able to stand out 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.320
 on the back you can stand out 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.360
 up to 25 centimeters and laterally but 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.369
 laterally measured from what is the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.700
 central axis that divides the vehicle into 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.979
 two parts may not exceed more than 50 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.319
 centimeters in such a way that the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.780
 total width of those vehicles as they are 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.700
 motorcycles or motorcycles do not 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.640
 You can overcome the subway 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.299
 in the rest of the vehicles case of the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.670
 4x4 passenger cars mixed vehicles cargo 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.100
 can not stand out of what is your 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.890
 projection in plant as we said to the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.500
 principle is exceptionally authorized 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.590
 that the load can protrude through the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.110
 back only up to 10 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.290
 percent when the load is 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.019
 indivisible may exceed 15 per 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.810
 cent and now let's see how 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.700
 we signal the load when it 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.390
 excels 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.800
 the load that comes out ahead 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.870
 it will only be signaled at night that is 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.670
 the load that protrudes in front of 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.970
 day will never be signaled 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.220
 the load that protrudes from behind goes to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.489
 be signaled both by day and by 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.910
 night of day we will place in the end 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.860
 of loading a panel uve 20 you know 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.100
 It is formed by a series of stripes 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.610
 red and white alternate and oblique 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.860
 as I said at the end of the load 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.530
 When the load protrudes across the width of 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.460
 vehicle we will place two pairs of panels 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.030
 of uve 20 one on each end and by the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.680
 At night these panels will be accompanied by 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.680
 a red light
