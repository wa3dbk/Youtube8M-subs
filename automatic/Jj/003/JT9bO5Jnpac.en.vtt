00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.460
 hello and welcome to the new 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.290
 website of exciters 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.739
 my name is mario ranked by the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.620
 biggest empire is reaching me again 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.739
 a pretty exciting call from one 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.059
 The opinion was on the opinion 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.940
 New Year's Eve in 2008 one 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.020
 sighting of an unusual 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.830
 to have made a flying object 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:17.300
 Of course he does not have the local one 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.460
 service reported because evidences around 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.530
 the season always diverse 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.580
 messages arrive and then it does 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.899
 rather easy to interpret would be that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.850
 he maybe a little too much 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:33.460
 has been drinking or that maybe 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.460
 been a firework rocket but was 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:41.850
 what he saw there 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.290
 it seems quite unusual to me 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.550
 we would just have a look 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.550
 closer to what it could be 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.590
 Of course you can not do that on the video 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.490
 to recognize a lot 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.530
 according to his statement he has the object 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.690
 Filmed at the moment so from his 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.730
 car exit 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.540
 and there it was for about 12 seconds 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.610
 visible but already on the way flight 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.320
 his description says that one 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.180
 size of about eight to ten meters and 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.900
 so red is almost glowing red 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.720
 that was this association of 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.730
 Of course, the witnesses are difficult to witness 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.740
 what can it be a simpler 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.100
 firecrackers that are moving and 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.040
 so a 90 degree angle just like that 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.510
 neither flies away I do not know so 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.140
 these firecrackers are mine 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.060
 at least not common, let's see what 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.060
 because it could be behind it
