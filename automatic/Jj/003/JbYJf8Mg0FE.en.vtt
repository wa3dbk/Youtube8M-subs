00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 I said ok here you have it commenting 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.349
 the videos how are you and good I squeak 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.559
 As you can see, I still grunt of their 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.289
 tutorials will try to create a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.770
 transportation in minecraft latest version 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.640
 1.5 points 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.610
 and well let's start the first thing that 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.530
 we have to do is 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.530
 I'm going to open a good land 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:36.790
 we inscribe shift your name but if 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.730
 has mind values ​​q uppercase people 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.220
 it has to be your saxo bank name in 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.020
 my daughter like that and in the tiny case of the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:51.060
 capital letter and so on and space 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.220
 137 so to the current 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.149
 we give people and not a block of 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.079
 hanging vale 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.420
 we can hear it 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.720
 and now we cover it with anything 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.500
 for example or wool to noise 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.500
 yes 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.790
 well once we put a plate of 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.790
 pressure a little 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.229
 you can put air 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.190
 a more comfortable pressure square and if 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.830
 want to put for example a little sign 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.030
 to indicate that it leads from there 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.080
 example must 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.080
 Youtube test 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:53.439
 that would what is the next step 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.100
 next step and the site by which you 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.100
 transports for example 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.580
 in the square behind that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:14.349
 we will take the xyyz coordinates 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:21.110
 but those that the parentheses xyz the 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:26.180
 parenthesis of if x would be 419 and it would be 63 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:29.480
 z would be minus 858 ok we take the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.560
 pueblada tip once fining 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.560
 the corderada delete it easy 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.860
 and we made it 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.430
 now we open very good work we notice 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.420
 how do they write 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.420
 dp 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:58.640
 can transport it 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:02.110
 well I will apply better pp good atp 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.330
 It's transportation 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.050
 means that you can take for granted 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.950
 new 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.840
 there he puts it 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.800
 use stolen to choose all 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.800
 good players 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.370
 we give him 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.250
 we give it space there and we say the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.600
 coordinates by first order x after 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.000
 and then 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.000
 in my case it would be x 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.890
 and 63 yz - 858 but we give you to accept 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.890
 and now 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:54.989
 well let's tread and we're here where 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.599
 we put it under the little sign here in 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.680
 the third boat so you can see us 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.680
 let's do the test 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.160
 again we are here the teleportation has 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.090
 come out perfect you can put the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.150
 coordinates that you want 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.000
 OK 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.329
