00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
you're hit the playback for your

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.509 
you're hit the playback for your

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
animation of your car moving I've

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.820 
animation of your car moving I've
recreated<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:15.570> using<00:00:15.960> only<00:00:16.080> two<00:00:16.260> frames

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
recreated it with using only two frames

recreated it with using only two frames
you're<00:00:17.250> seeing<00:00:17.550> 33<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:19.590> way<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.830> fix<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.490> is

you're seeing 33 the way to fix this is

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.630 
you're seeing 33 the way to fix this is
to<00:00:20.880> simply<00:00:21.570> add<00:00:21.779> layers<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.619> between<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
to simply add layers in between the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.450 
to simply add layers in between the
frames<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.300> already<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:25.039> to<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.220> that

to your filters skis and playback once

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.060 
to your filters skis and playback once
you've<00:01:39.509> added<00:01:39.689> each<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.290> these<00:01:40.409> extra<00:01:40.860> layers

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
you've added each of these extra layers

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.870 
you've added each of these extra layers
in<00:01:41.400> between<00:01:42.860> your<00:01:43.860> animation<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:46.880> just

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
in between your animation was so just

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.310 
in between your animation was so just
the<00:01:48.030> moving<00:01:48.390> color<00:01:50.570> if<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the moving color if you think that the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
the moving color if you think that the
animation<00:01:52.890> looks<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.369> chalky<00:01:53.729> by<00:01:54.540> having<00:01:54.990> that

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
animation looks to chalky by having that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.160 
animation looks to chalky by having that
extra<00:01:55.680> screen<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.939> or<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> extra<00:01:57.869> later

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
extra screen in there or the extra later

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.649 
extra screen in there or the extra later
you<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.250> need<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.579> adjust<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.030> frame<00:02:00.360> rate

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you just need to adjust the frame rate

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.020 
you just need to adjust the frame rate
and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.590> talked<00:02:01.829> about<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.250> new<00:02:02.460> video<00:02:02.759> you've

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and I talked about that new video you've

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.480 
and I talked about that new video you've
already<00:02:03.390> seen<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.100> should<00:02:05.100> solve<00:02:05.280> your

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
already seen and that should solve your

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.850 
already seen and that should solve your
problem
