00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.410 
to eat so at that point at that point
the<00:00:44.079> best<00:00:44.230> thing<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.559> do<00:00:44.829> is<00:00:44.980> not<00:00:45.850> eat<00:00:46.179> your

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
the best thing to do is not eat your

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.450 
the best thing to do is not eat your
calories<00:00:46.839> with<00:00:46.989> actually<00:00:47.320> drinks<00:00:47.769> drink<00:00:48.190> some

calories with actually drinks drink some

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.869 
calories with actually drinks drink some
of<00:00:48.579> your<00:00:48.699> calories<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:50.199> that's<00:00:50.409> when<00:00:50.879> protein

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
of your calories so that's when protein

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.020 
of your calories so that's when protein
mask<00:00:52.089> and<00:00:52.329> shape<00:00:52.629> becomes<00:00:53.079> very<00:00:53.350> beneficial

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
mask and shape becomes very beneficial

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.639

two bananas here these are these are the
small<00:03:17.220> size<00:03:17.490> panels<00:03:17.880> I<00:03:17.970> personally<00:03:18.450> prefer

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
small size panels I personally prefer

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.220 
small size panels I personally prefer
the<00:03:20.060> bigger<00:03:21.060> ones<00:03:21.390> because<00:03:21.510> these<00:03:21.810> are<00:03:22.050> like

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
the bigger ones because these are like

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.870 
the bigger ones because these are like
pretty<00:03:22.560> small<00:03:22.830> size<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.130> prefer<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.730> one

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
pretty small size I prefer the one

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.150 
pretty small size I prefer the one
that's<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.470> before<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> bigger<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.130> a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
that's like before the bigger and a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.340 
that's like before the bigger and a
larger<00:03:26.580> one<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:30.410> you<00:03:31.410> put<00:03:32.450> two<00:03:33.450> bananas<00:03:34.080> here

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
larger one so you put two bananas here

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.380 
larger one so you put two bananas here
and<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.220> figure<00:03:35.580> out<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.209> got<00:03:36.330> I

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
and you figure out if you got I

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.449 
and you figure out if you got I
personally<00:03:37.170> don't<00:03:37.350> have<00:03:37.410> ice<00:03:37.739> right<00:03:38.070> now<00:03:38.130> but

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
personally don't have ice right now but

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.640 
personally don't have ice right now but
if<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:38.610> do<00:03:38.850> have<00:03:39.030> some<00:03:39.239> ice<00:03:39.390> some<00:03:40.080> frozen<00:03:40.500> ice

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
if you do have some ice some frozen ice

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.979 
if you do have some ice some frozen ice
I<00:03:40.950> definitely<00:03:41.850> suggest<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.300> add<00:03:42.420> some<00:03:42.630> ice<00:03:42.780> in

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
I definitely suggest you add some ice in

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.300 
I definitely suggest you add some ice in
it<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.550> so<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.760> gives<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.300> gives<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.810> better

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
it and so it gives it gives it a better

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.210 
it and so it gives it gives it a better
better<00:03:47.310> taste<00:03:47.700> overall<00:03:48.300> taste<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.830> next

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
better taste overall taste so this next

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.000 
better taste overall taste so this next
we're<00:03:50.459> gonna<00:03:50.580> add<00:03:51.110> two<00:03:52.110> servings<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.620> peanut

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
we're gonna add two servings of peanut

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.770 
we're gonna add two servings of peanut
butter<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.590> use<00:03:55.830> this<00:03:56.640> skill<00:03:57.120> waiting<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
butter so I use this skill waiting the

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.690 
butter so I use this skill waiting the
peanuts<00:03:58.230> are<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.500> first<00:03:59.070> weighed<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.610> the

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
peanuts are you first weighed in the

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.140 
peanuts are you first weighed in the
spoon

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.580 

so<00:04:03.150> two<00:04:03.330> shares<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.870> peanut<00:04:04.200> butter<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:05.030> 64<00:04:06.590> 64

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
so two shares of peanut butter is 64 64

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:25.370 
so two shares of peanut butter is 64 64
grams

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.130 

this<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.280> actually<00:04:26.640> 70<00:04:27.120> grass<00:04:27.330> with<00:04:27.660> yet

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
this is this actually 70 grass with yet

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.950 
this is this actually 70 grass with yet
I'm<00:04:28.890> bulky<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.550> don't<00:04:29.760> mind<00:04:29.970> those<00:04:30.180> those

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
I'm bulky so I don't mind those those

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.850 
I'm bulky so I don't mind those those
extra<00:04:31.470> few<00:04:31.650> grams<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:38.610> then<00:04:39.570> last<00:04:40.470> but<00:04:40.650> not
