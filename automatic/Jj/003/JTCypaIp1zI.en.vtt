00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
PlayStation but sound quality is very

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.430 
PlayStation but sound quality is very
very<00:02:29.879> good<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.530> would<00:02:31.530> prefer<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:32.010> over<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
very good I would prefer this over the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.830 
very good I would prefer this over the
turtlebeach<00:02:36.620> mostly<00:02:37.620> because<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.890> simplicity

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
turtlebeach mostly because of simplicity

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.570 
turtlebeach mostly because of simplicity
but<00:02:39.840> also<00:02:40.050> it's<00:02:40.379> just<00:02:40.560> generally<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.099> very<00:02:41.370> good

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
but also it's just generally a very good

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.640 
but also it's just generally a very good

hours of use set of one charge and it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.860 
hours of use set of one charge and it
also<00:02:59.430> doesn't<00:02:59.700> take<00:02:59.849> very<00:02:59.970> long<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.510> recharge

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
also doesn't take very long to recharge

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.899 
also doesn't take very long to recharge
and<00:03:01.230> as<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.010> said<00:03:02.069> before<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:02.849> also

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
and as I said before you can also

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.820 
and as I said before you can also
recharge<00:03:03.599> it<00:03:03.750> while<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.409> use<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:06.830> overall

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
recharge it while it's in use so overall

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.580
