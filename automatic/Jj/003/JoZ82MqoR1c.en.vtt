00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 then dear blog.it this is one 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.810
 logitech k400 class new version 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.849
 of the keyboard with integrated touchpad but 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.679
 most widespread in the absolute everything 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.540
 which is the mini pc industry that they are 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.519
 android that is windows that are smart 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 tv because it allows exactly one 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.170
 device to command both the part 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 keyboard then write type i 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.460
 url write email files that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.039
 we want is the mouse part then with a 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 multitouch touchpad and two buttons 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.830
 integrated 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.449
 now this model will be available in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.360
 Italy in a few days with a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 price list of 45 euros for the same price as 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.899
 list of the previous version though 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.329
 clearly the old one being in 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.850
 trade for years but an offer more 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.410
 low is about half so it is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.090
 a good idea to take this new one 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.010
 plus or better to take advantage again 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.239
 of offers for the old and let's start 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.239
 I'll explain everything with the review 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.920
 ok from the aesthetic point of view not 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.020
 changes a lot between the new plus the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.240
 old model is a lot of aesthetics 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.250
 similar the back is absolutely identical 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.990
 with the top still or flat for 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.420
 then place it in a vertical 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.760
 save space next to the TV i 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.800
 keys are identical these new ones are a 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.750
 even quieter when when 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.270
 pressed but the race is the same is the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.890
 part that you go to press a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.780
 little bit wider but in short, they are 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.750
 really really details what changes 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.119
 is the layout of some keys and the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.759
 position of certain function keys vi 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.500
 I show the pub in particular 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.729
 which is smaller than that 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.890
 previous one 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.500
 I'll show you the new keys here for 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.930
 then windows android management 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.240
 of the dedicated keys and others that are 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.580
 been moved to second place with the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.890
 key fn all these settings though 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.869
 they can then be modified through the 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.700
 software lodging logitech option that 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.560
 you can download from the available site 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.410
 for all operating systems e 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.570
 above all, the disposition changes 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.060
 the keys here for the are added 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.090
 volume control over the touchpad 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.409
 the old woman had them with fn la keys 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.090
 old keyboard also had keys 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.460
 here additional ones that have now been 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.200
 moved and among them was the key 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.480
 turning on then power on your own 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.670
 of the pc this rate has not been removed 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.310
 has been added has been moved indeed 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.200
 in second place with the fn key 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.519
 the new layout of the keys here in 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.680
 high in my opinion is very convenient because 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.600
 you will find yourself managing the touch pad 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.820
 and have i 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.660
 checks that you can use during 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.610
 the use 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.320
 I imagine a little one used on TV 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.570
 be done to look at something 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.459
 multimedia filmvideo something and have 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.470
 here available volume ee 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.420
 possibility to reset the audio is 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.590
 I think good news 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.360
 like all recent devices 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.209
 logitech also here is the usb receiver 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.340
 unify allows you to manage a maximum 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.799
 of 6 exhibits with only one of these 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.630
 up to a maximum of 10 meters and I assure you 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.530
 dm that are real because I placed here 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.390
 one side to the other 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.650
 and again the keyboard that manages the PC that 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.750
 is in the other room 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.579
 if you have other logitech devices 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.380
 mouse or what you probably already have 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.209
 one of these is therefore this one 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.110
 found in the keyboard you do not need to 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.660
 nothing 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.490
 ok i tried 400 plus with all 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.560
 operating systems with android chrome os 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.180
 mac windows 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.160
 I have done several tests and always has 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.080
 worked well I also put it in 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.780
 this is the new mini android pc that i am 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.850
 trying here you can see only one 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.440
 usb busy or full control of the 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.750
 mini pc and therefore a real footprint 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.670
 really compact remains to be understood if 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.320
 take a solution like this air 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.020
 mouse tour or another solution 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.670
 like this keyboard with touchpad e 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.890
 armao functionality if i believe that 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.510
 it all depends on what you want to do if 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.580
 you simply have to go and bet it 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.650
 screen a mouse pro take it from 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.940
 quality and the most economical solution e 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.980
 probably also the most comfortable 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.130
 something so makes sense only if you have 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.959
 need little restricted space where 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.090
 carry it around maybe clearly 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.800
 the footprint is anything but different 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.720
 level but don't expect comfort 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.450
 because these are quite uncomfortable 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.130
 a k400 plus is a real keyboard e 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.900
 own full keyboard you can 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.150
 use it even with the home PC in 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.370
 office already arrives with two hard batteries 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.989
 18 months against the 10 of the previous one 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.000
 in short, it is a real keyboard 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.459
 with a good one produced by a company that 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.530
 in short, surely you already know it is not 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.290
 excellent quality but in short, at the level 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.180
 of price we are then clearly 45 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.380
 List price is the new price 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.330
 will be in mind in the coming days 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.520
 definitely a couple of weeks already there 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.200
 will be good online offers 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.840
 however, I do not believe that it is worth the 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.580
 page for those who already have a 400 of the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.110
 last year in the end le 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.720
 differences are minimal yes this one 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.400
 nicer design is not even raw 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.530
 however we say from the point of view of the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.660
 functionality does not change much 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.610
 vice versa those who have never taken the 4 100 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.900
 because maybe he thought so far e 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.550
 don't need it now 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.380
 something like that because it's there now 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.300
 been the explosion of mini PCs 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.700
 windows android or whatever it is 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.830
 he simply wants to try a solution 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.930
 also for home for the office 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.669
 shop something that is more compact and 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.350
 does not require the use of the mouse because 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.530
 maybe the use you make with one 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.240
 touch screen or similar does not provide list 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.460
 all day with the mouse in mark 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.479
 take it seriously 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.520
 for the rest, find more 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.770
 information other details I made a 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.210
 bit of photos I did some tests 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.039
 screen operating systems 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.940
 of the app I told you about in 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.830
 full review 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.830
