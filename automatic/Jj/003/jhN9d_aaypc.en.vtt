00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.469
 hummingbirds so will our be called 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:16.650
 today model hello friends with 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:22.160
 you vitali what we start for this we 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.160
 bend this time across our sheet 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.160
 paper 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.129
 the best abrasive one so dense 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.640
 because our model will be somewhat 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.550
 unusual hummingbird 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:55.030
 so now we need to combine this angle 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:01:01.019
 and here from this center line here 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.019
 corner along with our central 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:31.899
 here's a corner combining hummingbirds so on 20 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:44.890
 here is such a blank 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:49.240
 It turned out now to the center of this 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:54.149
 line we go to the center that is this one 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.149
 we go to the center 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.190
 yes friends come to my channel 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.120
 subscribe and literally I'm on this 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.830
 week I will start a big record will tell all 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.470
 secrets about making money on y tube 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.710
 Yes, and not only on the Y tube, but on the Y tube 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:24.180
 it seems to me today 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:25.680
 the easiest way to make money because 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.070
 small competition 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:34.970
 and seo optimization is much easier than 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.650
 let's say promote the site to earn them 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.800
 that is, it is much easier to earn a ya tuba 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.390
 rather than on the site 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.100
 therefore often uses even youtube 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.100
 in order to promote your set 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:57.350
 bye thanks to us getting a blank 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.350
 now zaginaem 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.610
 something like this 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:28.390
 this is a krygina 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:33.609
 Only not until the end we somewhere millimeters 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:39.150
 We put all this way in the first place is 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.150
 the edges of the ears we're under fire 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.989
 now this end you again on and 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:06.519
 Here it turns out beautifully now we will bend 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:11.980
 just need to drive out very carefully 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:15.120
 since here this place turns out 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.120
 very tight bend 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:26.590
 so just zaginay very carefully 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.590
 just about this place sit quietly 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:50.230
 Now they lagin so on the reverse side 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.220
 all well and now the final touch is 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:15.100
 parallel to this line 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:21.020
 here you are punishing and accordingly 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:29.950
 from this side here is a little bit 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:32.289
