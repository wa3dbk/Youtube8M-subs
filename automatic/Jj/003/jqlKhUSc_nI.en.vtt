00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
the first Titan and the aim of this game

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.940 
the first Titan and the aim of this game
is<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:37.370> get<00:00:37.550> perfect<00:00:38.180> pallets<00:00:38.630> so<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.620> didn't

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
is to get perfect pallets so I didn't

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.950 
is to get perfect pallets so I didn't
with<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.220> first<00:00:40.490> one<00:00:40.760> but<00:00:41.060> you'll<00:00:41.270> see<00:00:41.510> as<00:00:41.780> I

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
with the first one but you'll see as I

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.440 
with the first one but you'll see as I
go<00:00:41.990> through<00:00:42.200> I<00:00:42.830> managed<00:00:43.580> to<00:00:43.610> get<00:00:43.880> perfect

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
go through I managed to get perfect

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.870 
go through I managed to get perfect
carries<00:00:44.840> even<00:00:45.260> if<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.470> first<00:00:45.770> hit<00:00:46.130> like<00:00:46.550> that

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
carries even if the first hit like that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.320 
carries even if the first hit like that
one

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
one

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.620 
one
and<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.020> he's<00:00:48.410> immediately<00:00:48.920> finished<00:00:49.760> as<00:00:50.270> soon

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
and so he's immediately finished as soon

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.320 
and so he's immediately finished as soon
as<00:00:50.810> I<00:00:50.930> perform<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.590> first<00:00:51.830> parry<00:00:52.280> as<00:00:52.580> long<00:00:53.150> as

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
as I perform the first parry as long as

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.650 
as I perform the first parry as long as
you<00:00:53.450> get<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.870> perfect<00:00:54.410> power<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:55.130> this<00:00:55.970> amount

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
you get a perfect power and this amount

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.260 
you get a perfect power and this amount
of<00:00:56.930> damage<00:00:57.620> will<00:00:58.040> actually<00:00:58.550> take<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.850> all<00:00:59.240> the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
of damage will actually take you all the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.929 
of damage will actually take you all the
way<00:00:59.480> through<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.440> level<00:01:01.100> 16<00:01:01.730> or<00:01:01.970> round<00:01:02.330> 16<00:01:03.080> and

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
way through to level 16 or round 16 and

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.090 
way through to level 16 or round 16 and
you're<00:01:04.939> basically<00:01:05.539> the<00:01:05.689> defeating<00:01:06.619> all<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
you're basically the defeating all the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.789 
you're basically the defeating all the
Titans<00:01:07.640> with<00:01:08.299> just<00:01:08.659> those<00:01:08.929> perfect<00:01:09.530> very

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
Titans with just those perfect very

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.249 
Titans with just those perfect very
damaged<00:01:10.399> Titan<00:01:10.880> gems<00:01:11.149> as<00:01:11.420> long<00:01:11.780> as<00:01:11.960> you<00:01:12.049> have

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
damaged Titan gems as long as you have

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.580 
damaged Titan gems as long as you have
enough<00:01:12.289> and<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.579> can<00:01:13.789> fuse<00:01:14.119> capped<00:01:14.659> ones<00:01:14.990> from

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
enough and you can fuse capped ones from

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.669 
enough and you can fuse capped ones from
three<00:01:16.039> smaller<00:01:16.670> ones<00:01:16.999> and<00:01:17.329> yes<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.170> does<00:01:18.380> take

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
three smaller ones and yes it does take

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.610 
three smaller ones and yes it does take
a<00:01:18.740> while<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.429> collect<00:01:19.640> them<00:01:19.999> all

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
a while to collect them all

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.010 
a while to collect them all
get<00:01:20.800> more<00:01:21.070> confused<00:01:21.250> but<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.480> worth<00:01:22.780> it

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
get more confused but it is worth it

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.530 
get more confused but it is worth it
because<00:01:23.440> you<00:01:23.980> can<00:01:24.280> speak<00:01:24.700> through<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.210> arena

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
because you can speak through the arena

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.730 
because you can speak through the arena
really<00:01:26.110> fast<00:01:26.620> and<00:01:27.040> I<00:01:27.880> do<00:01:28.660> this<00:01:28.870> every<00:01:29.110> couple

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
really fast and I do this every couple

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.370 
really fast and I do this every couple
of<00:01:29.800> days<00:01:29.860> when<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.000> arena<00:01:31.390> appears<00:01:32.050> on<00:01:32.260> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
of days when the arena appears on the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.210 
of days when the arena appears on the
map<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:33.000> offers<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.390> chips<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.050> I'm<00:01:35.950> often

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
map and offers the chips and I'm often

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.580 
map and offers the chips and I'm often
asked<00:01:36.850> how<00:01:36.880> do<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.240> get<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:37.660> many<00:01:37.810> chips<00:01:38.290> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
asked how do you get so many chips and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.700 
asked how do you get so many chips and
this<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.250> one<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:40.030> ways<00:01:40.240> that<00:01:40.660> I<00:01:41.020> keep<00:01:41.440> my

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
this is one of the ways that I keep my

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.070 
this is one of the ways that I keep my
chips<00:01:42.070> topped<00:01:42.520> up<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:43.120> I<00:01:43.570> have<00:01:43.810> made

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
chips topped up and I have made

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.400 
chips topped up and I have made
thousands<00:01:44.830> of<00:01:44.980> chips<00:01:45.340> from<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.150> method<00:01:46.660> so

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
thousands of chips from this method so

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.220 
thousands of chips from this method so
every<00:01:48.040> couple<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.460> days<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:49.300> chips<00:01:49.990> are

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
every couple of days the chips are

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.040 
every couple of days the chips are
offered<00:01:50.620> in<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.920> arena<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:52.540> can<00:01:52.780> just

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
offered in the arena and you can just

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.900 
offered in the arena and you can just
get<00:01:53.260> through<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.590> really<00:01:53.890> fast<00:01:54.130> with<00:01:54.760> this

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
get through it really fast with this

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.750 
get through it really fast with this
method<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.600> by<00:01:56.230> using<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.890> great<00:01:57.250> parry<00:01:57.610> or

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
method and by using the great parry or

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.050 
method and by using the great parry or
gem<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.750> means<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.560> can<00:01:59.830> parry<00:02:00.340> hits<00:02:00.730> that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
gem that means you can parry hits that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.060 
gem that means you can parry hits that
normally<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:01.690> can't<00:02:01.990> like<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.800> shield

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
normally you can't like the shield

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.960 
normally you can't like the shield
bashes<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.000> kicks<00:02:04.870> and<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.950> combined<00:02:06.640> with

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
bashes and kicks and so combined with

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.389 
bashes and kicks and so combined with
the<00:02:07.210> perfect<00:02:07.810> parry<00:02:08.080> damage<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.710> Titan<00:02:09.130> gems

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
the perfect parry damage to Titan gems

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.440 
the perfect parry damage to Titan gems
any<00:02:10.090> parry<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:11.440> result<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.430> Titan<00:02:12.970> being

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
any parry can result in the Titan being

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.410 
any parry can result in the Titan being
finished<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.130> you'll<00:02:15.670> see<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:16.090> ten

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
finished and so you'll see that ten

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.120 
finished and so you'll see that ten
perfect<00:02:17.050> parry<00:02:17.290> damage

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
perfect parry damage

it does only mean about three rounds

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.320 
it does only mean about three rounds
where<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.349> need<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.800> use<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.550> attack<00:02:58.879> your

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
attack gems so you'll see now I'm at

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.070 
attack gems so you'll see now I'm at
round<00:03:02.660> 15<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.500> still<00:03:04.400> I'm<00:03:04.760> able<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.330> finish

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
round 15 and still I'm able to finish

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.040 
round 15 and still I'm able to finish
that<00:03:06.410> Titan<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.190> one<00:03:07.550> parry<00:03:07.970> because<00:03:08.900> he's

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
that Titan in one parry because he's

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.170 
that Titan in one parry because he's
still<00:03:09.410> under<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:10.010> sixty<00:03:10.519> two<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.970> half

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
still under the sixty two and a half

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.860 
still under the sixty two and a half
thousand<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:12.890> round<00:03:13.400> 16<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.599> first

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
thousand and so round 16 is the first

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.400 
thousand and so round 16 is the first
time<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:15.890> need<00:03:16.069> more<00:03:16.610> than<00:03:16.970> one<00:03:17.239> paui<00:03:17.930> to

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
time that you need more than one paui to

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.280 
time that you need more than one paui to
finish<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:19.010> type<00:03:19.250> knock<00:03:19.549> but<00:03:20.239> even<00:03:20.599> so<00:03:20.870> it's

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
finish the type knock but even so it's

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.949 
finish the type knock but even so it's
still<00:03:21.440> only<00:03:21.920> took<00:03:22.099> a<00:03:22.250> couple<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:23.239> by

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
still only took a couple and by

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.289 
still only took a couple and by
seventeen<00:03:24.650> now<00:03:25.069> it's<00:03:25.370> starting<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.880> get<00:03:26.030> too

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
seventeen now it's starting to get too

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.620 
seventeen now it's starting to get too
high<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:27.380> that's<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:28.010> point<00:03:28.250> when<00:03:28.819> I<00:03:28.849> swap<00:03:29.390> out

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
high so that's the point when I swap out

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.009 
high so that's the point when I swap out
is<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.079> perfect<00:03:30.560> parry<00:03:30.799> damage<00:03:31.640> gems<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:32.390> put

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.910 
in my attack build and I use many Titan
break<00:03:36.680> gems<00:03:37.069> and<00:03:37.599> bonus<00:03:38.599> combo<00:03:39.110> minus<00:03:39.680> one

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
break gems and bonus combo minus one

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.380

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.809 
perfect parry stun gem but you can see
that<00:03:47.329> is<00:03:47.599> actually<00:03:47.810> only<00:03:48.500> for<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.859> last<00:03:49.040> three

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
that is actually only for the last three

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.569 
that is actually only for the last three
rounds<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:50.989> need<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.470> use<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:52.040> attack

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
rounds that I need to use that attack

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.259 
rounds that I need to use that attack
build<00:03:53.319> so<00:03:54.319> that's<00:03:54.829> very<00:03:55.160> quick<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:55.910> if<00:03:56.120> you

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
build so that's very quick and if you

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.780 
build so that's very quick and if you
haven't<00:03:56.510> got<00:03:56.810> such<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.109> hideout<00:03:57.680> fire<00:03:58.010> made

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
haven't got such a hideout fire made

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.360 
haven't got such a hideout fire made
a<00:03:58.819> little<00:03:59.150> longer<00:03:59.390> but<00:04:00.140> as<00:04:00.349> I<00:04:00.379> say<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:01.010> only

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
a little longer but as I say is only

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.780 
a little longer but as I say is only
three<00:04:02.060> rounds<00:04:02.569> so<00:04:03.409> this<00:04:03.769> is<00:04:03.950> definitely<00:04:04.579> a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
three rounds so this is definitely a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.690 
three rounds so this is definitely a
great<00:04:05.030> way<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.810> use<00:04:06.379> the<00:04:06.650> arena<00:04:07.069> and<00:04:07.280> get
