that do for you as the top laner we knew

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.910 
that do for you as the top laner we knew
that<00:00:14.700> CLG<00:00:15.210> values<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.960> lot<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.560> also<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
that CLG values and a lot it's also a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.320 
that CLG values and a lot it's also a
pic<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.220> we've<00:00:17.490> had<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.640> lot<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.850> success<00:00:18.210> with

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
pic that we've had a lot of success with

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.580 
pic that we've had a lot of success with
and<00:00:18.600> we've<00:00:18.690> also<00:00:18.840> seen<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> lot<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.380> bands

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
and we've also seen a lot of bands

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.640 
and we've also seen a lot of bands
towards<00:00:19.980> us<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:21.180> knew<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.350> was<00:00:22.350> probably

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
towards us so we knew that was probably

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.580 
towards us so we knew that was probably
a<00:00:22.800> plausible<00:00:23.250> first<00:00:23.640> pick<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:23.850> them<00:00:24.590> we

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
a plausible first pick for them we

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.170 
a plausible first pick for them we
respected<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.279> ability<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.640> split<00:00:26.849> push<00:00:27.000> but

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
respected the ability of split push but

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.400 
respected the ability of split push but
we<00:00:27.240> also<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.869> felt<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.380> just

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
we also just like felt like if we just

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.779 
we also just like felt like if we just
pick<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> champion<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.220> cancel<00:00:29.550> as<00:00:29.640> all

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
pick a champion they can cancel as all

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.290 
pick a champion they can cancel as all
apply<00:00:30.570> pressure<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> Shen<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.219> make<00:00:32.790> good

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
apply pressure on the Shen and make good

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.580 
apply pressure on the Shen and make good
plays<00:00:33.420> elsewhere<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:33.989> map<00:00:34.200> then<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.500> could

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
plays elsewhere on the map then we could

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.319 
plays elsewhere on the map then we could
come<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.890> ahead<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.640> guess<00:00:35.790> that's<00:00:36.030> pretty

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
come out ahead and I guess that's pretty

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.330 
come out ahead and I guess that's pretty
much<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.690> did<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.410> your<00:00:37.559> last<00:00:37.680> pic<00:00:37.980> Zach

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
much what we did so your last pic Zach

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.880 
much what we did so your last pic Zach
was<00:00:38.730> basically<00:00:39.450> tailored<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.350> fight

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
was basically tailored to fight

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.610 
was basically tailored to fight
more<00:00:41.790> or<00:00:41.879> less<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.210> was<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.540> was<00:00:42.930> also<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> good

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
more or less it was it was also a good

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
more or less it was it was also a good
pick<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:43.800> our<00:00:44.010> team<00:00:44.160> comp<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.700> yeah<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.210> can

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
pick for our team comp but yeah that can

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.959 
pick for our team comp but yeah that can
deal<00:00:45.450> was<00:00:45.539> trying<00:00:45.719> pretty<00:00:45.930> well<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> did<00:00:47.820> you

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the most part it just worked out with

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
focusing the vein if you look at most of

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.190 
focusing the vein if you look at most of
the<00:01:43.860> team<00:01:44.009> fights<00:01:44.220> actually<00:01:44.970> re-engaged<00:01:45.869> onto

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
not it's not really a problem in most

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.069 
not it's not really a problem in most
scenarios<00:01:50.579> yeah<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.450> did<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:51.899> good

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079

scenarios yeah so you did a really good
job<00:01:52.140> doing<00:01:52.470> two<00:01:52.680> things<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.159> mentioned

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
job doing two things that you mentioned

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
first you interrupted the first Shen

capitalize and take that dragon fight
early<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.799> also<00:02:02.040> were<00:02:02.430> able<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
early and then you also were able to

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.730 
early and then you also were able to
draw<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.509> much<00:02:03.540> pressure<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.049> him<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.649> you

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
draw so much pressure on him that you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.889 
draw so much pressure on him that you
drew<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> Nocturne<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:05.909> top<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:06.719> team

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
drew a Nocturne up top and your team

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.410 
drew a Nocturne up top and your team
later<00:02:07.200> took<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> dragon<00:02:08.009> yeah<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> ended

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
later took the dragon yeah so you ended

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.029 
later took the dragon yeah so you ended
up<00:02:09.509> having<00:02:09.569> more<00:02:09.899> global<00:02:10.170> pressure<00:02:10.349> than<00:02:10.709> Shen

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
up having more global pressure than Shen

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.700 
up having more global pressure than Shen
in<00:02:11.220> fact<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.030> was<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.349> plan

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
in fact so was that the plan

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010 
in fact so was that the plan
and<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.340> from<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> beginning<00:02:15.150> not

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and just from the beginning not

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.380 
and just from the beginning not
necessarily<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.620> mean<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:17.100> think<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:17.640> went<00:02:18.270> out<00:02:18.360> on

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
necessarily I mean I think I went out on

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.210 
necessarily I mean I think I went out on
a<00:02:18.540> few<00:02:18.750> trades<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.410> would<00:02:19.860> definitely<00:02:20.160> win

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
a few trades that would definitely win

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.950 
a few trades that would definitely win
my<00:02:20.400> favor<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.570> got<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.930> point

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
my favor and like it got to the point

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.090 
my favor and like it got to the point
where<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> would<00:02:22.380> have<00:02:22.500> killed<00:02:22.680> potential<00:02:23.010> on

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
where I would have killed potential on

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.410 
where I would have killed potential on
Chen<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.430> Nocturne<00:02:23.760> had<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.000> come<00:02:24.150> hold<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.300 
lines held in their own we won we got a
huge<00:02:57.960> advantage<00:02:58.200> off<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.680> first<00:02:58.980> dragon

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
huge advantage off the first dragon

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.280 
huge advantage off the first dragon
fight<00:02:59.490> and<00:02:59.670> after<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.990> one<00:03:01.170> thing

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
fight and after that like it's one thing

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.420 
fight and after that like it's one thing
that<00:03:01.440> split<00:03:01.620> push<00:03:01.770> when<00:03:01.920> you're<00:03:02.040> ahead<00:03:02.100> but

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
that split push when you're ahead but

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.740 
that split push when you're ahead but
when<00:03:02.520> you're<00:03:02.640> behind<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:03.150> much<00:03:03.360> much<00:03:03.510> harder

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
when you're behind it's much much harder

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.450 
when you're behind it's much much harder
because<00:03:04.020> when<00:03:04.350> you're<00:03:04.470> ahead<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.950> all<00:03:05.310> your

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
because when you're ahead and all your

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.070 
because when you're ahead and all your
lanes<00:03:05.640> are<00:03:05.790> applying<00:03:06.090> pressure<00:03:06.300> then<00:03:06.900> when

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
lanes are applying pressure then when

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.480 
lanes are applying pressure then when
used<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.350> push<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:08.040> becomes<00:03:08.310> basically

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
used to push it be it becomes basically

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.030 
used to push it be it becomes basically
it's<00:03:08.820> like<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:09.210> movable<00:03:09.810> object<00:03:10.140> like<00:03:10.290> well<00:03:10.980> we

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it's like a movable object like well we

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
it's like a movable object like well we
have<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.220> send<00:03:11.400> somebody<00:03:11.520> deal<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.790> him<00:03:11.910> but

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
have to send somebody deal with him but

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.060 
have to send somebody deal with him but
we<00:03:12.240> also<00:03:12.360> have<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:12.780> everyone<00:03:13.440> dealing

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
we also have to have everyone dealing

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.350 
we also have to have everyone dealing
with<00:03:14.190> their<00:03:14.310> teams<00:03:14.550> ahead<00:03:14.760> of<00:03:14.880> us<00:03:15.060> but<00:03:15.210> when

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
with their teams ahead of us but when

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.330 
with their teams ahead of us but when
we're<00:03:15.540> ahead<00:03:15.630> like<00:03:16.320> basically<00:03:16.740> split<00:03:17.160> pushing

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
we're ahead like basically split pushing

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.950 
we're ahead like basically split pushing
sort<00:03:17.760> of<00:03:17.820> becomes<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.210> a<00:03:18.240> non-factor<00:03:18.810> like

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
sort of becomes like a non-factor like

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.990 
sort of becomes like a non-factor like
they<00:03:19.350> actually<00:03:19.440> got<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.800> bot<00:03:20.160> turret<00:03:20.610> off<00:03:20.760> of

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
they actually got a bot turret off of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.300 
they actually got a bot turret off of
vain<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.480> Nocturne<00:03:22.080> splitting<00:03:22.440> bought<00:03:22.620> but

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
vain and Nocturne splitting bought but

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.580 
vain and Nocturne splitting bought but

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
we have a good shot going in like we had

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.250 
we have a good shot going in like we had
a<00:03:47.790> rocky<00:03:48.030> start<00:03:48.210> but<00:03:48.570> we're<00:03:48.840> right<00:03:48.990> now<00:03:49.110> in<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
a rocky start but we're right now in the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.890 
a rocky start but we're right now in the
middle<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.560> pack<00:03:49.770> in<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.100> na<00:03:50.580> LCS<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.330> we
