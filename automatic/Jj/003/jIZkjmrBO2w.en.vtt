00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 and we continue with health issues to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.130
 often many people confuse 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.960
 warts with moles of all kinds and for 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.639
 clarify this distinction and deepen 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.990
 on the subject of warts we 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.730
 Accompanies Dr. Edgardo Rodríguez 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 vallecillo dermatologist good afternoon 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.490
 You enter for joining us 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.230
 good stable without sea and good afternoon to 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.520
 all the viewers as we can 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.980
 differentiate between once there is not a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.449
 good place sometimes the person can 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.890
 have a lot of difficulty in differentiating 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.990
 one from another because the appearance can 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.730
 be similar in puerto rico we have the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.080
 custom of calling wart all that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.490
 which is lifted on the skin and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.859
 forming an appearance we would say of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.829
 rough but the classic wart if I 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.210
 allow the first image is pretty 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.399
 characteristics because it's always 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 usually skin-colored and has a 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 really rugose appearance and the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.640
 can see on screen are like this in great 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.260
 been the time is not in a case then 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.600
 obviously quite dramatic for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.789
 illustrative purpose are very common in 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.230
 children for example and how can you 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.850
 see has that irregular appearance in the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.410
 surface something that polka dots so 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.030
 general although they may have a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.460
 surface sometimes a little irregular 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.890
 They are softer and usually polka dots 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.680
 They also have brown color 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.980
 moles that can be confused with 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.050
 warts 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.880
 they could not have color and depending on 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.620
 their appearance like this we see so 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.300
 this is a mole but a lunar time 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.280
 rugged and in puerto rico we have the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.600
 habit to say these things warts but 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.160
 for example this mole that we see in 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.450
 screen because this would not be contagious 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.820
 there is a person who only has that 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.310
 mole 15 or 20 years ago the best when 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.660
 we should worry about a mole or a 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.730
 wart in this case when we do 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.890
 worry and think that it could be to 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.630
 touch 0-2 usually when they are injuries 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.460
 new ones that were not there previously 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.280
 one was born with them especially if 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.780
 they are growing in size as that 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.000
 logically it should be a warning signal 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.190
 equally if a lesion is waxed and 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.690
 is raw because logically it is 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.730
 a sign that there is not something that does not go 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.080
 well especially if it has not healed in 8 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.580
 or 10 days as it would sound 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.250
 injury that one does on the skin 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.720
 it will not take cancer education not from 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.460
 made the warts that are caused by 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.230
 virus if we have the correct diagnosis 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.540
 because there is usually no place 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.100
 cancerous now some cancers of the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.390
 skin can grow in a form of 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.370
 rough especially the carcinoma 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.440
 spinocellular one of the three types 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.870
 major skin cancer and that's 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.369
 particularly if they can look like a 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.230
 rough manner and can be mistaken 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.390
 logically, sometimes they can even 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.950
 specialist also 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.270
 a biopsy to be able to distinguish a 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.920
 thing of the other the warts are 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.230
 contagious you have to have some kind of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.940
 care and how to determine if it is a 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.550
 contagious wart or not the warts 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.319
 contagious or viral are caused by 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.420
 the human papilloma virus and those rumps 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.640
 and they are logically contagious now 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.020
 it depends a lot on the person there are people 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.000
 whose immune system is therefore more 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.080
 susceptible to being infected with these 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.940
 warts and those people 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.470
 logically they will give you especially 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.760
 children are very susceptible these 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.830
 things and that's why the pediatric population 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 the development of 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.590
 rubén many times when one arrives at the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.690
 Adulthood has developed immunity 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.070
 natural and many people like in the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.290
 my case even that had wheel 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.670
 small of big no longer give me a close 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.200
 less than what can prevent that 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.090
 contagion especially in the case of 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.280
 children of wrinkle of bones wrinkles is 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.019
 really really nothing that 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.430
 we can do I can stop this at all 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.930
 one has to be aware and if 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.280
 the wart occurs in trying to catch them 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.739
 early before he grows up a lot 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.480
 treatment treatment there are many 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.390
 things can be done from putting in 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.470
 this one if you simply cauterize the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.910
 sometimes you can apply certain 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.730
 caustic liquids that can be thrown 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.230
 to go destroying the wart is pulsed 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.730
 liquid nitrogen that is still very cold 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.210
 that is triggered by a bottle with 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.520
 a spray 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.080
 literally freezing the skin sometimes 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.820
 depending on the site that can be used 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.650
 the laser beam of certain types of lasers 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.690
 as the so2 that can be useful for 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.090
 that and the children who have the hobby of 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.590
 these houses the warts and me that 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.810
 it's definitely a bad habit because 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.580
 precisely when scraping they can create 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.110
 small corrections the wart maybe 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.790
 theoretically, what could happen 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.440
 green to the body these viral warts 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.390
 that you are presented with a child in an adult 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.860
 can refuse the rest of which yes yes 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.360
 definitely sometimes we see 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.340
 warts that depending on the new 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.960
 the person's immune system will tend 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.670
 to water and it can happen then in 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.530
 large areas of skin moved a lot 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.330
 also in women who shave 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.980
 legs sometimes with trauma or 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.600
 micro trauma that causes a knife 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.080
 then the wart tends to be watered 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.080
 other areas 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.980
 obviously
