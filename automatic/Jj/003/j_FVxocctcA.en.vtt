since<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.500> last<00:00:04.529> did<00:00:04.920> one<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.160> these<00:00:05.220> V<00:00:05.490> logs<00:00:05.700> and

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
since I last did one of these V logs and

time and it annoys it just annoys me to
no<00:03:59.220> end<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:00.090> again<00:04:00.360> if<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.840> want<00:04:01.020> extra<00:04:01.200> tips<00:04:01.470> I

no end so again if you want extra tips I

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.180 
no end so again if you want extra tips I
can<00:04:01.710> give<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:04.080> small<00:04:04.770> answer<00:04:05.040> but

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
can give you like a small answer but

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.950 
can give you like a small answer but
it's<00:04:05.310> probably<00:04:05.490> not<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.820> best<00:04:06.060> answer<00:04:06.600> I

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
it's probably not the best answer I

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.449 
it's probably not the best answer I
would<00:04:07.290> seek<00:04:07.770> out<00:04:09.740> communities<00:04:10.740> to<00:04:11.190> help<00:04:11.220> you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
out for that but I think that's it in

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.130 
out for that but I think that's it in
terms<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.520> new<00:04:14.670> or<00:04:15.270> in<00:04:15.690> terms<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:16.020> the

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
terms of the new or in terms of the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.340 
terms of the new or in terms of the
Gundam<00:04:16.440> related<00:04:16.830> questions<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.690> yeah<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.989> just
