00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.260

 hello my name is marcelo good I am 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.790
 with my friend Gonzalo who is the owner of 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.099
 the account a lot I do not have an account 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.259
 youtube still then I wanted 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.470
 show them share with you a 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:34.090
 clock 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:37.190
 from the 79s 80 dual citizen watches 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 time chronograph 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.010
 lcd 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.970
 and good that is very particular in those 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.750
 years that watch was between watches 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.700
 digital was a top of line so 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.430
 Well, if I'm going to show it carefully 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.550
 what makes the engine work first 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.010
 that has a button on one of the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.579
 lateral white 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.500
 and the other side 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:09.860
 It has a black button and a yellow button 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:13.700
 and another embossed button that serves for the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.580
 selection of the functions good the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.140
 clock that is a digital clock program 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.600
 I repeat as I said before 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:28.040
 who has now second minute of brand 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.040
 am and fm 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.160
 and good also marks the day on the line 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.850
 of pictures below marks the good day 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.820
 I'm going to put the chronograph that is a 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.979
 of the little things more 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.720
 the function a very interesting function 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.180
 by the dotted line that has the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.900
 bottom part and we learned it to 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.900
 function 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.060
 we can stop with a partial 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.470
 there are lava stops and of course it's still 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.789
 working and we do it start 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.789
 again go again forgiveness 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.540
 and we do not stop 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.879
 and we put it in zero 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:27.670
 we go back again we went back to the 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:32.500
 hour and let's put with the black button 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:38.459
 let's put the date 5 for the month 5 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.459
 May 22nd of the year 2012 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.060
 Tuesday that marked it we left the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.780
 date 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.510
 and we are going something quite interesting that in 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.550
 that time the clocks did not have it 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.830
 it is the light we turn off irrigated landmarks that 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.290
 this is helping and we give it a 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.290
 little bit of light so appreciate it good if 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.360
 did not learn this water and if they can 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.500
 see there is the light on 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.880
 you have to have the button pressed 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.800
 to be surprised good 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.180
 we lose back 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.880
 when we do a panoramic view to 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.580
 all the clock 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.460
 let's put it in chronograph mode 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.760
 of chronograph so they see it work that 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.100
 quite interesting to see it as it follows 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.650
 showing the buttons on the sides 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.170
 the push buttons 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.240
 the other side that has one alone 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.790
 and let's see if we can see the part of 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.000
 down it's hard to see her but let's see if 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.709
 my friend Gonzalo without leaving turbid 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.720
 Well, that's how you see the model number 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.020
 it can be a little bit further back and there I go 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.000
 to come out that way they see the model and the anime 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.080
 the rest 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.050
 good submersible 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.210
 the belt the mesh it has is not 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.190
 original I do not know what happened to the 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.440
 time has been lost has been changed and 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.200
 the rest 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.080
 the original base I do not have it but good 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:11.660
 itself this is the watch is a citizen 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:14.330
 dual time chronograph of the year 79 and good 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.770
 I wanted to share it with you and that 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.770
 surely if you are looking 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.500
 this video will enjoy it because 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:26.630
 they were fashionable watches in those years 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.280
 well I would choose to show that and enjoy 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.650
 with you and share with you this 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.730
