00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.299 
this is some TDM and well the game has
its<00:00:57.480> flaws<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> better<00:00:59.039> but

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
its flaws and I know it's the better but

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.330 
its flaws and I know it's the better but
still<00:00:59.600> they<00:01:00.600> did<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.079> fix<00:01:01.500> any<00:01:01.890> flaws<00:01:02.309> that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
still they did not fix any flaws that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.840 
still they did not fix any flaws that
were<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.879> PlayStation<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.870> believe<00:01:04.850> because

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
were on PlayStation I believe because

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.690 
were on PlayStation I believe because
every<00:01:06.659> single<00:01:06.960> time<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.470> die<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.280> kind<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
every single time you die it's kind of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.820 
every single time you die it's kind of
laggy<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.479> kind<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.750> weird<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.439> always

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
laggy it's kind of weird like I always

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.830 
laggy it's kind of weird like I always
feel<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> game<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.939> going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.360> freeze<00:01:12.659> in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
feel like the game is going to freeze in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
feel like the game is going to freeze in
my<00:01:12.990> face<00:01:14.600> for<00:01:15.600> some<00:01:15.750> reason<00:01:16.250> while<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> was

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
my face for some reason while I was

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.780 
my face for some reason while I was
playing<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.939> game<00:01:18.210> froze<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:19.369> what<00:01:20.369> three

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
playing the game froze like what three

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.719 
playing the game froze like what three
times<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.570> that's<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.170> good<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:23.310> every

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
times and that's not good like every

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.160 
times and that's not good like every
time<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:24.090> trying<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.420> see<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> scoreboard

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
time I was trying to see the scoreboard

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.679 
time I was trying to see the scoreboard
the<00:01:25.560> game<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:26.040> freeze<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:27.090> just

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the game would freeze and that's just

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.130 
the game would freeze and that's just
bad<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.409> mean<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:29.729> shouldn't<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
bad I mean it shouldn't do that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.230 
bad I mean it shouldn't do that
so<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.070> needs<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.579> fixed<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so that really needs to be fixed for the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.260 
so that really needs to be fixed for the
full<00:01:34.079> game<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.920> well<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.790> it's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
full game if it's not well it's it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.050 
full game if it's not well it's it's
just<00:01:36.420> fail<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.460> will<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.729> me<00:01:38.850> rocking

you<00:02:11.300> move<00:02:11.810> like<00:02:12.020> slowly<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:14.000> it's<00:02:14.330> more

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
you move like slowly and it's more

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.660 
you move like slowly and it's more
realistic<00:02:14.930> because<00:02:15.800> uncle<00:02:16.190> vertie<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.520> not

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
realistic because uncle vertie is not

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.210 
realistic because uncle vertie is not
really<00:02:16.910> realistic<00:02:17.180> when<00:02:17.930> you're<00:02:18.080> moving<00:02:18.260> with

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
really realistic when you're moving with

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.640 
really realistic when you're moving with
a<00:02:19.520> bunch<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.940> bullets<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.750> stuff<00:02:21.140> like<00:02:21.380> that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
a bunch of bullets and stuff like that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.890 
a bunch of bullets and stuff like that
you<00:02:21.800> cannot<00:02:22.100> run<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.760> do<00:02:22.850> 360s<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.690> stuff

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you cannot run and do 360s and stuff

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.740 
you cannot run and do 360s and stuff
like<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:27.940> main<00:02:28.940> ila<00:02:29.150> foreigner<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.540> just

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
like that so main ila foreigner is just

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.780 
like that so main ila foreigner is just
more<00:02:29.990> realistic<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.220> now<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.430> just

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
more realistic like that and now I just

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.420 
more realistic like that and now I just
got<00:02:31.940> some<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.750> think<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:33.650> called<00:02:33.830> air<00:02:34.100> strike

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
got some I think it's called air strike

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.560 
got some I think it's called air strike
or<00:02:34.730> weight<00:02:35.240> we'll<00:02:35.570> see<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.170> second

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
or weight we'll see that in a second

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.300 
or weight we'll see that in a second
martyr<00:02:38.570> strike<00:02:38.870> yeah<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.970> oh<00:02:40.970> well<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.750> mean

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
martyr strike yeah and oh well I mean

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.070 
martyr strike yeah and oh well I mean
that<00:02:43.310> was<00:02:43.459> like<00:02:43.489> my<00:02:43.820> what<00:02:44.360> second<00:02:44.900> game

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
that was like my what second game

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.010 
that was like my what second game
because<00:02:45.489> like<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.700> every<00:02:47.090> time<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.330> tried<00:02:47.810> to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
because like the every time I tried to

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.470 
because like the every time I tried to
play<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.950> was<00:02:49.220> just<00:02:49.520> not<00:02:49.850> working<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.390> was

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
play it it was just not working it was

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
freezing and shit so that needs to be

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.880 
freezing and shit so that needs to be
fixed<00:02:52.640> it's<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.989> game<00:02:54.110> is<00:02:54.290> not<00:02:54.470> stable

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
fixed it's not the game is not stable

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.340 
fixed it's not the game is not stable
yet<00:02:55.100> I've<00:02:55.910> no<00:02:56.060> idea<00:02:56.120> why<00:02:56.450> they<00:02:56.690> didn't<00:02:56.989> fix<00:02:57.170> it

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
yet I've no idea why they didn't fix it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.530

and look I just died here and there's
some<00:02:59.810> kind<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.050> lag<00:03:00.380> it's<00:03:00.680> kind<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.920> weird<00:03:01.160> it's

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
some kind of lag it's kind of weird it's

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.449 
some kind of lag it's kind of weird it's
not<00:03:01.370> fluid<00:03:02.920> also<00:03:04.870> for<00:03:05.870> some<00:03:05.989> reason<00:03:06.320> well<00:03:07.010> you

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459

can like choose the size of your screen
and<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.670> was<00:03:10.820> trying<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.380> change<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.830> it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
and I was trying to change it and it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.030 
and I was trying to change it and it
actually<00:03:14.480> didn't<00:03:15.019> work<00:03:15.049> like<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.709> couldn't

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
actually didn't work like I couldn't

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.830 
actually didn't work like I couldn't
save<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:16.670> wouldn't<00:03:17.000> save<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.330> would<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.690> would

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
save it it wouldn't save I would I would

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.320 
save it it wouldn't save I would I would
change<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.290> then<00:03:18.739> go<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.100> game<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.850> it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
change it then go in a game and it

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.390 
change it then go in a game and it
wouldn't<00:03:20.840> be<00:03:21.140> saved<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:21.650> that's<00:03:22.220> kind<00:03:22.370> of

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
wouldn't be saved so that's kind of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.640 
wouldn't be saved so that's kind of
weird<00:03:22.580> like<00:03:22.820> right<00:03:23.090> now<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.330> can't<00:03:23.690> see<00:03:23.900> it<00:03:24.019> I

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
weird like right now you can't see it I

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.479 
weird like right now you can't see it I
can't<00:03:25.100> see<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.519> it's<00:03:25.700> okay<00:03:26.120> but<00:03:26.299> on<00:03:26.390> my<00:03:26.510> TV<00:03:27.489> like

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
can't see it it's okay but on my TV like

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.250 
can't see it it's okay but on my TV like
the<00:03:28.700> amount<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.030> bullets<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.989> score

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
the amount of bullets the score

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.319 
the amount of bullets the score
everything<00:03:31.010> was<00:03:31.160> like<00:03:31.340> cut<00:03:31.549> off<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.239> was

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
everything was like cut off and I was

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.819 
everything was like cut off and I was
like<00:03:32.480> what

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
like what

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.580 
like what
so<00:03:34.310> anyway<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:35.030> guess<00:03:35.510> they<00:03:35.690> will<00:03:36.019> need<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.320> fix

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
so anyway I guess they will need to fix

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.039 
so anyway I guess they will need to fix
that<00:03:36.829> as<00:03:36.980> well<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.880> mean<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.600> game<00:03:41.750> is<00:03:41.870> not

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
that as well so I mean the game is not

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.560 
that as well so I mean the game is not
bad<00:03:43.840> if<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.590> game<00:03:45.769> is<00:03:45.950> not<00:03:46.070> changed<00:03:46.760> if<00:03:47.000> it's

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
bad if the game is not changed if it's

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.430 
bad if the game is not changed if it's
not<00:03:47.750> better

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
not better

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.710 
not better
like<00:03:48.950> if<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.280> old<00:03:49.700> game<00:03:49.940> is<00:03:50.060> not<00:03:50.209> better<00:03:50.510> than

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
like if the old game is not better than

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.600 
like if the old game is not better than
that<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:52.190> should<00:03:52.220> not<00:03:52.579> get<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:52.970> it's<00:03:53.840> just<00:03:53.959> I

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
that you should not get it it's just I

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.650 
that you should not get it it's just I
don't<00:03:55.610> know<00:03:57.790> they<00:03:58.790> need<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.150> work<00:03:59.360> on<00:03:59.540> that

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
don't know they need to work on that

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.810 
don't know they need to work on that
again<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.530> feel<00:04:00.769> like<00:04:00.950> they<00:04:01.130> will<00:04:01.280> do<00:04:01.579> so

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
again and I feel like they will do so

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.240 
again and I feel like they will do so
but<00:04:02.180> if<00:04:02.329> they<00:04:02.510> don't<00:04:02.780> do<00:04:02.989> it<00:04:03.140> well<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:03.950> game<00:04:04.130> is

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
but if they don't do it well the game is

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.729 
but if they don't do it well the game is
not<00:04:04.400> going<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.940> be<00:04:05.090> worth<00:04:05.269> buying<00:04:05.600> at<00:04:05.930> all<00:04:06.110> but

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
not going to be worth buying at all but

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.289 
not going to be worth buying at all but
still<00:04:06.950> it's<00:04:07.160> not<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.340> money<00:04:07.820> more<00:04:07.970> for<00:04:08.180> two

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
still it's not like money more for two

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.860 
still it's not like money more for two
it's<00:04:08.540> just<00:04:08.750> it's<00:04:09.200> more<00:04:09.350> slow-paced<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:11.480> I

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
it's just it's more slow-paced it I

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.920 
it's just it's more slow-paced it I
don't<00:04:12.410> know<00:04:12.530> if<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.830> takes<00:04:13.099> more<00:04:13.370> skills<00:04:13.930> it's

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
don't know if it takes more skills it's

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.300 
don't know if it takes more skills it's
kind<00:04:15.080> of<00:04:15.110> hard<00:04:15.379> to<00:04:15.440> say<00:04:15.739> I<00:04:15.770> didn't<00:04:16.070> play

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
kind of hard to say I didn't play

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.690 
kind of hard to say I didn't play
enough<00:04:16.549> to<00:04:16.790> say<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.239> but<00:04:17.690> like<00:04:18.040> the<00:04:19.040> guns<00:04:19.489> they

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
enough to say it but like the guns they

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.069 
enough to say it but like the guns they
don't<00:04:19.850> have<00:04:19.940> much<00:04:20.180> recoil<00:04:20.540> I'm<00:04:20.720> using<00:04:20.870> the

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
don't have much recoil I'm using the

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.470 
don't have much recoil I'm using the
ak-47<00:04:21.590> right<00:04:22.160> now<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:23.060> pretty<00:04:23.330> much<00:04:23.419> has

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
ak-47 right now and it pretty much has

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.480 
ak-47 right now and it pretty much has
no<00:04:23.810> recoil<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:26.150> takes<00:04:26.480> like<00:04:26.889> what<00:04:27.889> four<00:04:28.280> to

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
no recoil it takes like what four to

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.210 
no recoil it takes like what four to
five<00:04:28.730> bullets<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:29.270> kill<00:04:29.300> somebody<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:30.220> yeah

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
five bullets to kill somebody and yeah

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.940 
five bullets to kill somebody and yeah
it's<00:04:31.580> also<00:04:31.790> as<00:04:32.540> you<00:04:32.690> can<00:04:32.840> see<00:04:32.930> right<00:04:33.050> now<00:04:33.110> extra

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
it's also as you can see right now extra

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.850 
it's also as you can see right now extra
points<00:04:34.280> for<00:04:34.600> headshots<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:36.200> stuff<00:04:36.410> like<00:04:36.620> that

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
points for headshots and stuff like that

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.320 
points for headshots and stuff like that
so<00:04:37.040> they're<00:04:37.220> kind<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.460> trying<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:37.910> make<00:04:38.300> it

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
so they're kind of trying to make it

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.970 
so they're kind of trying to make it
like<00:04:38.660> modern<00:04:38.930> warfare<00:04:39.080> 2<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.650> in<00:04:39.710> my<00:04:39.860> opinion

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
like modern warfare 2 and in my opinion

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.890 
like modern warfare 2 and in my opinion
that's<00:04:40.340> not<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> good<00:04:40.790> thing

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
that's not a good thing

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.659 
that's not a good thing
because<00:04:42.380> in<00:04:42.500> my<00:04:42.620> opinion<00:04:42.950> if<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.280> make<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.460> game

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
because in my opinion if you make a game

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.600 
because in my opinion if you make a game
you<00:04:43.910> need<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.120> make<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:44.840> different<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.610> that's

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
you need to make it different and that's

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.700 
you need to make it different and that's
what<00:04:46.880> makes<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.300> good<00:04:47.480> if<00:04:47.960> it's<00:04:48.260> like<00:04:48.500> the

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
what makes it good if it's like the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.320 
what makes it good if it's like the
others<00:04:49.010> if<00:04:49.220> you're<00:04:49.370> trying<00:04:49.729> to<00:04:49.880> copy<00:04:50.090> the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
others if you're trying to copy the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.610 
others if you're trying to copy the
others<00:04:50.630> that's<00:04:50.810> not<00:04:51.169> good

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
others that's not good

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.650 
others that's not good
and<00:04:52.130> uh<00:04:52.660> yeah<00:04:53.660> well<00:04:54.020> oh<00:04:54.940> I<00:04:55.940> thought<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.540> game

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
and uh yeah well oh I thought the game

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.710 
and uh yeah well oh I thought the game
was<00:04:56.810> wrapping<00:04:57.139> up<00:04:57.260> but<00:04:57.380> it's<00:04:57.530> not<00:04:57.590> ok<00:04:58.460> great

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
was wrapping up but it's not ok great

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.890 
was wrapping up but it's not ok great

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
would be interested in seeing some

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.070 
would be interested in seeing some
gameplay<00:05:13.010> like<00:05:13.220> that<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.790> might<00:05:14.360> play<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.930> more

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
gameplay like that I might play it more

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.879 
gameplay like that I might play it more
even<00:05:15.440> though<00:05:15.590> I<00:05:15.620> did<00:05:16.100> not<00:05:16.330> enjoy<00:05:17.330> my<00:05:17.450> first

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
even though I did not enjoy my first

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.640 
even though I did not enjoy my first
experience<00:05:18.889> that<00:05:18.979> much<00:05:19.570> I<00:05:20.570> got<00:05:21.350> kind<00:05:21.560> of

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
experience that much I got kind of

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.060 
experience that much I got kind of
frustrated<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.400> mean<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.300> don't<00:05:24.020> get<00:05:24.350> why<00:05:25.039> they

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
frustrated I mean I don't get why they

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.480 
frustrated I mean I don't get why they
would<00:05:25.539> release<00:05:26.539> something<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:28.070> is<00:05:28.250> not

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
would release something that is not

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.909 
would release something that is not
stable<00:05:29.180> that<00:05:29.419> keeps<00:05:29.720> freezing<00:05:30.050> that<00:05:30.560> that's

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
stable that keeps freezing that that's

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.190 
stable that keeps freezing that that's
kind<00:05:31.250> of<00:05:31.310> stupid<00:05:31.550> in<00:05:31.789> my<00:05:31.820> opinion<00:05:31.970> but<00:05:32.930> if<00:05:33.020> that

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
kind of stupid in my opinion but if that

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.080 
kind of stupid in my opinion but if that
gets<00:05:33.410> fixed<00:05:33.830> well<00:05:34.310> it's<00:05:34.520> alright<00:05:34.880> and<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.900> mean

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
gets fixed well it's alright and I mean

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.790 
gets fixed well it's alright and I mean
that<00:05:38.090> game<00:05:38.360> can<00:05:38.630> be<00:05:38.780> it's<00:05:39.080> not<00:05:39.260> like<00:05:39.560> modern

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
that game can be it's not like modern

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.159 
that game can be it's not like modern
warfare<00:05:40.070> 2<00:05:40.220> I<00:05:40.370> don't<00:05:40.700> want<00:05:40.970> to<00:05:41.150> compare<00:05:41.990> it<00:05:42.140> to

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
warfare 2 I don't want to compare it to

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.240 
warfare 2 I don't want to compare it to
modern<00:05:42.590> warfare<00:05:42.740> 2<00:05:42.919> but<00:05:43.280> it's<00:05:43.430> like<00:05:44.289> my<00:05:45.289> most

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
modern warfare 2 but it's like my most

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.460 
modern warfare 2 but it's like my most
of<00:05:46.400> my<00:05:46.550> game<00:05:46.760> play<00:05:47.000> is<00:05:47.240> about<00:05:47.660> monomorphic<00:05:48.169> -

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
of my game play is about monomorphic -

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.340 
of my game play is about monomorphic -
so<00:05:48.620> I<00:05:48.680> guess<00:05:48.889> that<00:05:49.070> you<00:05:49.220> guys<00:05:49.789> were<00:05:50.090> are<00:05:50.450> into

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
so I guess that you guys were are into

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.400 
so I guess that you guys were are into
mono<00:05:51.590> more<00:05:51.800> for<00:05:51.979> 2<00:05:52.100> right<00:05:52.370> now<00:05:52.690> or<00:05:53.690> at<00:05:54.260> least

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
mono more for 2 right now or at least

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.430 
mono more for 2 right now or at least
you<00:05:54.710> were<00:05:54.889> into<00:05:55.250> it<00:05:55.690> so<00:05:56.690> I<00:05:56.990> mean<00:05:57.169> you<00:05:57.260> can't

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
you were into it so I mean you can't

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.310
