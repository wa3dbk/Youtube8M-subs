find the switch I gotta go head and
decent<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.239> underneath<00:00:42.750> spawn<00:00:43.079> we

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
decent and this is underneath spawn we

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.180 
decent and this is underneath spawn we

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
right if I flip the switch on let me

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.069 
right if I flip the switch on let me
make<00:00:52.649> sure<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:52.829> render<00:00:53.699> distances<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.480> short

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
make sure my render distances on short

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.819 
make sure my render distances on short
okay<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.850> turn<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> then<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.829> go

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
okay so if I turn this on and then I go

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.770 
okay so if I turn this on and then I go
up<00:01:02.420> this<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:05.790> course<00:01:05.820> someone<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:08.780> telling

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

shut now so if i go back and descend

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.230 
shut now so if i go back and descend
again<00:01:15.630> i<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.979> flip<00:01:17.280> them<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.820> open<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
again i can flip them back and open it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.100

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
thought i'd put in there's a lot of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
thought i'd put in there's a lot of
theaters<00:01:25.680> down<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.009> there<00:01:26.220> was<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> time

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
theaters down here there was a time

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
theaters down here there was a time
system<00:01:27.570> i<00:01:27.659> didn't<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.290> i<00:01:28.560> liked<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> we

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
system i didn't like that i liked it we

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
system i didn't like that i liked it we
could<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.640> flip<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> switch<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.420> everything

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
could just flip a switch and everything

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.160 
could just flip a switch and everything
would<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.470> cool<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.020> back

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
would be cool so it's going to go back

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.020 
would be cool so it's going to go back
up<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.439> spawn<00:01:34.710> i<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
up to spawn i do think we have some of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.160 
up to spawn i do think we have some of
the<00:01:36.090> directions<00:01:36.450> i<00:01:36.509> think<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:37.079> supposed

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the directions i think that's supposed

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.499 
the directions i think that's supposed
to<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.500> east<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.880> supposed<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.420> be

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
to be east and that's supposed to be

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
to be east and that's supposed to be
West<00:01:40.400> or<00:01:41.400> north<00:01:41.939> east<00:01:42.570> south<00:01:42.840> west<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:44.189> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
West or north east south west I think I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.280 
West or north east south west I think I
got<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.000> messed<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.420> somehow<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.170> either

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
got the messed up somehow it's either

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.700 
got the messed up somehow it's either
north<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:46.740> south<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.340> believe<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.229> um<00:01:49.229> another

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
north or south I believe so um another

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.730 
north or south I believe so um another
thing<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:50.040> did<00:01:50.189> we<00:01:50.310> fenced<00:01:51.030> off<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.689> 100<00:01:52.320> block

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
thing we did we fenced off the 100 block

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.630 
thing we did we fenced off the 100 block
radius<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:54.110> Spahn<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.140> actually<00:01:55.860> nobody<00:01:56.130> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
radius of Spahn so actually nobody that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600 
radius of Spahn so actually nobody that
is<00:01:56.790> not<00:01:57.030> an<00:01:57.570> op<00:01:57.840> or<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.740> moderator<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.369> build

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
is not an op or a moderator can build

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.920 
is not an op or a moderator can build
there<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.000> i<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.149> really<00:02:00.270> no<00:02:00.509> point<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
there so i was really no point of this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.580 
there so i was really no point of this
being<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:02.270> or<00:02:03.270> build<00:02:03.659> over<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.469> they

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
being here or build over it so if they
