or anything up acting any blisters isn't

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.130 
or anything up acting any blisters isn't
every<00:02:06.310> night<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.640> then<00:02:06.759> lace<00:02:06.969> up<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:08.020> can

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
every night and then lace up and you can

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.469 
every night and then lace up and you can
just<00:02:08.259> slip<00:02:08.530> them<00:02:08.740> on<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:08.979> these<00:02:09.940> were<00:02:10.149> 10

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
just slip them on and these were 10

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.910 
just slip them on and these were 10
pounds<00:02:10.930> which<00:02:10.990> again<00:02:11.350> at<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.560> time<00:02:11.710> I've

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
pounds which again at the time I've

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.260 
pounds which again at the time I've
kinda<00:02:12.130> like<00:02:12.220> for<00:02:12.400> Primark<00:02:12.820> that's<00:02:13.060> quite

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
kinda like for Primark that's quite

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.970 
kinda like for Primark that's quite
steep<00:02:13.570> but<00:02:13.990> actually<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:14.410> think<00:02:14.500> they're<00:02:14.800> worth

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
steep but actually I think they're worth

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.080 
steep but actually I think they're worth
every<00:02:15.280> penny<00:02:15.460> there

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
every penny there

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.809 
every penny there
great<00:02:16.269> shoes<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.810> they<00:02:16.959> are<00:02:17.519> they're<00:02:18.519> not<00:02:18.700> the

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
great shoes and they are they're not the

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.229 
great shoes and they are they're not the
smartest<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.450> shoes<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.019> they're<00:02:21.120> kind<00:02:22.120> of

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
smartest of shoes but they're kind of

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.690 
smartest of shoes but they're kind of
plain<00:02:22.870> enough<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.440> they<00:02:23.560> don't<00:02:23.709> stand<00:02:24.040> out<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
plain enough so they don't stand out and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.369 
plain enough so they don't stand out and
look<00:02:24.970> scruffy<00:02:25.720> or<00:02:25.900> anything<00:02:26.140> like<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.260> that

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
look scruffy or anything like that that

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.470 
look scruffy or anything like that that
make<00:02:26.680> sense<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.700> yeah<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:27.849> really<00:02:28.120> really<00:02:28.330> like

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
make sense but yeah I really really like

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.059 
make sense but yeah I really really like
these<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.019> I<00:02:29.500> would<00:02:29.680> definitely<00:02:29.830> recommend

reminds<00:03:11.500> me<00:03:11.620> very<00:03:11.709> much<00:03:12.129> of<00:03:12.310> something<00:03:12.640> you

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
reminds me very much of something you

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.630 
reminds me very much of something you
might<00:03:13.030> find<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.510> Topshop<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.260> it's<00:03:14.640> black

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
might find in Topshop and it's black

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.369 
might find in Topshop and it's black
it's<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.150> little<00:03:16.180> bit<00:03:16.540> see-through<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.200> it'd<00:03:17.290> be

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
it's a little bit see-through so it'd be

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.740 
it's a little bit see-through so it'd be
nice<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.590> wear<00:03:17.890> on<00:03:18.010> holiday<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:18.849> butterflies

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.530 
nice to wear on holiday with butterflies
and<00:03:19.780> flowers<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.790> just<00:03:22.000> think<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:22.269> really

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
and flowers and I just think it's really

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.420 
and flowers and I just think it's really
pretty<00:03:22.900> obviously<00:03:23.590> it's<00:03:23.709> got<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.950> color<00:03:24.220> on

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
pretty obviously it's got the color on

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.849 
pretty obviously it's got the color on
it<00:03:24.459> but<00:03:24.760> also<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.630> still<00:03:25.959> black<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:26.650> it's<00:03:26.799> not

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
it but also it's still black so it's not

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.030 
it but also it's still black so it's not
so<00:03:27.310> vibrant<00:03:27.940> it's<00:03:28.090> very<00:03:28.269> understated<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.230> I

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
my high waisted skirt and this one is

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.280 
my high waisted skirt and this one is
just<00:04:51.510> like<00:04:51.960> an<00:04:52.080> oversized<00:04:53.960> gray-marl<00:04:54.960> I

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
just like an oversized gray-marl I

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.470 
just like an oversized gray-marl I
believe<00:04:55.530> it's<00:04:55.680> called<00:04:55.770> top<00:04:56.670> rather<00:04:57.090> big

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
believe it's called top rather big

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.390 
believe it's called top rather big
actually<00:04:57.930> looking<00:04:58.260> at<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:58.950> I<00:04:58.980> think<00:04:59.160> it

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
actually looking at it so I think it

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.160 
actually looking at it so I think it
would<00:04:59.490> be<00:04:59.520> nice<00:04:59.760> outside<00:05:00.090> good<00:05:00.900> for<00:05:01.110> the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
would be nice outside good for the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.510 
would be nice outside good for the
summer<00:05:01.440> when<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.830> want<00:05:02.130> to<00:05:02.250> be<00:05:02.280> wearing

summer when you want to be wearing

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.190 
summer when you want to be wearing
something<00:05:02.820> that's<00:05:03.090> really<00:05:03.300> easy<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.720> move<00:05:03.930> in

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
something that's really easy to move in

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.240 
something that's really easy to move in
casual<00:05:04.980> and<00:05:05.160> very<00:05:05.340> flowing<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:06.890> we<00:05:07.890> like<00:05:08.040> it

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
casual and very flowing and we like it

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.310

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
it's a bit see-through but I'm sure that

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.170 
it's a bit see-through but I'm sure that
would<00:05:10.410> be<00:05:10.530> absolutely<00:05:10.710> fine<00:05:11.100> but<00:05:11.700> yeah<00:05:11.880> that

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
would be absolutely fine but yeah that

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.020 
would be absolutely fine but yeah that
was<00:05:12.360> around<00:05:12.690> was<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.620> 12<00:05:14.040> pounds<00:05:14.130> with

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
was around was it 12 pounds with

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.340 
was around was it 12 pounds with
something<00:05:15.300> like<00:05:15.420> that<00:05:15.600> but<00:05:15.810> um<00:05:16.020> I<00:05:16.290> just

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
something like that but um I just

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.780 
something like that but um I just
thought<00:05:16.590> I'd<00:05:16.650> buy<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:16.890> because<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.220> do<00:05:17.340> have<00:05:17.550> one

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
thought I'd buy it because I do have one

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.820 
thought I'd buy it because I do have one
other<00:05:18.720> drop<00:05:18.870> which<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.140> wear<00:05:19.320> but<00:05:19.710> it's

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
other drop which I wear but it's

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.680 
other drop which I wear but it's
quite<00:05:20.010> it's<00:05:20.250> not<00:05:20.430> tight<00:05:20.670> it's<00:05:20.880> tight<00:05:21.180> fitting

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
quite it's not tight it's tight fitting

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.200 
quite it's not tight it's tight fitting
so<00:05:22.020> it's<00:05:23.300> it's<00:05:24.300> more<00:05:24.570> kind<00:05:24.840> of<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.350> don't<00:05:25.800> know

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
so it's it's more kind of I don't know

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.850 
so it's it's more kind of I don't know
you<00:05:27.210> can<00:05:27.360> kind<00:05:27.510> of<00:05:27.540> see<00:05:27.600> more<00:05:27.930> your<00:05:28.320> body<00:05:28.530> in<00:05:28.740> it

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
you can kind of see more your body in it

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.350 
you can kind of see more your body in it
whereas<00:05:29.130> this<00:05:29.280> one<00:05:29.340> it's<00:05:29.670> a<00:05:29.760> bit<00:05:29.970> kind<00:05:30.210> of

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
whereas this one it's a bit kind of

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.140 
whereas this one it's a bit kind of
loose<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:31.010> easier<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.070> get<00:05:32.670> away<00:05:32.790> with<00:05:32.910> or

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
loose and easier to get away with or

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.630 
loose and easier to get away with or
easy<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.480> wear<00:05:33.660> I<00:05:33.690> think<00:05:33.990> so<00:05:34.500> yes<00:05:34.980> that<00:05:35.040> was

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
check in website and I can cause these

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.510 
check in website and I can cause these
and<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.260> was<00:05:43.380> like<00:05:43.500> wow<00:05:43.680> they're<00:05:43.950> really<00:05:43.980> nice
