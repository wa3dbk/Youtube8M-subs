00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
now it's as if it was photocopied on a

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.000 
now it's as if it was photocopied on a
photo<00:01:15.790> on<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.060> scanner<00:01:16.420> scan<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.140> mean<00:01:17.410> yeah<00:01:17.590> so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
photo on a scanner scan I mean yeah so

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.580 
photo on a scanner scan I mean yeah so
uh<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.610> can<00:01:19.210> make<00:01:19.300> the<00:01:19.420> letters<00:01:19.960> bold<00:01:20.320> or<00:01:20.530> you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
uh you can make the letters bold or you

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.760 
uh you can make the letters bold or you
can<00:01:20.710> zoom<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.130> on<00:01:21.370> its<00:01:21.580> ok<00:01:21.880> let's<00:01:22.870> see<00:01:23.140> which

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
can zoom in on its ok let's see which

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.290 
can zoom in on its ok let's see which
ones<00:01:24.040> would<00:01:24.340> suit<00:01:24.640> us<00:01:24.730> best<00:01:25.000> i<00:01:26.040> think<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.430> the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
ones would suit us best i think the the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.180 
ones would suit us best i think the the
medium<00:01:29.050> one<00:01:29.200> would<00:01:29.410> be<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.650> best<00:01:29.830> because

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
medium one would be the best because

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.860 
medium one would be the best because
once<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.550> gets<00:01:30.670> lighter<00:01:30.970> it's<00:01:31.240> lighter<00:01:31.510> and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
once it gets lighter it's lighter and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.680 
once it gets lighter it's lighter and
once<00:01:32.440> it<00:01:32.560> gets<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.740> director<00:01:33.450> dark<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.600> i'll

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
once it gets a director dark so i'll

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.070 
once it gets a director dark so i'll
keep<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.930> like<00:01:35.050> this<00:01:35.080> next<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.810> then<00:01:37.900> right

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
keep it like this next and then right

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.410 
keep it like this next and then right
here<00:01:38.110> there<00:01:38.920> is<00:01:39.070> a<00:01:39.100> share<00:01:39.430> button<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:40.180> want<00:01:40.360> to
