game which Lucas arts is launching which

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.740 
game which Lucas arts is launching which
is<00:05:11.730> actually<00:05:11.850> pretty<00:05:12.000> cool<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.510> have

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
is actually pretty cool you have

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.300 
is actually pretty cool you have
lightsaber<00:05:13.260> battles<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.830> you<00:05:14.190> could

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
lightsaber battles and you could

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.400 
lightsaber battles and you could
actually<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:15.210> know<00:05:15.330> fight<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.840> its<00:05:15.960> really

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
actually you know fight and its really

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.020 
actually you know fight and its really
pretty<00:05:16.620> interesting<00:05:17.190> I<00:05:17.370> really<00:05:17.580> think<00:05:17.940> that

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
pretty interesting I really think that

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.760 
pretty interesting I really think that
connect<00:05:18.390> has<00:05:18.570> a<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.900> opportunity<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.650> be<00:05:19.740> a

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
connect has a the opportunity to be a

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.110 
connect has a the opportunity to be a
really<00:05:20.100> unique<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.490> immersive<00:05:20.910> gaming

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
really unique and immersive gaming

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.660 
really unique and immersive gaming
experience<00:05:21.690> because<00:05:22.320> not<00:05:22.500> only<00:05:22.530> do<00:05:23.100> you<00:05:23.190> is<00:05:23.430> it

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
experience because not only do you is it

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.760 
experience because not only do you is it
motion<00:05:24.120> controlled<00:05:24.570> like<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.110> wii<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:25.530> even

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
motion controlled like the wii and even

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.310 
motion controlled like the wii and even
the<00:05:25.920> PSN<00:05:26.640> PlayStation<00:05:27.540> Move<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:28.020> think<00:05:28.200> that's

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
the PSN PlayStation Move I think that's

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.120 
the PSN PlayStation Move I think that's
what<00:05:28.440> it's<00:05:28.560> called<00:05:28.590> on<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.830> hundred<00:05:29.070> percent

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
what it's called on a hundred percent

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.280 
what it's called on a hundred percent
sure<00:05:29.310> but<00:05:29.880> you<00:05:29.970> don't<00:05:30.120> even<00:05:30.180> need<00:05:30.450> you<00:05:30.960> know<00:05:31.080> a

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
sure but you don't even need you know a

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.440 
sure but you don't even need you know a
we<00:05:31.650> motor<00:05:32.090> we<00:05:33.090> up<00:05:33.300> PSN<00:05:34.130> ps3<00:05:35.130> one<00:05:35.550> is<00:05:35.880> just<00:05:36.300> your

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
we motor we up PSN ps3 one is just your

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.150 
we motor we up PSN ps3 one is just your
body<00:05:36.690> so<00:05:37.140> it<00:05:37.230> really<00:05:37.380> has<00:05:37.530> an<00:05:37.650> edge<00:05:37.800> over<00:05:37.920> those

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
body so it really has an edge over those

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.190 
body so it really has an edge over those
two<00:05:38.310> things<00:05:38.430> of<00:05:38.610> course<00:05:38.820> it<00:05:39.120> depends<00:05:39.690> on<00:05:39.810> if<00:05:40.020> it

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
two things of course it depends on if it

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.170 
two things of course it depends on if it
works<00:05:40.410> well<00:05:40.680> but<00:05:40.920> from<00:05:41.460> everything<00:05:41.730> all<00:05:42.060> the

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
works well but from everything all the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.820 
works well but from everything all the
testing<00:05:42.540> I've<00:05:42.660> read<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.080> all<00:05:43.260> of<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.500> demos

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
testing I've read and all of the demos

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.200 
testing I've read and all of the demos
I've<00:05:43.980> seen<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.370> seems<00:05:44.550> like<00:05:44.700> it<00:05:44.730> works<00:05:45.000> really

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
I've seen it seems like it works really

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.110 
I've seen it seems like it works really
well<00:05:45.740> but<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.920> biggest<00:05:47.130> announcement<00:05:47.520> I

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
well but the biggest announcement I

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.050 
well but the biggest announcement I
think<00:05:48.750> at<00:05:48.900> least<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.290> the<00:05:49.350> slim<00:05:49.890> xbox<00:05:50.160> 360<00:05:50.910> as

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
think at least is the slim xbox 360 as

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.790 
think at least is the slim xbox 360 as
they<00:05:51.330> say<00:05:51.510> it's<00:05:51.720> sleeker<00:05:52.110> smaller<00:05:52.500> and

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
they say it's sleeker smaller and

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.070 
they say it's sleeker smaller and
whisper-quiet<00:05:53.220> of<00:05:53.790> course<00:05:54.000> my<00:05:54.150> xbox<00:05:54.510> 360<00:05:54.960> is

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
whisper-quiet of course my xbox 360 is

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.630 
whisper-quiet of course my xbox 360 is
definitely<00:05:55.560> not<00:05:55.710> whisper<00:05:56.040> quiet<00:05:56.310> anything

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
definitely not whisper quiet anything

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.130 
definitely not whisper quiet anything
from<00:05:56.790> it<00:05:56.970> what<00:05:57.600> I<00:05:57.630> think<00:05:57.750> is<00:05:58.050> really

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
from it what I think is really

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.560 
from it what I think is really
interesting<00:05:58.710> is<00:05:59.340> they<00:05:59.760> actually<00:06:00.240> in<00:06:00.450> a

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
interesting is they actually in a

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
interesting is they actually in a
smaller<00:06:00.870> design<00:06:01.140> they've<00:06:01.440> actually

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
smaller design they've actually

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.290 
smaller design they've actually
integrated<00:06:02.280> the<00:06:02.370> power<00:06:02.610> supply<00:06:02.820> into<00:06:03.120> the

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
integrated the power supply into the

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.180 
integrated the power supply into the
case<00:06:03.510> the<00:06:03.720> power<00:06:03.960> supply<00:06:04.290> these<00:06:04.500> power<00:06:04.830> bricks

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
case the power supply these power bricks

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.400 
case the power supply these power bricks
had<00:06:06.120> two<00:06:06.330> problems<00:06:06.600> with<00:06:06.900> them<00:06:07.020> first<00:06:07.260> of<00:06:07.320> all

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
had two problems with them first of all

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.750
