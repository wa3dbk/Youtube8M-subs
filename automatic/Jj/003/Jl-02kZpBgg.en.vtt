00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.549
 very interesting from China from the site of the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.250
 dot com reference will be description this 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.240
 us the same thing that is the same outside 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.550
 de fourth iphone 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 protective glass is already for Pyaterochka 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.550
 let's see it came in 18 days here 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.820
 swords die here 25 was sent today 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.989
 already the twelfth came in 17 days 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.989
 up to 18 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:50.200
 let's open here there should be two 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:54.080
 the things there were just different purchases were 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:57.200
 red blue and yellow and green came 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:01.070
 us here such here Krasniqi principle 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.670
 shelf packaging does not play a major role 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.270
 the essence and so this is what we have written for 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.200
 retina 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.320
 and and super amoled screens that is she 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.509
 suitable for them is our thickness 04 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.400
 I even suspect that some response 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.840
 packaging candy packaging such thickness 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.130
 here we have 0 4 meters the thickest here 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:30.710
 Look at the back of the package here. 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:33.170
 we show product as well 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.740
 indicated that we have here included in 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.080
 kit 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.460
 that is, three times four four things this 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.460
 can look closer to high 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.409
 this glass itself 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:54.390
 cleaning cloth home button 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.479
 English manual wet cloth 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.509
 and how would scotch in which you will 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.189
 remove dust particles if we buy 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.189
 fall under the glass during gluing 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:13.319
 so let's open some 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:17.330
 work who opens us easy and what 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:22.799
 we see the macau brand here 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:28.019
 We will know here we have packaging 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:31.620
 one and a bag of sex with accessories 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:35.459
 actually go through with him so 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:41.480
 Interestingly opened discovered that we 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:44.250
 here we see it this for smoothing 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.900
 plastic sticker instead 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.380
 use your male card 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.000
 it is also convenient so we have 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.510
 Now let's see what this is for nothing 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 home better cleaning bag 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.860
 quality than in those with films 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.340
 usually because it â€™s important 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.430
 brand and proper wet cloth then 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:13.090
 have alcohol you say not to wet 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:16.190
 Soros alcohol and and that it is with us 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.820
 home button for some reason does not 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:25.340
 standard so let's say yes this home button 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.490
 it is on top you stick to 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.480
 there was no such big river so let's say 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.080
 when you warm look back than 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.350
 older 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.420
 it's actually written gas and spens then 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.890
 there is a cheat on the glass behind us 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.790
 instruction written to wither your 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.260
 hands and use only a clean cloth 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.920
 screen wipe 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.890
 Well, I think so if it will be interesting 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.290
 I will remove the installation process but this is not 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:03.470
 channel is that this text from 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.160
 there is no packaging so here we have 4 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.940
 sticker 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:12.140
 which are meant to help 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.060
 you remove the film and reinstall it 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.470
 there is written east knapsack that is for 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.070
 to reinstall it from 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.820
 components behind something else further in 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.940
 even such can be present as 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.000
 quality certificate 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.680
 written date here indicated this 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.520
 quality certificate here is the date 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:38.280
 when passed this test this glass 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.280
 also kimiko to secondary quality however 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:46.330
 could the floor again on the bag and inside u 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.670
 us actually the very glass it to me 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.010
 so it seems 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:55.720
 thicker than 4 I bought something on 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:58.810
 Four of us were thick enough 030 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.060
 30 navel not think of will withstand 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.020
 the same 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.330
 loads even this will be more than more 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.120
 principle mom so here it is to impose and 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:15.610
 You basically should not see the difference 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.280
 but practically here is still set here 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.560
 one sticker which is for sticking 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.770
 this is not the final version but the principle 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.430
 I can say for myself as a four 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.010
 I think here is also a hundred percent and also 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.680
 the quality will be the same and now I 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:36.130
 I can show how the video looks at 4 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.920
 showed they do not sell stick but 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:43.720
 quality here 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:46.450
 here you can see because there is a film 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.760
 not a page at all it's like you 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.480
 just a clean screen without glazing 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.670
 completely merges with the screen that is 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.520
 brightness is not lost clarity is not lost 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.260
 all distinguish and still here plus it in 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.880
 four of the five well as you too 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.190
 present at the boredom foursome as i 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.980
 it has already been used here with us 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:09.430
 you can see a hundred percent just a film she 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.690
 just flat on the edges and all of this for 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.090
 the account of the fact that she is subtle is not 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.950
 affects here made such 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.760
 beveled wounded film itself as 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:21.910
 for example life about low 6 plus there is the most 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.730
 the edge is mowed cabbage and due to this 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.480
 non-caste film is so thick and cumbersome 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.800
 and conveniently on the phone how many 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.290
 Basically everything I wanted to tell 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.920
 show about this film if you 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.980
 Interestingly I can take a review 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.660
 how not to stick itself of course 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.780
 it will be more difficult but basically I can 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.800
 Here I say goodbye to you 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.780
 subscribe to the channel put big 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.630
 fingers top and summit of course 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:52.130
 enjoyed repost all questions 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.130
