impressed at all how fast it works when

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.539 
impressed at all how fast it works when
I<00:04:07.940> put<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.389> much<00:04:08.660> in<00:04:08.989> eight<00:04:09.949> ounces<00:04:10.129> of<00:04:10.400> water

I put that much in eight ounces of water
a<00:04:11.030> whole<00:04:11.299> capful<00:04:11.930> should<00:04:12.859> have<00:04:12.980> annihilated

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
a whole capful should have annihilated

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:14.890 
a whole capful should have annihilated
these<00:04:13.730> things<00:04:13.940> in<00:04:14.090> my<00:04:14.209> opinion<00:04:14.480> if<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.780> was<00:04:14.870> a

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
these things in my opinion if it was a

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.629 
these things in my opinion if it was a
dim<00:04:15.199> land<00:04:15.440> related<00:04:15.889> product<00:04:16.310> it<00:04:16.430> would<00:04:16.549> have

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
dim land related product it would have

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.430 
dim land related product it would have
been<00:04:16.760> done<00:04:16.970> in<00:04:17.120> 10<00:04:17.329> minutes<00:04:18.099> so<00:04:19.099> let's<00:04:20.260> keep<00:04:21.260> my

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
been done in 10 minutes so let's keep my

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.939 
been done in 10 minutes so let's keep my
evaluation<00:04:22.070> going<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:22.580> it's<00:04:22.729> appropriate<00:04:23.949> the

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
evaluation going so it's appropriate the

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.350 
evaluation going so it's appropriate the
only<00:04:25.250> thing<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.550> could<00:04:25.610> have<00:04:25.910> done<00:04:26.090> is<00:04:26.210> maybe

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
only thing I could have done is maybe

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.150 
only thing I could have done is maybe
captured<00:04:26.930> two<00:04:27.139> more<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.530> these<00:04:27.680> things<00:04:27.949> and

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
captured two more of these things and

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.860 
captured two more of these things and
put<00:04:28.250> them<00:04:28.430> in<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.639> separate<00:04:29.060> cup<00:04:29.300> in<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.599> same

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
put them in a separate cup in the same
