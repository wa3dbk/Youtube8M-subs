00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
vapors they're very similar but these

vapors they're very similar but these
are<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.840> little<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.410> cheaper<00:00:52.829> okay<00:00:53.100> you

are like a little like cheaper okay you
know<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.260> side<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:56.100> looks<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
know it's on the side it looks like a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
know it's on the side it looks like a
vapor<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.780> under<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> looks<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.829> just

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
vapor but under it looks like they just

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.119 
vapor but under it looks like they just
printed<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> speed<00:01:00.420> under<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:01.980> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
printed it speed under it it's kind of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
printed it speed under it it's kind of
like<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:04.229> similar<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
like I don't know it's very similar to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.859 
like I don't know it's very similar to
the<00:01:04.830> vapor<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.390> thing<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.689> that

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the vapor but the thing is that

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.260 
the vapor but the thing is that
differently<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> cover<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.640> not

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
differently this one is the cover is not

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.700 
differently this one is the cover is not
as<00:01:09.570> durable<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:11.580> noticed<00:01:12.479> whenever<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.080> hit<00:01:13.320> like

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
as durable I noticed whenever I hit like

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.690 
as durable I noticed whenever I hit like
wedge<00:01:14.490> shots<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.390> sand<00:01:16.380> trap<00:01:16.650> shots<00:01:17.009> at<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
wedge shots and sand trap shots at the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.760 
wedge shots and sand trap shots at the
ball<00:01:17.970> would<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.390> caught<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.750> very<00:01:19.110> easily<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
ball would get caught up very easily and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
ball would get caught up very easily and
when<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> hits<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> tree<00:01:21.509> or<00:01:21.780> cart<00:01:22.110> path

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
when it hits like a tree or cart path

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.560 
when it hits like a tree or cart path
it's<00:01:22.560> pretty<00:01:22.860> much<00:01:22.950> done<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:24.240> worse

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it's pretty much done for it's worse

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
it's pretty much done for it's worse

the<00:01:59.700> greens<00:02:00.030> um<00:02:01.310> they're<00:02:02.310> okay<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.270> it's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the greens um they're okay I think it's

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.139 
the greens um they're okay I think it's
got<00:02:03.540> mid<00:02:03.780> spin<00:02:04.170> i<00:02:04.439> usually<00:02:05.369> get<00:02:05.670> some<00:02:05.880> spin<00:02:06.119> on

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
got mid spin i usually get some spin on

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.260 
got mid spin i usually get some spin on
my<00:02:06.240> shots<00:02:06.600> big<00:02:07.229> amid<00:02:07.560> spin<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.640> usually<00:02:09.119> not

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
my shots big amid spin but usually not

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
my shots big amid spin but usually not
all<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> time<00:02:09.780> i<00:02:09.840> had<00:02:10.080> some<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.349> them<00:02:10.440> bounce

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
all the time i had some of them bounce

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.620 
all the time i had some of them bounce
on<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> greens<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:12.030> usually<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.170> say

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
on the greens so usually if you say

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.800 
on the greens so usually if you say
if<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:14.500> hit<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.920> high<00:02:15.430> spin<00:02:15.820> shot<00:02:16.030> with<00:02:16.210> pro<00:02:16.450> v1

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
if you hit a high spin shot with pro v1

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.610 
if you hit a high spin shot with pro v1
then<00:02:17.740> this<00:02:18.040> would<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.490> like<00:02:18.960> almost<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.290> same

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
then this would be like almost the same

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.100 
then this would be like almost the same
as<00:02:20.680> hitting<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.670> low<00:02:21.910> spin<00:02:22.240> shot<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.600> pro<00:02:22.780> v1

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
as hitting a low spin shot of the pro v1

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.350 
as hitting a low spin shot of the pro v1
it<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.590> stick<00:02:23.830> there<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.310> if<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:24.970> hit<00:02:25.150> like

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
it just stick there and if you hit like

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.660 
it just stick there and if you hit like
a<00:02:25.420> medium<00:02:26.050> spin<00:02:26.320> shot<00:02:26.530> with<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.740> pro<00:02:26.920> v1<00:02:27.310> then

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
a medium spin shot with the pro v1 then

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.740 
a medium spin shot with the pro v1 then
this<00:02:28.000> will<00:02:28.150> probably<00:02:28.690> just<00:02:29.050> roll<00:02:29.410> forward<00:02:29.650> and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
this will probably just roll forward and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.620 
this will probably just roll forward and
barely<00:02:31.750> even<00:02:31.810> stop<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.000> designed<00:02:34.540> for

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
barely even stop so this is designed for

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.280 
barely even stop so this is designed for
amateurs<00:02:35.290> or<00:02:35.710> people<00:02:36.340> who<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.970> know<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.750> you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
amateurs or people who you know like you

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.150 
amateurs or people who you know like you
know<00:02:38.350> like<00:02:38.910> my<00:02:39.910> level<00:02:40.300> almost<00:02:40.420> or<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:41.160> really

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
know like my level almost or like really

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.250 
know like my level almost or like really
I<00:02:42.400> get<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.850> says<00:02:43.060> really<00:02:43.390> good<00:02:43.540> golfers<00:02:43.990> but<00:02:44.230> I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
I get it says really good golfers but I

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260 
I get it says really good golfers but I
mean<00:02:44.530> really<00:02:45.220> good<00:02:45.430> golfers<00:02:45.790> really<00:02:46.030> wouldn't

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
mean really good golfers really wouldn't

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.290 
mean really good golfers really wouldn't
like<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.540> kind<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.930> ball<00:02:47.080> um<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:48.310> think

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
like this kind of ball um I think

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.970 
like this kind of ball um I think
they're<00:02:49.630> like<00:02:49.780> thirty<00:02:50.290> dollars<00:02:50.620> or<00:02:50.770> forty

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
they're like thirty dollars or forty

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.060 
they're like thirty dollars or forty
dollars<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> dozen<00:02:51.670> um<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:53.260> you're<00:02:53.710> a<00:02:53.740> kid<00:02:53.950> like

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
dollars a dozen um if you're a kid like

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.490 
dollars a dozen um if you're a kid like
my<00:02:54.280> age<00:02:54.490> then<00:02:55.030> yeah<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.630> should<00:02:55.960> go<00:02:56.110> for<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.410> if

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
my age then yeah you should go for it if

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.900 
my age then yeah you should go for it if
you're<00:02:56.590> an<00:02:56.710> adult<00:02:56.980> or<00:02:57.160> something<00:02:57.520> I<00:02:57.670> would

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
you're an adult or something I would

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.200 
you're an adult or something I would
stay<00:02:58.120> away<00:02:58.240> from<00:02:58.360> these<00:02:58.630> because<00:02:59.940> they<00:03:00.940> just

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
stay away from these because they just

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.630 
stay away from these because they just
they<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:01.720> cut<00:03:02.170> very<00:03:02.440> easily<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:03.160> you

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
they just cut very easily and if you

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.490 
they just cut very easily and if you
know<00:03:03.760> it's<00:03:04.390> kind<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.720> annoying<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.260> greens

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
know it's kind of annoying on the greens

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.900 
know it's kind of annoying on the greens
because<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.860> can<00:03:06.010> feel<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.370> when<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:06.610> hate<00:03:06.730> it

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
because you can feel it when you hate it

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.940 
because you can feel it when you hate it
they<00:03:07.060> bump<00:03:07.330> when<00:03:07.690> they<00:03:07.870> roll<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.830> know

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
they bump when they roll but you know

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.500 
they bump when they roll but you know
when<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.190> hit<00:03:09.340> them<00:03:09.460> off<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:10.060> greens<00:03:10.300> are

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
when you hit them off the greens are

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.130 
when you hit them off the greens are
very<00:03:10.720> true<00:03:11.080> um<00:03:12.060> they're<00:03:13.060> very<00:03:13.240> chewy<00:03:13.540> if

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
very true um they're very chewy if

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.710 
very true um they're very chewy if
they're<00:03:14.350> not<00:03:14.470> cut<00:03:14.850> overall<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.090> night<00:03:16.270> he<00:03:16.510> won

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
they're not cut overall the night he won

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.060 
they're not cut overall the night he won
vapor<00:03:16.990> speed<00:03:18.510> if<00:03:19.510> out<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.200> 5<00:03:20.410> stars<00:03:20.740> i<00:03:20.950> would

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
vapor speed if out of 5 stars i would

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.710 
vapor speed if out of 5 stars i would
have<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.190> give<00:03:21.490> it<00:03:21.580> may<00:03:21.670> be<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:22.240> a<00:03:22.390> two<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.660> a

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
have to give it may be like a two and a

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.200 
have to give it may be like a two and a
half<00:03:22.840> or<00:03:23.020> three<00:03:23.290> two<00:03:23.920> decent<00:03:24.370> ball<00:03:24.610> but<00:03:24.940> it's

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
half or three two decent ball but it's

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.990 
half or three two decent ball but it's
just<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:27.250> durability<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
just it's just the the durability of the

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.020 
just it's just the the durability of the
cover<00:03:28.240> is<00:03:28.420> not<00:03:28.600> too<00:03:28.780> great<00:03:28.990> but<00:03:29.260> uh<00:03:30.070> I'd<00:03:31.000> say

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
cover is not too great but uh I'd say

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.600 
cover is not too great but uh I'd say
definitely<00:03:31.570> go<00:03:32.470> for<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.710> one<00:03:32.830> vapors<00:03:33.310> rather

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
definitely go for the one vapors rather

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.030 
definitely go for the one vapors rather
than<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.910> vapor<00:03:34.120> speeds<00:03:34.480> because<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:35.800> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
than the vapor speeds because it the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.590 
than the vapor speeds because it the
vapor<00:03:36.220> speeds<00:03:36.580> are<00:03:36.730> pretty<00:03:36.910> much<00:03:37.030> paying<00:03:37.360> for

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
vapor speeds are pretty much paying for

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.390 
vapor speeds are pretty much paying for
a<00:03:37.630> dumber<00:03:37.930> version<00:03:38.410> for<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.590> same<00:03:38.860> price<00:03:39.040> it's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
a dumber version for the same price it's

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.730 
a dumber version for the same price it's
the<00:03:39.490> same<00:03:39.700> price<00:03:39.970> as<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.240> vapor<00:03:40.450> but<00:03:41.290> only<00:03:41.560> like

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
the same price as a vapor but only like

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.150 
the same price as a vapor but only like
you<00:03:42.400> know<00:03:42.520> a<00:03:42.790> little<00:03:43.510> little<00:03:44.140> worse<00:03:44.320> so

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
you know a little little worse so

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.600 
you know a little little worse so
definitely<00:03:46.090> go<00:03:46.390> for<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:47.140> one<00:03:47.860> vapors<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
definitely go for the one vapors the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.790 
definitely go for the one vapors the
regular<00:03:48.910> ones<00:03:49.120> because<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.510> easy<00:03:49.660> no<00:03:49.930> they're

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
regular ones because the easy no they're
