00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.200
 I can hold the pleasing 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.820
 message make yes that the 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.860
 timmelsjoch high alpine road after 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.960
 seven-month break so winter break 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.690
 yes, almost for the traffic 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.640
 has been released, we are happy 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.500
 very much so that it was still possible in may 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.220
 is that maybe the five 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.870
 months until the World Cup opening then 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.690
 can pull through 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.339
 and should it leave the weather 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.110
 then it will surely be the next 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.110
 stay open for five months 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.120
 yes you can say about a month 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.920
 Milling year more in our case on the 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.159
 Austrian side with three mills 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.170
 yes and four employees the italians 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.490
 have almost the same effort 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.180
 they even have something earlier 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.850
 So you can already see that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.850
 that some things happen 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.650
 just as high alpine road is almost a 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.730
 So bass transition from north to north 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.320
 south a relatively faster and that too 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.800
 the highest of the eastern Alps so over 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.710
 2500 meters you drive here about 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.540
 beautiful way to meran yes if you 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.120
 the difference here is the peace 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.310
 snow walls and you know 20 kilometers 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.240
 are already grown apples and wine 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:06.640
 So that's what connects something 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.640
 colder oden with the warm south 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.280
 yes to the construction of the devils high street would be too 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.210
 So say that was initiated 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.060
 formerly of the quasi here pioneers a 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.970
 away to Italy to the south 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.200
 to find it was in the 50s end 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.650
 the 15 years finished and there 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.630
 you could drive to the bass the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.040
 cross-border traffic goods only 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.760
 1968 possible and since then drive up 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.660
 all travel here until after meran 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.170
 and then, as it were, the South Tyrol 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.170
 enjoy
