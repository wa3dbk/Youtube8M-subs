00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
level properly what I bet Lino's why

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.280 
level properly what I bet Lino's why
it's<00:02:09.190> boom<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.670> didn't<00:02:09.880> touch<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.269> but<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.050> still

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
it's boom I didn't touch it but it still

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.840 
it's boom I didn't touch it but it still
happened<00:02:11.590> because<00:02:11.709> L<00:02:12.040> would<00:02:12.190> be<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:12.519> change

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
happened because L would be to change

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.170 
happened because L would be to change
the<00:02:13.030> physics<00:02:13.390> very<00:02:14.130> slightly<00:02:15.130> slightly<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the physics very slightly slightly and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.360 
the physics very slightly slightly and
which<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.840> why<00:02:17.019> we're<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.440> narrowing<00:02:18.160> Li

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
which is why we're like narrowing Li

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.570 
which is why we're like narrowing Li
like<00:02:18.670> making<00:02:19.269> some<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.600> these<00:02:19.830> yeah<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.070> but

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
like making some of these yeah and but

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.250 
like making some of these yeah and but
if<00:02:21.670> we<00:02:21.790> went<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.390> played<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> first<00:02:23.080> game

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
if we went and played in the first game

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.920 
if we went and played in the first game
it<00:02:23.410> would<00:02:23.470> work<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:24.239> don't<00:02:25.239> like<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.570> don't<00:02:25.600> know
