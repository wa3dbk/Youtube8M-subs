down the big piece of dough we go round

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.170 
down the big piece of dough we go round
one<00:03:04.079> like<00:03:05.079> our<00:03:05.290> three<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.980> then<00:03:06.549> move<00:03:06.819> it<00:03:06.969> into

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
one like our three and then move it into

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.059 
one like our three and then move it into
your<00:03:07.450> tray<00:03:07.780> and<00:03:08.079> just<00:03:08.950> spread<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.489> all<00:03:09.849> over

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
just make sure all the thickness around

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:21.839 
just make sure all the thickness around
the<00:03:15.189> tree<00:03:15.519> is<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.480> same<00:03:19.949> just<00:03:20.949> spread<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.310> well

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
the tree is the same just spread it well

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:35.530 
the tree is the same just spread it well
with<00:03:22.810> your<00:03:22.989> hand<00:03:23.290> around<00:03:24.129> your<00:03:24.430> tree

and then heat several three times with
their<00:03:38.299> fork<00:03:38.689> and<00:03:40.359> then<00:03:41.359> we<00:03:41.480> can<00:03:41.689> put<00:03:41.989> our

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
their fork and then we can put our

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.160

but it's entirely up to you all around

00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:00.520 
but it's entirely up to you all around
the<00:03:51.319> base<00:03:57.159> perfect<00:03:58.480> this<00:03:59.480> point<00:03:59.780> we<00:04:00.079> can<00:04:00.260> start

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
the base perfect this point we can start

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:12.640 
the base perfect this point we can start
to<00:04:00.709> do<00:04:00.890> our<00:04:01.510> stripes<00:04:09.879> we<00:04:10.879> doing<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.599> few<00:04:12.019> stripes

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
to do our stripes we doing a few stripes

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:20.199 
to do our stripes we doing a few stripes
long<00:04:13.549> as<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.870> tree<00:04:15.139> like<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.739> space<00:04:18.699> and<00:04:19.699> then

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
long as the tree like a space and then

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.550 
long as the tree like a space and then
put<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.690> on<00:04:20.810> top<00:04:22.330> vertical<00:04:23.330> stripes<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.110> then

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
put it on top vertical stripes and then

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:36.620 
put it on top vertical stripes and then
horizontal<00:04:25.430> stripes

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.090 

we're<00:04:37.630> going<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.960> make<00:04:38.169> like<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.889> net<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:41.830> this

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
we're going to make like a net like this

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.790
