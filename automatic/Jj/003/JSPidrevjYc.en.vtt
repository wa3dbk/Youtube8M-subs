00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
notes about what this is basically you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
notes about what this is basically you
know<00:01:10.020> research<00:01:10.680> has<00:01:10.710> shown<00:01:11.100> without<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.369> shadow

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
know research has shown without a shadow

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.190 
know research has shown without a shadow
of<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.060> doubt<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:12.750> you're<00:01:12.960> under

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
of a doubt that when you're under

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.130 
of a doubt that when you're under
extreme<00:01:13.799> stress<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> tension<00:01:15.150> there's<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
extreme stress and tension there's a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.100 
extreme stress and tension there's a
special<00:01:16.799> type<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> cell<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:18.000> actually

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
special type of cell that actually

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.480 
special type of cell that actually
attaches<00:01:19.110> itself<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> muscle<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
attaches itself to the muscle and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.990 
attaches itself to the muscle and
donates<00:01:21.330> nuclei<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.759> you're

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
donates nuclei all right when you're

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
donates nuclei all right when you're
doing<00:01:24.479> extreme<00:01:24.960> exercise<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.740> workouts<00:01:26.070> I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
doing extreme exercise and workouts I

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.179 
doing extreme exercise and workouts I
can<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.490> my<00:01:26.610> 40<00:01:27.409> right<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.619> ascends<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
can in my 40 right what ascends here

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.170 
can in my 40 right what ascends here
there's<00:01:29.460> specific<00:01:30.060> type<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> cells<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.650> will

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
there's specific type of cells that will

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.300 
there's specific type of cells that will
donate<00:01:33.180> nuclei<00:01:33.689> this<00:01:34.409> literally<00:01:34.799> increases

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
donate nuclei this literally increases

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.460 
donate nuclei this literally increases
the<00:01:35.430> number<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.850> nuclei<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> cells

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
the number of nuclei of the cells

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.929 
the number of nuclei of the cells
therefore<00:01:37.470> allowing<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> muscles<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
therefore allowing the muscles to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.539 
therefore allowing the muscles to
recover<00:01:39.090> faster<00:01:39.990> by<00:01:40.439> synthesizing<00:01:41.040> more

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
recover faster by synthesizing more

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.090 
recover faster by synthesizing more
protein<00:01:42.090> at<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:42.720> time<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.619> means<00:01:43.920> you're

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
protein at one time this means you're

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
protein at one time this means you're
able<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> recover<00:01:44.549> faster<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:45.840> when<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
able to recover faster we know when you

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.050 
able to recover faster we know when you
recover<00:01:46.380> faster<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.490> build<00:01:47.820> muscle

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
recover faster you can build muscle

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.690 
recover faster you can build muscle
faster<00:01:48.810> those<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> two<00:01:50.070> things<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.460> we

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
faster those are the two things that we

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.859 
faster those are the two things that we
want<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.360> able<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.600> recover

want we want to be able to recover
faster<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.799> end<00:01:53.009> result<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.460> build<00:01:53.729> muscle

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
faster the end result is to build muscle

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
faster the end result is to build muscle
without<00:01:54.540> all<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> extra<00:01:55.020> fat<00:01:55.500> bimple

i've spent the past hour reviewing the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.760 
i've spent the past hour reviewing the
behind<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> scenes<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.439> actual

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
behind the scenes what the actual

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.429 
behind the scenes what the actual
product<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.759> i<00:02:03.180> mean<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.990> guy<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.200> on

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
product is and i mean the guy is on

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.770 
product is and i mean the guy is on
another<00:02:04.680> level<00:02:04.820> he<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.969> out<00:02:06.210> there<00:02:06.540> when<00:02:06.689> it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
another level he is out there when it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.119 
another level he is out there when it
comes<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.049> his<00:02:07.140> knowledge<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.890> want<00:02:08.069> to
