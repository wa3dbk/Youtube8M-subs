00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.590 
important here is that we have three
game<00:02:30.720> endings<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:32.070> there's<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.610> few<00:02:32.880> dozens<00:02:33.330> of

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
game endings but there's a few dozens of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.660 
game endings but there's a few dozens of
states<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.620> world<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:36.209> will<00:02:36.480> basically

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
states of the world that will basically

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.430 
states of the world that will basically
be<00:02:38.670> derived<00:02:39.060> from<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.570> decisions<00:02:40.050> taken<00:02:40.410> by

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
be derived from the decisions taken by

be derived from the decisions taken by
the<00:02:40.590> player<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.880> know<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.810> usually

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the player and you know it's usually

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.790 
the player and you know it's usually
gonna<00:02:44.489> be<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> simple<00:02:45.180> choice<00:02:45.360> between<00:02:45.800> you

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
gonna be a simple choice between you

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.490 
gonna be a simple choice between you
know<00:02:46.920> white<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.610> black<00:02:48.380> unfortunately<00:02:49.380> it's

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
know white and black unfortunately it's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.320 
know white and black unfortunately it's
not<00:02:49.560> how<00:02:49.770> things<00:02:50.040> were<00:02:50.280> working<00:02:51.180> through

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
not how things were working through

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.590 
not how things were working through
which<00:02:51.510> our<00:02:51.690> union<00:02:51.989> first<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:53.760> certain

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
which our union first so certain

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.960 
which our union first so certain
decisions<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.470> place<00:02:55.680> will<00:02:55.950> take<00:02:55.980> will<00:02:56.790> have

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
decisions the place will take will have

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.360 
decisions the place will take will have
certain<00:02:57.600> consequences<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:59.160> will

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
certain consequences and we will

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.130 
certain consequences and we will
basically<00:02:59.910> at<00:03:00.150> some<00:03:00.360> point<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> game<00:03:00.930> we

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
basically at some point in the game we

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.140 
basically at some point in the game we
will<00:03:01.290> show<00:03:01.500> players<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.160> its<00:03:02.250> consequences<00:03:02.940> so

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
will show players to its consequences so

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.300 
will show players to its consequences so
you'll<00:03:03.360> be<00:03:03.570> able<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.900> see<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.290> oh<00:03:04.440> nothing

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
you'll be able to see that oh nothing

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.060 
you'll be able to see that oh nothing
that<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.489> did<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.940> let's<00:03:06.690> do<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.860> think

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
that I did you let's do this and I think

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.350 
that I did you let's do this and I think
it's<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.310> really<00:03:08.580> interesting<00:03:08.790> feature<00:03:09.120> of

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
it's a really interesting feature of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.400 
it's a really interesting feature of
this<00:03:09.420> game<00:03:11.239> whilst<00:03:12.239> watching<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.959> demo<00:03:13.140> of

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
this game whilst watching the demo of

this game whilst watching the demo of
The<00:03:13.560> Witcher<00:03:13.890> when<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> menu<00:03:14.610> popped<00:03:15.000> up<00:03:15.180> to

The Witcher when the menu popped up to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.780 
The Witcher when the menu popped up to
me<00:03:15.660> if<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.500> first<00:03:16.830> look<00:03:17.040> at<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.489> used<00:03:17.670> a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
me if you first look at it it's used a

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.000 
me if you first look at it it's used a
bit<00:03:17.910> complex<00:03:18.360> we've<00:03:19.080> learned<00:03:19.350> our<00:03:19.530> lessons

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
bit complex we've learned our lessons

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.199 
bit complex we've learned our lessons
from<00:03:20.130> Witcher<00:03:20.519> 2<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.780> we<00:03:22.769> know<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:23.370> think<00:03:23.940> we

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
from Witcher 2 and we know I think we

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.500 
from Witcher 2 and we know I think we
know<00:03:24.330> we<00:03:24.540> got<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:25.100> when<00:03:26.100> when<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.549> in<00:03:27.150> terms<00:03:27.330> of

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
know we got it when when it in terms of

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.630 
know we got it when when it in terms of
the<00:03:27.690> UI<00:03:27.930> how<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.380> want<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.799> make<00:03:28.920> it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
the UI how we want to make it

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.509 
the UI how we want to make it
alchemy<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.660> crafting<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.980> that's<00:03:32.400> a

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
alchemy and crafting that that's a

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.310 
alchemy and crafting that that's a
really<00:03:33.150> important<00:03:33.510> part<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.930> game<00:03:34.080> it's

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
really important part of the game it's

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.470 
really important part of the game it's
one<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.920> fundaments<00:03:35.610> of<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.850> RPG<00:03:36.120> layer

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
one of the fundaments of the RPG layer

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.720 
one of the fundaments of the RPG layer
and<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.709> really<00:03:38.130> important<00:03:38.459> from<00:03:38.580> our

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
and this is really important from our

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.060 
and this is really important from our
perspective<00:03:39.450> because<00:03:40.380> we<00:03:40.620> are<00:03:40.799> making<00:03:41.030> an<00:03:42.030> RPG

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
perspective because we are making an RPG

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.590 
perspective because we are making an RPG
panels<00:03:44.070> are<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.670> think<00:03:45.000> right<00:03:45.360> now<00:03:45.390> we're

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
panels are I think right now we're

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.280 
panels are I think right now we're
really<00:03:45.810> intuitive<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.290> it's

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
really intuitive and and it's a it's

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.780 
really intuitive and and it's a it's
also<00:03:49.440> important<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.040> we<00:03:50.190> will<00:03:50.519> teach

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
also important that we will teach

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.930 
also important that we will teach
players<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:52.410> use<00:03:52.590> their<00:03:52.830> gradual<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.610> will

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
players to use their gradual and will

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.750 
players to use their gradual and will
make<00:03:54.090> them<00:03:54.239> understand<00:03:55.250> what<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.400> means<00:03:56.579> to

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
make them understand what it means to

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.640 
make them understand what it means to
crack<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.360> quotients<00:03:57.840> potion

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650

what kind of potions you have because

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.509 
what kind of potions you have because
there's<00:04:00.989> two<00:04:01.140> types<00:04:01.350> of<00:04:01.500> potions<00:04:01.950> are<00:04:02.160> the

ones that you can take the

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.440 
ones that you can take the
or<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.770> combatant<00:04:06.280> must<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.550> can<00:04:06.670> use<00:04:06.849> during

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
the combat will explain the toxicity

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.780 
the combat will explain the toxicity
level<00:04:10.660> how<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:10.989> works<00:04:11.290> is<00:04:11.830> something<00:04:12.459> in<00:04:12.610> to

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
level how it works is something in to

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.870 
level how it works is something in to
watch<00:04:12.970> for<00:04:13.920> but<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.069> know<00:04:15.220> it's<00:04:15.730> going<00:04:15.819> to

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
watch for but you know it's going to

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.300 
watch for but you know it's going to
happen<00:04:16.000> step<00:04:16.359> by<00:04:16.510> step<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.070> think

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
happen step by step and and I think

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.350 
happen step by step and and I think
degrees<00:04:19.299> cooler<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:21.820> world<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.210> The<00:04:22.330> Witcher

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
degrees cooler the world of The Witcher

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.460 
degrees cooler the world of The Witcher
is<00:04:22.690> much<00:04:23.020> more<00:04:23.889> mature<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.970> that<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.389> choice<00:04:25.780> yes

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
is much more mature is that a choice yes

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.680 
is much more mature is that a choice yes
absolutely<00:04:27.040> this<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.460> my<00:04:27.610> choice<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:28.090> mean<00:04:28.210> we

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
absolutely this is my choice I mean we

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.200 
absolutely this is my choice I mean we
are<00:04:28.810> making<00:04:29.080> amateur<00:04:29.889> rated<00:04:30.460> game<00:04:30.700> right<00:04:30.970> it's
