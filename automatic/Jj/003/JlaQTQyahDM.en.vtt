welcome back to 4 cycle fat loss for you
today<00:00:06.569> I'm<00:00:07.170> gonna<00:00:07.319> uncover<00:00:07.620> three<00:00:08.040> metabolic

today I'm gonna uncover three metabolic
triggers<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.510> block<00:00:09.929> your<00:00:10.559> fat<00:00:10.830> loss<00:00:11.040> then<00:00:11.639> I

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
triggers that block your fat loss then I

days<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:16.090> being<00:03:16.150> down<00:03:16.540> here<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.019> can<00:03:17.170> suppress

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
days of being down here you can suppress

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.830 
days of being down here you can suppress
leptin<00:03:18.160> levels<00:03:18.489> by<00:03:18.610> up<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.850> 50%

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
leptin levels by up to 50%

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.170 
leptin levels by up to 50%
so<00:03:20.200> going<00:03:20.440> low-carb<00:03:21.180> dramatically

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
so going low-carb dramatically

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.790 
so going low-carb dramatically
suppresses<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:22.900> drops<00:03:23.110> your<00:03:23.320> fat<00:03:23.500> burning

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
suppresses and drops your fat burning

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.890 
suppresses and drops your fat burning
hormones<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.370> actually<00:03:24.670> can<00:03:24.820> block<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.660> fat

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
hormones and actually can block the fat

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.190 
hormones and actually can block the fat
loss<00:03:26.110> process<00:03:26.739> but<00:03:27.430> if<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.360> learn<00:03:28.600> how<00:03:29.170> to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
loss process but if you can learn how to

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.350 
loss process but if you can learn how to
manipulate<00:03:29.650> your<00:03:30.130> glycogen<00:03:30.430> levels<00:03:30.730> the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
manipulate your glycogen levels the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.020 
manipulate your glycogen levels the
right<00:03:31.660> way<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.530> can<00:03:32.560> actually<00:03:32.980> master<00:03:33.850> your

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
right way you can actually master your

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.690 
right way you can actually master your
hormones<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.840> limit<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.830> control<00:03:36.220> your<00:03:36.459> fat

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
hormones and limit and control your fat

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.449 
hormones and limit and control your fat
spillover<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.050> how<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.830> do<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.100> with

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
spillover and this is how you do it with

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.789 
spillover and this is how you do it with
something<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.850> we<00:03:40.120> call<00:03:40.360> macro<00:03:41.080> patterning

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
something that we call macro patterning

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.800 
something that we call macro patterning
and<00:03:41.920> with<00:03:42.070> macro<00:03:42.489> patterning<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.390> basically

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
and with macro patterning you basically

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.320 
and with macro patterning you basically
cycle<00:03:44.410> your<00:03:44.560> carbs<00:03:44.950> in<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.280> way<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.060> you

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
cycle your carbs in a way so that you

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.690 
cycle your carbs in a way so that you
live<00:03:46.540> life<00:03:46.810> right<00:03:47.530> inside<00:03:48.100> here<00:03:48.459> in<00:03:48.580> your

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
live life right inside here in your

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.670 
live life right inside here in your
storage<00:03:49.090> tank<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.660> never<00:03:49.959> cross<00:03:50.380> this

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
storage tank and you never cross this

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.100 
storage tank and you never cross this
line<00:03:50.950> of<00:03:51.160> fat<00:03:51.400> spillover<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> couple

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
line of fat spillover and then a couple

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.100 
line of fat spillover and then a couple
times<00:03:53.560> of<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.459> week<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:55.299> come<00:03:55.600> down<00:03:55.810> here

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
times of the week you come down here

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.990 
times of the week you come down here
over<00:03:56.260> here<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.070> bring<00:03:57.310> your<00:03:57.430> body<00:03:57.760> over

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
over here and you bring your body over

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.810 
over here and you bring your body over
here<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.420> burn<00:03:58.570> a<00:03:58.750> massive<00:03:59.320> amount<00:03:59.739> of<00:04:00.010> fat<00:04:00.310> now

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
here to burn a massive amount of fat now

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.690 
here to burn a massive amount of fat now
this<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.330> how<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:02.170> can<00:04:02.380> enjoy<00:04:02.530> carbs<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.459> all

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
this is how you can enjoy carbs and all

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.729 
this is how you can enjoy carbs and all
your<00:04:03.850> favorite<00:04:04.209> cheap<00:04:04.450> foods<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:04.959> still<00:04:05.500> be<00:04:05.709> a

your favorite cheap foods and still be a

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.330 
your favorite cheap foods and still be a
super<00:04:06.340> fat<00:04:06.610> burner<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.530> what<00:04:08.530> happens<00:04:08.950> is<00:04:09.070> you

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
super fat burner and what happens is you

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.490 
super fat burner and what happens is you
end<00:04:09.489> up<00:04:09.760> controlling<00:04:10.299> all<00:04:10.870> three<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.410> these

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
end up controlling all three of these

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.140 
end up controlling all three of these
metabolic<00:04:11.830> triggers<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.549> block<00:04:12.760> your<00:04:12.940> fat

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
metabolic triggers that block your fat

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.699 
metabolic triggers that block your fat
loss<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.600> now<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.810> manipulating<00:04:14.440> these<00:04:14.500> by

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
loss so now you manipulating these by

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.770 
loss so now you manipulating these by
Kajin<00:04:15.040> levels<00:04:15.340> which<00:04:15.790> will<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.090> turn<00:04:16.120> limit

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
Kajin levels which will in turn limit

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.960 
Kajin levels which will in turn limit
and<00:04:16.989> control<00:04:17.290> your<00:04:17.410> fat<00:04:17.620> spillover<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.280> it

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
and control your fat spillover and it

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.570 
and control your fat spillover and it
will<00:04:19.150> allow<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:19.539> to<00:04:20.020> master<00:04:20.859> your<00:04:21.310> fat

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
will allow you to master your fat

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.430 
will allow you to master your fat
burning<00:04:21.880> hormones
