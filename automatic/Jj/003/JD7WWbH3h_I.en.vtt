00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.370
 hi to all this happening in quarters where the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.320
 math and guitar teacher for 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.060
 count them to four reasons that you 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:33.690
 will make it possible to work the speed of 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:35.640
 your left then the first 3 a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:45.300
 accent right hands followed by two 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:46.410
 flops with our gypsy 3rd 3 2 3 and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.450
 for the exercise to be a little bit 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.460
 more interesting we can divide its 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.290
 right hands accentuated on the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.290
 men for example 3 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.110
 in a pinch on the cymbals with a 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.110
 bass drum 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.039
 I have a kir ap second reason have 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.219
 narrated 4 this time hand accents 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.750
 right on the one nothing on the two egos 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.810
 note on the 3 with the left hand 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.119
 does not know the 4 with the left hand 2 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:33.829
 3 4 2 3 4 so technically the sequence 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.360
 is the same as on the ground before and 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.020
 the count is not even paying attention to 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:54.140
 do not confuse them two three quarters 2 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:55.880
 3 dap and not you can replace 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.259
 the small fries that you would do on 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.530
 a classic rhythm with your hand 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.299
 left 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:14.720
 the simple kids our share of bumps 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:16.579
 our doubled for example third ground 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.100
 this time more difficult since 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.780
 will alternate a ghost notes with the hand 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.290
 left followed by an accent always with 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.780
 the left hand 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.139
 we will go up three on the 1 we give a 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.139
 hi-hat on the 2 we give a 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.150
 wrong note with our left hand and 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.579
 on the 3 we give both a shot of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:44.750
 accentuated left hand and a stroke of 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:47.950
 Charleston 2nd set easy to work 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.950
 that very slowly and there 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.709
 ok last exercise in four this time 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.930
 it's more complicated since we alternate 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.439
 this time left hand 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:16.319
 ghost notes left hand accent and my 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:20.879
 left ghost notes on the 1-1 shot of 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:24.379
 Charleston on the two kids note 2 on 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:29.030
 the 3 accent of my left and hock stoll 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.030
 and on the cac bush 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.790
