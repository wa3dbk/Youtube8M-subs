where<00:01:28.020> there's<00:01:28.259> no<00:01:28.470> text<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.650> as<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.400> see

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
where there's no text so as you can see

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.319

see<00:01:33.229> text<00:01:34.229> selection<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.619> become<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.329> lot

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
see text selection has become a lot

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.760 
see text selection has become a lot
easier<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:38.040> hand<00:01:38.280> use<00:01:38.549> case<00:01:39.680> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.749 

sadly<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> doesn't<00:01:44.070> work<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.640> all

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
sadly it doesn't work in all

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.120 
sadly it doesn't work in all
applications<00:01:44.909> because<00:01:45.560> they<00:01:46.560> would<00:01:46.950> actually

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
applications because they would actually

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.639 
applications because they would actually
have<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> provided<00:01:48.090> components<00:01:48.960> for

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
have to use the provided components for

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.389 
have to use the provided components for

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
i also see these two handlers popping up

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.190 
i also see these two handlers popping up
can<00:02:47.010> move<00:02:47.160> them<00:02:47.600> same<00:02:48.600> again<00:02:48.810> i<00:02:48.870> see<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200

can move them same again i see the
magnifier<00:02:49.650> here<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.390> text<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> bit

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
magnifier here the the text is a bit

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.130 
magnifier here the the text is a bit
smaller<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.610> notes<00:02:53.790> application<00:02:54.140> so

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
smaller then in the notes application so

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.200 
smaller then in the notes application so
it's<00:02:56.130> not<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.490> easy<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:57.210> get<00:02:57.960> this<00:02:58.650> accurately

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
it's not so easy to get this accurately

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.640 
it's not so easy to get this accurately
it<00:03:00.210> works<00:03:00.480> quite<00:03:00.840> well<00:03:00.900> if<00:03:01.170> i<00:03:01.230> want<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> select

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
it works quite well if i want to select

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.520 
it works quite well if i want to select
the<00:03:01.800> whole<00:03:01.950> paragraph<00:03:02.460> cell<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:04.320> if<00:03:04.380> i'm
