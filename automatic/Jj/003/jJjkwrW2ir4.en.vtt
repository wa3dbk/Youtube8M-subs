cameras now what a camera is is pretty
much<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.219> different<00:00:12.000> way<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.150> viewing<00:00:12.540> your

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
much a different way of viewing your

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.499 
much a different way of viewing your
composition<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:14.610> set<00:00:14.820> just<00:00:15.059> viewing<00:00:15.299> it

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
composition so I'm set just viewing it

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.630 
composition so I'm set just viewing it
straight<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:16.529> looking<00:00:16.890> directly<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.369> it

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
straight on me looking directly at it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.910 
straight on me looking directly at it
like<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> TV<00:00:18.119> you<00:00:18.900> can<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.170> your<00:00:19.320> camera<00:00:19.680> move

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
like a TV you can have your camera move

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.650 
like a TV you can have your camera move
around<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.609> view<00:00:20.730> from<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> different

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
around and view from all the different

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.170 
around and view from all the different
sorts<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.990> angles<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.500> distances<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.340> just

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
sorts of angles and distances and just

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.810 
sorts of angles and distances and just
like<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> regular<00:00:24.570> camera<00:00:25.460> one<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> main

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
like a regular camera one of the main

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700 
like a regular camera one of the main
things<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> closer<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.380> your

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
things is the closer you are to your

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
things is the closer you are to your
composition<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:30.029> bigger<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> appears<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
composition the bigger it appears in the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.780 
composition the bigger it appears in the
further<00:00:31.320> away<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.679> are<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.279> smaller<00:00:32.579> it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
further away you are the smaller it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.630 
further away you are the smaller it
appears<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.960> you'll<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.010> why<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> useful

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
appears so you'll see why this is useful

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420 
appears so you'll see why this is useful

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
just like you learned any other layer

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.420 
just like you learned any other layer
but<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.330> has<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> few<00:01:18.979> gotchas<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:21.799> anytime<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.609 
that the composition increases in size
but<00:01:51.420> let's<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.750> ahead<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.079> take<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> look<00:01:52.439> down

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
but let's go ahead and take a look down

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.160 
but let's go ahead and take a look down
at<00:01:52.920> our<00:01:52.950> composition<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
at our composition right here and the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.969 
at our composition right here and the
size<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.670> same<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.869> happened<00:01:58.380> if

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
size is all the same so what happened if

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.639 
size is all the same so what happened if
you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.340> see<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.640> here<00:02:00.290> here's<00:02:01.290> my<00:02:01.350> little

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
you can see out here here's my little

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.069 
you can see out here here's my little
camera<00:02:01.979> right<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.610> instead<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.780> just

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
camera right here instead of just

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.139 
camera right here instead of just
increasing<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.799> size<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.369> give<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
increasing the size you just give the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.080 
increasing the size you just give the
appearance<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.229> increased<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.770> size<00:02:08.090> so

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
appearance that it increased in size so

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.170 
appearance that it increased in size so
let's<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:09.899> ahead<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:11.340> brings<00:02:11.640> me<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
let's go ahead and this brings me to the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.110 
let's go ahead and this brings me to the
point<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.629> any

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
point that any

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.149 
point that any
time<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.720> don't<00:02:14.230> know<00:02:14.379> what<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.709> was<00:02:14.799> it<00:02:15.040> before

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
time I don't know what it was it before

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.390 
time I don't know what it was it before
35<00:02:15.819> maybe<00:02:16.090> good<00:02:16.750> enough

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
35 maybe good enough

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.460 
35 maybe good enough
anytime<00:02:18.400> your<00:02:19.120> camera<00:02:19.540> increases<00:02:20.230> or

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
anytime your camera increases or

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.280 
anytime your camera increases or
decreases<00:02:20.739> in<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:22.390> little<00:02:22.629> preset<00:02:23.049> right

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
decreases in this little preset right

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.680 
decreases in this little preset right
here<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.739> decrease<00:02:24.610> means<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.239> see<00:02:25.420> more

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
here a decrease means you can see more

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.899 
here a decrease means you can see more
of<00:02:25.750> your<00:02:26.049> composition<00:02:26.590> an<00:02:26.769> increase<00:02:27.519> in<00:02:27.700> size

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
of your composition an increase in size

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.280 
of your composition an increase in size
means<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.420> can<00:02:28.569> see<00:02:28.780> less<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.019> your

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
means you can see less of your

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.339 
means you can see less of your
composition<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.909> is<00:02:31.180> irrelevant<00:02:31.810> for

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
composition but that is irrelevant for

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.830 
composition but that is irrelevant for
now<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.769> just<00:02:32.950> wanted<00:02:33.159> to<00:02:33.250> show<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.430> guys<00:02:33.840> what

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
now I just wanted to show you guys what

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.589 
now I just wanted to show you guys what
that<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.920> pretty<00:02:36.190> much<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:37.480> you're

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
that is so pretty much what you're

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.630 
that is so pretty much what you're
seeing<00:02:37.900> isn't<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.980> size<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.519> your

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
seeing isn't it the size of your

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.759 
seeing isn't it the size of your
composition<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:40.569> your<00:02:41.019> perspective

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
composition it's just your perspective

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.759 
composition it's just your perspective
of<00:02:42.010> how<00:02:42.250> big<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.819> is<00:02:43.390> based<00:02:43.720> on<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.110> angle<00:02:44.590> of

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
of how big it is based on the angle of

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.800 
of how big it is based on the angle of
the<00:02:44.920> camera<00:02:45.129> that<00:02:45.940> makes<00:02:46.120> any<00:02:46.299> sense<00:02:46.390> at<00:02:46.690> all

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
the camera that makes any sense at all

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.339 
the camera that makes any sense at all
if<00:02:47.109> it<00:02:47.319> doesn't<00:02:47.680> oh<00:02:47.829> well<00:02:48.750> another<00:02:49.750> thing<00:02:49.870> I

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
if it doesn't oh well another thing I

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.270 
if it doesn't oh well another thing I
want<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.590> take<00:02:50.739> note<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:50.980> is<00:02:52.079> aside<00:02:53.079> from<00:02:53.440> when

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
want to take note of is aside from when

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.339 
want to take note of is aside from when
we<00:02:54.430> started<00:02:54.459> when<00:02:55.299> you<00:02:55.329> start<00:02:55.629> editing<00:02:55.930> angles

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
we started when you start editing angles

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.770 
we started when you start editing angles
and<00:02:56.500> all<00:02:56.590> stuff<00:02:56.769> like<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:57.239> aside<00:02:58.239> from<00:02:58.510> all

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
and all stuff like that aside from all

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.280 
and all stuff like that aside from all
these<00:02:58.930> basic<00:03:00.120> what<00:03:01.120> they<00:03:01.269> call<00:03:01.480> preset<00:03:01.989> views

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
these basic what they call preset views

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.610 
these basic what they call preset views
you<00:03:02.950> have<00:03:02.980> your<00:03:03.430> custom<00:03:03.909> camera<00:03:04.180> views<00:03:04.540> too<00:03:04.810> so

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
you have your custom camera views too so

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.220 
you have your custom camera views too so
ours<00:03:06.099> is<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> same<00:03:06.670> right<00:03:06.940> now<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.480> whenever

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
ours is the same right now but whenever

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.050 
ours is the same right now but whenever
you<00:03:08.470> start<00:03:08.709> adding<00:03:08.859> in<00:03:09.069> weird<00:03:09.310> angles<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.879> can

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
you start adding in weird angles you can

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.479 
you start adding in weird angles you can
also<00:03:10.239> view<00:03:10.629> it<00:03:10.750> from<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> camp<00:03:11.349> cameras<00:03:12.159> you

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
also view it from the camp cameras you

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.569 
also view it from the camp cameras you
made<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.510> that's<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.109> neat<00:03:14.349> little<00:03:14.500> thing<00:03:15.430> to

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
made so that's a neat little thing to

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.280 
made so that's a neat little thing to
take<00:03:15.730> note<00:03:16.239> of<00:03:16.269> if<00:03:16.659> you<00:03:16.930> want<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.169> make<00:03:17.260> a

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
take note of if you want to make a

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.199 
take note of if you want to make a
camera<00:03:17.739> just<00:03:18.040> for<00:03:18.190> viewing<00:03:18.430> angles<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.090> can

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
camera just for viewing angles you can

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.330 
camera just for viewing angles you can
do<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.540> as<00:03:19.690> well

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
do that as well

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.030 
do that as well
so<00:03:21.389> now<00:03:22.389> let's<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.139> something<00:03:23.349> half<00:03:23.859> way

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
so now let's get to something half way

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.120 
so now let's get to something half way
useful<00:03:24.750> in<00:03:25.750> when<00:03:26.560> you're<00:03:26.709> making<00:03:26.980> like

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
useful in when you're making like

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.089 
useful in when you're making like
professional<00:03:27.700> film<00:03:27.940> films<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.019> stuff<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.470> real

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
professional film films and stuff a real

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.240 
professional film films and stuff a real
camera<00:03:30.480> has<00:03:31.480> different<00:03:32.319> stuff<00:03:32.560> have

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
camera has different stuff have

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.220 
camera has different stuff have
different<00:03:33.700> amounts<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.150> blur<00:03:34.419> depending<00:03:35.019> on

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
different amounts of blur depending on

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.159 
different amounts of blur depending on
if<00:03:35.349> it's<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:35.680> focus<00:03:36.129> or<00:03:36.370> not<00:03:36.609> now<00:03:37.569> in<00:03:37.840> After

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
if it's in focus or not now in After

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.659 
if it's in focus or not now in After
Effects<00:03:38.410> you<00:03:38.500> don't<00:03:38.739> have<00:03:38.889> to<00:03:39.040> do<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.400> and

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
Effects you don't have to do this and

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.610 
Effects you don't have to do this and
everything<00:03:40.269> can<00:03:40.629> just<00:03:40.660> be<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:40.959> perfect<00:03:41.470> focus

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
everything can just be in perfect focus

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.830 
everything can just be in perfect focus
but<00:03:42.549> if<00:03:42.639> you<00:03:42.730> want<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.000> make<00:03:43.120> your<00:03:43.209> animations

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
but if you want to make your animations

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.610 
but if you want to make your animations
look<00:03:44.019> more<00:03:44.290> natural<00:03:44.799> you<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.489> do<00:03:45.879> this<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:47.410> go

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
depth of field and what this is gonna do

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.099 
depth of field and what this is gonna do
is<00:03:55.269> allow<00:03:56.139> things<00:03:56.519> that<00:03:57.519> are<00:03:57.730> in<00:03:57.940> focus<00:03:58.449> to<00:03:58.959> be

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
clear and how to focus to be blurry just

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.539 
clear and how to focus to be blurry just
like<00:04:01.449> you<00:04:02.019> would<00:04:02.199> on<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.440> real<00:04:02.739> life<00:04:02.919> camcorder

like you would on a real life camcorder

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.050 
like you would on a real life camcorder
now<00:04:04.199> what<00:04:05.199> this<00:04:05.319> is<00:04:05.590> is<00:04:05.889> the<00:04:06.370> focus<00:04:06.790> distance

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
now what this is is the focus distance

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.839 
now what this is is the focus distance
right<00:04:07.780> here<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.260> when<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.190> focus<00:04:09.459> distance

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
right here and when the focus distance

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.960 
right here and when the focus distance
this<00:04:10.660> is<00:04:10.720> pretty<00:04:11.049> much<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.500> distance<00:04:12.010> where

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
this is pretty much the distance where

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.960 
this is pretty much the distance where
an<00:04:13.569> object<00:04:13.989> has<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.620> be<00:04:14.829> for<00:04:15.459> it<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.639> be<00:04:15.790> in

go ahead and subtract a little bit from
this<00:05:02.610> blurry<00:05:02.880> level<00:05:03.330> but<00:05:03.810> this<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.110> pretty

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
this blurry level but this is pretty

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.350 
this blurry level but this is pretty
much<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.740> preset<00:05:05.250> or<00:05:05.490> if<00:05:06.120> you're<00:05:06.330> thinking

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
much the preset or if you're thinking

much the preset or if you're thinking
alright<00:05:07.080> these<00:05:07.290> things<00:05:07.530> aren't<00:05:07.800> blurry

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
alright these things aren't blurry

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.190 
alright these things aren't blurry
enough<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.940> things<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.450> out<00:05:09.660> focus<00:05:10.080> I'm

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
enough the things that out focus I'm

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.570 
enough the things that out focus I'm
talking<00:05:10.530> about<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:11.070> can<00:05:11.190> go<00:05:11.280> ahead<00:05:11.370> and

talking about you can go ahead and

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.460 
talking about you can go ahead and
increase<00:05:11.880> that<00:05:11.910> but<00:05:12.840> enough<00:05:13.170> of<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.350> small

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
talk let's get to work

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.580 
talk let's get to work
so<00:05:15.990> now<00:05:16.260> we<00:05:16.710> have<00:05:16.950> our<00:05:17.280> camera<00:05:17.790> right<00:05:18.030> here<00:05:18.390> and

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
so now we have our camera right here and

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.920 
so now we have our camera right here and
we<00:05:19.590> can<00:05:19.740> move<00:05:19.860> it<00:05:20.010> around<00:05:20.070> with<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.520> x<00:05:20.730> y&amp;z<00:05:21.690> and

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
we can move it around with the x y&amp;z and

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.180 
we can move it around with the x y&amp;z and
this<00:05:22.800> is<00:05:23.160> our<00:05:23.750> object<00:05:24.750> or<00:05:25.350> composition<00:05:25.980> right

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
this is our object or composition right

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.270 
this is our object or composition right
here<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:27.510> whenever<00:05:27.840> let's<00:05:28.740> go<00:05:28.860> ahead<00:05:28.950> and<00:05:29.190> work

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
here so whenever let's go ahead and work

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.940 
here so whenever let's go ahead and work
with<00:05:29.340> camera<00:05:29.790> settings<00:05:30.710> actually<00:05:31.710> it

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
with camera settings actually it

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.060 
with camera settings actually it
probably<00:05:32.240> well<00:05:33.240> that's<00:05:33.450> good<00:05:33.630> for<00:05:33.780> now<00:05:34.070> what

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
probably well that's good for now what

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.070 
probably well that's good for now what
we're<00:05:35.220> gonna<00:05:35.340> be<00:05:35.580> working<00:05:36.030> with<00:05:36.180> is<00:05:36.360> focus

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
we're gonna be working with is focus

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.860 
we're gonna be working with is focus
distance<00:05:37.550> parameter<00:05:38.550> right<00:05:38.730> here<00:05:38.970> so<00:05:39.600> again<00:05:39.720> I

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
distance parameter right here so again I

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.940 
distance parameter right here so again I
told<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.350> anything

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.570 
told you anything
that's<00:05:41.460> not<00:05:41.820> 1200<00:05:42.570> pixels<00:05:42.990> as<00:05:43.230> said<00:05:44.130> right

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
that's not 1200 pixels as said right

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.400 
that's not 1200 pixels as said right
here<00:05:44.850> focus<00:05:45.330> distance<00:05:45.570> is<00:05:45.900> gonna<00:05:46.110> be<00:05:46.230> out<00:05:46.380> of

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
here focus distance is gonna be out of

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.850 
here focus distance is gonna be out of
focus<00:05:46.650> so<00:05:47.550> this<00:05:47.760> is<00:05:47.970> exactly<00:05:48.540> 1200<00:05:49.410> pixels

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
focus so this is exactly 1200 pixels

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.310 
focus so this is exactly 1200 pixels
away<00:05:50.070> so<00:05:51.060> let<00:05:51.270> me<00:05:51.360> go<00:05:51.510> ahead<00:05:51.540> and<00:05:51.750> move<00:05:52.110> the

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
away so let me go ahead and move the

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.900 
away so let me go ahead and move the
focus<00:05:52.560> distance<00:05:53.150> closer<00:05:54.150> say<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:55.170> 900<00:05:56.100> as<00:05:56.310> you

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
focus distance closer say to 900 as you

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.000 
focus distance closer say to 900 as you
can<00:05:57.060> see<00:05:57.300> my<00:05:57.720> image<00:05:57.750> becomes<00:05:58.590> a<00:05:58.710> little<00:05:58.890> more

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
can see my image becomes a little more

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.890 
can see my image becomes a little more
blurry<00:05:59.430> actually<00:06:00.210> I'm<00:06:00.270> just<00:06:00.330> gonna<00:06:00.600> go<00:06:00.810> ahead

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
blurry actually I'm just gonna go ahead

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.560 
blurry actually I'm just gonna go ahead
and<00:06:01.020> change<00:06:01.290> it<00:06:01.410> to<00:06:01.470> 600<00:06:02.190> and<00:06:02.340> as<00:06:03.090> you<00:06:03.240> can<00:06:03.390> see

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
and change it to 600 and as you can see

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.300 
and change it to 600 and as you can see
my<00:06:03.750> image<00:06:03.930> it<00:06:04.260> gets<00:06:04.440> really<00:06:04.890> blurry<00:06:05.160> right

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
my image it gets really blurry right

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.880 
my image it gets really blurry right
here<00:06:05.790> and<00:06:05.970> again<00:06:06.780> if<00:06:06.990> I<00:06:07.140> move<00:06:07.380> this<00:06:07.530> to<00:06:07.590> like

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
here and again if I move this to like

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.140 
here and again if I move this to like
300<00:06:08.520> it<00:06:09.300> would<00:06:09.480> become<00:06:10.010> incredibly<00:06:11.010> blurry<00:06:11.250> so

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
300 it would become incredibly blurry so

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.150 
300 it would become incredibly blurry so
that's<00:06:12.390> what<00:06:12.570> this<00:06:12.810> little<00:06:13.050> bar<00:06:13.380> is<00:06:13.650> on<00:06:14.010> your

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
that's what this little bar is on your

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.670 
that's what this little bar is on your
camera<00:06:14.640> this<00:06:15.090> is<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.540> focus<00:06:15.960> distance<00:06:16.200> right

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
camera this is the focus distance right

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.830 
camera this is the focus distance right
here<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.160> as<00:06:17.250> you<00:06:17.370> can<00:06:17.400> see<00:06:17.700> my<00:06:18.270> image<00:06:18.480> is

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
here and as you can see my image is

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.750 
here and as you can see my image is
incredibly<00:06:19.410> blurry<00:06:19.770> right<00:06:20.100> here<00:06:20.550> that's

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
incredibly blurry right here that's

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.420 
incredibly blurry right here that's
because<00:06:21.120> this<00:06:21.720> camera<00:06:22.260> is<00:06:22.320> viewing<00:06:22.710> its<00:06:23.010> focus

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
because this camera is viewing its focus

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.240 
because this camera is viewing its focus
distance<00:06:23.640> at<00:06:23.970> 300<00:06:24.480> pixels<00:06:25.070> but<00:06:26.070> this

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
distance at 300 pixels but this

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.580 
distance at 300 pixels but this
composition<00:06:26.760> is<00:06:27.150> actually<00:06:27.480> at<00:06:27.570> 1200<00:06:28.200> pixels

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
composition is actually at 1200 pixels

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.400 
composition is actually at 1200 pixels
so<00:06:29.580> if<00:06:29.850> you<00:06:29.940> ever<00:06:30.150> have<00:06:30.420> a<00:06:30.450> composition<00:06:30.900> and

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
so if you ever have a composition and

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.040 
so if you ever have a composition and
you<00:06:31.500> want<00:06:31.680> things<00:06:31.860> to<00:06:32.010> like<00:06:32.360> go<00:06:33.360> from<00:06:33.570> far<00:06:33.900> away

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
you want things to like go from far away

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.090 
you want things to like go from far away
in<00:06:34.530> there<00:06:34.740> blurry<00:06:35.040> and<00:06:35.400> have<00:06:35.580> them<00:06:35.700> Zhu

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
in there blurry and have them Zhu

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.490 
in there blurry and have them Zhu
men<00:06:36.280> and<00:06:36.520> they're<00:06:37.420> clear<00:06:37.810> for<00:06:38.020> a<00:06:38.080> little<00:06:38.350> bit

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
men and they're clear for a little bit

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.560 
men and they're clear for a little bit
as<00:06:38.740> they<00:06:39.040> get<00:06:39.190> closer<00:06:39.490> but<00:06:39.880> then<00:06:40.060> they<00:06:40.240> come

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
as they get closer but then they come

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.200 
as they get closer but then they come
out<00:06:41.190> this<00:06:42.190> is<00:06:42.370> how<00:06:42.520> you<00:06:42.580> do<00:06:42.760> that

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
out this is how you do that

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.480 
out this is how you do that
but<00:06:44.110> for<00:06:44.320> now<00:06:44.440> I'm<00:06:44.680> running<00:06:44.860> out<00:06:45.130> of<00:06:45.190> time<00:06:45.430> in

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
but for now I'm running out of time in

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.460 
but for now I'm running out of time in
this<00:06:45.730> tutorial<00:06:45.880> but<00:06:46.750> I<00:06:46.780> just<00:06:47.020> wanted<00:06:47.290> to<00:06:47.350> show

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
this tutorial but I just wanted to show

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.700 
this tutorial but I just wanted to show
you<00:06:47.500> guys<00:06:47.730> the<00:06:48.730> main<00:06:48.940> thing<00:06:49.240> is<00:06:49.900> double<00:06:50.530> click

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:50.710 
you guys the main thing is double click

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.890 
you guys the main thing is double click
this<00:06:50.860> to<00:06:51.040> get<00:06:51.190> your<00:06:51.310> camera<00:06:51.670> settings<00:06:51.910> your

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:52.900 
this to get your camera settings your

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.710 
this to get your camera settings your
presets<00:06:53.640> enable<00:06:54.640> depth<00:06:54.910> of<00:06:55.060> field<00:06:55.330> allows

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
presets enable depth of field allows

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.710 
presets enable depth of field allows
things<00:06:55.960> to<00:06:56.080> be<00:06:56.230> blurry<00:06:56.560> and<00:06:56.800> not<00:06:56.980> blurry<00:06:57.310> and

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
things to be blurry and not blurry and

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.110 
things to be blurry and not blurry and
just<00:06:58.720> go<00:06:58.870> ahead<00:06:58.960> and<00:06:59.140> press<00:06:59.290> ok<00:06:59.620> and<00:07:00.120> this

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
just go ahead and press ok and this

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.350 
just go ahead and press ok and this
focus<00:07:01.390> distance<00:07:01.810> is<00:07:02.290> the<00:07:03.190> distance<00:07:03.730> your

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
focus distance is the distance your

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.540 
focus distance is the distance your
composition<00:07:05.050> needs<00:07:05.290> to<00:07:05.470> be<00:07:05.590> away<00:07:05.980> or<00:07:06.280> the

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
composition needs to be away or the

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.190 
composition needs to be away or the
layers<00:07:06.790> need<00:07:07.150> to<00:07:07.270> be<00:07:07.360> a<00:07:07.390> way<00:07:07.600> for<00:07:07.840> it<00:07:07.900> to<00:07:07.960> be<00:07:08.050> in

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
layers need to be a way for it to be in

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.310 
layers need to be a way for it to be in
perfect<00:07:08.470> focus<00:07:08.940> so<00:07:09.940> anything<00:07:10.360> that's<00:07:10.570> not<00:07:10.750> 300

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
perfect focus so anything that's not 300

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.810 
perfect focus so anything that's not 300
pixels<00:07:11.710> is<00:07:11.860> going<00:07:12.040> to<00:07:12.100> be<00:07:12.190> progressively

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
pixels is going to be progressively

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.630 
pixels is going to be progressively
blurrier<00:07:13.360> and<00:07:13.450> blurrier<00:07:13.720> and<00:07:14.320> in<00:07:15.220> the<00:07:15.340> next

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
blurrier and blurrier and in the next

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
blurrier and blurrier and in the next
story<00:07:15.850> I'm<00:07:16.000> probably<00:07:16.180> going<00:07:16.390> to<00:07:16.450> show<00:07:16.600> you

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
story I'm probably going to show you

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.420 
story I'm probably going to show you
guys<00:07:16.840> how<00:07:17.050> to<00:07:17.110> move<00:07:17.350> your<00:07:17.500> camera<00:07:17.680> around<00:07:17.980> or

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430 
guys how to move your camera around or

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.490 
guys how to move your camera around or
probably<00:07:19.270> something<00:07:19.630> now<00:07:19.840> it's<00:07:19.990> useful<00:07:20.380> as<00:07:20.470> a

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500 
probably something now it's useful as a

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.510 
probably something now it's useful as a
sentence<00:07:20.800> you<00:07:20.890> can<00:07:21.010> guys<00:07:21.160> can<00:07:21.430> probably

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
sentence you can guys can probably

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.880 
sentence you can guys can probably
figure<00:07:21.820> that<00:07:22.060> out<00:07:22.270> but<00:07:22.510> make<00:07:23.500> sure<00:07:23.530> to<00:07:23.650> check

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
figure that out but make sure to check

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.200 
figure that out but make sure to check
out<00:07:24.010> my<00:07:24.070> next<00:07:24.190> tutorial<00:07:24.670> play<00:07:24.850> around<00:07:25.060> with

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
out my next tutorial play around with

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.240 
out my next tutorial play around with
your<00:07:25.330> camera<00:07:25.690> a<00:07:25.720> bit<00:07:25.750> and<00:07:26.020> hopefully<00:07:26.140> you<00:07:27.100> get

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
your camera a bit and hopefully you get
