they're injured we're not doing that at
the<00:02:58.870> moment<00:02:59.400> just<00:03:00.400> basically<00:03:00.879> because<00:03:01.329> you

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
the moment just basically because you

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.940 
the moment just basically because you
know<00:03:01.569> when<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.840> injury<00:03:02.079> happens<00:03:02.530> we<00:03:02.709> kind<00:03:02.889> of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
know when the injury happens we kind of

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.580 
know when the injury happens we kind of
cut<00:03:03.159> to<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.599> injury<00:03:04.959> kind<00:03:05.409> of

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
cut to the the injury kind of

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.559 
cut to the the injury kind of
substitution<00:03:06.340> itself<00:03:06.760> rather<00:03:07.060> than<00:03:07.209> showing

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
substitution itself rather than showing

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.780 
substitution itself rather than showing
that<00:03:07.810> coming<00:03:08.079> on<00:03:08.169> and<00:03:08.349> off<00:03:08.439> great<00:03:09.040> idea<00:03:09.250> again

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that coming on and off great idea again

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.429 
that coming on and off great idea again
we<00:03:09.939> thought<00:03:10.180> about<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.659> a<00:03:10.719> few<00:03:10.750> times<00:03:10.959> but

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
we thought about it a few times but

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.709 
we thought about it a few times but
ultimately<00:03:11.889> our<00:03:12.010> priorities<00:03:12.790> lie<00:03:13.030> in<00:03:13.269> a

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:13.719 
ultimately our priorities lie in a

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.659 
ultimately our priorities lie in a
slightly<00:03:13.989> different<00:03:14.139> place<00:03:14.680> but<00:03:15.219> when<00:03:15.370> we<00:03:15.519> get

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
slightly different place but when we get

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.490 
slightly different place but when we get
round<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:16.000> it<00:03:16.090> we<00:03:16.269> will<00:03:16.919> at<00:03:17.919> Luke<00:03:18.400> HTF<00:03:19.500> jindal

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
round to it we will at Luke HTF jindal

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.920 
round to it we will at Luke HTF jindal
do<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.099> think<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.790> could<00:03:21.969> ever<00:03:22.120> have<00:03:22.599> a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
do you think we you could ever have a

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.319 
do you think we you could ever have a
feature<00:03:23.230> called<00:03:23.349> fan<00:03:23.859> factor<00:03:24.489> where<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.090> fan

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
feature called fan factor where the fan

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.879 
feature called fan factor where the fan
atmosphere<00:03:25.900> could<00:03:26.079> make<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.319> difference<00:03:26.799> to

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
atmosphere could make a difference to

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.009 
atmosphere could make a difference to
play<00:03:27.159> a<00:03:27.190> performance<00:03:27.790> it's<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.780> great<00:03:28.989> idea

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
play a performance it's a great idea

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.890 
play a performance it's a great idea
it's<00:03:29.979> something<00:03:30.250> we've<00:03:30.549> toyed<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:30.849> but<00:03:31.720> I

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
it's something we've toyed with but I

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.920 
it's something we've toyed with but I
don't<00:03:32.260> want<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.680> effect<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.930> something

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
don't want the effect of something

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.649 
don't want the effect of something
tenuous<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.939> control<00:03:36.939> the<00:03:37.120> way<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
tenuous to control the way that the

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.140 
tenuous to control the way that the
gameplay<00:03:38.109> works<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:39.579> would<00:03:39.729> kind<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.030> be

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
gameplay works it would kind of be

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.089 
gameplay works it would kind of be
unfair<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.569> some<00:03:41.019> people<00:03:41.439> if<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.859> fans

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
unfair on some people if the fans

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.129 
unfair on some people if the fans
weren't<00:03:42.400> getting<00:03:43.090> behind<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.510> team<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:43.989> their

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
weren't getting behind a team and their

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.780 
weren't getting behind a team and their
team<00:03:44.379> kind<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.829> got<00:03:44.949> worse<00:03:45.129> and<00:03:45.340> worse<00:03:45.459> based

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
team kind of got worse and worse based

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.819 
team kind of got worse and worse based
on<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.329> want<00:03:46.629> it<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.840> be<00:03:46.959> about<00:03:46.989> your

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
on that so I want it to be about your

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.379 
on that so I want it to be about your
ability<00:03:48.340> at<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.639> game<00:03:48.849> rather<00:03:49.180> than

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
ability at the game rather than

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.210 
ability at the game rather than
something<00:03:49.720> else<00:03:50.019> going<00:03:50.319> on<00:03:50.530> really<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:51.069> it's

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
something else going on really so it's

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.559 
something else going on really so it's
