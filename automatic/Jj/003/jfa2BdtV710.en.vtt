the<00:00:54.570> open<00:00:55.399> container<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.700> there

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
the open container up there

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.310 
the open container up there
there's<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.000> hammer<00:00:59.270> at<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.450> top<00:00:59.719> and<00:01:00.200> it

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
there's the hammer at the top and it

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.939 
there's the hammer at the top and it
basically<00:01:01.300> flows<00:01:02.300> along<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.719> top<00:01:03.050> part<00:01:03.620> of<00:01:03.829> it

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
basically flows along the top part of it

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.000 
basically flows along the top part of it
drive<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.699> through<00:01:04.850> there<00:01:05.710> that's<00:01:06.710> when<00:01:06.890> the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
drive it through there that's when the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.540 
drive it through there that's when the
hot<00:01:07.130> air<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.520> made

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.940 

and<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.570> cold<00:01:12.870> it's<00:01:13.140> important

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.340 

as<00:01:16.640> purchasing<00:01:17.180> can<00:01:17.420> raining<00:01:17.869> before<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.229> goes

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
as purchasing can raining before it goes

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.930 
as purchasing can raining before it goes
its<00:01:18.619> long-term<00:01:18.890> storage<00:01:19.520> so

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
its long-term storage so

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.200 
its long-term storage so
it<00:01:21.360> doesn't<00:01:21.690> provide

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
it doesn't provide

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.000 
it doesn't provide
the<00:01:23.510> right-sided<00:01:23.930> temperatures<00:01:24.500> of<00:01:24.620> it's<00:01:24.740> too

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
the right-sided temperatures of it's too

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.770 
the right-sided temperatures of it's too
warm<00:01:25.280> for<00:01:25.490> bugs<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.660> things<00:01:26.840> allowed<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.350> grow

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
warm for bugs and things allowed to grow

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.240 
warm for bugs and things allowed to grow
what<00:01:29.680> we<00:01:29.799> don't

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
what we don't

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.830 
what we don't
so<00:01:31.170> that's<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.350> great<00:01:32.530> fryer<00:01:32.950> itself<00:01:33.840> that's
