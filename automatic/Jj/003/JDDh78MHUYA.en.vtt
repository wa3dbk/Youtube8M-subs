00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
book by Jory Graham is a poet I really

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.720 
book by Jory Graham is a poet I really
admire<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.180> they<00:01:40.750> all<00:01:41.080> have<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:42.010> do<00:01:42.190> with<00:01:42.220> a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
admire and they all have to do with a

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.880 
admire and they all have to do with a
moment<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.450> time<00:01:43.600> that's<00:01:43.810> kind<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.110> frozen<00:01:44.409> and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
moment in time that's kind of frozen and

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.620 
moment in time that's kind of frozen and
expanded<00:01:45.640> into<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:45.970> sort<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.470> long<00:01:47.470> moment

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
expanded into this sort of long moment

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.390 
expanded into this sort of long moment
out<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:50.050> time<00:01:50.260> so<00:01:50.860> in<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:51.220> particular

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
out of time so in this particular

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.719 
out of time so in this particular
instance<00:01:51.760> it's<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.600> moment<00:01:53.050> when<00:01:53.500> Orpheus<00:01:54.460> is

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
instance it's the moment when Orpheus is

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.490 
instance it's the moment when Orpheus is
just<00:01:55.270> starting<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.600> turn<00:01:55.840> towards<00:01:56.290> you're<00:01:56.440> a
