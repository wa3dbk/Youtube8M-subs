variety of back swings you could argue

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
variety of back swings you could argue
that<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.519> whole<00:00:26.699> point<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.630> back<00:00:27.869> swing

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that the whole point of the back swing

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.220 
that the whole point of the back swing
is<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.740> put<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.099> racket<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:30.630> arm<00:00:30.900> in

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
is to put your racket and your arm in

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.319

later<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> shot<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:35.730> back<00:00:36.000> swing

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
later in the shot so if your back swing

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.819 
later in the shot so if your back swing
is<00:00:36.420> allowing<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.380> that

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
is allowing you to do that

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.580 
is allowing you to do that
then<00:00:38.370> you're<00:00:38.579> good<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.450> again<00:00:40.320> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
then you're good to go and again that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
use but once you set it that's what

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.320 
use but once you set it that's what
you're<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> keep<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:18.060> swing
