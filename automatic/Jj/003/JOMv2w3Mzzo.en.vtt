00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.009
 Projects 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.719
 and what do you think is the most 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.119
 draw attention to all this end of 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.490
 week apart from the youtubers that 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.110
 also grace the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.909
 competitions our finals and about 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.490
 the whole theme of presenting new 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.700
 games and talking about a specific game 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.990
 I would say that lately it coincides 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.549
 with me in what is hitting more 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.170
 strong you can not see a lot of 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.240
 things like said ricky minecraft and I do not know 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.679
 what but I think that lately it 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.630
 has returned in the game of revelations to 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.369
 be a free to play as many people do 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.519
 that is taking a fancy to playing that 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.319
 You see game I think so and 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.970
 last thing is that this is going to petar 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.739
 because the truth is that it has just begun 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.750
 it is beginning to fill more and more 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.700
 what day of this weekend you want 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.160
 what is going to be this the bomb 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.290
 now we are lazy day and I do not know what 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.660
 what time is it at five thirty? 6 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.030
 and we are on Friday people are 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.470
 working channels and other Saturdays 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.079
 surely it will lend itself will be filled 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 stop and then and to Sunday then a little 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.549
 but also with the finals surely 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.590
 there will be many strong people totally 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.540
 asks an extra bonus question because 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.040
 I just noticed that there is a mother 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.850
 here and it's that it's not the first one that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.860
 cross 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.200
 of parents because the kids start 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.960
 from very young you think good 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.210
 has an account in the range of public that 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.670
 there are youtubers and in all the games 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.890
 It also starts from very young and 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.210
 Of course many kids can not come 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.550
 them alone and it has to do with some 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.730
 compadre and others surely because 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.990
 security and everything that are from here not 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.550
 because I guess a kid 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.770
 small is going to hit us the whole trip 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.750
 to come from madrid the typical thing that 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.070
 we could pass mom I do not know who 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.210
 as he still does not have the age to go 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.730
 just because that's why he has to come 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.710
 accompanied with the good box then nothing 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.160
 You already know how to come and do it 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.160
 same 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.020
 well we are here with someone who 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.000
 sure you know tell us to those who 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.040
 they have not been able to come or they are going to come 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.360
 days that can be found here 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.590
 Well, I'm discovering it 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.120
 Now that the truth is good 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.800
 pint is the whole subject of the sun that is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.690
 the loquísima people but aside from that 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.850
 there's a little bit of minecraft you can quarter 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.090
 so folk is elebol that is the game 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.580
 that I have more desire I have done than when 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.080
 that's why when it's not there and we have 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.430
 this from the room of one that is the 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.650
 cool because youtubers come that are 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.560
 as future promises to try to make 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.930
 here a gameplay the people the assumptions 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.580
 experts we value them so I was 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.500
 I think there is a very strong environment 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.110
 cool and if you like video games 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.860
 you have to come, you 're going to be very hard with 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.230
 the promises 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.150
 I like to be hard you know it's like 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.370
 cool to say I do not like it because because no 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.290
 the pursuit is true that I notice 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.630
 always in the comment a lot and so 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.370
 less than some councils and it depends 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.750
 if I think that everyone votes high 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.000
 I'm going to vote low to take it 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.190
 if I like the risotto mejide from youtube 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.070
 we have it right here we're going to miss it without 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.690
 missing is more handsome since then 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.530
 no thank you and see you by 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.530
 here by gamer dyn 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.729
 and up to here our step because mary ya 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.160
 you have seen that there is a lot of atmosphere 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.650
 a lot of people and a lot of competition that 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.889
 is what we like , you know that 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.919
 misfortune the black note of this event 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.289
 has been the lack of static of the group 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.360
 of competition of lol but good we 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.360
 we say goodbye with this figure until later
