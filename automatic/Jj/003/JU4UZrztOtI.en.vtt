00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
as the penguins fly past Bermuda and an

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.170 
as the penguins fly past Bermuda and an
altitude<00:00:50.590> of<00:00:50.890> approximately<00:00:51.180> thirty

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
altitude of approximately thirty

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.780 
altitude of approximately thirty
thirty-five<00:00:52.630> thousand<00:00:53.200> feet<00:00:53.380> I<00:00:53.730> thought<00:00:54.730> I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
thirty-five thousand feet I thought I

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.490 
thirty-five thousand feet I thought I
caught<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.180> glint<00:00:55.360> of<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.570> wing<00:00:55.810> just<00:00:56.170> up<00:00:56.350> there

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
caught the glint of a wing just up there

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.950 
caught the glint of a wing just up there
behind<00:00:56.740> that<00:00:56.830> cloud<00:00:57.100> did<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:57.910> see<00:00:58.060> that<00:00:58.180> yeah

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
behind that cloud did you see that yeah

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.470 
behind that cloud did you see that yeah
but<00:00:59.830> I<00:01:00.010> think<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.460> main<00:01:00.640> body<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.060> Penguins

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
but I think the main body the Penguins

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.240 
but I think the main body the Penguins
probably<00:01:02.020> won't<00:01:02.230> be<00:01:02.350> passing<00:01:02.860> through<00:01:03.100> the

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
probably won't be passing through the

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.490 
probably won't be passing through the
islands<00:01:03.580> for<00:01:04.210> at<00:01:04.299> least<00:01:04.449> another<00:01:04.659> half<00:01:05.320> an

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
islands for at least another half an

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.649 
islands for at least another half an
hour<00:01:05.650> 40<00:01:05.950> minutes<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.460> but<00:01:07.240> when<00:01:07.420> they<00:01:07.600> do

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
hour 40 minutes and but when they do

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.480 
hour 40 minutes and but when they do
come<00:01:07.780> over<00:01:08.259> you<00:01:08.470> do<00:01:08.860> really<00:01:09.100> want<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.400> have

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
come over you do really want to have

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.399 
come over you do really want to have
that<00:01:09.610> camera<00:01:09.850> directed<00:01:10.509> definitely<00:01:11.049> the<00:01:11.170> sky

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
that camera directed definitely the sky

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.170 
that camera directed definitely the sky
