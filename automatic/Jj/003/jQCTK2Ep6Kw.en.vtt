00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:07.610
 more exciting but also one of the 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.169
 most risky throughout its history 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.330

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.910
 1982 one of the best flyers that 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.800
 has seen formula1 on its circuits 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.619

 Grand Prix of Belgium 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.000
 It ran approximately 220 kilometers 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.430
 per hour when the front wheel 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.070
 left of his ferrari touched the back 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.289
 right of johan march plus the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.239
 weak ferrari in the skittle through the air and 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.399
 he got fired from the car in the 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.190
 fall received a death blow in the 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.600
 head is said that the Canadian accelerated 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.309
 more than the account to beat your 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.980
 coequipero the French didier pironí 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.809
 author at that time of the best time in 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.810
 the classification with an advantage of 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.700
 just one tenth of a second 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.010
 and that is two weeks before his death 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.080
 during the grand prize of san marino his 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.150
 last race the ferraris weak and 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.190
 weak but they largely dominated the 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.320
 test will raise the difference between 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.880
 them and the rest of the pilots that their 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.480
 teams ordered them to slow down 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.150
 to avoid risks here fulfilled but in 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.160
 the last round of he ignored without 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.410
 more or more advance to his teammate for 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.230
 win that race and also hate 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.480
 eternal of the Canadian why two 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.760
 weeks after that cloudy May 8

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.430
 a pilot recognized for his talent more 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.160
 beyond your results 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.500
 Biden was one of those atypical pilots 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.300
 that they give themselves from time to time their 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.860
 story started when James Jones was 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.369
 fixed on him during a race the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.400

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.610
 would come to his life enzo ferrari who 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.200
 he treated like a son 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.720
 the first encounter between 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.770
 numbers were never spectacular and 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.110
 it failed more than the account but ferrari 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.090
 he was delighted with his pilot was 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.370
 very fast in any circumstance 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.070
 especially in the wet and there has not been 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.860
