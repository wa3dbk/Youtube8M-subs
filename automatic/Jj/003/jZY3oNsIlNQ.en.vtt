00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.929
 84 days to design a prototype 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.119
 this is the crazy challenge launched every year to 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.710
 twenty-seven students from the school hoped 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.720
 sbarro at j - 1 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.490
 they are more than ever on the heels of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.840
 war before departure for the salon of 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.259
 geneva of their creation 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.400
 the concept sparta there I was working on 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.590
 a team of air that leads to it 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.470
 from the air to the turbo exchanger I was 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.780
 polishing pieces that are going 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.410
 come to the fore at level level 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.280
 front lights in less than 24 hours 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.110
 what at that time normally 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.540
 tomorrow she is already in the truck in 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.820
 train to leave it's yeah that's very 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.100
 very short and this is the first time 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.410
 for me a unique experience for 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.269
 students who addresses this final rush more 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.809
 or less serenely it's very concrete 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.610
 and with a fairly important result very 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.110
 quickly I dread a lot Thursday 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.720
 when I want everything that is left to 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.150
 make good we normally should 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.580
 to arrive but it's true that it sounds 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.950
 sounds crazy and stays a lot of things 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.870
 good after that is precisely the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.880
 big project it'll still be the 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.009
 door assembly brakes 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.299
 then put the car on the ground and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.820
 will end tomorrow by the collage of the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.590
 windshield finish tomorrow yes but he will have 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.729
 in the meantime one last night 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.729
 white hard work 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.650
 it's a big challenge for them 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.990
 personal ie that basically there is 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.330
 self-confidence for the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.680
 who will say who is aware of 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.070
 what she's doing that 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.540
 is huge 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.160
 I speak knowingly 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.840
 since I lived I was in their place 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.600
 a little over ten years ago I was 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.830
 pupil at school I know it has me 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.320
 brought a lot and it's true that 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.490
 it's a stress we meet very 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.290
 rarely after in his career 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.610
 professional and if we suffered that we 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.610
 can suffer take a lot of things after 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.960
 14 weeks of manufacturing an engine 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.619
 thermal of 156 horses and two engines 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.930
 electrical 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.869
 challenge raised for the hybrid prototype 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.209
 sparta concept that was exposed from 6 to 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.950
 March 16 at the international fair of 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.930
 the car of Geneva and who 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.620
 will participate in the monte carlo rally 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.620
 new energies
