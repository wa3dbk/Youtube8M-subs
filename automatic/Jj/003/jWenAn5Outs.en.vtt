00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
question is from Ruby blush and she says

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
question is from Ruby blush and she says
would<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.750> rather<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.320> three<00:01:10.860> feet<00:01:11.070> taller<00:01:11.430> or

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
would you rather be three feet taller or

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.330 
would you rather be three feet taller or
three<00:01:12.270> feet<00:01:12.570> shorter<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.010> really

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
three feet shorter that is really

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.120 
three feet shorter that is really
difficult<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.000> if<00:01:15.210> I'm<00:01:15.479> about<00:01:15.780> 55<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.979> was

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
difficult so if I'm about 55 so if I was

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.890 
difficult so if I'm about 55 so if I was
three<00:01:17.369> feet<00:01:17.549> taller<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.909> would<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.299> eight<00:01:18.540> foot

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
three feet taller I would be eight foot

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.310 
three feet taller I would be eight foot
five<00:01:19.799> inches<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:20.790> three<00:01:21.630> feet<00:01:21.840> shorter

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
five inches and about three feet shorter

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.149 
five inches and about three feet shorter
I<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.979> two<00:01:23.520> feet<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.320> 5<00:01:25.320> inches<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.950> was

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I would be two feet and 5 inches I was

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
I would be two feet and 5 inches I was
difficult<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.729> choose<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.119> i<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.479> i'm

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
difficult to choose but i think i'm

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
difficult to choose but i think i'm
going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.049> i<00:01:28.380> would<00:01:28.409> rather<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.979> three

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
going to go with i would rather be three

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.460 
going to go with i would rather be three
feet<00:01:29.579> shorter<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:30.930> i<00:01:30.960> feel<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.290> if

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
feet shorter just because i feel like if

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.990 
feet shorter just because i feel like if
i<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.710> eight<00:01:31.860> foot<00:01:32.130> five<00:01:32.340> i<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.790> absolutely

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
i was eight foot five i would absolutely

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.510 
i was eight foot five i would absolutely
tower<00:01:33.630> over<00:01:34.049> everyone<00:01:34.079> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> entire<00:01:35.009> world

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
tower over everyone in the entire world

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.850 
tower over everyone in the entire world
so<00:01:36.479> i<00:01:36.509> would<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.079> tiny<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.710> would

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
so i would be really tiny and I would

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.710 
so i would be really tiny and I would
look<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.220> child<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:38.939> i<00:01:39.000> think<00:01:39.450> i<00:01:39.659> would

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
look like a child but i think i would

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.530 
look like a child but i think i would
rather<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.770> three<00:01:41.579> feet<00:01:41.850> shorter<00:01:42.509> than

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
rather be on three feet shorter than

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.910 
rather be on three feet shorter than
three<00:01:42.960> feet<00:01:42.990> taller<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.710> was<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> really

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
three feet taller so that was a really

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.530 
three feet taller so that was a really
interesting<00:01:44.130> question<00:01:44.549> i<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.360> one

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
interesting question i like that one

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.350 
interesting question i like that one
quart<00:01:46.079> c1<00:01:46.530> 01<00:01:46.680> asks<00:01:47.280> what<00:01:47.460> kind<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> camera<00:01:48.060> do

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
quart c1 01 asks what kind of camera do

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.010 
quart c1 01 asks what kind of camera do

you use and i use the canon t3i megan

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440 
you use and i use the canon t3i megan
underscore<00:01:52.740> parcel<00:01:53.399> asks<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.299> your

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
underscore parcel asks what is your

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.020 
underscore parcel asks what is your
all-time<00:01:54.630> favorite<00:01:54.869> memory<00:01:55.710> from<00:01:55.799> summer<00:01:56.340> so

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
all-time favorite memory from summer so

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
all-time favorite memory from summer so
I'm<00:01:57.180> guessing<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.630> from<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.530> past

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
I'm guessing that's from this past

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.249 
I'm guessing that's from this past
summer<00:01:59.070> which<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.610> happened<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.210> um<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
summer which just happened so um it's

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.440 
summer which just happened so um it's
hard<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.740> think<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.340> would<00:02:02.460> probably<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:03.180> my

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
hard but I think it would probably be my

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.810 
hard but I think it would probably be my
trip<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.899> california<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.560> june<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.250> was<00:02:05.729> my

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
trip to california in june it was my

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.850 
trip to california in june it was my

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
first time going to California and it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.260 
first time going to California and it
was<00:02:08.009> absolutely<00:02:08.190> amazed

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
was absolutely amazed

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.330 
was absolutely amazed
I<00:02:09.300> got<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.080> many<00:02:10.260> fun<00:02:10.590> things<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:11.070> I<00:02:11.160> got

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
I got to do so many fun things and I got

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.850 
I got to do so many fun things and I got
to<00:02:11.490> go<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.610> I'm<00:02:11.910> at<00:02:12.180> La<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.960> first<00:02:13.170> time<00:02:13.320> so

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
to go to I'm at La for the first time so

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.820 
to go to I'm at La for the first time so
I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.670> or<00:02:15.000> maybe<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.870> trip<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.440> new

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
