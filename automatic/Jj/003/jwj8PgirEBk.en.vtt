00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.170
 Hi, I'm Professor Adriana Bologna 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.960
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make the fondant 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.750
 extended that is the paste that is used 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.850
 to cover the cakes and also the 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.590
 we can mix together with the pasta 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.590
 rubber to be modeled 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.529
 to make the fund have extended let's 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.860
 need 4 tablespoons water 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.960
 spoonfuls are tureens everything we are going to 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.960
 use with the same spoon 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.100
 in those four tablespoons of water I'm going to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.469
 dissolve a spoonful of gelatin without 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.469
 flavor in the form of rain 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.460
 until this unflavored gelatin does not 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.850
 dissolve did not incorporate the rest of the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.850
 ingredients 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.890
 Once the unflavored gelatine is dissolved 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.680
 in the water I will incorporate the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.220
 glycerin 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.280
 This element may vary according to 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 weather if it's a rainy or very wet day 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.020
 I'm not going to put it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.130
 after the glycerin we put a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.130
 loose spoonful of glucose 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:54.240
 and finally we are going to place a 

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:58.020
 tablespoon also of vegetable inah all 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.100
 this must dissolve well in the water that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.100
 it is already hot 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.490
 once all the ingredients are dissolved 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.610
 we can put the essence to taste 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.640
 from each one a little trickle and now 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.620
 directly we go to the table add 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.570
 the impalpable sugar because this 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.570
 preparation must be hot 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.860
 once we remove from the fire 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.880
 we begin to add sugar 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.209
 impalpable we should not stop long 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.290
 at this time because we must keep 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.470
 the temperature of this liquid if that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.739
 liquid cools does not absorb more sugar 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.370
 impalpable and we have a very 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.370
 girl 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.120
 this preparation that you are going to see 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.440
 now serves to line a cake 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.870
 size 24 round centimeters when 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.680
 we need to make more sizes 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.680
 great we multiply these proportions 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.810
 there's going to be a moment that we need 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.810
 pass it to the table so we love it 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.910
 we put a little impalpable sugar 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.000
 on the table, and we pour is 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.060
 preparation so we can knead it is very 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.020
 tender and very soft and it is a race that 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.560
 it never cracks, it does not shine, it dries, it does not 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.020
 transpira is very noble approximately 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.200
 will carry 800 grams of sugar 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.890
 impalpable everything will depend on the size 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.560
 of the spoon that we used because 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.330
 the liquid may be greater and may 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.250
 get to absorb a little bit more than 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.810
 sugar 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.379
 we knead until it sticks in 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.379
 hands 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.390
 absorbs what is just and necessary after 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.150
 we finished kneading this fondant 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.630
 we will place it in 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.300
 a tightly closed bag and you can 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.840
 keep up to three months in the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.840
 refrigerator 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.630
 apart from serving to wrap cakes this 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.100
 dough can be mixed with the dough 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.810
 rubber in equal proportions 50 and 50 and 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.810
 it is used to model 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.370
 before lining a cake I will have 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.120
 what to do to warm it with the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.900
 hands and that it is as tender as 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.900
 is now 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.220
 well here finally we have left 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:45.510
 finished the extended fondant is a 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.510
 Tender mass very soft and very even 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:53.330
 it's how I 'm going to keep it in a 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.330
 hermetic bag with closure 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.520
 until the sauce 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.030
 Well I hope you have served this 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.760
 was the explanation of the fund have 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.590
 extended is a mass that you can 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.170
 Take advantage of doing it with your own 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.140
 hands in a homemade way and any 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.630
 consult send me an adriana mail 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.050
 will hotmail.com 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.050
 Thank you
