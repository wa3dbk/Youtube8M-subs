when<00:00:00.510> I<00:00:00.630> was<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.810> child<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:01.500> was<00:00:01.829> fascinated<00:00:01.860> by

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
when I was a child I was fascinated by

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.930 
when I was a child I was fascinated by
telepathy<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:04.049> science<00:00:04.529> fiction<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.370> fact<00:00:05.790> I

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
telepathy in science fiction in fact I

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.360 
telepathy in science fiction in fact I
tried<00:00:06.240> really<00:00:06.629> hard<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:07.230> read<00:00:07.589> other<00:00:07.890> people's

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
tried really hard to read other people's

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.089 
tried really hard to read other people's
minds<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.120> project<00:00:09.870> my<00:00:10.050> thoughts<00:00:10.080> into<00:00:10.950> other

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
minds to project my thoughts into other

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.700 
minds to project my thoughts into other
people's<00:00:11.580> heads<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.870> came<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.530> the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
people's heads and I came to the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.090 
people's heads and I came to the
conclusion<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.910> maybe<00:00:15.540> telepaths<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:16.830> walk

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
conclusion that maybe telepaths do walk

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.580 
conclusion that maybe telepaths do walk
the<00:00:17.130> surface<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> earth<00:00:18.020> but<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.260> wasn't

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the surface of the earth but I wasn't

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.420 
the surface of the earth but I wasn't
one<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:19.949> them

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
one of them

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.929 
one of them
now<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.810> physicist<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:23.039> realized<00:00:23.580> that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
now I'm a physicist and I realized that

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.779 
now I'm a physicist and I realized that
with<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.960> electromagnetic<00:00:25.800> probes<00:00:26.609> that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
with all the electromagnetic probes that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
with all the electromagnetic probes that
we<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.750> human<00:00:28.050> brain<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:29.070> can

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
we have of the human brain we can

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
we have of the human brain we can
actually<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.760> thoughts<00:00:30.210> ricocheting<00:00:31.050> across

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
actually see thoughts ricocheting across

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.830 
actually see thoughts ricocheting across
the<00:00:31.740> brain<00:00:31.949> itself<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.790> see<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.239> thinking

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the brain itself we can see the thinking

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.979 
the brain itself we can see the thinking
living<00:00:34.320> brain<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.520> thinks<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.750> can

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
living brain as it thinks and we can

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
living brain as it thinks and we can
create<00:00:37.320> computer<00:00:37.950> simulations<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
create computer simulations of this to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
create computer simulations of this to
understand<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.559> people<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:40.980> thinking<00:00:41.059> so

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
understand what people are thinking so

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.260 
understand what people are thinking so
at<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> present<00:00:42.420> time<00:00:42.719> telepathy<00:00:43.550> exists<00:00:44.550> for

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
at the present time telepathy exists for

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.540 
at the present time telepathy exists for
example<00:00:45.350> look<00:00:46.350> at<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.559> colleague<00:00:47.160> Stephen

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
example look at my colleague Stephen

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.119 
example look at my colleague Stephen
Hawking<00:00:47.940> he's<00:00:48.570> lost<00:00:48.840> control<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.350> his<00:00:49.710> fingers

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
Hawking he's lost control of his fingers

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
Hawking he's lost control of his fingers
now<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.610> he<00:00:50.760> cannot<00:00:51.059> communicate<00:00:51.780> even<00:00:51.960> with

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
now so he cannot communicate even with

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.069 
now so he cannot communicate even with
the<00:00:52.320> laptop<00:00:52.710> computer<00:00:53.030> but<00:00:54.030> look<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:54.899> his

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the laptop computer but look at his

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.740 
the laptop computer but look at his
right<00:00:55.410> frame<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.280> his<00:00:56.370> glasses<00:00:56.570> there's<00:00:57.570> an

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
right frame of his glasses there's an

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.040 
right frame of his glasses there's an
EEG<00:00:58.199> sensor<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.340> picks<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.730> radio<00:01:00.570> waves

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
EEG sensor that picks up radio waves

from<00:01:01.230> his<00:01:01.350> brain<00:01:01.649> decodes<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.420> he's

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
from his brain decodes that and he's

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
from his brain decodes that and he's
allowed<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.409> manipulate<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:05.100> some<00:01:05.339> degree<00:01:05.670> a

this depression by putting in probes you

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.460 
this depression by putting in probes you

this and all of a sudden they're cured
on<00:03:00.650> one<00:03:00.920> hand<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.370> see<00:03:01.550> somebody<00:03:01.910> who's

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
steps in this direction have been taken

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.120 
steps in this direction have been taken
already<00:05:13.130> in<00:05:13.520> Kyoto<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.180> at<00:05:14.870> Berkeley<00:05:15.500> what

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
already in Kyoto and at Berkeley what

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.000 
already in Kyoto and at Berkeley what
you<00:05:16.280> do<00:05:16.460> is<00:05:16.730> you<00:05:17.420> put<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.720> patient<00:05:18.110> in<00:05:18.530> an<00:05:18.770> MRI

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
you do is you put the patient in an MRI

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.480 
you do is you put the patient in an MRI
scanner<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.820> he<00:05:20.030> falls<00:05:20.270> asleep<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.950> brain<00:05:21.980> is

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
scanner and he falls asleep the brain is

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.270 
scanner and he falls asleep the brain is
then<00:05:22.670> scanned<00:05:23.060> creating<00:05:23.840> 30,000<00:05:24.740> dots<00:05:24.920> a

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
then scanned creating 30,000 dots a

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.720 
then scanned creating 30,000 dots a
computer<00:05:26.270> analyzes<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.200> 30,000<00:05:28.130> dots<00:05:28.400> of<00:05:28.640> a

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
computer analyzes the 30,000 dots of a

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.420 
computer analyzes the 30,000 dots of a
sleeping<00:05:29.060> brain<00:05:29.420> and<00:05:30.280> reconstructs<00:05:31.280> the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
sleeping brain and reconstructs the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.909 
sleeping brain and reconstructs the
image<00:05:31.850> of<00:05:32.090> what<00:05:32.360> he's<00:05:32.480> dreaming<00:05:32.720> about<00:05:32.919> now

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
image of what he's dreaming about now

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.530 
image of what he's dreaming about now
I've<00:05:34.070> seen<00:05:34.310> these<00:05:34.520> pictures<00:05:34.790> they're<00:05:35.300> pretty

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
I've seen these pictures they're pretty

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.340 
I've seen these pictures they're pretty
crude<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.530> see<00:05:36.710> a<00:05:36.740> picture<00:05:37.190> of<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.700> human<00:05:37.880> and

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
crude you see a picture of a human and

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.510 
crude you see a picture of a human and
obviously<00:05:39.350> he's<00:05:39.560> thinking<00:05:39.890> about<00:05:40.220> and

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
obviously he's thinking about and

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.630 
obviously he's thinking about and
dreaming<00:05:40.820> about<00:05:41.000> a<00:05:41.180> human<00:05:41.600> but<00:05:42.290> one<00:05:42.560> day<00:05:42.800> we

dreaming about a human but one day we
may<00:05:43.850> be<00:05:43.910> able<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.330> refine<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.169> technique<00:05:45.710> so

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
may be able to refine this technique so

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.560 
may be able to refine this technique so
that<00:05:46.250> when<00:05:46.520> you<00:05:46.640> wake<00:05:46.790> up<00:05:46.820> in<00:05:47.030> the<00:05:47.060> morning<00:05:47.450> and
