00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.769
 what you need to know is that money 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.020
 it's still less qualitative than 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.520
 when his black if with time it 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.320
 talk about it requires more 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.369
 maintenance and then and then it's going 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.630
 wake up more easily so it's a 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.340
 jewel that will last less in time 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.930
 but on the other hand for a small gift 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.180
 it's pretty suitable typically saint 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.279
 valentine christmas why not leave on a 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.890
 silver jewel around 150 200 euros 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.809
 after if you want more marked blow 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.190
 there I will leave without hesitation on gold 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.450
 and laurent blanc the advantage is that 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.950
 it lasts all the life so in fact 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.539
 the advantage is that you will be able 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.800
 to offer him this jewel is actually she 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.800
 will keep almost forever 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.010
 all that is so ruby ​​sapphires 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.330
 emeralds and diamonds it's still 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.490
 the feet had more precious it's 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.980
 often enough connoted important gift 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.450
 so every engagement ring 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.100
 other possible stone I think by 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.970
 example to that is the marines so 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.310
 it is a stone that pleases a lot 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.110
 it's typically the kind of stone that 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.489
 I that I actually recommend for a 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.080
 gift that is only an important gift 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.830
 still, but not at all 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.690
 an engagement ring 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.520
 so the diamond and the other stones 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.630
 precious emerald ruby sapphires where 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.400
 be careful it is therefore 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.720
 that it's a loner because as soon as 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.770
 it's a loner to necessarily pass a 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.750
 little on the other side of the fence 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.280
 you arrive at the moment when it's very 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.259
 mac of engagement so watch out for that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.729
 every month of birth is associated with 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.590
 a stone and that's something that 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.000
 date of the Gregorian calendar so genres 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.350
 of the 9th century it's not at all 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.930
 something that is new and leaves the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.690
 markit things and suddenly what is 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.979
 very interesting is to watch the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.020
 birth month of the person to whom 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.360
 you offer a jewel or if you ever 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.040
 wait for a child together at the top of the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.840
 baby birth month will be born and you 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.080
 can offer a jewel with the stone of 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.080
 birth 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.259
 money does it physically 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.939
 exactly the same pace and 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.710
 visually only when a thing already 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.570
 is that money selling jewelry 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.100
 this is money that is 925 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.090
 to say that it's massive money and to 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.500
 92 5% pure silver in gold metal 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.630
 these are alloys to harden a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.710
 little bit is like when 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.959
 the orangery from the moment 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.670
 tell you it's 18 carat gold or we 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.369
 also call 750 thousandths said that to 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.720
 75% pure gold in it basically means 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.310
 that it is during very good quality 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.379
 then you have to be careful about gold 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.730
 because there are 14-carat gold and 9 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.290
 karats that is to say that there is less gold 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.310
 pure in and so that 's the least 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.230
 good quality is often what we 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.370
 call the plated for example in silver 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.720
 in fact there is no silver plates and 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.810
 it's all the time it's all the time 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.030
 of pure after chemically the money and 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.560
 less valuable nerves it costs less 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.030
 than gold if ever it's a very gem 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.040
 end for example money tends to 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.780
 more twist than gold is so it's okay 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.010
 necessarily deform with time so 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.540
 maybe take that into consideration 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.540
 there is no good bad money 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.270
 so typically festive water is the 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.830
 biggest enemy of money we do not know 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.360
 not necessarily but we have a lot of 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.040
 people who keep their jewelry in 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.190
 money to shower to wash the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.750
 hands 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.370
 it's a big mistake because 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.380
 precisely the oxidation in fact of 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.660
 accelerate this metal which is white it goes 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.270
 blacken it will become grainy it goes a 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.520
 little thicken it's going to be rougher 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.630
 in fact to touch and so my already it's 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.160
 not very aesthetic and it's not very 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.230
 nice what to do for the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.930
 to treat is to use a resin chain 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.430
 so a little fabric and then some product 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.170
 silverware attention after me on 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.700
 the stones can be done but 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.500
 sincerely he will find again anyway 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.610
 never its original brightness so that's 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.750
 unfortunately a property 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.150
 intrinsic to money that's 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.920
 chemically like that and therefore avoid at 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.450
 maximum work that's why often 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.950
 I still recommend passing on 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.330
 money for small gifts 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.160
 rather on earrings and on 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.150
 on pendants because at least 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.150
 there is no contact with water
