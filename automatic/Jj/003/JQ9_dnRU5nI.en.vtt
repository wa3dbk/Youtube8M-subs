we're trying to do is gets into

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.380 
we're trying to do is gets into
projections<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:46.160> maybe<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:46.879> know<00:00:47.000> get<00:00:47.239> some

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
projections and maybe you know get some

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.760 
projections and maybe you know get some
fireworks<00:00:48.140> over<00:00:48.260> here<00:00:48.469> on<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.590> side

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
fireworks over here on the side

awesome<00:06:53.400> awesome<00:06:53.850> projections<00:06:54.840> that<00:06:54.900> was<00:06:55.020> a

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
awesome awesome projections that was a

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.720 
awesome awesome projections that was a
great<00:06:55.290> show<00:06:55.530> from<00:06:55.680> the<00:06:55.770> facade<00:06:56.070> the<00:06:56.520> only

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
great show from the facade the only

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.060 
great show from the facade the only
weird<00:06:57.030> thing<00:06:57.120> was<00:06:57.930> they<00:06:58.350> projected<00:06:58.980> the
