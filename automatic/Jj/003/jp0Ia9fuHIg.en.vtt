let's<00:01:39.870> open<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.050> some<00:01:40.200> legend<00:01:40.470> packs<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.830> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
let's open up some legend packs here and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.380 
let's open up some legend packs here and
I<00:01:41.280> figured<00:01:41.580> out<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.790> take<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:41.970> couple<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
I figured out what take a couple of

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.390 
I figured out what take a couple of
minutes<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.720> took<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.290> minute<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.310> go

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
minutes I took like a minute just to go

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.740 
minutes I took like a minute just to go
through<00:01:44.640> all<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.940> I<00:01:45.000> guess<00:01:45.150> we<00:01:45.330> got<00:01:45.450> nothing

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
through all and I guess we got nothing

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.090 
through all and I guess we got nothing
good<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> wasn't<00:01:46.260> understand<00:01:46.590> anything<00:01:46.770> down
