00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.440 
fantastic and so easy and makes me
wonder<00:02:20.220> why<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.580> isn't<00:02:21.090> more<00:02:21.180> well<00:02:21.420> known

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
wonder why it isn't more well known

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.900 
wonder why it isn't more well known
because<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.410> did<00:02:22.680> there<00:02:23.520> could<00:02:23.610> be<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.849> many

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
because if we did there could be so many

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.650 
because if we did there could be so many
well-trained<00:02:24.480> dogs<00:02:24.720> out<00:02:24.930> there

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.500 

the<00:02:30.530> dog<00:02:30.770> kind<00:02:31.130> of<00:02:31.220> directs<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.700> training<00:02:32.120> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
the dog kind of directs the training and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.770 
the dog kind of directs the training and
you<00:02:33.170> reward<00:02:34.040> their<00:02:34.550> positive<00:02:35.060> behavior<00:02:35.600> the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
you reward their positive behavior the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.000 
you reward their positive behavior the
things<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.170> they<00:02:36.320> meant<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.830> doing

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
things that they meant to be doing

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.000 
things that they meant to be doing
that's<00:02:37.700> what<00:02:37.850> they<00:02:37.940> get<00:02:38.060> rewarded<00:02:38.240> for<00:02:39.010> start

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
that's what they get rewarded for start

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.290 
that's what they get rewarded for start
saw<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.250> was<00:02:40.370> simply<00:02:40.700> just<00:02:40.880> something<00:02:41.150> likes

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300
