00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.440
 and now that we've talked a lot about the remake 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.360
 of halo 2 and ice the collection of 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.769
 master boss was very well-deserved 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.719
 space to ge and the five guardians 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.389
 Guardians keep their departure date 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.190
 does not specify for autumn 2015 but its 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.730
 beta version will be unlocked this 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.800
 Christmas on December 27, 2014 this one 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.289
 will come included with the purchase of yale or 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.220
 the master chief's collection 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.929
 apparently by playing the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.029
 master boss's collection we can 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.710
 find exclusive items that also 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.869
 we can use in ge the five guardians 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.030
 but nothing specific about it has been 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.010
 clarified was confirmed by bonnie 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.140
 rose that the beta will obviously contain 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.030
 new maps and new game modes the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.800
 which may be used in part to 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.930
 receive comments from the community in 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.180
 as to what the game and repairing things 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 what things to keep intact a trailer 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.110
 new beta version leaves the five 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.790
 guardians was released but without telling them 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.790
 I still leave you here 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.050
 how could we realize this and it seems 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.790
 be that the multiplayer leaves the five 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.500
 guardians will again be based on a 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.600
 story giving reason that the spartans 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.850
 they fight in the wargames aboard the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.340
 uned that infinite and this brings us to the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.200
 question the elite will be playable or not 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.790
 agreeing with the ice comics 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.950
 escalation we can find the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.900
 response as if despite not being 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.730
 apparently confirmed troops of the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.040
 inquisitor train together with spartans 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.200
 on board this ship or at least this 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.460
 is my personal theory nothing about a 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.530
 range system was even 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.209
 mentioned but usually that class 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.160
 of details are released on dates 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.690
 closest to the launch of the game what 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.820
 that if it's been said is that the game 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.340
 will run a resolution of 1080 pixels 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.290
 at 60 frames per second and all this to 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.420
 board dedicated servers too 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.190
 It was apparently confirmed that the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.750
 five guardians was a multiplayer of 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.580
 sand meaning encounters 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.709
 small multiplayer like four against 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.690
 four or eight against eight however 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.600
 this does not rule out the probable possibility 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.459
 of games of 12 against 12 or higher 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.860
 in the trailer we could also observe 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.510
 something called sport and skills 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.770
 it was confirmed that the skills 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.630
 Spartans 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.060
 the same as armor skills 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.800
 but they did not specify us in 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.230
 how would they differentiate you from the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.700
 already mentioned to which we saw the spartan 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.290
 seems to have used a backpack 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.820
 propeller to strike a blow towards the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.980
 floor and end other adversaries 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.690
 will have to see that later when 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.850
 confirm a little more about it 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.830
 we could also observe a rifle 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.600
 battle without sight which seems to me a 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.730
 weird little maybe now we can 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.530
 customize our weapons by adding 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.330
 removing accessories I do not want 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.130
 insinuate a lot about this since it's mere 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.530
 my speculation and we should wait 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.450
 by official words no matter what 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.400
 mentioned my guess is that a rifle 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.770
 battle without sight would work similar 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.390
 to an automatic carbine or this weapon 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.480
 Observed at high low cost of phoenix 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.610
 this weapon called ma 5k maybe to your 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.230
 appearance for the game I can not be 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.570
 sure last but not least 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.730
 important we observe what appears to be 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.590
 a new helmet in my opinion looks like 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.330
 a son between the marc helmet 5b and the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280
 Recognition helmet has a design 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.840
 shrunk with a wide viewfinder and does not fit 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.250
 doubt that it is probably the new 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.870
 helmet predetermined for 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.420
 multiplayer leaves the five guardians 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.530
 now let's talk a little bit about the story if 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.930
 the two anniversary 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.250
 several terminals hidden around the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.500
 game that will give us clues about 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.150
 of the plot of guardians but not only 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.620
 that but it will also contain a 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.600
 prologue and an epilogue that will be 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.190
 connected to the game but more information 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.470
 of this will require both time and 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.540
 patience my personal assumption is that 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.610
 highly has something to do with the NGO 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.650
 and the spartan project and for some reason 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.450
 great mind also a kind of 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.220
 cinematic combination of halo 2 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.050
 anniversary and the five guardians are 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.549
 showed us today we can see the 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.350
 new spartan which apparently 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.510
 called clear that receiving 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.980
 instructions from the very save save or 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.930
 as some still do not know the 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.520
 Inquisitor it seems that somehow 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.350
 way they want to capture the master boss 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.060
 after some action committed in 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.490
 against the unece but there is no 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.169
 confirmation is many people are under 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.930
 the hypothesis that now the inquisitor 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.060
 it's bad but what if the boss is the 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.620
 bad not necessarily bad but the boss 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.840
 is who is disobeying the orders 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.760
 and earning a wrong punishment for 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.040
 Of course the boss will not let anything 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.960
 I can also assume that part of 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.820
 his mission is involved with recovering 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.190
 to cortana but also with the four 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.169
 runner as we observed in halo 4 the boss 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.100
 teacher is 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.199
 related to them being the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.389
 claimed and also having a code 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.370
 DNA evolved to what we can 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.260
 appreciate that the five guardians in 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.060
 truth will be the darkest delivery of the 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.040
 halo franchise to date and with 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.530
 a deep plot with sinister touches 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.690
 someone is behind jong's head and 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.430
 well this is all for this video I will be 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.900
 uploading more news from the collection 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.910
 the Master Chief and the five 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.770
 guardians as it is revealed 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.750
 but until then if you liked this 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.729
 video you could thank me with a like 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.290
 subscribe for more information like this and we 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.720
 we'll see until next time 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.530
 thank you very much for watching treated in 343 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.530
 outside
