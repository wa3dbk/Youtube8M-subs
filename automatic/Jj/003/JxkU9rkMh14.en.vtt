00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.429
 Hello, I want to show you Irina 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:12.360
 another one I dragged 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.590
 home again , her nose is on yellow 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.619
 little white 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:24.869
 fading was the fact that we are 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.429
 see what is damaged . growth therefore i 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.430
 I think that we will wait 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.770
 basal caustic 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.590
 with roots we kind of like everything is in order 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.239
 one thing is that we have greens in 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:45.170
 pot well, tobi gati and watered and kept 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:50.540
 what is our place 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:54.050
 flowers and from the fact that she was in the dark 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.120
 place with one side green on 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.550
 the other is absolutely normal 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.110
 our roots are absolutely normal 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.590
 healthy most likely that we had 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:07.190
 somehow most likely standing alone 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.310
 side to the dark 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.970
 and the other to the light so one side 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.160
 the pot is fine and here we have this 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.040
 here is green scary in this green 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.369
 absolutely nothing but we have roots 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.640
 absolutely normal and healthy and necessary 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.850
 will just get the wash out of the pot 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.200
 a pot of laundry soap 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.560
 so I understand that all very 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.220
 interesting to look at those inside 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.290
 animated cartoon 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.190
 Well, then I will prepare everything and we will be with 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.290
 you then get it out of the pot 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.280
 rinse the pot 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.710
 repot it back most likely what 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.090
 it will be necessary to cut the peduncle as he 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:00.350
 already turned yellow and he is completely orchids 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:05.900
 I did not need a second flower stalker 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:12.460
 cut or broke I donâ€™t know you 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:18.350
 see interesting us and the story 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.870
 peduncle near the point of growth but 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.180
 most likely that the growth point we had 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.910
 peduncle grew yanochka that is it us 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.220
 did not grow without a point of growth 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:33.860
 Well, we will watch we will watch 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:37.790
 this plant how she will behave him 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:43.700
 further life we will try 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:48.580
 something to do so another one became 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.010
 thank you for your attention sign 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.760
 on the channel put huskies to new meetings 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.760
 bye Bye
