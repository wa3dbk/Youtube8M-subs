Middle Ages when these great sages left

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
Middle Ages when these great sages left
we<00:00:52.260> found<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.739> only<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.760> these<00:00:54.000> names

we found that only some of these names

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.810 
we found that only some of these names
and<00:00:54.719> some<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> Spelling's<00:00:55.800> were<00:00:55.980> used

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.680 

and<00:00:59.750> we<00:00:59.930> wondered<00:01:00.380> why<00:01:00.950> this<00:01:01.010> particular

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
and we wondered why this particular

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.810 
and we wondered why this particular
selection<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.989> names<00:01:03.230> was<00:01:03.500> used<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.129> in

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
selection of names was used and in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.090 
selection of names was used and in
particular<00:01:05.030> we<00:01:05.900> wondered<00:01:06.470> whether<00:01:06.710> there

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
particular we wondered whether there

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.640 
particular we wondered whether there
were<00:01:07.220> some<00:01:07.550> process<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.870> way<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.500> the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
were some process in the way that the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.040 
were some process in the way that the
names<00:01:09.890> were<00:01:10.070> selected<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:11.090> biased<00:01:11.810> the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
names were selected that biased the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.030 
names were selected that biased the
result<00:01:12.470> in<00:01:12.920> favor<00:01:13.369> of<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:14.060> positive<00:01:14.300> outcome<00:01:15.040> so

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
result in favor of a positive outcome so

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.130 
result in favor of a positive outcome so

Mackay came up with a separate list and

Mackay came up with a separate list and

it's<00:04:44.130> an<00:04:44.280> easy<00:04:44.400> thing<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.790> do<00:04:44.910> once<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.360> get

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
itself an understatement the Bible codes

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.720 
itself an understatement the Bible codes
really<00:05:30.480> are<00:05:30.800> piddling<00:05:31.800> little<00:05:31.860> nothings<00:05:32.490> by

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
is that really that you have to go seek

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.410 
is that really that you have to go seek
some<00:05:55.020> bogus<00:05:55.470> bible<00:05:56.340> code<00:05:56.550> message<00:05:57.060> to

might devise but the Bible codes don't I
think<00:06:10.410> it's<00:06:10.530> far<00:06:10.830> better<00:06:11.040> to<00:06:11.220> have<00:06:11.730> the
