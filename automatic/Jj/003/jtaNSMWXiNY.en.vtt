 and what you do 'is not a little bit of that 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.730
 we are reminded that this oil does not 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.980
 hold at elevated temperatures 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.240
 please be careful with the heats and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.410

 to the refrigerator is not to lose this I'm going 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.440
 to put a little salt and if you are 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.410
 other side 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.380
 and we're going to let this chick grab 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.890
 color that separates them their march 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:51.390
 on the other hand let's mix in 1 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.390
 a little bit dried 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.150
 hey no flight is peshawar 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.720
 it was nothing more 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.580
 it's water and water 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.820
 soy sauce 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.820
 so it can be that it smells what 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.820
 sugar 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.880
 and I got the truth 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.920
 ok and let's put all this to take 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.530
 a boil in the fire 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.430
 joy inside where not with a 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.819
 knife let's give it here a mix 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.819
 dita 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.820
 hey and let's let it end 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.260
 cooking our already you can apply me of 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.430
 truth and now I can pass what 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.430
 whatever it is yesterday abel martÃ­n what 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.630
 nothing sticks in this does not stop at all 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.820
 because they are made with sapphire 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.620
 non-stick this means we 're going to 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.440
 be able to cook without using absolutely 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.360
 no fat 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.880
 you need nothing absolutely nothing believe me 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.700
 and some of the great wonders because 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.740
 the primes trons have pure advantages 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.230
 the advantage that we will be able to cook 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.870
 without absolutely any fats 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.200
 food does not stick 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.120
 that because they have the top layer to 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.940
 makes it heat fast 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.660
 uniformly the advantage that we are going to 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.390
 save on gas energy get hot 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.570
 very fast and of course we are going to 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.210
 save on soaps in water and in driving 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.640
 my charity 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.430
 there is also what is coming to understand 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.220
 your clear operation no no carving 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.320
 that truly carve the best 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.810
 option are the first ones are because they are going to 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.240
 power now without fast easy cooking 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.890
 simple and healthy pains have used 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.500
 really important that is very 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.500
 important that this time 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:03.490
 and it's very important to take with you 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.680
 tools to be able to achieve it because 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.750
 then it happens that we want to get a 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.699
 super healthy recipe 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.949
 at the time of cooking we realize 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.229
 that we need twice as much fat 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.960
 double that we will not do it and at the end of 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:20.590
 accounts ends up becoming a recipe 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.280
 that is no longer healthy for 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.280
 to get it 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.720
 the displayed call 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.750
