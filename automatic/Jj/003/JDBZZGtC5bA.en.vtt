00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.740 
bad carbs 160 and i'm a 3 grams over
again<00:03:59.220> not<00:03:59.579> that<00:03:59.609> bad<00:04:00.000> not<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.510> end<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.690> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
again not that bad not the end of the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.800 
again not that bad not the end of the
world<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.319> then<00:04:01.919> for<00:04:02.130> protein<00:04:02.519> 140<00:04:03.299> grams<00:04:03.540> and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
world and then for protein 140 grams and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.050 
world and then for protein 140 grams and
i'm<00:04:03.900> over<00:04:04.139> by<00:04:04.169> nine<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.980> nets<00:04:05.340> just<00:04:05.639> protein

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
i'm over by nine and nets just protein

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.110 
i'm over by nine and nets just protein
so<00:04:06.329> that's<00:04:06.540> fine<00:04:07.099> so<00:04:08.099> those<00:04:08.310> are<00:04:08.340> my<00:04:08.549> macros

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
so that's fine so those are my macros

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.449 
so that's fine so those are my macros
and<00:04:09.419> just<00:04:10.230> before<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.590> head<00:04:10.859> off<00:04:10.889> to<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.250> gym<00:04:11.400> I

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
and just before I head off to the gym I

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.280 
and just before I head off to the gym I
just<00:04:11.760> want<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:11.970> clarify<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.750> everybody's

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
just want to clarify that everybody's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.099 
just want to clarify that everybody's
goals<00:04:14.190> are<00:04:14.609> different<00:04:14.639> everybody's<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:16.079> know

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
goals are different everybody's you know

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.520 
goals are different everybody's you know
weight<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.950> height

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
weight and height

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.560 
weight and height
different<00:04:17.950> which<00:04:18.459> means<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.880> everybody's

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
different which means that everybody's

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.360 
different which means that everybody's
macros<00:04:20.139> are<00:04:20.230> different<00:04:20.650> so<00:04:20.859> mine<00:04:21.100> are

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
macros are different so mine are

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.430 
macros are different so mine are
specified<00:04:21.880> for<00:04:22.120> my<00:04:22.270> goals<00:04:22.540> my<00:04:23.110> height<00:04:23.410> my

specified for my goals my height my
weight<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:24.190> entered<00:04:24.490> all<00:04:24.760> my<00:04:24.790> information<00:04:25.180> on

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
weight I entered all my information on

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.080 
weight I entered all my information on
the<00:04:25.690> different<00:04:25.780> feature<00:04:26.230> macros<00:04:27.040> website<00:04:27.730> and
