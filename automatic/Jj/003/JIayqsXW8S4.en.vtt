00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.250
 good in today's video we're going to 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.480
 learn to play the song speaks of 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.700
 Manuel Carrasco 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.920
 and well I will teach as always 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.010
 I will teach the chords and technique 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.720
 which is used and good by different parts 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.000
 the intro 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.640
 the chorus verses and good 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.250
 I will leave a link below in the description 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.869
 where will I see where you can see a 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.480
 video to see how everything is built 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.999
 the song and for what you are watching 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.400
 of the page of tuenti enter inside 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.040
 my channel and put it you can see the video 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.420
 complete there with all the information and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.730
 of step they subscribed those that I am not 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.730
 subscribed so nothing 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.320
 the invoices that are used are doing 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.600
 it's as if we put 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.380
 but with the index finger only 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.800
 clicking here 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:05.050
 on the second string first 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:08.960
 without moving the first finger up 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.360
 but the bass to whom only in the sixth 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.990
 rope and this area 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.520
 two 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 the introduction to be caught 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 that's what makes it in the dramas is with 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.380
 this jealousy at the beginning and I go 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.330
 bouncing with everything or 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.440
 Y 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.480
 and we close 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.910
 the past is more widespread and we go with 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.820
 all the fingers and a pinch in all 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.750
 the ropes 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.750
 all right 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.000
 then outside our position and we do 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.000
 the same 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.189
 to move from this position here to this 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.490
 we go with the third the rope in the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.490
 air 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.230
 and more 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.660
 two 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.660
 and we will also do another job 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.060
 this is the intro not good now that 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.849
 we knew with the first stanza 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.930
 we start the top position in the 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.710
 sun and we would give doing the same technique 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.040
 fought 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.960
 that we have been practicing in the intro 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.530
 we would start 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.530
 Sun 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.500
 down on the finger chord 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.580
 we repeat board 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.420
 and another here 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.880
 now we will remember the sun is 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.880
 the sun and we would give low 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.620
 and the position of 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.150
 another of the sun 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.819
 and again the salt 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.459
 Y 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.620
 Well, all this verse that the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.389
 first stanza would be repeated 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.750
 but this time we would repeat them as a 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:26.610
 rhythmic base that carries the theme 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.260
 the rhythmic basis would be in them 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.500
 chords the same verse in it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.830
 afternoon wheel we would hit 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.860
 they are always down 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.110
 although good is like giving touch in the 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.380
 video that I 'm going to put you down but I 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.090
 I think we can always do it without 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.220
 to get out of time we can not is like 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.220
 more comfortable he does not like that 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.720
 and we are going to do it 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.470
 with some blow that we can his vignette 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.490
 it went up to see it 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.410
 as it is not for each one for we can 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.410
 do I say that it does so 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.100
 all right 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:22.230
 ah 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.160
 and 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.490
 but all this stanza we 've seen 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.270
 is done with this with this rhythmic base and 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.560
 Well, from here we would go into exile 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.420
 before it was very good where the chord of 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.420
 sun to start towards the chorus 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.120
 ah 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:52.689
 yes 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.780
 i 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.729
 from the heart 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.990
 yes 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:32.569
 again we do the same interval as 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.569
 previously instead of the minor 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.870
 Well, after that, it turns to 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:48.360
 repeat what is the first stanza and 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.920
 when the first verse passes and then 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.470
 there is a bridge that starts here in a network 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.529
 studying with the outskirts that the 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.149
 first on the second string 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.539
 and in the third round of having second 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:00.539
 fret 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:07.819
 yes 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.660
 we passed it to the sun 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.300
 the first fret and this 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.290
 we continue with the chair of the first 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:35.300
 fret and we would put in the third fret 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.300
 the second rope and in the fourth door 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.440
 Y 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.810
 to the 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.860
 yes 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.949
 again 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.339
 we would make the chorus work and good 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.789
 to finish then 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.789
 they share the intro 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.090
 ah 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.540
 and finish 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.230
 well then here in the tutorial today if 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:30.590
 You have any doubts anything as 

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:33.790
 comment on the comments and the putting 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.790
 the next video jaleo
