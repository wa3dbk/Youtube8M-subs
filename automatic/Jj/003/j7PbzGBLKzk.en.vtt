less m-city and computers gotten so
powerful<00:01:35.870> that<00:01:36.050> we<00:01:36.200> can<00:01:36.320> do<00:01:36.410> all<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.620> things

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.200 
powerful that we can do all the things
that<00:01:36.860> we're<00:01:37.040> dreaming<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.550> with<00:01:37.670> Sim<00:01:37.820> City<00:01:37.940> for

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
that we're dreaming of with Sim City for

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.940 
that we're dreaming of with Sim City for
things<00:01:38.780> like<00:01:38.930> make<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.170> full<00:01:39.440> bottom-up

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
things like make a full bottom-up

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.760 
things like make a full bottom-up
simulation<00:01:40.490> where<00:01:40.640> every<00:01:41.000> Sim<00:01:41.630> every<00:01:42.410> vehicle

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
simulation where every Sim every vehicle

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.140 
simulation where every Sim every vehicle
every<00:01:42.950> building<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.400> real<00:01:43.670> simulation

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.210 

so<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.870> look<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.110> this<00:01:47.230> game<00:01:47.440> is<00:01:47.710> really

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
so the look of this game is really

where<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.020> take<00:01:50.290> footage<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.980> real<00:01:51.220> city

where you take footage of a real city

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.520 
where you take footage of a real city
and<00:01:51.760> you<00:01:52.390> filter<00:01:52.780> it<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.230> looks<00:01:53.440> like

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
and you filter it so that it looks like

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.110 
and you filter it so that it looks like
a<00:01:53.650> miniature<00:01:54.130> world<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.730> know<00:01:54.820> a<00:01:54.850> world<00:01:55.030> that

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
a miniature world you know a world that

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.540 
a miniature world you know a world that
you<00:01:55.270> could<00:01:55.390> reach<00:01:55.600> into<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.170> touch<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:57.130> world

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
you could reach into and touch a world

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.430 
you could reach into and touch a world
that<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.910> smaller<00:01:58.420> than<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:59.140> you<00:01:59.260> can

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
that is smaller than you that you can

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.680 
that is smaller than you that you can
control<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.970> here<00:02:01.120> you<00:02:01.180> can<00:02:01.270> see<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.510> checked

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
control so here you can see the checked

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.120

ility<00:02:02.020> of<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.140> building<00:02:02.440> so<00:02:02.620> we're<00:02:02.860> gonna<00:02:02.950> let

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
ility of the building so we're gonna let

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.740 
ility of the building so we're gonna let
you<00:02:03.250> just<00:02:03.400> flop<00:02:03.850> them<00:02:04.030> into<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.240> world<00:02:04.390> as<00:02:04.600> if

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
you just flop them into the world as if

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.960 
you just flop them into the world as if
they're<00:02:04.870> physical<00:02:05.260> objects<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:06.580> can<00:02:06.760> build

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
they're physical objects you can build

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.700 
they're physical objects you can build
specialized<00:02:07.600> cities<00:02:07.960> that<00:02:08.410> attract

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
specialized cities that attract

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.109 
specialized cities that attract
different<00:02:08.800> sims<00:02:09.220> have<00:02:09.610> different<00:02:09.880> sorts<00:02:10.060> of

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
different sims have different sorts of

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.460 
different sims have different sorts of
buildings<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.570> them<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.140> might<00:02:11.290> have<00:02:11.410> a

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
buildings in them so you might have a

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.290 
buildings in them so you might have a
city<00:02:11.740> that's<00:02:12.040> based<00:02:12.310> around<00:02:12.550> culture<00:02:13.210> and

to track all these blue-collar Sims your

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.770 
to track all these blue-collar Sims your
