cliff in a car which looked very very
similar<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.350> mariachi<00:01:31.710> tornado<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.909> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
similar to this mariachi tornado so you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.069 
similar to this mariachi tornado so you
can<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.329> here<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.659> actually<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
can see here that you actually have the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.510 
can see here that you actually have the

actually get to see them crash as it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.179 
actually get to see them crash as it
does<00:01:42.600> fades<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> credits<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.070> is

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
does fades to the credits but this is

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.980 
does fades to the credits but this is
GTA<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.939> course<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.600> them<00:01:45.750> crash

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
GTA so of course you do see them crash

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.480 
GTA so of course you do see them crash
straight<00:01:46.350> down<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.799> they're<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:47.310> more

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
straight down and they're a little more

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.210 
straight down and they're a little more
unlucky<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.930> why<00:01:49.140> did<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.590> clip<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.860> just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
unlucky so why did in this clip is just

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730 
unlucky so why did in this clip is just
scope<00:01:50.430> across<00:01:50.790> kill<00:01:51.210> both<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.780> kill<00:01:52.560> both

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
scope across kill both of the kill both

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.350 
scope across kill both of the kill both
of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.920> girls<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> car<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.119> they

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
of the girls in the car so that they

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.850 
of the girls in the car so that they
have<00:01:54.479> no<00:01:54.630> chance<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.960> drive<00:01:55.229> away<00:01:55.409> as<00:01:55.560> when<00:01:55.770> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
have no chance to drive away as when you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.380 
have no chance to drive away as when you
do<00:01:55.979> get<00:01:56.159> close<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:56.670> will<00:01:56.820> attempt<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> drive

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
do get close they will attempt to drive

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.990 
do get close they will attempt to drive
off<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.600> cliff<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.110> blow<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.909> to

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
off the cliff and blow up so you have to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.639 
off the cliff and blow up so you have to
be<00:02:00.119> very<00:02:00.149> very<00:02:00.390> quickly<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.229> said<00:02:01.500> so

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
be very very quickly this like said so

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.929 
be very very quickly this like said so
once<00:02:01.799> you've<00:02:02.009> killed<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> two<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:02.790> need

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
once you've killed the two you then need

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.789 
once you've killed the two you then need
to<00:02:03.000> fly<00:02:03.270> over<00:02:03.299> there<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.780> recommend<00:02:04.350> using<00:02:04.619> it

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
to fly over there I recommend using it

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.170 
to fly over there I recommend using it
in<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> chopper<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.430> much<00:02:05.610> faster<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:06.149> of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
in a chopper as it's much faster way of

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.639 
in a chopper as it's much faster way of
doing<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> need<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.469> either

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
doing it and then you need to either

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.440 
doing it and then you need to either
kill<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> cops<00:02:08.310> at<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.489> back<00:02:08.700> or<00:02:08.879> parking

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
kill the cops at the back or parking

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.729 
kill the cops at the back or parking
away<00:02:09.599> where<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:10.110> harder<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.590> them<00:02:10.679> to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
away where it's much harder for them to

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.960 
away where it's much harder for them to
be<00:02:10.920> able<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.160> shoot<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.459> while<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:11.849> in

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
be able to shoot you while you get in

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.660 
be able to shoot you while you get in
the<00:02:12.060> car

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
the car

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.339 
the car
up<00:02:12.849> which<00:02:13.030> can<00:02:13.270> take<00:02:13.480> time<00:02:13.720> as<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.110> an<00:02:14.200> old

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
up which can take time as it is an old

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.280 
up which can take time as it is an old
rusty<00:02:14.560> car<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.160> actually<00:02:15.520> drive<00:02:15.970> off<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.810> this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
rusty car and actually drive off so this

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.080 
rusty car and actually drive off so this
can<00:02:17.500> be<00:02:17.530> done<00:02:17.709> offline<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.370> online<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.970> this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
can be done offline and online in this

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.729 
can be done offline and online in this
clip<00:02:19.330> actually<00:02:19.480> did<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.810> offline<00:02:20.230> because

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
clip actually did it offline because

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.620 
clip actually did it offline because
when<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.370> tried<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.610> do<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:21.849> online<00:02:22.000> ended<00:02:22.540> up

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
when I tried to do it online ended up

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.150 
when I tried to do it online ended up
crashing<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.170> car<00:02:23.200> straight<00:02:23.560> down<00:02:23.830> into<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
crashing the car straight down into the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.460 
crashing the car straight down into the
ground<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.819> did<00:02:24.970> blow<00:02:25.209> up<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.930> was<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.319> bit

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
ground and it did blow up so I was a bit

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.960 
ground and it did blow up so I was a bit
more<00:02:26.590> unlucky<00:02:26.830> with<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.370> wanted<00:02:27.730> show<00:02:27.910> you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
this offline so that you can easily see

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.530 
this offline so that you can easily see
that<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.920> available<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.400> both<00:02:30.580> remember
