00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 22 of helder we are in minecraft 1.7 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.960
 point 10 let's see a way that is 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.450
 pretty cool and is that it adds spawn 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.070
 spoilers to be able to ride the but they are 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.870
 or at least it gives me the impression of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.760
 that are much more beasts we are going to 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.900
 start watching it I'm here zombies 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.119
 pauner 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.640
 honor is a little expensive to do the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.279
 gesture and to the friend a bucket of diamonds and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.740
 four iron and four meat 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.480
 zombie and we do zombie spam but 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 is that I get the impression that it is very 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.140
 beast uncle let's make a room 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.870
 so they do not burn 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.520
 it's worth something like that let's have done a super 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.990
 battle stadium although we are not going to 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.910
 fight but good 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.880
 but I get the impression that they are 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.960
 too fast or is it not like a 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.460
 normal state what amount a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.720
 moment 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.329
 if I walk away 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.280
 further away it stops as it is so normal 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.980
 but look what was the best thing if I 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.020
 I'll wait 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.880
 they do not stop going out it 's a barbarity 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.740
 or this is for traps of musicians like this 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.740
 this mod is great 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.100
 I'm how many people are part and rock 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.420
 nor all acabÃ©is no longer in the room I 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 I made a pit bull that I put it so that 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.170
 eliminate them very much at the speed they are going 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.900
 leaving new 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.730
 It is an outrage me who are not going to 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.670
 remove first 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.960
 there it is we are going to see the following the one of 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.440
 skeletons maybe diamond 4 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.340
 of iron and 4 bones only changes the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.340
 material of the mod would be 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.260
 and it's just like these are coming out without 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.030
 stop does not look very good 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.240
 It's great but I do not know why it does not have 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.240
 arc 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.500
 because they do not have arch ie 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.080
 do not 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.080
 if they do not have perfect arch 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:07.259
 do not have a boat simply 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.470
 the year 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.630
 it is very very vast like these spaces 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.670
 sea â€‹â€‹a lot the creepers 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.670
 this scares a little bit hey 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.880
 the one of flus does not take out although it is not done 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.880
 same but with gunpowder 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.070
 it seems that creepers do not just 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.070
 work what will be a book book 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.400
 person that is why the boss 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.860
 it has to be a failure simply 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.890
 it's a shame and nothing comes out here 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.200
 directly the one of spiders that is made 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.580
 Spider eyes the same cardboard 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.980
 always but the change that works 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.340
 this is the flu is that weird of all 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.890
 forms let's put the clippers by 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.890
 there just in case for some reason 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.640
 you see here I'm too much then we have the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.350
 of slams he is testing 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.490
 here is only being four bullets 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.200
 sling if the coffee is the same as always 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.380
 this can be useful if we need 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.180
 many slim balls 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.130
 more than not because with four you already take 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.200
 look 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.120
 is that the rhythm of appearance of 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.980
 bugs is an outrage this does not come out 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.760
 directly the one of writer but for 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.680
 that works but you see what a barbarity 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.080
 the one of poisonous spiders that is done with 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.090
 Fermented eyes coffee is the same as 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.330
 always four iron blocks and one 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.330
 diamond 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.430
 is that is cool gave what can be 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.890
 useful this mode can be very useful 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.090
 silver fish that is made with blocks of 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.090
 Stoner and this one 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.970
 and this is because you can get into the 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.830
 stone 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.050
 He pointed out how my mother is disappearing 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.910
 because this will be a party I will 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.600
 win a while to see if it is getting into 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.220
 effective stone 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.050
 or something 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.480
 and then we put one of tnt that bursts 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.100
 the entire illusion system and finally 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.420
 the blaze that is done with four rods 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.510
 of blaze 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.579
 and it's the same let's put it right here 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.040
 is that you have to remove it quickly because 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.190
 this is an outrageous thing I have 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.050
 here because more illusion 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:31.720
 I do not know if it's working at all 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.720
 this if you want the stone and monster 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.280
 ok let's bust this this already 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.720
 is starting to tighten me 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.310
 so we can this and it's there 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.910
 you see out of curiosity more than 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.910
 college 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.759
 if they are not here, not rights 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.970
 not with cue 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.970
 here is jumping 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.640
 just out of curiosity to see if it's all 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.640
 full although it does not seem like 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.980
 good but there are still many from 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.920
 then this one is weird because this is when 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.330
 I put on the track a piglet takes me out 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.400
 take out any kripper estero put like this 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.070
 because I want to test how it can be 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.880
 put all 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.230
 two dots 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.230
 I have an apartment right now 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.590
 same, this is not a very good idea 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.590
 silver fish now I think about it 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.240
 same no but good is lines spiders me 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.710
 is going to tighten the minecraft creepers 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.710
 although skeletons do not come out 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.760
 Well, here zombies are worth 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.300
 just out of curiosity because this sound 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.300
 it is not done 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.550
 well that comes out hey that's cheating 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.550
 that can not go out 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.380
 my mother is that we are these are 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.639
 an awful lot of people leave the room at a rhythm 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.110
 they already leave they do not stop falling down 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.610
 to the 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.250
 rain pigeon 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.650
 look what madness this needs a lot 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.310
 block so much to flee as the 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.250
 loving frames both iron and 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.000
 diamond then equal this takes on 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.000
 do it a lot 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.009
 since they no longer fit 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:32.009
 no longer fit, I'm going to be silly 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.009
 because this is that such minecraft that 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:38.080
 area that does not fit 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.419
 we are here out of these are the 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.080
 bulls because there are too many because 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.080
 they fit so much entity 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.569
 but good description 1.7 point 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.930
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.879
 bye
