what<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.699> move<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> Shah<00:00:30.150> was<00:00:30.330> there

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
what I like to move the Shah was there

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.759 
what I like to move the Shah was there
wasn't<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.779> crazy<00:00:30.990> amount<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.289> distance<00:00:31.470> but

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
wasn't a crazy amount of distance but

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.340 
wasn't a crazy amount of distance but
that's<00:00:31.949> alright<00:00:32.160> because<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:33.000> shot<00:00:33.809> made<00:00:34.170> up

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that's alright because that shot made up

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.440 
that's alright because that shot made up
for<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.680> he<00:00:34.739> actually<00:00:34.950> did<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> variable<00:00:36.210> zoom

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
for it he actually did a variable zoom

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.950 
for it he actually did a variable zoom
shot<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> air<00:00:37.980> there<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.610> well<00:00:38.910> so

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
shot in the air there as well so

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.880 
shot in the air there as well so
hopefully<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.260> audio<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:40.680> loud<00:00:40.860> enough

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
hopefully the audio was loud enough

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.740 
hopefully the audio was loud enough
there<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> guys<00:00:41.640> could<00:00:41.850> hear<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.420> but

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
there that you guys could hear that but

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.840 
there that you guys could hear that but
I<00:00:43.079> mean<00:00:43.350> overall<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.950> was<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> six-shot<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I mean overall that was a six-shot so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.529 
I mean overall that was a six-shot so
coming<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.480> number<00:00:45.629> 4<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.320> red<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.539> this

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
coming in number 4 we got red and this

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.750 
coming in number 4 we got red and this
shot<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.170> cool<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:50.340> gonna<00:00:50.489> tell<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
shot here was cool I'm gonna tell you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.220 
shot here was cool I'm gonna tell you
why<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:50.940> didn't<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.360> hired<00:00:51.570> because<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.960> shot

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
why this didn't get hired because a shot

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.869 
why this didn't get hired because a shot
like<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.739> amazing<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> reason<00:00:53.760> i

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
like that is amazing and the reason i

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.850 
like that is amazing and the reason i
didn't<00:00:54.090> give<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.660> bit<00:00:54.870> higher<00:00:55.110> was

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
didn't give this a little bit higher was

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.290 
didn't give this a little bit higher was
just<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.210> been

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
just because if there would have been

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
just because if there would have been
one<00:00:57.600> more<00:00:57.840> spin<00:00:58.289> i<00:00:58.559> probably<00:00:58.859> would<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.160> but

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
one more spin i probably would have but

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.010 
one more spin i probably would have but
just<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.640> he<00:00:59.789> paused<00:01:00.059> there<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.539> mean<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> was

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
just that he paused there I mean it was

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.959 
just that he paused there I mean it was
a<00:01:01.079> crazy<00:01:01.469> window<00:01:02.070> shot<00:01:02.309> definitely<00:01:02.550> worthy

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
a crazy window shot definitely worthy

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.990 
a crazy window shot definitely worthy
for<00:01:03.359> number<00:01:03.690> four<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.769> maybe<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.610> more<00:01:05.760> spin

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
for number four but maybe one more spin

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.190 
for number four but maybe one more spin
could<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.270> been<00:01:06.360> added<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:06.900> hard<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
could have been added there it's hard to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.840

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
here you know a few days ago so I

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.580 
here you know a few days ago so I
thought<00:03:01.240> that<00:03:01.300> was<00:03:01.540> kind<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.810> creative<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.500> I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
thought that was kind of creative and I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.380
