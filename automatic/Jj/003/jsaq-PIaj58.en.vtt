00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hi creditors or make a video as well 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.830
 quickie for you how to roll canelinha 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.480
 on these older machines 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.440
 the new ones are like that, they are 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.700
 easier and there is so lenders have the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.609
 same problem here is that the little dog 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.619
 is loose and does not fit here because this 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.910
 line today are younger and this sax 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.340
 older machines 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.900
 then you can put a fillet of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.670
 fabric looks in here 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.779
 I cut hate a piece of very thin cloth 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.969
 I put it here 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.360
 Then you 'll fit in here before. 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.780
 As I did here you, oh, and roll a little. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.300
 from line to hand you're rolling a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.750
 little lina 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.129
 so you pass the amendment there 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.719
 then you will fit and then the line in the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.739
 my case I leave here a reel zin 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.390
 But that may be how I got here. 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.170
 just nec nec plate wilson andrade 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.930
 Finally you put the other beady eye 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.260
 thing here you come from the other side can 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:16.439
 want the room the creator here in that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:25.200
 wheel you will loose safe here and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:27.420
 runs only here for that and left en 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.329
 There you loose what counts running here. 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.970
 it's not running because it's dangerous 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.090
 Do you have teaching how to do it? 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.729
 your needle is so now you come to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.509
 under the pedal is to ensure that the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.509
 so the pedal failure 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.190
 which is already good that she does not like that 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.369
 It's very very chinese and you agree 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.200
 take away from here sometimes you can save 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.600
 this little bit like that or every time you 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.509
 take a piece of a retail and that's it 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.759
 put in your coil of your machine 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.560
 In this case, this coil is in the box and 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.940
 so played in the other video to others 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.760
 types of machines I have not see 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.410
 another video and then you'll open it here 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.660
 like I said is that squeeze her back 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:24.040
 I did not come back as I said. 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.890
 that running here is clean without 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.450
 this other part in 711 you go 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.350
 fit in and ended well 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:40.989
 I'll take the line that I've already 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:43.860
 put pass here is to be beat 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:57.910
 come back you leave this well had on top 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:59.650
 here and now on the needle on the needle there gives 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.430
 for you to see the line there 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.920
 inside 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:12.700
 So now, as a giraffe, she'll get it. 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:22.260
 you'll pull it came now has the 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:25.019
 line of the canelinha and nests here the real 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.760
 bridesmaid party motive 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.430
 then again and again he had to you the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.930
 Channel I do it even now I see 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.880
