through<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> our<00:01:16.409> world<00:01:16.890> thought<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> was

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
through the our world thought I was

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.130 
through the our world thought I was
making<00:01:18.119> art<00:01:18.270> nope

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
making art nope

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.999 
making art nope
and<00:01:20.390> well<00:01:21.390> obviously<00:01:21.720> time<00:01:22.259> went<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and well obviously time went on and I

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.390 
and well obviously time went on and I
kind<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> was<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
kind of was like that's not right like I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.719 
kind of was like that's not right like I
think<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.780> if<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:29.420> are<00:01:30.420> interested<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:32.340> art

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
think that if you are interested in art

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
think that if you are interested in art
and<00:01:34.040> you<00:01:35.040> make<00:01:35.220> something<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.509> consider

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and you make something and you consider

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.770 
and you make something and you consider
it<00:01:37.560> yourself<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.220> art<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it yourself to be art then I think that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.840 
it yourself to be art then I think that
it<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.729> your<00:01:41.729> audience's<00:01:42.680> obligation<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:44.310> view

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
it is your audience's obligation to view

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.359 
it is your audience's obligation to view
it<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.180> art<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.960> they<00:01:46.829> may<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.009> their<00:01:47.159> own

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
it as art and they may have their own

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.969 
it as art and they may have their own
opinions<00:01:47.850> about<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.990> art<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> think<00:01:49.860> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
opinions about your art but I think that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.039 
opinions about your art but I think that
is<00:01:50.130> definitely<00:01:50.159> their<00:01:50.729> obligation<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.960> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
is definitely their obligation do you

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.929 
is definitely their obligation do you
think<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.619> art<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.369> look<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.850> it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
think of it as art and to look at it

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.420 
think of it as art and to look at it
within<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.450> artistic<00:01:55.219> minded<00:01:56.420> context<00:01:57.420> thing

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
within an artistic minded context thing

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.090 
within an artistic minded context thing
do<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.549> what<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> mean<00:01:59.820> though<00:02:00.000> like<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
do you know what I mean though like and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.709 
do you know what I mean though like and
also<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> want<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.579> taken<00:02:02.880> seriously<00:02:02.909> -

also if you want to be taken seriously -

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.880 
also if you want to be taken seriously -
