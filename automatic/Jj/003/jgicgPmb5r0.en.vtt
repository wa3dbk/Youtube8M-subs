00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.060 
model that stuff I choose very low
because<00:04:26.940> my<00:04:27.210> computer<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.750> very<00:04:27.810> weak<00:04:28.410> if<00:04:28.949> you

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
because my computer is very weak if you

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.490 
because my computer is very weak if you
have<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.250> strong<00:04:29.550> computer<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.419> can<00:04:30.599> miss<00:04:31.199> you

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
have a strong computer you can miss you

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.420 
have a strong computer you can miss you
can<00:04:31.680> pay<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:32.639> at<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.389> highest<00:04:33.599> resolution

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
can pay it at the highest resolution

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.939 
can pay it at the highest resolution
anyways<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.820> suggest<00:04:36.539> you<00:04:36.660> open<00:04:36.870> your<00:04:37.500> launcher

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
anyways I suggest you open your launcher

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:44.150 
anyways I suggest you open your launcher
fix<00:04:38.820> all<00:04:39.090> of<00:04:39.120> these<00:04:39.449> stuff<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:40.669> exit<00:04:41.669> and<00:04:43.160> run
