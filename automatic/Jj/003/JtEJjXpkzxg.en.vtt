00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the seed trays lengthways and then we've

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.370 
the seed trays lengthways and then we've
got<00:00:17.580> deeper<00:00:17.940> shelves<00:00:18.300> at<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.480> bottom<00:00:18.810> which

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
three foot sections to each shelf so you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.959 
three foot sections to each shelf so you
can<00:00:33.960> change<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> spacing<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.700> need

wall<00:01:45.600> acts<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> storage<00:01:46.590> heater<00:01:46.920> warms<00:01:47.549> up

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
wall acts like a storage heater warms up

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
wall acts like a storage heater warms up
in<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> data<00:01:48.180> especially<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:48.780> some<00:01:48.960> direct

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
in the data especially into some direct

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
in the data especially into some direct
Sun<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> gives<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.670> heat<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.119> off

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
Sun on it and gives that heat back off

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
Sun on it and gives that heat back off
in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.899> evening<00:01:52.350> time<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.979> makes<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
in the evening time so it makes the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.780 
in the evening time so it makes the
growing<00:01:53.579> day<00:01:53.820> longer<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.689> then<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
growing day longer and then the

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
growing day longer and then the
framework<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.119> glazed<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.930> toughened

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
framework is then glazed in toughened

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.039 
framework is then glazed in toughened
safety<00:01:59.310> glass<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> horticultural

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
safety glass so this is horticultural

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.270 
safety glass so this is horticultural
glass<00:02:01.229> has<00:02:01.409> been<00:02:01.439> through<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.829> tough<00:02:02.070> name

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
glass has been through a tough name

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520 
glass has been through a tough name
process<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.329> makes<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:03.960> stronger<00:02:04.259> but

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
process that makes it a lot stronger but

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.859 
process that makes it a lot stronger but
also<00:02:04.590> means<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> any<00:02:05.850> sharp<00:02:06.240> edges<00:02:06.390> are

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
also means that any sharp edges are

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.320 
also means that any sharp edges are
removed<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.890> well<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.000> high

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
removed as well so if you have high

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.050 
removed as well so if you have high

winds the the framework isn't going to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.700 
winds the the framework isn't going to
lose<00:02:12.270> any<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.540> its<00:02:12.690> glazing<00:02:13.140> or<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.440> woody

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
lose any of its glazing or I can woody

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.560 
lose any of its glazing or I can woody
it<00:02:13.770> was<00:02:13.860> plastic<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.000> you've<00:02:15.150> got<00:02:15.360> a

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
it was plastic and if you've got a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.060 
it was plastic and if you've got a
couple<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.870> feet<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.020> snow<00:02:16.350> it'll<00:02:16.680> stand<00:02:16.860> on

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
couple of feet of snow it'll stand on

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.850 
couple of feet of snow it'll stand on
the<00:02:17.640> top<00:02:17.910> without<00:02:18.390> any<00:02:18.780> problems<00:02:19.230> now<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.620> lot

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
the top without any problems now a lot

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.230 
the top without any problems now a lot
of<00:02:19.950> people<00:02:20.220> sort<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.550> look<00:02:20.760> at<00:02:20.880> glass<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
of people sort of look at glass the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.210 
of people sort of look at glass the
thing<00:02:21.360> weighs<00:02:21.510> must<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.080> very<00:02:22.260> fragile<00:02:22.740> but<00:02:22.770> in

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
thing weighs must be very fragile but in

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.220 
thing weighs must be very fragile but in
actual<00:02:23.610> fact<00:02:23.640> when<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.060> go<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.420> shows<00:02:24.660> we

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
actual fact when we go to the shows we

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.980 
actual fact when we go to the shows we
use<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> cricket<00:02:25.770> ball<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.520> actually<00:02:26.990> throw

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
use a cricket ball and we actually throw

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.330 
use a cricket ball and we actually throw
it<00:02:28.110> at<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> glass<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.770> show<00:02:29.280> how<00:02:29.490> strong<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.390> is

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
it at the glass to show how strong it is

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.830 
it at the glass to show how strong it is
so<00:02:32.340> we<00:02:32.430> talked<00:02:32.640> about<00:02:32.730> Tomatoes<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:33.660> talked

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
so we talked about Tomatoes we talked

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.930 
so we talked about Tomatoes we talked
about<00:02:33.930> seedlings<00:02:34.680> early<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> year<00:02:35.400> let

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
about seedlings early on in the year let

about seedlings early on in the year let
me<00:02:36.030> get<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.450> autumn<00:02:36.840> time<00:02:36.870> we<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.740> use<00:02:37.770> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
me get to the autumn time we can use the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.660 
me get to the autumn time we can use the
grow<00:02:38.880> house<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:40.040> autumn<00:02:41.040> planting<00:02:41.550> of

and<00:02:46.740> we<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.010> use<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.190> for<00:02:47.370> overwintering

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and we can use it for overwintering

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.810 
and we can use it for overwintering
fuchsias<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:48.870> geraniums<00:02:49.770> so<00:02:50.130> all<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.730> all
