one<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.840> probably<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:34.369> think

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
one that I have is probably I think

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.030 
one that I have is probably I think
either<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.630> bottom<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.259> my<00:01:37.350> triple<00:01:37.590> helix

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
either the bottom one of my triple helix

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.819 
either the bottom one of my triple helix
or<00:01:38.220> my<00:01:38.340> conch<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> very<00:01:40.590> high

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
or my conch but I have a very high

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.140 
or my conch but I have a very high
tolerance<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.579> pain

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
tolerance for pain

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.980 
tolerance for pain
so<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.939> they<00:01:44.939> were<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.360> most<00:01:45.479> painful

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
so like that they were the most painful

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.359 
so like that they were the most painful
out<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> pain<00:01:46.979> wasn't<00:01:47.280> that

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
out of all them but the pain wasn't that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.749 
out of all them but the pain wasn't that
bad<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.820> me<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.780> mean<00:01:49.759> my
