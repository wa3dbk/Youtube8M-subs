beautiful practically speaking I find a
bit<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.299> pain<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> ass<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.950> other<00:01:17.340> things<00:01:17.460> that

the<00:01:26.369> keypads<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.090> relatively<00:01:27.930> easy<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.380> use

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the keypads is relatively easy to use

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.130 
the keypads is relatively easy to use
even<00:01:29.490> though<00:01:29.610> they're<00:01:29.759> all<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
even though they're all kind of on a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.140 
even though they're all kind of on a
level<00:01:31.439> without<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.159> having<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.729> much

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
level without really having a much

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.390 
level without really having a much
differentiation<00:01:33.960> between<00:01:34.049> buttons<00:01:34.560> there's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
differentiation between buttons there's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
differentiation between buttons there's
enough<00:01:35.700> there's<00:01:36.030> kind<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.390> bit<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.570> etching

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
enough there's kind of a bit of etching

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.060 
enough there's kind of a bit of etching
around<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> outside<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.829> actually

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
around the outside so you can actually

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.060

here<00:01:54.180> which<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.670> good<00:01:56.820> idea<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.479> you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
here which is a really good idea and you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.679 
here which is a really good idea and you
can<00:01:58.500> actually<00:01:58.770> navigate<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.280> whole<00:01:59.399> menu

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
can actually navigate the whole menu

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.060 
can actually navigate the whole menu
using<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:01.409> I'd<00:02:01.560> say<00:02:01.770> though<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.040> that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
using this what I'd say though is that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.100 
using this what I'd say though is that
it's<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.490> little<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:03.000> slow<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.270> respond<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.780> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it's a little bit slow to respond so you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.950 
it's a little bit slow to respond so you
find<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:05.189> you're<00:02:05.369> scrolling<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.600> kind

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
find that you're scrolling and it kind

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.169 
find that you're scrolling and it kind
of<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.229> slightly<00:02:07.649> before<00:02:08.160> where<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.879> want

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of it's slightly before where you want

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.490 
of it's slightly before where you want
it<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.899> does<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.349> little

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it to be and so that does get a little

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.870 
it to be and so that does get a little
bit<00:02:10.770> confusing<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.610> other

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
bit confusing the other

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.280 
bit confusing the other
thing<00:02:12.000> unnoticed<00:02:12.450> having<00:02:12.660> used<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.930> for<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.110> few

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
thing unnoticed having used it for a few

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.710 
thing unnoticed having used it for a few
days<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.460> battery<00:02:14.790> life<00:02:14.970> they<00:02:15.360> tell<00:02:15.570> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
days is the battery life they tell you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.830 
days is the battery life they tell you
is<00:02:16.130> three<00:02:17.130> days<00:02:17.310> long<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.540> actual<00:02:18.750> fact

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
is three days long but in actual fact

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.960 
is three days long but in actual fact
once<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.410> gets<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.620> halfway<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.730> suppose

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
once it gets to halfway in then suppose

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.310 
once it gets to halfway in then suppose
the<00:02:21.120> next<00:02:21.360> day<00:02:21.480> telling<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.020> there's<00:02:22.200> no

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
the next day telling you that there's no

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.540 
the next day telling you that there's no
battery<00:02:22.710> then<00:02:22.860> there's<00:02:23.040> loads<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.280> batching

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
battery then there's loads of batching

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.340 
battery then there's loads of batching
there's<00:02:23.700> no<00:02:23.760> button<00:02:24.030> has<00:02:24.120> loads<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:25.200> know

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
there's no button has loads and you know

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.290 
there's no button has loads and you know
it's<00:02:25.740> just<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.120> large

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
it's just it's a it's just a large

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.690 
it's just it's a it's just a large
decision<00:02:27.840> lies<00:02:28.260> essentially<00:02:29.010> yeah<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.640> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
decision lies essentially yeah so it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.160 
decision lies essentially yeah so it
might<00:02:29.820> just<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.240> phone<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.600> who<00:02:30.780> knows

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
might just be this phone but who knows

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.340 
might just be this phone but who knows
so<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.340> my<00:02:32.550> fairly<00:02:33.060> relatively<00:02:33.810> in-depth

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
so that is my fairly relatively in-depth

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.710 
so that is my fairly relatively in-depth
review<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.550> LG<00:02:35.850> shine<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:36.300> overall<00:02:36.630> I

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
review of the LG shine but overall I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.970 
review of the LG shine but overall I
think<00:02:36.960> actually<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.650> gonna<00:02:37.740> be<00:02:37.830> more

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
think actually it's gonna be more

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.500 
think actually it's gonna be more
