gravity<00:04:32.759> did<00:04:32.909> work<00:04:33.090> on<00:04:33.270> this<00:04:33.360> jetpack<00:04:33.599> God<00:04:33.960> and

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
gravity did work on this jetpack God and

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.209 
gravity did work on this jetpack God and
it's<00:04:34.349> going<00:04:34.439> to<00:04:34.500> be<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.620> space<00:04:34.800> dick

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
it's going to be a space dick

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:37.399 
it's going to be a space dick
so<00:04:35.370> obviously<00:04:35.879> that<00:04:36.060> messed<00:04:36.270> up<00:04:36.360> there<00:04:36.599> we're

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
so obviously that messed up there we're

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
gonna see how this and does a giant fan

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.020 
gonna see how this and does a giant fan
okay<00:04:41.250> here<00:04:41.460> it<00:04:41.550> goes

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
okay here it goes

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.070 
okay here it goes
does<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.020> giant<00:04:43.259> fan<00:04:43.530> perfectly<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.930> does

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
does a giant fan perfectly and it does

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.159 
does a giant fan perfectly and it does
able<00:04:46.409> to<00:04:46.530> shuffle<00:04:47.270> nicely<00:04:48.270> as<00:04:48.599> well<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.800> does<00:04:50.069> a

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
able to shuffle nicely as well it does a

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.959 
able to shuffle nicely as well it does a
spring<00:04:52.169> great<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:53.159> a<00:04:53.219> good<00:04:53.430> one<00:04:53.699> we<00:04:53.759> could<00:04:53.909> do

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
spring great and a good one we could do

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.270 
spring great and a good one we could do
a<00:04:54.000> double<00:04:54.180> lift<00:04:54.509> as<00:04:54.719> well<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.800> see<00:04:56.039> we<00:04:56.129> do<00:04:56.250> a

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
a double lift as well you see we do a

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.010 
a double lift as well you see we do a
double<00:04:56.460> lift<00:04:56.759> and<00:04:57.000> we<00:04:57.120> can<00:04:57.270> do<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.419> color<00:04:57.719> change

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
double lift and we can do a color change

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.589 
double lift and we can do a color change
and<00:04:58.259> it<00:04:58.439> does<00:04:58.650> which<00:04:59.039> other<00:04:59.250> changes<00:04:59.789> well<00:05:00.000> if

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
and it does which other changes well if

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.059 
and it does which other changes well if
flips<00:05:00.930> great<00:05:01.199> and<00:05:01.409> it's<00:05:01.500> just<00:05:01.620> an<00:05:01.710> all-around

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
flips great and it's just an all-around

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.820 
flips great and it's just an all-around
nice<00:05:02.430> deck<00:05:02.819> I<00:05:03.120> like<00:05:03.900> it<00:05:04.169> Savannah<00:05:04.500> wasn't<00:05:04.770> a

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
nice deck I like it Savannah wasn't a

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.709 
nice deck I like it Savannah wasn't a
big<00:05:04.949> fan<00:05:04.979> apparently<00:05:05.550> but<00:05:05.849> I<00:05:06.060> don't<00:05:06.449> seem<00:05:06.689> to

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
big fan apparently but I don't seem to

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:08.149 
big fan apparently but I don't seem to
mind<00:05:06.960> it<00:05:07.169> I<00:05:07.229> think<00:05:07.379> it's<00:05:07.469> quite<00:05:07.620> cool<00:05:07.889> very

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159
