this hoping for them to really see that

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.899 
this hoping for them to really see that
the<00:01:46.979> cinematic<00:01:47.979> opening<00:01:48.310> we<00:01:48.369> want<00:01:48.549> we<00:01:48.729> showed

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
the cinematic opening we want we showed

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.059 
the cinematic opening we want we showed
back<00:01:49.179> in<00:01:49.210> Los<00:01:49.479> Angeles<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.990> not<00:01:50.109> just<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.860> fluke

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
back in Los Angeles is not just a fluke

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.800 
back in Los Angeles is not just a fluke
it's<00:01:51.250> actually<00:01:51.579> how<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.909> game<00:01:52.149> is<00:01:52.360> it's<00:01:52.600> very

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
it's actually how the game is it's very

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.080 
it's actually how the game is it's very
cinematic<00:01:53.200> right<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.679> it's<00:01:53.799> full<00:01:54.759> of<00:01:54.880> choice

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
cinematic right and it's full of choice

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.429 
cinematic right and it's full of choice
so<00:01:55.390> that's<00:01:55.659> what<00:01:55.780> we're<00:01:55.899> hoping<00:01:55.990> they<00:01:56.229> take

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
so that's what we're hoping they take

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.559 
so that's what we're hoping they take
away<00:01:56.619> from<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:57.069> it's<00:01:57.280> reaffirming<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
away from this that it's reaffirming the

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.539 
away from this that it's reaffirming the
abilities<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.020> 47<00:01:59.860> and<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.069> it<00:02:00.189> is<00:02:00.219> a<00:02:00.310> very

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
abilities of 47 and that it is a very

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.730 
abilities of 47 and that it is a very
cinematic<00:02:01.000> game<00:02:01.299> we're<00:02:01.420> building<00:02:01.740> absolution

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
cinematic game we're building absolution

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.469 
cinematic game we're building absolution
has<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.890> far<00:02:03.130> more<00:02:03.280> personal<00:02:03.759> story<00:02:04.030> than<00:02:04.299> the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
has a far more personal story than the

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.300 
has a far more personal story than the
previous<00:02:04.840> games<00:02:05.079> so<00:02:05.439> and<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:05.979> is<00:02:06.159> something

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
previous games so and this is something

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.520 
previous games so and this is something
that's<00:02:06.670> been<00:02:06.909> it's<00:02:07.810> been<00:02:07.899> tough<00:02:08.229> for<00:02:08.259> us<00:02:08.470> to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
that's been it's been tough for us to

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.139 
that's been it's been tough for us to
work<00:02:08.890> with<00:02:08.920> because<00:02:09.250> it's<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.700> different<00:02:10.030> way

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
work with because it's a different way

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.600 
work with because it's a different way
of<00:02:10.179> telling<00:02:10.599> a<00:02:10.660> story<00:02:10.869> than<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:12.250> classically

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
of telling a story than we classically

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.330 
of telling a story than we classically
did<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.660> also<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.470> team<00:02:14.680> has<00:02:14.860> been<00:02:15.010> learning<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
did so also the team has been learning a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.120 
did so also the team has been learning a
lot<00:02:15.390> during<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.720> years<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.319> how<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.680> kind<00:02:18.069> of

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
lot during the years to how to kind of

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.190 
lot during the years to how to kind of
integrate<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:19.060> story<00:02:19.390> within<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.900> levels

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
integrate the story within the levels

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.039 
integrate the story within the levels
without<00:02:20.489> compromising<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.750> player<00:02:22.750> choice

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
without compromising the player choice

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.839 
without compromising the player choice
for<00:02:23.470> me<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:23.799> really<00:02:23.920> important<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:24.579> they

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
for me it's really important that they

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.270 
for me it's really important that they
see<00:02:25.269> just<00:02:25.720> how<00:02:25.900> much<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.110> can<00:02:26.349> do<00:02:26.530> as<00:02:26.680> 1847

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
see just how much you can do as 1847

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.569 
see just how much you can do as 1847
this<00:02:27.549> time<00:02:27.700> around<00:02:27.819> which<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.690> why<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:28.989> don't

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
this time around which is why we don't

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.770 
this time around which is why we don't
go<00:02:30.579> through<00:02:30.610> where<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.360> actually<00:02:31.630> two

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
go through where that is actually two

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.479 
go through where that is actually two
playthroughs<00:02:31.959> first<00:02:32.829> one<00:02:32.980> where<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.310> play<00:02:33.459> a

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
playthroughs first one where we play a

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.009 
playthroughs first one where we play a
more<00:02:33.670> professional<00:02:33.940> style<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.660> then<00:02:34.840> one

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
more professional style and then one

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.509 
more professional style and then one
where<00:02:35.230> we<00:02:35.319> play<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.470> more<00:02:35.620> freestyle<00:02:36.190> where<00:02:36.400> we

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
where we play a more freestyle where we

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.949 
where we play a more freestyle where we
end<00:02:36.640> up<00:02:36.700> killing<00:02:37.000> quite<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.209> few<00:02:37.420> people<00:02:37.720> and

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
end up killing quite a few people and

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.840 
end up killing quite a few people and
it's<00:02:38.410> all<00:02:38.560> kind<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.130> show<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
it's all kind of to show that the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.150 
it's all kind of to show that the
Arsenal<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.359> now<00:02:40.510> kind<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.590> full<00:02:41.799> circle

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
Arsenal is now kind of the full circle

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.979 
Arsenal is now kind of the full circle
it's<00:02:42.340> well<00:02:42.549> rounded<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:43.060> think<00:02:43.480> we<00:02:43.630> are<00:02:43.750> this

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
it's well rounded I think we are this

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.319 
it's well rounded I think we are this
time<00:02:44.220> able<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.310> cater<00:02:45.489> for<00:02:45.670> all<00:02:45.730> sorts<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.150> play

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
time able to cater for all sorts of play

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:47.940 
time able to cater for all sorts of play
styles<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.840> then<00:02:47.319> make<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.739> player's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
styles and then make it the player's

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.550 
styles and then make it the player's
choice<00:02:48.190> when<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.639> change<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.359> oh<00:02:49.480> if<00:02:50.049> there<00:02:50.350> if

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
choice when to change it oh if there if

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.199 
choice when to change it oh if there if
you<00:02:50.709> screw<00:02:51.130> up<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.310> little<00:02:51.519> bit<00:02:51.639> and<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:52.030> have

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
you screw up a little bit and you have

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.030 
you screw up a little bit and you have
to<00:02:52.329> change<00:02:52.540> your<00:02:52.630> gear<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.650> do<00:02:53.889> that

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
to change your gear you can do that

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:09.900 
to change your gear you can do that
right<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.489> clean<00:02:55.150> up

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.550 

it's<00:03:10.910> been<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.180> backbone<00:03:11.360> of<00:03:11.630> i/o<00:03:11.959> ever<00:03:12.260> since

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
it's been the backbone of i/o ever since

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.640 
it's been the backbone of i/o ever since
it<00:03:12.709> started<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.790> was<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.690> technology<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.500> was

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
it started it was the technology I was

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.320 
it started it was the technology I was
made<00:03:15.800> for<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.069> first<00:03:16.190> hitman<00:03:16.610> game<00:03:16.819> also<00:03:17.060> laid

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
made for the first hitman game also laid

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.420 
made for the first hitman game also laid
the<00:03:17.450> foundation<00:03:17.959> for<00:03:17.990> every<00:03:18.530> other<00:03:18.830> game<00:03:19.220> we

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the foundation for every other game we

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.940 
the foundation for every other game we
did<00:03:19.610> up<00:03:20.090> until<00:03:20.270> this<00:03:20.569> point<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.470> it's<00:03:21.590> only<00:03:21.800> now

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
did up until this point so it's only now

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.410 
did up until this point so it's only now
that<00:03:21.980> we<00:03:22.340> actually<00:03:22.610> got<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.819> opportunity<00:03:23.000> to

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
that we actually got the opportunity to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.940 
that we actually got the opportunity to
make<00:03:23.569> completely<00:03:24.110> new<00:03:24.230> technology<00:03:24.800> from

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
make completely new technology from

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.280 
make completely new technology from
scratch<00:03:25.280> which<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.060> called<00:03:26.209> laser<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.720> which

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
scratch which is called laser to which

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.820 
scratch which is called laser to which
is<00:03:27.380> was<00:03:27.530> powering<00:03:27.890> absolution<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.850> it's<00:03:29.030> made

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
is was powering absolution and it's made

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.990 
is was powering absolution and it's made
completely<00:03:30.830> in<00:03:31.130> fusion<00:03:31.580> with<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.850> game

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
completely in fusion with the game

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.670 
completely in fusion with the game
design<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.600> everything<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.380> mechanics

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
design so everything that the mechanics

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.130 
design so everything that the mechanics
needs<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.970> art<00:03:35.120> direction<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.810> sound

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
needs and the art direction and sound

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.930 
needs and the art direction and sound
needs<00:03:36.500> it's<00:03:36.920> been<00:03:37.100> made<00:03:37.250> custom<00:03:37.489> for<00:03:37.850> this

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
needs it's been made custom for this

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.080 
needs it's been made custom for this
game<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.480> very<00:03:39.110> excited<00:03:39.560> about<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:40.160> mean
