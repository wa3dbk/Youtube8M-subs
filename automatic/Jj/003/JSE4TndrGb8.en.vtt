playing<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.940> Division<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.329> now<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.629> think<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
playing in Division one now I think I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.779 
playing in Division one now I think I
maybe<00:00:43.079> built<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.070> my<00:00:44.129> head<00:00:44.219> too<00:00:44.579> much

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
maybe built it up in my head too much

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.880 
maybe built it up in my head too much
and<00:00:45.059> made<00:00:45.600> too<00:00:45.899> much<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.289> big<00:00:46.440> deal<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and made too much of a big deal out of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.500 
and made too much of a big deal out of
it<00:00:47.039> psychologically<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.879> acted<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
it psychologically and acted as if it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.790 
it psychologically and acted as if it
was<00:00:48.629> something<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.079> couldn't<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.680> in

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
was something that I couldn't do when in

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
was something that I couldn't do when in
reality<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> definitely<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.480> this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
reality I can definitely get out of this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.970 
reality I can definitely get out of this
took<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:51.960> obviously<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.469> can't<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
took well obviously you can't get out of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.110 
took well obviously you can't get out of
this<00:00:53.039> division<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.579> that's<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:53.940> much<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this division so that's pretty much a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
this division so that's pretty much a
lie<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.780> definitely<00:00:54.870> maintain<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
lie but I can definitely maintain a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.040 
lie but I can definitely maintain a
place<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.460> division<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.510> go<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.840> nail

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the most infuriating part of playing

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.310 
the most infuriating part of playing
ultimate<00:01:29.189> team<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.420> me<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.630> used<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.140> be

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
ultimate team like for me it used to be

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
ultimate team like for me it used to be
people<00:01:31.890> who<00:01:32.130> cut<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> ball<00:01:32.700> across<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> face

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
people who cut the ball across the face

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
people who cut the ball across the face
of<00:01:33.420> goal<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> sweat<00:01:34.350> basically<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of goal and sweat basically but that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
of goal and sweat basically but that
doesn't<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:35.820> bother<00:01:36.150> me<00:01:36.299> anymore<00:01:36.630> because

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
doesn't really bother me anymore because

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200 
doesn't really bother me anymore because
it's<00:01:37.229> almost<00:01:37.619> expected<00:01:38.100> now<00:01:38.640> especially<00:01:38.909> with

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it's almost expected now especially with

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120

the<00:01:39.329> ad<00:01:39.560> especially<00:01:40.560> with<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> addition<00:01:41.040> of

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the ad especially with the addition of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.679 
the ad especially with the addition of
the<00:01:41.250> divisions<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.880> stuff<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.270> it's

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the divisions and stuff like that it's

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.499 
the divisions and stuff like that it's
an<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:44.070> almost<00:01:44.369> expected<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:45.030> people<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
an it's almost expected of people and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
an it's almost expected of people and
it's<00:01:45.630> almost<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.590> high<00:01:46.799> level<00:01:47.159> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it's almost like a high level of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.460 
it's almost like a high level of
competitiveness<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:48.119> pretty<00:01:48.780> much<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> given

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
competitiveness is pretty much the given

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.899 
competitiveness is pretty much the given
when<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.950> play<00:01:50.130> ultimate<00:01:50.520> team<00:01:50.670> at<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
when you play ultimate team at the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.450 
when you play ultimate team at the
moment<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.409> for<00:01:52.409> me<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:52.740> its<00:01:53.130> people<00:01:53.430> who

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
moment so for me I think its people who

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.800 
moment so for me I think its people who
just<00:01:53.549> dropped<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.119> controller<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
just dropped the controller in the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.929 
just dropped the controller in the
middle<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.170> game<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.680> people<00:01:56.490> who<00:01:56.520> start

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
middle of a game or people who start

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.340 
middle of a game or people who start
passing<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.479> around<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.780> defense<00:01:58.079> look<00:01:58.259> at

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
passing it around the defense look at

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.840 
passing it around the defense look at
that<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> absolutely<00:01:58.920> destroyed<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> guy<00:01:59.670> by

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that I absolutely destroyed that guy by

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.580 
that I absolutely destroyed that guy by
the<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.149> that's<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.689> nice<00:02:00.869> welcome<00:02:01.049> back<00:02:01.409> to

the way so that's a nice welcome back to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.420 
the way so that's a nice welcome back to
division<00:02:01.799> 1<00:02:02.100> and

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
standings are like because we've got

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.290 
standings are like because we've got
seven<00:02:07.780> games<00:02:08.110> remaining<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:09.369> get<00:02:09.550> 18<00:02:09.940> points

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
because I've said it's mike easier but

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.490 
because I've said it's mike easier but
not<00:02:57.970> suree<00:02:58.150> know<00:02:58.450> they're<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.720> sentiment<00:02:59.290> has

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
not suree know they're a sentiment has

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.320

defensive<00:03:01.959> workrate<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.320> think<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.340> he's

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
defensive workrate I think it is so he's
