00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
motor superfast super powerful and it's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.889 
motor superfast super powerful and it's
got<00:01:51.450> dual<00:01:52.110> fuel<00:01:52.409> injectors<00:01:53.360> one<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:54.540> near<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
got dual fuel injectors one up near the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.330 
got dual fuel injectors one up near the
you<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:55.200> throttle<00:01:55.619> body<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.950> then<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:56.219> up

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you know throttle body and then one up

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.679 
you know throttle body and then one up
in<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> air<00:01:56.700> box<00:01:56.909> too<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.479> really

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
in the air box too and that really

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.480 
in the air box too and that really
boosts<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> top<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> let's<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.130> motor

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
boosts the top in and let's that motor

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.230 
boosts the top in and let's that motor
bring<00:01:59.729> him

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
bring him

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.569 
bring him
harder<00:02:00.479> faster<00:02:00.720> at<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> other<00:02:01.409> revs<00:02:01.619> yeah<00:02:02.369> now

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
harder faster at the other revs yeah now

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.190 
harder faster at the other revs yeah now
from<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.850> handling<00:02:03.210> perspective<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:04.020> weren't

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
from a handling perspective we weren't

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.990 
from a handling perspective we weren't
quite<00:02:04.320> as<00:02:04.409> pleased<00:02:04.829> about<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.430> Cowie<00:02:05.640> as<00:02:05.880> we

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
quite as pleased about the Cowie as we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.880 
quite as pleased about the Cowie as we
were<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> motor<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.170> think

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
were with the motor on it I think

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
were with the motor on it I think
personally<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> bike<00:02:08.849> took<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.300> couple<00:02:09.539> steps

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
personally the bike took a couple steps

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.240 
personally the bike took a couple steps
backwards<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.130> bit

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
backwards just it's a little bit

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.010 
backwards just it's a little bit
unbalanced<00:02:11.849> how<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.630> describe<00:02:12.840> that

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
unbalanced how would you describe that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
unbalanced how would you describe that
in<00:02:13.470> terms<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.980> changes<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.400> they<00:02:14.489> made

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
in terms of the changes that they made

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.160 
in terms of the changes that they made
because<00:02:14.849> they<00:02:15.120> boosted<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> size<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
because they boosted the size of the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.380 
because they boosted the size of the
separate<00:02:17.040> function<00:02:17.400> Fork<00:02:17.610> has<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.940> show<00:02:18.180> up

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
separate function Fork has got a show up

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.259 
separate function Fork has got a show up
front<00:02:18.720> was<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> 47<00:02:20.040> last<00:02:20.250> year<00:02:20.459> now<00:02:20.640> it's<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> 48

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
front was a 47 last year now it's the 48

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.270 
front was a 47 last year now it's the 48
mil<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.870> how<00:02:22.290> does<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.470> play<00:02:22.769> into<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
mil so how does that play into the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.589 
mil so how does that play into the
overall<00:02:23.519> opinion<00:02:23.760> what<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.120> thought<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.360> it

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
overall opinion what we thought of it

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.570 
overall opinion what we thought of it
the<00:02:24.870> fork<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.319> suspension<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:26.040> agree<00:02:26.430> with

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
the fork in the suspension I agree with

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.240 
the fork in the suspension I agree with
you<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.730> think<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.959> step<00:02:28.410> backwards<00:02:29.010> from

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
you I think it is a step backwards from

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.380 
you I think it is a step backwards from
the<00:02:29.340> 2012<00:02:30.530> me<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.709> fork<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.340> too<00:02:32.880> stiff<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
the 2012 me the fork is too stiff and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.900 
the 2012 me the fork is too stiff and
I'm<00:02:33.540> 165<00:02:34.530> pounds<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.100> ride<00:02:35.310> pretty<00:02:35.580> fast

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
I'm 165 pounds and I ride pretty fast

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.870 
I'm 165 pounds and I ride pretty fast
and<00:02:36.440> for<00:02:37.440> being<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.010> too<00:02:38.130> stiff<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
and for being it too stiff on it to the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.330 
and for being it too stiff on it to the
F<00:02:38.970> that's<00:02:39.200> that's<00:02:40.200> quite<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> bit<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.980> know<00:02:41.100> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
F that's that's quite a bit you know and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.539 
F that's that's quite a bit you know and
the<00:02:42.030> shock<00:02:42.299> is<00:02:42.540> built<00:02:42.780> for<00:02:43.049> comfort<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
the shock is built for comfort and the

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.580 
the shock is built for comfort and the
forks<00:02:44.880> are<00:02:45.000> built<00:02:45.239> for<00:02:45.450> performance<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:46.260> know

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
forks are built for performance you know

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.400 
forks are built for performance you know
so<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.130> really<00:02:47.970> tried<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.450> ride<00:02:48.660> harder<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.319> the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
so I really tried to ride harder on the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.190 
so I really tried to ride harder on the
front<00:02:49.650> end<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.390> was<00:02:51.510> too<00:02:51.540> harsh<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:51.959> me

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
front end it just was too harsh for me

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.259 
front end it just was too harsh for me
on<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.440> front<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.890> was<00:02:53.010> predicting<00:02:53.760> my<00:02:53.850> corner

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
on the front it was predicting my corner

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.860 
on the front it was predicting my corner
which<00:02:54.480> hearted<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.290> set<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:55.830> me<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.870> like

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
which hearted to set up for me so like

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.039 
which hearted to set up for me so like
you<00:02:57.959> said<00:02:58.110> unbalanced<00:02:58.799> was<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.069> key<00:02:59.220> word

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
you said unbalanced was the key word

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.750 
you said unbalanced was the key word
felt<00:03:01.049> low<00:03:01.319> in<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> rear<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:02.250> always<00:03:02.519> tried<00:03:02.730> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
felt low in the rear I always tried to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.190 
felt low in the rear I always tried to
bring<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> rear<00:03:03.239> up<00:03:03.390> but<00:03:03.599> nothing<00:03:03.989> seemed<00:03:04.170> to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
bring the rear up but nothing seemed to

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.160 
bring the rear up but nothing seemed to
work<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.859> I<00:03:04.890> just<00:03:05.060> need<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.209> maybe<00:03:06.570> take<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> step

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
work so I just need to maybe take a step

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.050 
work so I just need to maybe take a step
down<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.560> fourth<00:03:07.859> now<00:03:08.609> just<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.940> clarify

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
down on the fourth now just to clarify

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.819 
down on the fourth now just to clarify
do<00:03:09.359> you<00:03:09.480> think<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.870> Cowie<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> front<00:03:10.739> end

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
do you think the Cowie is a front end

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.349 
do you think the Cowie is a front end
steering<00:03:11.190> bike<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.760> maybe<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.060> little<00:03:12.180> bit

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
steering bike like maybe a little bit

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.729 
steering bike like maybe a little bit
more<00:03:12.480> weight<00:03:12.660> on<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.930> front<00:03:13.049> or<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.560> lower

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
more weight on the front or is it lower

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.220 
more weight on the front or is it lower
in<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.010> back<00:03:14.299> it's<00:03:15.299> more<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.600> a<00:03:15.660> rear<00:03:15.870> steering

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
in the back it's more of a rear steering

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.259 
in the back it's more of a rear steering
bike<00:03:16.470> but<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:17.040> come<00:03:17.400> up<00:03:17.579> in<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.820> years<00:03:18.060> where

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
bike but it's come up in the years where

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.430 
bike but it's come up in the years where
you<00:03:18.420> can't<00:03:18.660> steer<00:03:18.840> at<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.989> front<00:03:19.200> end<00:03:19.320> not

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
you can't steer at the front end not

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.949 
you can't steer at the front end not
like<00:03:19.680> it's<00:03:19.890> big<00:03:20.160> brother<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.459> 450<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.209> the

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
like it's big brother the 450 is the

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
and you change them it's not something

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.129 
and you change them it's not something
like<00:05:24.260> I<00:05:24.530> don't

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
like I don't

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.689 
like I don't
you<00:05:25.590> feel<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:25.979> yeah<00:05:26.189> you<00:05:26.249> can<00:05:26.460> with<00:05:26.550> all<00:05:26.669> the

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
you feel it yeah you can with all the

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.420 
you feel it yeah you can with all the
show<00:05:26.879> you<00:05:27.210> can<00:05:27.360> tell<00:05:27.860> yeah<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.069> I<00:05:29.099> think<00:05:29.340> the

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
show you can tell yeah and I think the

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.189 
show you can tell yeah and I think the
separate<00:05:29.729> function<00:05:30.060> Fork<00:05:30.300> is<00:05:30.419> here<00:05:30.629> to<00:05:30.719> stay<00:05:30.990> I

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
separate function Fork is here to stay I

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.899 
separate function Fork is here to stay I
just<00:05:31.620> think<00:05:31.770> how<00:05:31.919> it<00:05:32.069> pushed<00:05:32.430> it<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.610> bit<00:05:32.759> too

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:32.909 
just think how it pushed it a bit too

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:34.999 
just think how it pushed it a bit too
far<00:05:32.939> as<00:05:33.389> far<00:05:33.629> as<00:05:33.659> the<00:05:34.199> stiffness<00:05:34.620> out<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:34.919> the

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
far as far as the stiffness out of the

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:36.200 
far as far as the stiffness out of the
thing<00:05:35.189> stuff<00:05:35.490> which<00:05:35.729> she's<00:05:35.879> been<00:05:35.999> doing<00:05:36.120> a

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
thing stuff which she's been doing a

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.989 
thing stuff which she's been doing a
little<00:05:36.270> long<00:05:36.479> so<00:05:37.229> in<00:05:38.099> in<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.669> grander<00:05:38.969> scheme

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
little long so in in the grander scheme

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.550 
little long so in in the grander scheme
of<00:05:39.210> the<00:05:39.360> shootout<00:05:39.689> where<00:05:39.900> does<00:05:40.050> it<00:05:40.169> settle<00:05:40.409> for

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
of the shootout where does it settle for

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.649 
of the shootout where does it settle for
you<00:05:40.680> Kiefer<00:05:41.039> and<00:05:41.219> and<00:05:41.370> as<00:05:41.819> a<00:05:41.849> stock<00:05:42.210> race<00:05:42.419> bike

you Kiefer and and as a stock race bike

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.610 
you Kiefer and and as a stock race bike
how<00:05:42.810> do<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:42.960> feel<00:05:43.110> about<00:05:43.139> it

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
how do you feel about it

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.980 
how do you feel about it
that<00:05:44.340> was<00:05:44.460> close<00:05:44.729> i<00:05:44.909> rated<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.300> second<00:05:45.749> the

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
that was close i rated it second the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.129 
that was close i rated it second the
motor<00:05:46.560> is<00:05:46.710> great<00:05:47.419> like<00:05:48.419> I<00:05:48.539> said<00:05:48.719> I<00:05:48.749> could<00:05:49.020> have

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
motor is great like I said I could have

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:51.019 
motor is great like I said I could have
used<00:05:49.349> a<00:05:49.499> little<00:05:49.529> bit<00:05:49.740> more<00:05:49.860> comfort<00:05:50.759> in<00:05:50.909> the

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:51.029 
used a little bit more comfort in the

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.830 
used a little bit more comfort in the
fork<00:05:51.270> like<00:05:51.599> the<00:05:51.779> shock<00:05:53.419> like<00:05:54.419> dirt<00:05:54.629> router

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840

fork like the shock like dirt router
does<00:05:55.080> we're<00:05:55.319> gonna<00:05:55.529> go<00:05:55.620> out<00:05:55.740> to<00:05:55.889> the<00:05:56.009> you<00:05:56.159> know

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:56.189 
does we're gonna go out to the you know

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.969 
does we're gonna go out to the you know
to<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.879> year<00:05:57.090> 2013<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:58.169> mess<00:05:58.379> around<00:05:58.409> with<00:05:58.710> it

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
to the year 2013 and mess around with it

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.189 
to the year 2013 and mess around with it
and<00:05:59.250> try<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.490> change<00:05:59.729> it<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.300> get<00:06:00.870> towards

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
and try to change it and get towards

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:04.189 
and try to change it and get towards
more<00:06:01.349> comfortable<00:06:02.360> but<00:06:03.360> it's<00:06:03.810> still<00:06:04.050> it's

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
more comfortable but it's still it's

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.899 
more comfortable but it's still it's
such<00:06:04.409> a<00:06:04.439> good<00:06:04.650> bike<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:05.219> I<00:06:05.340> wish<00:06:05.550> it<00:06:05.699> would

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
such a good bike and I wish it would

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.820 
such a good bike and I wish it would
hold<00:06:06.659> up<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:06.960> little<00:06:07.169> bit<00:06:07.289> better<00:06:07.469> you<00:06:07.680> know

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
hold up a little bit better you know

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.629 
hold up a little bit better you know
over<00:06:08.430> time<00:06:08.610> it<00:06:08.789> does<00:06:08.819> feel<00:06:09.090> a<00:06:09.120> little<00:06:09.150> raggedy

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
over time it does feel a little raggedy

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.100 
over time it does feel a little raggedy
but<00:06:11.639> overall<00:06:11.939> it's<00:06:12.180> a<00:06:12.240> solid<00:06:12.270> package<00:06:12.719> just

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
but overall it's a solid package just

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.629 
but overall it's a solid package just
was<00:06:13.229> some<00:06:13.379> suspension<00:06:13.710> changes<00:06:13.979> managed<00:06:14.460> it

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
was some suspension changes managed it

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.820 
was some suspension changes managed it
could<00:06:14.789> have<00:06:14.879> one<00:06:15.000> I<00:06:15.029> think<00:06:15.360> yeah<00:06:16.199> I<00:06:16.409> think<00:06:16.469> it

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
could have one I think yeah I think it

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.320 
could have one I think yeah I think it
was<00:06:16.889> close<00:06:17.129> for<00:06:17.339> me<00:06:17.490> too<00:06:17.669> but<00:06:17.909> I<00:06:17.969> would<00:06:18.180> also

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
was close for me too but I would also

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.119 
was close for me too but I would also
rate<00:06:18.629> ranked<00:06:18.990> in<00:06:19.139> second<00:06:19.500> behind<00:06:19.589> the<00:06:19.830> Honda

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:20.129 
rate ranked in second behind the Honda

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.279 
rate ranked in second behind the Honda
just<00:06:20.339> in<00:06:20.460> terms<00:06:20.669> of<00:06:20.879> usability<00:06:21.629> on<00:06:22.050> every

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
just in terms of usability on every

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.079 
just in terms of usability on every
single<00:06:22.620> track<00:06:22.860> you<00:06:23.550> know<00:06:23.610> for<00:06:23.819> me<00:06:23.909> it<00:06:23.999> was

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.089 
single track you know for me it was

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.629 
single track you know for me it was
easier<00:06:24.419> to<00:06:24.659> I<00:06:25.169> think<00:06:25.770> you<00:06:26.009> can<00:06:26.159> make<00:06:26.279> the<00:06:26.370> Honda

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
easier to I think you can make the Honda

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:27.890 
easier to I think you can make the Honda
run<00:06:26.789> like<00:06:26.939> the<00:06:27.060> Kawasaki<00:06:27.509> in<00:06:27.659> the<00:06:27.719> motor

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
run like the Kawasaki in the motor

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.079 
run like the Kawasaki in the motor
department<00:06:28.439> then<00:06:28.919> to<00:06:29.009> make<00:06:29.159> the<00:06:29.460> Kawasaki

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
department then to make the Kawasaki

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.700 
department then to make the Kawasaki
handle<00:06:30.509> like<00:06:30.629> a<00:06:30.659> Honda<00:06:30.990> does<00:06:31.139> in<00:06:31.319> terms<00:06:31.469> of

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
handle like a Honda does in terms of

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.170 
handle like a Honda does in terms of
like<00:06:31.860> all-around<00:06:32.400> comfort<00:06:32.639> and<00:06:32.939> just<00:06:33.060> how

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
like all-around comfort and just how

tough<00:06:41.789> you<00:06:42.330> know<00:06:42.419> I<00:06:42.479> think<00:06:42.569> it's<00:06:43.020> right<00:06:43.319> up

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:43.439 
tough you know I think it's right up

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:44.779 
tough you know I think it's right up
there<00:06:43.560> with<00:06:43.620> the<00:06:43.800> Honda<00:06:43.979> the<00:06:44.159> motor<00:06:44.370> is<00:06:44.550> so

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
there with the Honda the motor is so

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.459 
there with the Honda the motor is so
good<00:06:45.029> that<00:06:45.060> just<00:06:45.659> carries<00:06:45.870> some<00:06:46.229> of<00:06:46.259> the

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:46.469 
good that just carries some of the

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.679 
good that just carries some of the
traits<00:06:47.370> that<00:06:47.520> are<00:06:47.639> knocking<00:06:48.000> it<00:06:48.120> away<00:06:48.389> from

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:48.689 
traits that are knocking it away from

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.019 
traits that are knocking it away from
the<00:06:48.810> Honda<00:06:49.080> a<00:06:49.139> bit<00:06:49.289> but<00:06:49.469> for<00:06:50.159> me<00:06:50.399> you<00:06:50.849> know<00:06:50.939> the

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:51.029 
the Honda a bit but for me you know the

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:52.219 
the Honda a bit but for me you know the
Honda<00:06:51.270> corners<00:06:51.599> a<00:06:51.629> little<00:06:51.719> easier<00:06:52.110> it's<00:06:52.199> a

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
Honda corners a little easier it's a

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:53.990 
Honda corners a little easier it's a
little<00:06:52.439> easier<00:06:52.680> ride<00:06:52.830> joeys<00:06:53.520> have<00:06:53.849> always

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
on what your position is in the corners

00:06:59.300 --> 00:06:59.310 
and if you're not as aggressive as I

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.649

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659 
keep airing guys who hold the bike and

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.689 
keep airing guys who hold the bike and
wide<00:07:00.839> open<00:07:01.229> to<00:07:01.349> everything<00:07:01.680> like<00:07:02.039> pro<00:07:02.279> guys

they<00:07:03.360> just<00:07:03.569> ride<00:07:03.719> the<00:07:03.870> rear<00:07:04.020> wheel<00:07:04.199> and<00:07:04.379> I

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
they just ride the rear wheel and I

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.170 
they just ride the rear wheel and I
think<00:07:04.649> leave<00:07:04.889> looking<00:07:05.159> pins<00:07:05.430> so<00:07:05.789> sometimes

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
think leave looking pins so sometimes

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.260 
think leave looking pins so sometimes
the<00:07:06.270> front<00:07:06.479> end<00:07:06.599> doesn't<00:07:06.779> really

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
the front end doesn't really

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.460 
the front end doesn't really
how<00:07:07.360> to<00:07:07.420> wear<00:07:07.630> it<00:07:07.690> soaking<00:07:08.080> up<00:07:08.200> because

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
how to wear it soaking up because

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.020 
how to wear it soaking up because

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
they're gonna go where the rear wheels

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.690 
they're gonna go where the rear wheels
Amy<00:07:10.390> a<00:07:10.720> little<00:07:11.620> slower<00:07:11.830> guy<00:07:12.010> like<00:07:12.220> me

so<00:07:16.630> you<00:07:17.260> tower<00:07:17.470> you<00:07:17.620> just<00:07:17.770> have<00:07:17.860> to<00:07:17.920> keep<00:07:18.010> your

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.160 
so you tower you just have to keep your

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.860 
so you tower you just have to keep your
body<00:07:18.220> forward<00:07:18.640> and<00:07:18.820> it<00:07:18.940> works<00:07:19.150> but<00:07:19.510> if<00:07:19.630> you<00:07:19.720> get

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870 
body forward and it works but if you get

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.600 
body forward and it works but if you get
lazy<00:07:20.080> and<00:07:20.350> start<00:07:20.530> to<00:07:20.620> fall<00:07:20.800> back<00:07:21.010> sometimes<00:07:21.460> up

front in there's a little tendency to
push<00:07:23.650> on<00:07:23.860> but<00:07:24.700> overall<00:07:24.940> that's<00:07:25.120> if<00:07:25.300> it's<00:07:25.450> an

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.540 
push on but overall that's if it's an

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.090 
push on but overall that's if it's an
awesome<00:07:25.840> bike<00:07:25.990> coming<00:07:26.320> out<00:07:26.440> of<00:07:26.590> the<00:07:26.650> box<00:07:26.830> that
