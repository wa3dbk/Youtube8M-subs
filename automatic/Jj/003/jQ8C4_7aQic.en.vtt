00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.520
 in secret levels those worlds 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.350
 hidden inside a game of those that do not 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.330
 we knew nothing until you read it in a 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.220
 magazine or a friend told you and 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.500

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.189
 a more than common practice throughout 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.899
 the years truth because the truth is that 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.790
 As the medium has advanced, it has 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.620
 been losing little by little being able 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.420
 have practically with the fingers of the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.050
 hand the games that give us these 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.760
 hidden areas at first sight this 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.410
 We want to review some 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.360
 mythical games that used this 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.920
 great resource and see some titles 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.320
 contemporaries who have collected the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.250
 legacy of your predecessors you will be able to 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.250
 discover the all 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.630
 today the extra levels of a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.610
 sonic are almost mandatory if you want 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.470
 pass the game to 100% but in the 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.910
 time to collect the emeralds of chaos 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.890
 It was one of the many secrets that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.570
 housed the classic sega in the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.640
 first sony we had those strangers 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.160
 rotating labyrinths that were trying 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 eject at the exit in 2 those phases 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.090
 with depth that they tried to imitate the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.800
 three-dimensional perspective and all 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.229
 we remember what happened if we took 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.330
 all the emeralds exact truth 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.800
 unblock let's go to super sonic and not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.800
 there was nothing more cool at the time 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.429
 practically all the games of the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.289
 mario franchise have had their levels 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.390
 secrets from the first of the nes 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.009
 going through super mario world and arriving 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.929
 to the new super mario bros and mario 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.700
 galaxy are so many that this time we 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.619
 we are left with the final secret level of 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.420
 super mario suite the world that adds 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.399
 a difficulty more than challenging to the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.899
 game and it shows that nintendo does not lose 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.640
 good manners when it comes to 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.640
 give us these extra phases 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.990
 they are not complete phases but the games 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.490
 of haiti software have always saved 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.500
 a lot of hidden areas that 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.190
 investigate throughout your wolfenstein 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.410
 3d 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.840
 doom and quake a practice that rescued 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.880
 one of his last great works colando 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.040
 in pixelated format these areas with the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.870
 own graphics of the time the truth 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.150
 It is that it is a level hysterically 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.690
 secret but given his legacy deserves to be 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.690
 in this top 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.829
 another one of those secret levels that we 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.299
 like is he who offered us symphony of 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.890
 the night and is that if we wanted 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.680
 complete the game one hundred percent 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.540
 good at 200% and get the final 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.189
 true it was necessary to invest the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.349
 famous dracula castle for 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.150
 continue with the adventure of the place a 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.129
 element as simple as going around 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.569
 on the stage was the great work of 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.579
 konami a game that doubled its 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.620
 duration and which also included new 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.620
 final boss areas and enemies 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.599
 the fighting games did not stay to the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.400
 behind in this practice many characters 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.620
 that appeared in some deliveries of 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.090
 mortal kombat or street fighter had already 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.280
 debuted in previous works and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.079
 we met a series of requirements was 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.150
 what happened to mortal kombat where 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.099
 we fought against red time that had the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.510
 scorpion and sub zero skills if 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.269
 we got a series of victories 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.430
 perfect and fatalities the same thing happened 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.159
 with super street fighter 2 turbo where 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.650
 we could fight against kuma or with that 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.650
 in street fighter 37 strike 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.020
 one of the most iconic levels is the 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.330
 that jealously guarded devil 2 and that 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.430
 contains good doses of humor it comes 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.440
 of the secret level of the cow if it clicks 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.480
 we go repeatedly in these animals to 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.100
 the outskirts of the town we entered in a 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.230
 world where these animals were the 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.450
 main enemy of the game could walk 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.340
 on two legs and in addition they were being more and 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.530
 more powerful to each update of the 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.090
 game that became so popular because 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.130
 because it reaches a point where it was the best 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.850
 site to form clear is and never 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.850
 rather 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.540
 Maybe shadow of the colossus 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.489
 It seems like a simple game in your 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.560
 structure go where the light was taking us 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.209
 of the sword look for the colossus and finish 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.129
 with him but we all went crazy 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.319
 when we found out that it was possible 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.750
 access before the famous secret garden 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.459
 the climb is not easy and you need 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.620
 a good grip level plus no 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.389
 waste energy in case it was not enough 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.950
 it's pretty easy that it does not detect our 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.630
 grip and let's fall from a good 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.489
 height but if we get it we can 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.840
 access this area where the truth is 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.759
 that there is not much to do except 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.560
 shoot these fruits that curiously 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.860
 our life bars will diminish us 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.860
 and energy 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:33.269
 all the super smash bros are full 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:35.399
 of secrets but maybe it's brow one of 

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:37.169
 the most unlockable contains the 

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:38.789
 wii delivery had a good handful of 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.319
 secret phases that we could 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.569
 access fulfilling a series of 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.589
 requirements from the original level of 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.379
 mario bros 

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:48.689
 the mansion of luigi's mansion the pokemon 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:51.089
 station or the great wind cell sea 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.919
 waker all these phases and secrets were 

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:56.329
 undoubtedly one of the best attractions 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.329
 who had the work of sakurai 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.270
 at the beginning of the report os 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.310
 we commented that few games in the 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.140
 currently they were making use of this 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.120
 great resource as is the levels 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.830
 secrets but if there is a modern game 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.020
 that he strictly complies with what he must 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.940
 be a hidden phase that is dark souls 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.830
 almost all the titles of the saga 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.630
 they contain many secret areas but 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.550
 we are left with the one that keeps 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.950
 this hollow tree in the lower level of 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.930
 the city infested an illusory wall 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.390
 It hides a gigantic and dangerous area 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.580
 divided into two parts the decline of 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.680
 great hollow full of those terrible toads 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.720
 that curse you and the lake of ashes with 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.820
 new enemies that give access to good 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.830
 weapons and a secret pact propitiated by 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.780
 a dragon a great example of how 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.350
 continue with this practice in disuse in 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.350
 our little world 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.950
 we end with a title whose principal 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.600
 characteristic is that its own 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.060
 development is to look for these 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.220
 hidden paths and levels it's about 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.870
 the stanley for bolt a game in which 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.460
 each path to explore leads us to a 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.740
 different ending and in which the players 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.140
 they try to find absolutely all 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.540
 them some really hidden from a 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.280
 total of 12 final is a good example of 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.290
 how we all love the players 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.100
 discover every little corner programmed 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.100
 in an interactive work 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.789
 and has now your turn what are 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.500
 your favorite secret levels if those 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.939
 that were not necessary to finish the 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.680
 main adventure but neither 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.430
 they were at first sight as a phase 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.469
 high school 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.300
 tell us to try to rescue 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:26.830
 I forget this great resource that forms 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.830
 part of the history of videogames
