this but I think this came from out of

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.660 
this but I think this came from out of
country<00:04:11.810> based<00:04:12.620> on<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:12.950> fact<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:13.580> got

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
country based on the fact that it's got

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.180 
country based on the fact that it's got
