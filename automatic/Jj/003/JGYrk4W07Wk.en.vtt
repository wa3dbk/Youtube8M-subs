up<00:00:53.039> getting<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> Sam<00:00:53.969> Gagner<00:00:54.210> card

this<00:01:29.159> thing<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.610> crazy<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.930> bounces<00:01:31.530> off

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this thing is crazy like it bounces off

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.490

his head or his shoulder and bar down

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890 
his head or his shoulder and bar down
and<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> counts<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> was<00:01:36.119> ridiculous<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and it counts like that was ridiculous I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.780 
and it counts like that was ridiculous I
definitely<00:01:37.590> didn't<00:01:37.920> expect<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.549> count

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
definitely didn't expect that to count

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.330 
definitely didn't expect that to count
but<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.180> that's<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.470> pretty<00:01:40.710> crazy<00:01:41.040> goal

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
but that's that's a pretty crazy goal

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.950 
but that's that's a pretty crazy goal
actually<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> craziest<00:01:42.420> i've<00:01:42.630> seen

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
