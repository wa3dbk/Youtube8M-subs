mistakes<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.960> can<00:02:10.940> choose<00:02:11.940> three<00:02:12.300> times<00:02:12.570> but

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
for spectators because it's sometimes

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
for spectators because it's sometimes
really<00:02:19.890> interesting<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.880> what<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.390> think<00:02:21.810> what

why<00:02:23.670> he<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.270> going<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.540> check<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.140> not

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
why he is going to check now and not

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.090
