00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
to accomplish the measure is the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.980 
to accomplish the measure is the
specific<00:00:28.070> task<00:00:28.429> that<00:00:28.939> is<00:00:29.090> being<00:00:29.300> asked<00:00:29.929> of

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
obviously if I do the measure I

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.090 
obviously if I do the measure I
satisfied<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.019> objective<00:00:36.470> for<00:00:36.620> that<00:00:36.800> stage

of<00:01:15.200> them<00:01:15.350> are<00:01:15.469> not<00:01:15.619> relevant<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.340> other

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
specialties that are not primary care so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.690 
specialties that are not primary care so
there<00:01:20.270> are<00:01:20.420> 13<00:01:20.929> exclusion<00:01:21.619> clauses<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:22.460> where

that<00:01:27.649> objective<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.909> number<00:01:29.299> of

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
that objective so the number of

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.349 
that objective so the number of

objectives say for a dentist would be

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.109 
objectives say for a dentist would be

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
much less than those for a primary care

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.480 
much less than those for a primary care
now<00:01:35.420> in<00:01:35.570> stage<00:01:35.899> 2<00:01:36.350> which<00:01:36.829> was<00:01:37.130> actually

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
now in stage 2 which was actually

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.029 
now in stage 2 which was actually
released<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.689> public<00:01:38.869> in<00:01:39.259> August<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:39.950> the

23rd it didn't hit the Federal Register

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.219 
23rd it didn't hit the Federal Register
till<00:01:42.409> September<00:01:42.950> 4th<00:01:43.249> but<00:01:43.939> there<00:01:44.119> are<00:01:44.270> 17<00:01:44.869> core

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
till September 4th but there are 17 core

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.289 
till September 4th but there are 17 core
measures<00:01:45.679> required<00:01:46.159> by<00:01:46.340> all<00:01:46.609> eligible

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
measures required by all eligible

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.929 
measures required by all eligible
professionals<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.319> then<00:01:48.619> a<00:01:48.649> menu<00:01:49.009> set<00:01:49.369> of<00:01:49.490> six

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
professionals and then a menu set of six

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.849 
professionals and then a menu set of six
measures<00:01:50.240> from<00:01:50.689> which<00:01:50.869> each<00:01:51.170> provider<00:01:51.619> would

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
measures from which each provider would

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.639 
measures from which each provider would
choose<00:01:52.130> 3<00:01:52.609> there<00:01:52.939> are<00:01:52.969> 20<00:01:53.630> exclusion<00:01:54.380> clauses

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
choose 3 there are 20 exclusion clauses

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.950 
choose 3 there are 20 exclusion clauses
so<00:01:55.130> lots<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.850> ways<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.359> we<00:01:56.509> can<00:01:56.689> include

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
so lots of the ways that we can include

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.410 
so lots of the ways that we can include
if<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.950> makes<00:01:58.159> sense<00:01:58.399> for<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.729> individual

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
if it makes sense for that individual

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.080 
if it makes sense for that individual
provider<00:01:59.869> but<00:02:00.170> remember<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.549> provider

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
provider but remember this is a provider

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.499 
provider but remember this is a provider
program<00:02:03.049> always<00:02:03.829> remind<00:02:04.219> people<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:04.789> so

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
program always remind people of that so

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.989 
program always remind people of that so
if<00:02:05.630> you've<00:02:05.840> got<00:02:06.049> a<00:02:06.259> large<00:02:06.649> enterprise<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.759> I

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
if you've got a large enterprise and I

a stage 1 DP not a state

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.080 
a stage 1 DP not a state
-<00:02:22.200> EP<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.859> doesn't<00:02:23.189> follow<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.519> clinic<00:02:23.939> it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
- EP so it doesn't follow the clinic it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.880 
- EP so it doesn't follow the clinic it
follows<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.659> provider<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.349> always<00:02:25.620> remember
