minifigure<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.270> one<00:02:23.570> piece<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.380> if<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.560> put

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
minifigure is one piece so if you put

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.940 
minifigure is one piece so if you put
her<00:02:24.920> together<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:26.060> subtracts<00:02:26.630> 2<00:02:26.870> and<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.920> you

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
her together that subtracts 2 and if you

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.460 
her together that subtracts 2 and if you
count<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.460> sprue<00:02:28.880> with<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.570> 4<00:02:29.780> flowers<00:02:30.290> is

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
count the sprue with the 4 flowers is

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.890 
count the sprue with the 4 flowers is
one<00:02:30.500> piece<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.280> brings<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.030> down<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.240> 26

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
one piece that brings you down to 26

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.590 
one piece that brings you down to 26
pieces<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.500> there<00:02:33.650> really<00:02:33.740> are<00:02:33.890> 26<00:02:34.520> pieces<00:02:34.790> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
pieces so there really are 26 pieces the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.280 
pieces so there really are 26 pieces the
brick<00:02:35.840> link<00:02:36.170> inventory<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.670> 22<00:02:38.270> pieces<00:02:38.540> takes

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
brick link inventory of 22 pieces takes

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.040 
brick link inventory of 22 pieces takes
into<00:02:39.650> account<00:02:39.680> only<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.670> pieces<00:02:41.180> used<00:02:41.840> to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
into account only the pieces used to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.600 
into account only the pieces used to
build<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.440> actual<00:02:42.890> model<00:02:43.250> per<00:02:43.460> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
build the actual model per the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.580 
build the actual model per the
instructions<00:02:44.240> so<00:02:44.810> that's<00:02:45.020> why<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.230> see<00:02:45.560> a

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
instructions so that's why you see a

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.220 
instructions so that's why you see a
discrepancy<00:02:46.390> from<00:02:47.390> time<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.750> time<00:02:47.780> on<00:02:48.140> the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
discrepancy from time to time on the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.320 
discrepancy from time to time on the
brick<00:02:48.410> link<00:02:48.650> inventories<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.180> thought

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
brick link inventories so I just thought

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.840 
brick link inventories so I just thought
I'd<00:02:50.480> mentioned<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:50.960> so<00:02:51.890> anyway<00:02:52.130> that's<00:02:52.310> just

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
I'd mentioned that so anyway that's just

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.910 
I'd mentioned that so anyway that's just
a<00:02:52.970> quick<00:02:53.120> look<00:02:53.180> get<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> small<00:02:54.020> poly<00:02:54.320> bag<00:02:54.620> you

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
a quick look get a small poly bag you

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.100 
a quick look get a small poly bag you
can<00:02:55.040> pick<00:02:55.160> these<00:02:55.310> up<00:02:55.370> for<00:02:55.580> about<00:02:55.940> $4<00:02:56.600> we<00:02:56.960> got

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
can pick these up for about $4 we got

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.370 
can pick these up for about $4 we got
this<00:02:57.260> one<00:02:57.470> at<00:02:57.560> Walmart<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:59.360> was<00:02:59.750> in<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.050> Lego
