this is the side here so let's knock
these<00:01:54.720> two<00:01:54.930> blocks<00:01:55.229> off<00:01:55.439> let's<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> chest

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
these two blocks off let's get a chest

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.160 
these two blocks off let's get a chest
here<00:01:56.490> let's<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.270> hopper<00:01:57.719> let's<00:01:57.899> shift

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
here let's get a hopper let's shift

shift click into that and let's get some

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.149 
shift click into that and let's get some
glass<00:02:04.920> here

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
glass here

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.070 
glass here
let's<00:02:06.670> go<00:02:06.820> up<00:02:06.969> like<00:02:07.149> three<00:02:07.359> or<00:02:07.479> four<00:02:07.509> doesn't

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
let's go up like three or four doesn't

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.479 
let's go up like three or four doesn't
matter<00:02:08.229> right<00:02:08.410> now<00:02:08.470> all<00:02:08.979> right<00:02:09.099> so<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.340> is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
the front we're going to make a three

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.020 
the front we're going to make a three
high<00:02:11.050> arch<00:02:11.349> like<00:02:12.069> so<00:02:14.610> alright<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.640> see<00:02:15.879> that

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
high arch like so alright you see that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.539 
high arch like so alright you see that
three<00:02:16.480> hive<00:02:16.660> alright<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.440> behind<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.220> lab

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
three hive alright so behind this lab

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.650 
three hive alright so behind this lab
here<00:02:18.790> we're<00:02:18.879> going<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.060> place<00:02:19.209> one<00:02:19.450> block

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
here we're going to place one block

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.930 
here we're going to place one block
behind<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.140> one<00:02:20.349> two<00:02:20.560> blocks<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:21.190> then<00:02:21.730> two

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
behind this one two blocks and then two

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.789 
behind this one two blocks and then two
blocks<00:02:22.239> here<00:02:22.569> let's<00:02:23.019> get<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.200> dispenser<00:02:23.769> a

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
blocks here let's get a dispenser a

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.710 
blocks here let's get a dispenser a
dispenser<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:24.819> holds<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.239> water<00:02:25.420> so

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
dispenser this one holds the water so

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.020 
dispenser this one holds the water so
let's<00:02:25.900> do<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.260> this<00:02:26.950> one<00:02:27.129> holds<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.459> lava<00:02:27.700> so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
let's do that this one holds the lava so

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.330 
let's do that this one holds the lava so
let's<00:02:28.239> do<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.569> it's<00:02:29.410> place<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.830> solid<00:02:30.250> block

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
let's do that it's place a solid block

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.339 
let's do that it's place a solid block
so<00:02:30.640> much<00:02:31.000> click<00:02:31.299> or<00:02:31.480> whatever<00:02:31.780> on<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.319> one

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
so much click or whatever on to that one

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.180 
so much click or whatever on to that one
let's<00:02:33.040> get<00:02:33.250> ourselves<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.760> sign<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:35.319> basically

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
let's get ourselves a sign and basically

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.710 
let's get ourselves a sign and basically
this<00:02:36.430> sign<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.760> here<00:02:36.940> just<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.269> make<00:02:37.420> sure<00:02:37.450> that

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
this sign is here just to make sure that

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.289 
this sign is here just to make sure that
the<00:02:37.810> water<00:02:37.959> doesn't<00:02:38.110> overflow<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:40.090> kind

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
the water doesn't overflow and it's kind

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.580 
the water doesn't overflow and it's kind
of<00:02:40.360> cover<00:02:40.569> this<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:40.870> we're<00:02:41.079> pretty<00:02:41.200> much<00:02:41.349> good

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
of cover this up we're pretty much good

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.160 
of cover this up we're pretty much good
with<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.860> front<00:02:42.720> now<00:02:43.720> we're<00:02:43.870> going<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.049> need<00:02:44.110> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
with the front now we're going to need a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.460 
with the front now we're going to need a
button<00:02:44.530> here<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:46.030> button<00:02:46.329> here<00:02:46.750> let's<00:02:47.319> go

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
button here and a button here let's go

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.839 
button here and a button here let's go
ahead<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.650> get<00:02:47.769> us<00:02:47.890> some<00:02:47.920> redstone<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.700> we're

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
ahead and get us some redstone so we're

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.850 
ahead and get us some redstone so we're
getting<00:02:49.480> some<00:02:49.660> repeaters<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.260> some<00:02:50.650> redstone

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
getting some repeaters and some redstone

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.479 
getting some repeaters and some redstone
dust<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.519> a<00:02:51.760> sticky<00:02:52.150> piston<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:53.230> we<00:02:53.890> rest

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
dust and a sticky piston so we rest

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.210 
dust and a sticky piston so we rest
unwise<00:02:54.940> directly<00:02:55.810> behind<00:02:56.019> this<00:02:56.379> one<00:02:56.620> put<00:02:57.190> a

here<00:03:09.310> all<00:03:09.849> right<00:03:10.000> now<00:03:10.150> we<00:03:10.209> need<00:03:10.450> basically<00:03:10.870> to

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
here all right now we need basically to

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.900 
here all right now we need basically to
activate<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.799> water<00:03:12.010> one<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.340> one's<00:03:12.549> super

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
activate the water one this one's super

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.430 
activate the water one this one's super
simple<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.329> just<00:03:13.540> go<00:03:13.660> ahead<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.870> do<00:03:14.049> this<00:03:14.230> and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
simple we just go ahead and do this and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.819 
simple we just go ahead and do this and
this<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.549> directly<00:03:16.510> from<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.019> block<00:03:17.319> holding

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
this and directly from the block holding
