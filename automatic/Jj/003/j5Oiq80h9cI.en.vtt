my<00:00:53.569> high<00:00:53.719> school<00:00:53.899> counselor<00:00:54.289> said<00:00:54.499> that

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
my high school counselor said that

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.770 
my high school counselor said that
dental<00:00:55.760> school<00:00:55.940> probably<00:00:56.179> would<00:00:56.389> not<00:00:56.510> be<00:00:56.569> an

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
dental school probably would not be an

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.660 
dental school probably would not be an
option<00:00:56.870> for<00:00:57.109> me<00:00:57.289> that<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:57.769> probably<00:00:58.039> couldn't

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
option for me that I probably couldn't

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.450 
option for me that I probably couldn't
handle<00:00:58.819> it<00:00:59.030> academically<00:00:59.569> and<00:00:59.979> so<00:01:00.979> I<00:01:01.010> wound<00:01:01.339> up

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
handle it academically and so I wound up
