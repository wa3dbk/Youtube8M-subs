00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.080
 hi to all friends and welcome back to those 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.549
 two on the server today we talk about my 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.440
 Christmas gift 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.470
 exact decided to give away for Christmas 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.380
 this game compatible with pc to good 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.119
 reds because he had recently expressed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.099
 the desire to play all those 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.900
 games he asked one was doing me 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.460
 to gnaw at those who had given to him 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.260
 rightly he plays all young people 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.969
 sitting by the couch and I was mayor 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 because I'm always feeling my ass 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.590
 on the series said but I want to talk about it 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.210
 he and me preceded me just right 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.489
 also because in short it is a period in which 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.050
 we are dedicating a lot to the platformers there 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.579
 are enjoying several platforms and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.829
 so what better time to 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.350
 start experimenting with the gamepad 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.430
 per pc for excellence that is that of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.710
 xbox 360 of mother microsoft and that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.350
 should be compatible with 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.629
 practically all platforms 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.840
 windows is correct and therefore has with him 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.720
 we are very pleased to have this game like this 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.780
 I can regain my control 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.909
 this too is true we say that if it is 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.400
 buy bundled here and find the link 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.880
 to buy it below it will come out 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.000
 also a very small discreet little e 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.850
 guys almost can't see this thing 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.280
 here that is not a remote control is and the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.090
 USB receiver I also show the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.079
 cable 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.329
 indeed the cabbage usb here it is in short if 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.270
 you have a rather spacious desk 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.770
 this is the receiver 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.659
 in short, we could have done something 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.740
 however, this is more discreet 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.140
 size 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 thanks to the fact we say that it succeeds in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.850
 have a range of nine meters 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.649
 ok what maybe the logitech doesn't like 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.900
 later maybe we will make a 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.220
 comparative logitech xbox and know us 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.230
 you still like the idea here 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.480
 below we must talk about this 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.490
 joypad that everyone knows but 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.550
 what they don't know how it works 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.600
 actually on pc ie if there is a de lei though 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.910
 there is some kind of contraindication 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.370
 then the only contraindication that 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.790
 you could find the space 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.470
 on the desk because the game ed 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.690
 rightly being owner of 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.310
 microsoft works a cream yes 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.230
 will grant a cream the important thing is that 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.709
 connect we say the receiver then 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.600
 stop the 3 here the first pairing that yes 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.760
 does while keeping this taste pressed 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.910
 we have solved or this other law 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.060
 here the last let's say the last little thing that 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.250
 in reality there is also a software one is a 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.160
 cd because microsoft rather than 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.980
 to download 4 megs of di 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.170
 software includes a cd inside the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.510
 glossy pack that contains this 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.090
 little guide on how to use this 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.700
 game to know the usual things is wrong 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.550
 machine dried these things where 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.709
 put these things in the cat's micro 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.130
 here is basically a small life 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.620
 software on TV always available 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.080
 of your controller's status la 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.160
 more useless as it happens 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.260
 for the xbox 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.790
 actually we also have the connector 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.150
 for the audio we want 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.209
 connect with a black micro USB crowe 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.519
 jack forgive the Freudian slip 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.320
 median you can hear the sound of 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.269
 your game directly from the game that 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.060
 this is perhaps the coolest feature 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.330
 there is absolutely no need to take a 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.790
 converter was from a micro jack jack 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.269
 normal let's say 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.099
 other dams that other mention 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.799
 ni trigger and go trigger ni are 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.319
 very very soft to a lot of pressure 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.450
 progressive because it is not that you press 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.459
 done ie if we played a game of 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.500
 drive thanks to this soft trigger 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.420
 you will be able to dare the accelerator in 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.900
 really very very gradual way 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.030
 if a little less fun if we want in the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.980
 fps because maybe it would take a little longer 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.780
 Hard to pull the gun trigger 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.730
 but let's say that in the end one does 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.709
 satisfied and a matter of taste 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.510
 fundamental of atandt udine very much 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.209
 cute scooters that give the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.620
 vibration because the deduction 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.419
 bilateral so if a lot sound 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.939
 strong and comes from your right 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:19.120
 rather it will vibrate on the right and 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:21.789
 vice versa and above all the vibration e 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.410
 very soft ie in spite of others 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.060
 games we've tried that 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.070
 we have been trying lately we are 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.580
 trying we are having fun like crazy 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.289
 I don't, but he says we are much more 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.650
 soft so there is no tactical shock 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.810
 electric so but almost allows you 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.030
 enjoy the scene real because it feels 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.039
 they promised first floor and cool but 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.650
 very sheared very gradually also 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.139
 boys vibration we're talking about a 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.729
 product that perhaps at the moment is the top 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.430
 as for the gamepad for 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.860
 pc and in short it is equal only 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.599
 precisely to my logitech which is the 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.479
 prerogative of steam for jewels 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.520
 so we are in our hands 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.040
 two monsters so maybe we'll propose you 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.560
 the challenge between the logitech 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.630
 microsoft let us know if you want it 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.400
 you want this challenge actually in the meantime 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.210
 we always leave the link below and 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.210
 to the next
