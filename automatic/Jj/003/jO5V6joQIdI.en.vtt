00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.490
 your dog drives you crazy 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.380
 marisol king has the solution we 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.170
 informs how he created the school of 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.240
 training called patita patita in 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.160
 the one next to mister pedro com and tiny 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.500
 They dedicated to resolving form 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.859
 recreational all kinds of problems of 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.420
 behavior in our beloved pets 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.020
 for you I pull you up approximately 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.490
 three years 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.560
 I was studying a flame career 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.330
 bachelor's degree in labor relations and 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 I always liked dogs and 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.130
 good and for one reason or another does not study 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.110
 veterinary more than anything for the part 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.460
 clinic that did not interest me that much but 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.570
 I was always passionate about everything 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.670
 were the dogs I was always 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.080
 studying and reading about them and I 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.400
 I found out that it was good that a 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.350
 career that was called instrument 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.780
 canine I began to study in different 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.220
 courses 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.270
 and is that need we would already dedicate 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.910
 three years ago we always say I was 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.110
 very very involved with dogs all 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.110
 this arises based on that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.950
 especially there are certain problems of 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.170
 behavior that are acquired say there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.450
 bad habits that are pretty closed 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.520
 in the dog when the dog spends a lot 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 alone or they call you when you have 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.780
 five years and let's say they have many more 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.670
 accumulated solids and a lot of loneliness about 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.799
 all when it's a problem that makes 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.420
 something when you're alone but if you have a 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.670
 bad habit what about the process you 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.840
 have many years to be alone if it is for 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.909
 hours is usually a problem of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.229
 behavior that costs to correct for this 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.700
 but the reality is that it depends 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.149
 a lot of problem behavior 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.250
 How did this yemen 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.560
 possibility of owner to correct it by 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.299
 example I do not know for telling you in the air the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.950
 most common problem let's say when 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.720
 it's about the dog that does physics 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.959
 within the time of domicile and we 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.360
 we sank and it's not what you're looking for or 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:02.399
 when they break all that kind of behavior 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.659
 when he spent a lot of time and the dog 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.640
 she has very sick inside her bad 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.080
 habits is usually a problem in which 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.030
 you have to dedicate a lot to correct them 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.950
 but as we all say 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.989
 Behavioral problems have a solution 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.489
 is that because your dog destroyed everything 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.380
 for three years it can not be corrected 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.300
 they can always be corrected 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.840
 and sometimes the solution is very 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.840
 reach of hands 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.240
 in the streets of the city is coming 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.240
 the moment 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.270
 but we met in the faculty uba 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.660
 of veterinary sciences where 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.760
 we study the extra load 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.310
 and once I was missing someone like 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.850
 let's say that it will help me in everything that is 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.640
 there obedience and had that handling with 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.860
 the people who have pedro let's say a 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.750
 very very human handling 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.670
 then good but the 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.370
 team also to be able to expand the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.370
 let's say yes and be my teammate 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.329
 usually to me particularly I 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.670
 many bull owners contact 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.530
 little ones and pedro usually 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.939
 touch much more dreams of big dog 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.969
 it also has a lot to do with a 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.980
 gender characteristic and reality 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.560
 is that I particularly get 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.379
 many cases of the most common 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.359
 belt pulls dogs that break everything 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.270
 puppies that make titicaca inside or 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.310
 Adults 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.920
 bad habits such as asking for 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.470
 the table ask for food from the table with the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.460
 end of tasks that until now all the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.590
 behavior programs that have 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.690
 arrived have been very very problems 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.070
 correctable and quite simple and 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.180
 done if we are surprised sometimes what 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.180
 fast that the dog learns 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.060
 I know not 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.440
 domÃ©nica type 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.510
 in addition to group form obedience and 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.880
 agility are the only two activities 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.620
 that we give obedience group applies to 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.050
 everything what is the behavior in the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.080
 street that is what it is and what is the 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.300
 sitting on one side together walking the 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.950
 side the dog here that is the exercise 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.350
 that I come when you always call 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.570
 how lucky we are with the tub an object 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.950
 in the mouth and wait for him to stay 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.050
 still in a place in the position 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.450
 then we have a secret and it's agility 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.520
 tricks true that is so this is a 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.220
 track obstacles where the dog what 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.410
 does is exercise and communicate with the 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.390
 Owner going through different obstacles 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.440
 to order what the owner tells you 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.060
 how tunnels fence ramps hoops is a 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.330
 sport that looks very much 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.580
 in TV 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.289
 then we do tricks that is the shocks 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.909
 to the album the muertito above the 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.370
 back a lot of tricks jump by 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.689
 the hoop all the tricks that are 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.099
 fun for the owner as the 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.020
 can show family money that does the 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.460
 dog that kind of tricks more like to 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.930
 have fun and then we have what it is 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.460
 domicile that aims more than anything at 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.509
 the resolution of the behavior problem 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.569
 we are not called because of problems of 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:18.650
 conduct bad habits in general physical 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:21.350
 here inside bites strip of the strap 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.850
 break all these types of behaviors 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.860
 individually cater ie 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.020
 everything that happens at home for 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.449
 inside we have it on an individual hand in 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.630
 the domicile intensively or 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.889
 regular depending on the case and if in 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.240
 some cases if the owner wants to 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.680
 work with individual obedience is 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.690
 say this that we mentioned as a group 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.130
 it is also worked for individual if the 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.930
 owner or can not get to the place of

 personalized treatment do not change in 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.919
