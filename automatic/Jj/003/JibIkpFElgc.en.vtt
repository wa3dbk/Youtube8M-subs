Michaels lack of looking for a shot well
as<00:02:17.750> i<00:02:18.050> watch<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.500> game<00:02:18.709> on<00:02:18.740> falls<00:02:19.220> i<00:02:19.430> felt<00:02:19.880> that

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
as i watch the game on falls i felt that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.510 
as i watch the game on falls i felt that
he<00:02:20.240> was<00:02:20.270> saving<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.500> end<00:02:21.770> but<00:02:22.430> he

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
he was saving it for the end but he

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.490 
he was saving it for the end but he
never<00:02:22.730> did<00:02:22.820> put<00:02:23.240> that<00:02:23.390> explosion<00:02:24.020> together

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
never did put that explosion together

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.560 
never did put that explosion together
that<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:24.740> thought<00:02:25.040> he<00:02:25.160> was<00:02:25.310> going<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.820> he<00:02:26.360> has

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
that I thought he was going to he has

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.240 
that I thought he was going to he has
been<00:02:26.870> double-teamed<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.590> whole<00:02:27.739> game<00:02:28.040> and

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
been double-teamed the whole game and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.370 
been double-teamed the whole game and
it's<00:02:28.370> not<00:02:28.580> his<00:02:28.760> nature<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.150> take<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.660> really<00:02:30.140> bad

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
it's not his nature to take a really bad

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.199 
it's not his nature to take a really bad
shot<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:30.980> think<00:02:31.250> maybe<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.550> entered<00:02:31.970> into

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
shot and I think maybe that entered into

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.170 
shot and I think maybe that entered into
it<00:02:32.650> many<00:02:33.650> makes<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.220> first<00:02:34.459> he<00:02:34.790> has<00:02:34.910> been
