this could be fun so let's open this up
and<00:00:53.190> let's<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.239> will<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.809> get

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
and let's see what will you get

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.250 
and let's see what will you get
since<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.850> also<00:00:57.239> know<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.050> hot

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
since I also know you use your hot

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.650 
since I also know you use your hot
package<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> HMS<00:00:59.100> cards<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
package in HMS cards so do you get a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.789 
package in HMS cards so do you get a
video<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.170> DVI<00:01:01.620> adapter<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.589> what

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
video a DVI adapter and this is what

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.910 
video a DVI adapter and this is what
here<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.309> an<00:01:06.020> infinitely<00:01:08.869> don't<00:01:09.920> you

videos supposed to keep the core clock
speed<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.300> this<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.690> 1,000<00:02:07.410> megahertz<00:02:07.670> it's

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
speed of this is a 1,000 megahertz it's

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.130 
speed of this is a 1,000 megahertz it's
sort<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:09.000> boost<00:02:09.240> right<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:09.960> fell

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
sort of a boost right up to it so fell

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.380 
sort of a boost right up to it so fell
to<00:02:10.470> 1050<00:02:11.280> obviously<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.670> can<00:02:11.850> overclock<00:02:12.150> this

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
to 1050 obviously you can overclock this

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.940 
to 1050 obviously you can overclock this
with<00:02:12.540> whatever<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.960> like<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.260> well<00:02:13.440> no<00:02:13.920> I

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
with whatever you like as well no I

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
with whatever you like as well no I
normally<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.460> use<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> overdrive<00:02:15.210> software

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
normally just use the overdrive software

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.620 
normally just use the overdrive software
that<00:02:16.470> AMD<00:02:17.010> supplying<00:02:17.580> um

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
that AMD supplying um

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260 
that AMD supplying um
the<00:02:19.140> basically<00:02:20.130> let<00:02:20.640> me<00:02:20.730> look<00:02:20.940> let<00:02:21.060> me<00:02:21.180> look

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the basically let me look let me look

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.930 
the basically let me look let me look
let<00:02:21.480> me<00:02:21.630> look<00:02:21.750> where<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.920> gallon<00:02:23.370> oh<00:02:23.490> yeah

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
let me look where is it gallon oh yeah

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.460 
let me look where is it gallon oh yeah
right<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.450> obviously<00:02:24.510> near<00:02:25.050> memory

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
right so that obviously near memory

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.610 
right so that obviously near memory
clock<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.980> five<00:02:26.400> thousand<00:02:27.120> six<00:02:27.420> hundred

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
clock is five thousand six hundred

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.560 
clock is five thousand six hundred
megahertz<00:02:28.620> which<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.130> quite<00:02:29.400> nice<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.790> believe

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
megahertz which is quite nice I believe

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.810 
megahertz which is quite nice I believe
this<00:02:30.660> one<00:02:30.870> here<00:02:31.080> is<00:02:31.170> equal<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.860> seven<00:02:32.610> nine

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
this one here is equal to the seven nine

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.210 
this one here is equal to the seven nine
fifty<00:02:33.420> but<00:02:33.959> also<00:02:34.080> acting<00:02:34.560> much<00:02:34.860> much<00:02:35.190> cheaper

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
fifty but also acting much much cheaper

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.520 
fifty but also acting much much cheaper

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
556 pound that makes it much much

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.850 
556 pound that makes it much much
cheaper<00:02:47.610> than<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> 7950<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.260> is<00:02:49.350> previously

out<00:02:50.100> there<00:02:50.340> also<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.940> may<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.150> seen<00:02:51.390> like

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
out there also you may have seen like

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.750 
out there also you may have seen like
the<00:02:51.750> unbox<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.350> 280<00:02:52.890> X<00:02:53.220> which<00:02:53.670> is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
the unbox of the 280 X which is

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.520 
the unbox of the 280 X which is
basically<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> equivalent<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.600> 7<00:02:54.840> 970<00:02:55.380> and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
basically the equivalent of a 7 970 and

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.900 
basically the equivalent of a 7 970 and
it<00:02:55.980> would<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:56.190> saved<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.519> anywhere<00:02:56.820> between

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
it would have saved you anywhere between

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.479 
it would have saved you anywhere between
50<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.690> 100<00:02:58.290> pounds<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.130> difference<00:02:59.400> in

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
50 and 100 pounds on the difference in

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.340 
50 and 100 pounds on the difference in
the<00:02:59.550> price<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.910> card<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.660> obviously<00:03:00.930> these

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
the price of the card so obviously these

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.470 
the price of the card so obviously these
new<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:02.040> new<00:03:02.250> range<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.640> cards<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.060> at<00:03:03.239> very

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
new this new range of cards is at very

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.110 
new this new range of cards is at very
very<00:03:03.540> much<00:03:03.959> very<00:03:04.260> very<00:03:05.130> much<00:03:05.340> very<00:03:05.580> very

very much very very much very very

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.750 
very much very very much very very
cheaper<00:03:06.660> letters<00:03:07.530> remittance<00:03:07.980> much<00:03:08.310> cheaper

and<00:03:09.360> very<00:03:09.810> much<00:03:10.650> more<00:03:10.760> cost-effective<00:03:11.760> I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
and very much more cost-effective I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.220 
and very much more cost-effective I
don't<00:03:12.360> really<00:03:12.510> know<00:03:12.630> whether<00:03:12.780> very<00:03:13.050> well

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
don't really know whether very well

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.340 
don't really know whether very well
decay<00:03:13.410> into<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.680> sense<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.040> anyway<00:03:14.430> and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
decay into that sense but anyway and

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.690 
decay into that sense but anyway and
especially<00:03:16.350> some<00:03:16.709> quick<00:03:16.920> Zima<00:03:17.250> might<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.610> as

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
especially some quick Zima might just as

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.040 
especially some quick Zima might just as
well<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.060> can<00:03:18.120> fella<00:03:18.330> see<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.720> also<00:03:18.840> your

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
well so you can fella see it's also your

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.750 
well so you can fella see it's also your
very<00:03:19.290> very<00:03:19.500> nice<00:03:19.650> design<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.160> really<00:03:20.489> like<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
very very nice design I really like the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.970 
very very nice design I really like the
design<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.239> HMS<00:03:21.570> cards<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.560> doesn't<00:03:22.860> look

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
design of the HMS cards it doesn't look

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.300 
design of the HMS cards it doesn't look
a<00:03:23.070> very<00:03:23.340> very<00:03:23.910> good<00:03:24.209> indeed<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.620> fingers

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
a very very good indeed so fingers

hopefully you guys are going to enjoy
that<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.990> before

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
that and before

that and before
you<00:03:34.620> guys<00:03:34.800> have<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.070> kind<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.310> sneak<00:03:35.490> peak<00:03:35.700> and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
you guys have a kind of sneak peak and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.490 
you guys have a kind of sneak peak and
have<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> look<00:03:36.210> in<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.720> basically<00:03:37.020> decide

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
have a look in and basically decide

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.930 
have a look in and basically decide
whether<00:03:37.800> or<00:03:37.890> not<00:03:37.980> these<00:03:38.100> AMD<00:03:38.460> cards<00:03:38.760> are<00:03:38.820> for

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
whether or not these AMD cards are for

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.540 
whether or not these AMD cards are for
you<00:03:39.060> because<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:40.230> equivalent<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.130> obviously

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
you because the equivalent so obviously

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.790 
you because the equivalent so obviously
AMD<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> brownout<00:03:42.450> compared<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:42.990> the<00:03:43.110> geforce

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
obviously the aim of the ice key cards

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.230 
obviously the aim of the ice key cards
is<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:32.010> fact<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.280> they're<00:04:32.490> quieter<00:04:33.000> and

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
is the fact that they're quieter and

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.450 
is the fact that they're quieter and
they<00:04:33.990> call<00:04:34.230> her<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.950> tell<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.250> what<00:04:35.370> now
