so<00:00:00.539> I<00:00:01.190> want<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> talk<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.460> little<00:00:02.639> bit<00:00:02.909> before<00:00:03.419> I

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
so I want to talk a little bit before I

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.950 
so I want to talk a little bit before I
conclude<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.290> portion<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.799> video<00:00:05.100> about

conclude this portion of the video about

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.410 
conclude this portion of the video about
something<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:06.990> Bob<00:00:07.290> told<00:00:07.649> me<00:00:07.770> about

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
something that Bob told me about

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.560 
something that Bob told me about
introducing<00:00:09.420> hydroxy<00:00:10.200> gas<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.590> your<00:00:10.620> motor

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
introducing hydroxy gas in your motor

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.140 
introducing hydroxy gas in your motor
the<00:00:12.570> smacks<00:00:12.900> booster<00:00:13.610> produces<00:00:14.610> less<00:00:14.910> than

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
the smacks booster produces less than

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.050 
the smacks booster produces less than
four<00:00:15.389> percent<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> overall<00:00:16.609> volume<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.940> an

four percent of the overall volume of an

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.480 
four percent of the overall volume of an
engine<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:19.170> means<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:20.029> it's<00:00:21.619> not<00:00:22.619> posing<00:00:23.010> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
engine this means that it's not posing a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
Dana what would he was explaining was

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.870 
Dana what would he was explaining was
over<00:00:25.800> four<00:00:26.039> percent<00:00:27.769> you<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:29.010> basically<00:00:29.730> you

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
over four percent you have basically you

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820 
over four percent you have basically you
have<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> combustible<00:00:30.630> bomb<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.289> your<00:00:31.349> intake

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
have a combustible bomb in your intake

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.540 
have a combustible bomb in your intake
system<00:00:32.250> under<00:00:32.940> four<00:00:33.149> percent<00:00:34.010> it<00:00:35.010> doesn't

system under four percent it doesn't

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.020 
system under four percent it doesn't
ignite<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.750> easily<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.710> won't<00:00:37.950> want<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
ignite as easily or it won't want to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.260 
ignite as easily or it won't want to
propagate<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.290> flame<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.309> percentage<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270

propagate a flame the percentage is a
hydroxy<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.170> dilute<00:00:43.579> this<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.789> important

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
hydroxy is to dilute this is important

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.600 
hydroxy is to dilute this is important
because<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.690> means<00:00:45.870> now<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.920> instead<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
because it means now that instead of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.610 
because it means now that instead of
installing<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.420> hydroxy<00:00:48.930> output<00:00:49.289> tube<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
installing the hydroxy output tube is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500 
installing the hydroxy output tube is
close<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> butterfly<00:00:50.340> valve<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.030> possible

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
close to the butterfly valve as possible

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600 
close to the butterfly valve as possible
to<00:00:51.629> minimize<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.230> volume<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.280> intake

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
to minimize the volume in the intake

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.560 
to minimize the volume in the intake
conducting<00:00:54.199> we<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.410> now<00:00:56.120> introduce<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.390> gas

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
conducting we can now introduce the gas

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.560 
conducting we can now introduce the gas
closer<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> air<00:00:59.100> filter<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.059> air

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
closer to the air filter and the air

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.520 
closer to the air filter and the air
filter<00:01:00.840> acts<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:02.359> now<00:01:03.359> diffuser<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.080> defuse

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
filter acts as now diffuser to defuse

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.179 
filter acts as now diffuser to defuse
the<00:01:04.739> hydroxy<00:01:05.280> gas<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> better

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
the hydroxy gas so that you get a better

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
the hydroxy gas so that you get a better
distribution<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.240> gas<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.140> air<00:01:10.290> charge<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
distribution of gas in the air charge it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.520 
distribution of gas in the air charge it
it<00:01:11.400> means<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> more<00:01:12.900> efficient<00:01:13.350> burn

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
it means you have a more efficient burn

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310 
it means you have a more efficient burn
then<00:01:14.400> adding<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> gas<00:01:15.630> close<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
then adding the gas close to the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.039 
then adding the gas close to the
throttle<00:01:16.680> body<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.700> basically<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.869> good

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
throttle body so basically this is good

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.770 
throttle body so basically this is good

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this point before I talk hey this this

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.719 
this point before I talk hey this this
is<00:01:38.850> coming<00:01:39.119> from<00:01:39.150> Bob<00:01:39.530> up<00:01:40.530> until<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.189> point<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
is coming from Bob up until this point I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.240 
is coming from Bob up until this point I
was<00:01:42.630> afraid<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.649> didn't<00:01:43.890> want<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.130> be

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
was afraid and I didn't want to be

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.830 
was afraid and I didn't want to be
responsible<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:45.180> somebody<00:01:45.479> blowing

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
responsible for somebody blowing

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.300 
responsible for somebody blowing
themselves<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.890> filled<00:01:47.159> their

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
themselves up because they filled their

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.030 
themselves up because they filled their
intake<00:01:47.610> tube<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.000> hydroxy<00:01:48.509> gas<00:01:48.740> now<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
intake tube with hydroxy gas now you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.130 
intake tube with hydroxy gas now you
still<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.640> use<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> bubbler<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.630> they

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
still have to use a bubbler because they

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.639 
still have to use a bubbler because they
run<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.829> from<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.820> unit<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.409> place

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
run going from the unit to the place

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.830 
run going from the unit to the place
where<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> tap<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.759> into<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> car<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.509> still

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
where you tap it into the car is still

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530 
where you tap it into the car is still
high<00:01:58.700> concentration<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> hydroxy<00:02:00.360> gas

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
high concentration of hydroxy gas

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020 
high concentration of hydroxy gas
obviously<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:01.979> still<00:02:02.100> need<00:02:02.340> your<00:02:02.700> bubbler

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
obviously so you still need your bubbler

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.550 
obviously so you still need your bubbler
um<00:02:04.219> but<00:02:05.390> after<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.509> point<00:02:06.840> there's<00:02:07.320> not

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
um but after that point there's not

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.449 
um but after that point there's not
enough<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.580> ratio<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.360> pose<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.679> bomb

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
enough in there in ratio to pose a bomb
