 also prepare for the enem and of course 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.230
 That studying a lot is the big secret.

 some aulinhas to clients of pre-school 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.359
 to give a pass is even the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.920
 teachers also when they do the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.560
 Work, he already said that. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.260
 You do not even study, so they 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.410
 We are already studying right now, right? 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.160
 by the time we get to the race we already have 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.739
 letter

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.780
 mateus de sÃ£o paulo is a sociologist and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.690
 expert at enem then attention 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.750
 focus students on content 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.079
 the best way is for you to take the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.789
 previous evidence since 2009 solve 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.609
 these tests only I could solve 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.649
 four can solve 5 and from the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.619
 your result in these tests 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.000
 Do you do your study plan and then you? 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.520
 Are you going to study what you 're getting at? 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.500
 Too much does not pay to spend time 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.170
 studying and what is hitting 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.150
 very little for example 20% you have one 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.850
 large learning deficit is dedicated to 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.159
 study what you are outsourcing 40 50 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.130
 60 and 70 percent that these issues will 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.229
 appear again in this year's event and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.299
 of other years, the Santa Catarina is 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.729
 biology teacher who is 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.400
 steeped in studies to make beautiful 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.950
 in the test he knows well the video lessons of 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.500
 If you're smart, Paulo remembers that for this 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.950
 time is precious the ideal is 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.070
 study between 35 and 40 minutes and gives a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.649
 ten minute break 10 15 minutes 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.750
 This pause to breathe Take a water 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.850
 It's not to watch television and nothing. 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.409
 relax during the World Cup that the student 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.229
 cup time he has to take the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.810
 first care is to avoid the chest effect

 how is the party mood in the country right're 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.219
 everybody kind of relaxed is very 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.520
 easy for a student who is in a rut 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.659
 strong study I also fell into this self 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.550
 but keep your body moving 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.239
 also helps in the good performance is this 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.069
 same 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.379
 if you 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.810
 one and a half hours of exercise 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.290
 moderate every day a walk of 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.299
 45 years per hour or not done by anyone who did 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.459
 will accept 15 to 20 percent more 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.189
 issues in enem 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.319
 then follow the tips of teachers and a 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.590
 good example of alexandre that by the way 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.319
 is very confident clear bank of 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.680
 I'm not nervous or anxious I'm not
