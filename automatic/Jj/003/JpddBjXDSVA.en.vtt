00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.170
 Hello 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.810
 today will tell you how to open 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.960
 to monitor it is necessary in order to 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.530
 whole program working schedule 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.769
 displayed and equally 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.029
 for this we need in the control panel 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.289
 girlfriends visitors 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.390
 and choose step by step to build further 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.980
 then load the profile if you have 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.320
 passed the session by the monitor choose 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.320
 just sardoba course on st 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.920
 at this point we need to configure 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.750
 brightness and contrast 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.560
 monitor 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.610
 first 6 tune and contrast do about 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.040
 maximum but I would advise doing what 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.190
 90 95 percent of the maximum not to 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.860
 damage class 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.720
 next we adjust the brightness in this way 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.710
 so that the square in the center stops 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.510
 as dark as possible but different 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.060
 from the black square outside that knocked out 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.000
 became with pure white 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.120
 there we are removing the settings or for foro 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.260
 for our monitor and mine itself 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.770
 offers but also better on a construction site but if you 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.780
 sure that you know better the husband of the gulls themselves 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.130
 choose 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.020
 at 10 you need to build a range of gomar 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.650
 determines how and this 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.730
 shows 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.390
 average kana 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.830
 for this we need to square in 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.570
 center merged with of course square 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.020
 Neklyaev bottom 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.710
 we need this 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.909
 it has to show because the program 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.140
 linen grab does not show rice 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.630
 that 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.210
 but for this they need to dance 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.920
 everything 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.140
 for this the most convenient growing role 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.580
 you will not see on it 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.680
 in certain settings merge 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.510
 further we remove dolomin son kim 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 slums go clean leave such 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.149
 on ii here we have so much balance 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.900
 white 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.430
 and if m 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.010
 you do not immediately taycher though he still 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.280
 would advise you to choose from those that are 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.170
 can customize other things there 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.470
 until departure 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.910
 in each of which you need to choose 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.640
 neutral gray among warmer 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.210
 colder tones 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.369
 people I still choose to choose from the fact that 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.709
 there is 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.669
 Nalchik 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.039
 Warsaw workspace can 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.100
 differ from 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.040
 percentage of your monitor 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.919
 in this case playing center he managed 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.699
 if you leave space to say 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.569
 same as monitor leaving maxim 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.939
 Sukhanova if no, we choose handed 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.349
 advice to keep the same as the previous one 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.769
 paragraph 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.790
 clan construction is now finished us 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.489
 need to see what was dollars and after if 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.809
 you are pleased with what happened 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:36.199
 we were given 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.509
 save them with some new name 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:39.629
 now it's automatic 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.200
 changed and 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.250
 will be yours 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.129
 default profile 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.889
 Yes, I will show right now how to configure and photoshop what 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.239
 God worked in colors about which 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.829
 often built them in this space 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.829
 has become 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.090
 because we have a rockstar shock on 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.319
 you just need to choose a percentage of 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.839
 we are only colors 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:03.249
 profile in a thrill the third is done 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.519
 So 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.019
 voices text 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.699
 in the settings again american idol puncture two 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:11.669
 either withdrawing internet 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.529
 ap to look at the question or is it any 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.509
 lodging questions which 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.979
 we are most often used 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:23.179
 John Kay and further give the right composition 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:25.179
 the cops sue us 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.359
 macintosh was tuned to address 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.979
 kentucky on this setting is complete and 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.869
 now you have this program check 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:34.509
 display graphics equally 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:35.649
 if not 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.749
 most likely the car shines comes on 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:39.589
 construction site 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.219
