00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
ignore the fact that it's roofie that

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.999 
ignore the fact that it's roofie that
and<00:00:16.820> it's<00:00:16.970> just<00:00:17.060> I<00:00:17.330> should<00:00:17.750> I<00:00:17.810> want<00:00:17.960> it<00:00:18.050> take

and it's just I should I want it take
the<00:00:20.000> fluffy<00:00:20.390> bit<00:00:20.540> off<00:00:21.640> so<00:00:22.640> you've<00:00:22.759> got<00:00:23.000> just<00:00:23.210> a

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
the fluffy bit off so you've got just a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.600 
the fluffy bit off so you've got just a
very<00:00:23.509> small<00:00:23.810> stick<00:00:24.169> and<00:00:24.410> then<00:00:24.739> dip<00:00:25.160> that<00:00:25.399> in

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
very small stick and then dip that in

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.499 
very small stick and then dip that in
latex<00:00:26.739> and<00:00:27.739> then<00:00:27.919> you<00:00:28.009> want<00:00:28.189> to<00:00:28.250> draw<00:00:28.520> just

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509 
latex and then you want to draw just

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:38.830 
latex and then you want to draw just
very<00:00:31.540> thin<00:00:32.540> lines<00:00:35.649> crush<00:00:36.649> it<00:00:36.890> our<00:00:37.840> thicknesses

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
very thin lines crush it our thicknesses

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.390 
very thin lines crush it our thicknesses
come<00:00:39.110> verax<00:00:39.770> because<00:00:40.670> with<00:00:40.820> scars<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:41.270> would

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
come verax because with scars that would

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.780 
come verax because with scars that would
it's<00:00:43.400> not<00:00:43.520> going<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.730> be<00:00:43.850> like<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.300> perfect<00:00:45.790> even

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
it's not going to be like a perfect even

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.420 
it's not going to be like a perfect even
line<00:00:47.030> every<00:00:47.420> time<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:51.920> have<00:00:52.160> some

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
line every time so you have some

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.190 
line every time so you have some
slightly<00:00:52.970> thicker<00:00:53.210> areas<00:00:53.660> some<00:00:53.900> thinner

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
slightly thicker areas some thinner

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.440 
slightly thicker areas some thinner
areas<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:58.040> what<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.340> tend<00:00:58.610> to<00:00:58.670> do<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:58.940> just<00:00:59.180> make

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
areas and what I tend to do is just make

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.689 
areas and what I tend to do is just make
sure<00:00:59.480> I'll<00:01:00.140> thin<00:01:00.470> it<00:01:00.590> out<00:01:01.329> at<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.480> ends<00:01:03.699> like

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
sure I'll thin it out at the ends like

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.590 
sure I'll thin it out at the ends like
so<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:06.290> you<00:01:06.380> don't<00:01:06.560> end<00:01:06.860> up<00:01:07.040> with<00:01:07.540> like<00:01:08.540> a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
so so you don't end up with like a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.390 
so so you don't end up with like a
chunky<00:01:09.049> end<00:01:09.229> like<00:01:09.439> that<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:09.860> want<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.130> have<00:01:10.280> it

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
chunky end like that you want to have it

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.590 
chunky end like that you want to have it
so<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.700> tapers<00:01:11.120> off<00:01:11.240> into<00:01:11.870> a<00:01:11.900> thin<00:01:12.260> bit<00:01:13.600> not

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
so it tapers off into a thin bit not

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.430 
so it tapers off into a thin bit not
more<00:01:14.900> like<00:01:15.080> that<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:16.970> can<00:01:17.090> do<00:01:17.180> as<00:01:17.300> many<00:01:17.540> or

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
more like that and you can do as many or

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.810 
more like that and you can do as many or
as<00:01:18.470> few<00:01:18.590> as<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:19.729> need<00:01:20.659> for<00:01:21.110> whatever<00:01:21.409> look

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
as few as you need for whatever look

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.289 
as few as you need for whatever look
you're<00:01:22.820> creating<00:01:24.729> years<00:01:25.729> ago<00:01:25.940> I<00:01:25.970> did<00:01:26.180> an

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
you're creating years ago I did an

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.050 
you're creating years ago I did an
Edward<00:01:26.600> Scissorhands<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.440> I<00:01:27.500> did<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.920> with

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
Edward Scissorhands and I did that with

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.820 
Edward Scissorhands and I did that with
I<00:01:29.890> think<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.010> did<00:01:31.159> it<00:01:31.280> with<00:01:31.460> eyelash<00:01:32.299> glue<00:01:32.830> so

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
I think I did it with eyelash glue so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.070 
I think I did it with eyelash glue so
you<00:01:33.890> could<00:01:34.159> do<00:01:35.229> this<00:01:36.229> technique<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:38.720> do<00:01:38.869> like

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
you could do this technique to do like

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.010 
you could do this technique to do like
Edward<00:01:39.500> Scissorhands<00:01:40.010> type<00:01:40.280> scars<00:01:41.020> stuff

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
Edward Scissorhands type scars stuff

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.789 
Edward Scissorhands type scars stuff
like<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:48.200> can<00:01:48.350> have<00:01:48.380> them<00:01:48.590> as

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
like that and you can have them as

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.539 
like that and you can have them as
raised<00:01:49.070> or<00:01:49.520> as<00:01:49.729> flat<00:01:50.000> as<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.210> like<00:01:51.340> if<00:01:52.340> you

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
raised or as flat as you like if you

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.410 
raised or as flat as you like if you
want<00:01:52.729> a<00:01:52.880> more<00:01:53.090> sort<00:01:53.330> of<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:54.850> keloid<00:01:55.850> type<00:01:56.210> of

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
want a more sort of like keloid type of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.810 
want a more sort of like keloid type of
scar<00:01:56.799> then<00:01:57.799> you're<00:01:58.220> going<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.400> want<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.640> put

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
scar then you're going to want to put

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.170 
scar then you're going to want to put
more<00:01:58.970> layers<00:01:59.180> of<00:01:59.330> latex<00:01:59.689> on<00:01:59.930> if<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.380> want<00:02:00.590> just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
more layers of latex on if you want just

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.780 
more layers of latex on if you want just
thin<00:02:02.200> pale<00:02:03.200> ish<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:04.840> standard<00:02:05.840> scars<00:02:06.200> then

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
thin pale ish and standard scars then

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.460 
thin pale ish and standard scars then
one<00:02:07.790> or<00:02:07.939> two<00:02:08.179> layers<00:02:08.479> at<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.750> most<00:02:09.080> I'm

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
one or two layers at the most I'm

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.080 
one or two layers at the most I'm
probably<00:02:09.739> going<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.039> do<00:02:10.189> just<00:02:10.429> one<00:02:10.610> layer<00:02:10.849> for

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
probably going to do just one layer for

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.190 
probably going to do just one layer for
these

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.899 

and<00:02:19.200> as<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.769> can<00:02:19.860> see<00:02:19.920> as<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.310> dries<00:02:20.580> it

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
and as you can see as it dries it

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.490 
and as you can see as it dries it
virtually<00:02:21.299> disappears<00:02:21.870> look<00:02:22.110> oops

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
virtually disappears look oops

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.850 
virtually disappears look oops
what<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.650> hell<00:02:25.769> put<00:02:26.099> sticks<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.560> thinner

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
what the hell put sticks so the thinner

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.080 
what the hell put sticks so the thinner
bit<00:02:29.099> is<00:02:29.310> there<00:02:29.909> but<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:30.900> just<00:02:31.849> fading<00:02:32.849> into

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
bit is there but it's just fading into

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.550 
bit is there but it's just fading into
my<00:02:33.180> skin<00:02:33.510> as<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:33.989> drying

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
my skin as it's drying

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830 
my skin as it's drying
so<00:02:35.310> I'm<00:02:35.579> going<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.760> let<00:02:35.909> them<00:02:36.090> dry<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.690> then

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
so I'm going to let them dry and then

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.539 
so I'm going to let them dry and then
I'll<00:02:36.989> come<00:02:37.260> back<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.709> show<00:02:38.159> you<00:02:38.190> what<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.459> do

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
I'll come back and show you what to do

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.420 
I'll come back and show you what to do
next<00:02:41.870> okay<00:02:42.870> once<00:02:43.230> they're<00:02:43.500> pretty<00:02:43.950> much<00:02:44.129> dry

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
next okay once they're pretty much dry

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.559 
next okay once they're pretty much dry
they're<00:02:44.609> going<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.790> look<00:02:44.909> like<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.510> you

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
they're going to look like this so you

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.699 
they're going to look like this so you

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
that bright bit there's just not quite

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.119 
that bright bit there's just not quite
dry<00:02:57.090> yet<00:02:57.180> there's<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:57.900> dry<00:02:58.109> pan<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.590> dry<00:02:58.920> one

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
dry yet there's a dry pan a dry one

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.670 
dry yet there's a dry pan a dry one
there<00:02:59.340> so<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.299> could<00:03:00.480> leave<00:03:00.659> a<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:01.170> if

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
there so you could leave a like that if

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.440 
there so you could leave a like that if
you<00:03:01.859> wanted<00:03:02.310> or<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.870> could<00:03:04.139> take<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:05.450> face

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
you wanted or you could take a face

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.319 
you wanted or you could take a face
powder<00:03:06.840> or<00:03:08.780> sort<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.930> flesh<00:03:10.440> toned<00:03:11.329> eyeshadow

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.369 

so<00:03:20.579> it'll<00:03:20.970> just<00:03:21.060> reduce<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.780> shine<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.079> little

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
so it'll just reduce the shine a little

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.039 
so it'll just reduce the shine a little
tiny<00:03:22.739> bit<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:25.730> make<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.760> blend<00:03:27.569> in<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.959> your

tiny bit and make it blend in with your

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.460 
tiny bit and make it blend in with your
skin<00:03:28.319> tone<00:03:29.269> you<00:03:30.269> could<00:03:30.480> use<00:03:30.690> your<00:03:31.049> regular

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
skin tone you could use your regular

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.789 
skin tone you could use your regular
face<00:03:32.040> powder<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:36.349> obviously<00:03:37.349> that<00:03:37.530> bits

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
not going to be blended in because it's

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.140 
not going to be blended in because it's
not<00:03:39.299> dry<00:03:39.480> yet<00:03:39.720> but<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.560> get<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.859> idea<00:03:40.889> and
