00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
placement actually affects the sound

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.270 
placement actually affects the sound
whenever<00:00:13.290> you're<00:00:13.440> recording<00:00:13.710> something<00:00:13.889> or

whenever you're recording something or

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.189 
whenever you're recording something or
when<00:00:14.370> you're<00:00:14.549> playing<00:00:14.700> live<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.269> see<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> lot<00:00:16.080> of

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.650 
guys just doing a 57 up on the amp and
just<00:00:19.560> letting<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> think

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
just letting it be that but I think

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.420 
just letting it be that but I think
you'll<00:00:21.779> find<00:00:22.050> as<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.350> move<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.769> mic<00:00:23.039> around

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
you'll find as I move this mic around

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.189 
you'll find as I move this mic around
here<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.970> minute<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.660> really

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
here in just a minute it really

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.439 
here in just a minute it really
dramatically<00:00:25.769> changes<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.279> tone<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.970> you'll

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
dramatically changes the tone and you'll

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.060 
dramatically changes the tone and you'll
see<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.840> also<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
see it also you can if you have

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.609 
see it also you can if you have
appointed<00:00:29.340> facing<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.720> guitar<00:00:31.050> yep<00:00:31.230> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
appointed facing the the guitar yep it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.520 
appointed facing the the guitar yep it
has<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.279> specific<00:00:33.090> sound<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> point<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> off

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
has a specific sound if you point it off

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.220 
has a specific sound if you point it off
access<00:00:35.040> kind<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> 45<00:00:35.820> degree<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.840> changes

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
access kind of at a 45 degree it changes

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.020 
access kind of at a 45 degree it changes
the<00:00:37.350> sound<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.860> where<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> put<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:38.879> that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the sound and where you put it on that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420 
the sound and where you put it on that
speaker<00:00:39.510> actually<00:00:39.750> change<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> sound<00:00:40.739> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
speaker actually change the sound it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250 
speaker actually change the sound it
also<00:00:41.520> makes<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> big<00:00:42.329> difference<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.050> an

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
also makes a big difference if it's an

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
also makes a big difference if it's an
inch<00:00:43.469> back<00:00:43.710> four<00:00:44.370> inches<00:00:44.579> back<00:00:44.789> six<00:00:45.090> inches

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
inch back four inches back six inches

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
inch back four inches back six inches
back<00:00:45.539> all<00:00:46.079> those<00:00:46.410> things<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.980> fairly

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
back all those things are fairly

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.740 
back all those things are fairly
critical<00:00:47.489> especially<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.239> using<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.570> mic

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
critical especially when using a mic

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.770 
critical especially when using a mic
like<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.289> sm57<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> have

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
like like sm57 so I'm going to have

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.350 
like like sm57 so I'm going to have
Travis<00:00:52.230> play<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.489> simple<00:00:54.149> riff

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
Travis play just kind of a simple riff

00:00:54.360 --> 00:02:21.809 
Travis play just kind of a simple riff
and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:55.079> I'll<00:00:55.230> move<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> mic<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:56.039> him

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.059 

so<00:02:22.819> as<00:02:22.939> you<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.150> see<00:02:23.209> there's<00:02:24.109> a<00:02:24.200> huge<00:02:24.769> amount

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
so as you can see there's a huge amount

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.209 
so as you can see there's a huge amount
of<00:02:25.189> tonal<00:02:25.549> changes<00:02:25.909> just<00:02:26.299> simply<00:02:27.079> by<00:02:27.500> moving

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:28.219 
of tonal changes just simply by moving

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.339 
of tonal changes just simply by moving
the<00:02:28.459> mic<00:02:28.640> in<00:02:28.819> different<00:02:29.090> positions<00:02:29.480> moving<00:02:30.170> it

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
the mic in different positions moving it

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.990 
the mic in different positions moving it
away<00:02:30.680> from<00:02:30.859> the<00:02:30.980> speaker<00:02:31.189> moving<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.760> closer

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
away from the speaker moving it closer

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.319 
away from the speaker moving it closer
to<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.299> speaker<00:02:32.530> moving<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.680> if<00:02:34.340> your<00:02:34.819> here's

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
to the speaker moving it if your here's

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.390 
to the speaker moving it if your here's
your<00:02:35.450> speaker<00:02:35.810> moving<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.650> across<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.159> grid

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
your speaker moving it across the grid

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.089 
your speaker moving it across the grid
there<00:02:37.870> if<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.049> move<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.319> towards<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.739> center

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
there if you move it towards the center

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.110 
there if you move it towards the center
of<00:02:40.159> the<00:02:40.219> speaker<00:02:40.489> you'll<00:02:40.730> notice<00:02:40.969> they<00:02:41.090> got

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
of the speaker you'll notice they got

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.140 
of the speaker you'll notice they got
and<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.840> lot<00:02:42.200> lot<00:02:42.680> brighter<00:02:42.980> if<00:02:43.609> you<00:02:43.670> move<00:02:43.969> it<00:02:44.060> to

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and a lot lot brighter if you move it to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.910 
and a lot lot brighter if you move it to
the<00:02:44.329> outside<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.780> start<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.409> lose<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.620> lot<00:02:45.829> of

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
the outside you start to lose a lot of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.589 
the outside you start to lose a lot of
that<00:02:46.040> presence<00:02:46.519> when<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.209> turn<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.510> off

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
that presence when you turn it off

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.949 
that presence when you turn it off
access<00:02:48.049> it's<00:02:48.290> like<00:02:48.439> a<00:02:48.469> whole<00:02:48.889> different<00:02:48.920> sound

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
access it's like a whole different sound

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.539 
access it's like a whole different sound
so<00:02:50.959> hopefully<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.650> helps<00:02:51.889> you<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.340> keep

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
so hopefully that helps you just keep

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.069 
so hopefully that helps you just keep
that<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:52.760> mind<00:02:53.090> whenever<00:02:53.359> you're<00:02:53.569> setting<00:02:53.989> up
