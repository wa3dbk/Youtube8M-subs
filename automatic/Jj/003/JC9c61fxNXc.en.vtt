00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
on the edge now look at this this one

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.670 
on the edge now look at this this one
stands<00:04:53.060> up<00:04:53.210> on<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.570> edge<00:04:53.750> like<00:04:53.780> this<00:04:54.230> so<00:04:54.500> for

stands up on the edge like this so for

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.230 
stands up on the edge like this so for
stores<00:04:54.920> you<00:04:55.190> can<00:04:55.280> actually<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:55.820> stand<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:56.150> up

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
stores you can actually just stand it up

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.430
