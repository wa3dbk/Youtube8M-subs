00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.800
 sugar and well in this video they 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.260
 I will teach a small review 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.009
 about a great and powerful application of 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:34.100
 more and good then this good application 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.270
 it's free and it's the best thing that they have 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.640
 free post because it 's the great 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.650
 application of the week and well then 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.850
 this application is called enable us 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:47.039
 let's go into it 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.530
 and well, here, as you can see, it is a 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.320
 in this way but if I already pick the most 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.390
 I'm applying right now I'll open the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.489
 matters if we want to create an issue or if 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.320
 we want to create a gray that is a divisor 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.149
 the divisor is this for example that what 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.820
 I have school as if it were a folder 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.310
 to add different notes and we're going to 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.409
 add a subject we will put the name 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.689
 and we will put the name of the video 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.990
 here we can already where is the pencil that 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.130
 I'm squeezing let's bring the note 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.840
 let's apply here the text 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.240
 we can have all the pencil marker 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.869
 between fresh let's turn it on in return 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.620
 the text we are going to put video for him 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.830
 channel 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:32.130
 this has changed as you see now we can 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:39.939
 change here that is video 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:42.460
 hello friends your letters and good since 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.750
 is that we can create ours because 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.750
 example a happy face here 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.810
 is a drawing with this marker we can 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.120
 highlight what we liked most just 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 so that we do not miss the note or 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.180
 we can delete it with this for example 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 here as I'm erasing this will erase you 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.220
 or we can remember that for example if 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.800
 we remember this image we can move it 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.530
 for example I want it here like this and 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.110
 here we can move between pages with 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.940
 this we can add an audio note 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.890
 to our bet here to the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.140
 application we can apply it here say 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.090
 good hello friends here in this note 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.740
 I'm teaching science how to use 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.120
 this wonderful and great application 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.420
 and as you see here, it's just missing 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.240
 play good here the following 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.730
 where else can we put a photo or 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.269
 submit this 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.269
 here 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.020
 we can add a legend that is 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.020
 poetics 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.130
 there they are or we can edit what he says 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.680
 here edit which means that we can 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.100
 put for example this that I am what 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.930
 I want red and then put it bigger and 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.240
 I want it to be here uncovering 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.580
 all this apple or we can trim the 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.240
 that we give ok beauties 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.980
 well the following is a figure in case 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.340
 we want to make a figure for example 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.340
 this 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.409
 and we will leave it 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.780
 and here also the following is a clip 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.950
 web is a web clip 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.319
 Well, for example if we leave 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.530
 towards the apple page 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.900
 cookie 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.459

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.470
 announcement of my iphone 5 s we give ok and 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.720
 we are going to save the page here in 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.240
 our post in our notes another 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.709

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.490
 live on ads and has iphone 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.750

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.340
 for example that I want a lines 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:02.970
 doing and we could write something what 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.770
 first a legend hello 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.120
 there is good 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.120
 here we could grate the 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.060
 and well here you are finished let's go 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.710
 add the settings the only thing that you 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.000
 is changing the color of the paper and / or 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.850
 I have blank I can put it here 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.190
 black 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.440
 or if you leave it blank 1 5% share 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.770
 and help here we can change in three 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.440
 different leaves between page 1 and 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.840
 page 2 and here we can find the page 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.150
 or put a marker 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.340

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.729
 stripe that we have more have zero meter and 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.820
 to finish we can convert it by 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.729
 mail by dropbox by google back because 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:55.000

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:12.140
 and it's all here is to put a 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.700
 icloud account and we just look here 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.540
 for example if we have many notes for 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.370
 not hinder us life 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.530
