ready to they were gonna put a door
there<00:01:56.660> but<00:01:56.840> then<00:01:56.930> decided<00:01:57.080> not<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.710> because

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
there but then decided not to because

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.109 
there but then decided not to because
maybe<00:01:58.280> there<00:01:58.460> was<00:01:58.550> too<00:01:58.610> many<00:01:58.700> doors<00:01:59.000> or

maybe there was too many doors or

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.150 
maybe there was too many doors or
