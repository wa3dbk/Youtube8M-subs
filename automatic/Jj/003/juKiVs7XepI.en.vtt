00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.230 

before<00:01:18.950> we<00:01:19.070> install<00:01:19.190> our<00:01:19.549> space<00:01:19.760> we<00:01:19.970> want<00:01:20.150> to

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
before we install our space we want to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.300 
before we install our space we want to
make<00:01:20.360> sure<00:01:20.390> we<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.750> clean<00:01:21.140> rotor<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:21.860> hub

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
make sure we have a clean rotor and hub

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.800 
make sure we have a clean rotor and hub
surface<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:22.909> I'm<00:01:23.030> just<00:01:23.270> going<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.479> gently

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
surface so I'm just going to gently

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:39.480 
surface so I'm just going to gently
clean<00:01:24.170> it<00:01:24.350> off<00:01:24.470> with<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:24.830> wire<00:01:25.070> brush

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.340 

with<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.330> clean<00:01:40.570> we<00:01:40.720> can<00:01:40.750> now<00:01:40.930> install<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
with that clean we can now install the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.990 
with that clean we can now install the
space<00:01:41.680> their<00:01:41.890> direction<00:01:42.310> doesn't<00:01:42.760> really

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
space their direction doesn't really

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.340 
space their direction doesn't really
matter<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.390> just<00:01:43.540> need<00:01:43.659> to<00:01:43.750> make<00:01:43.900> sure<00:01:43.930> it's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
matter you just need to make sure it's

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
matter you just need to make sure it's
fully<00:01:44.770> seated<00:01:45.070> around<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.460> hub<00:01:45.670> flange<00:01:46.560> as

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
fully seated around the hub flange as

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.640 
fully seated around the hub flange as
you<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.570> see<00:01:49.720> it's<00:01:49.869> totally<00:01:50.080> centered<00:01:50.530> around

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
you can see it's totally centered around

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.100 
you can see it's totally centered around
the<00:01:50.890> hub<00:01:51.159> and<00:01:51.430> not<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.729> studs<00:01:52.060> make<00:01:52.509> sure<00:01:52.720> it's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
the hub and not the studs make sure it's

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.840 
the hub and not the studs make sure it's
just<00:01:53.409> flat<00:01:53.830> up<00:01:53.950> against<00:01:54.250> there<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.549> not

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
just flat up against there and not

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.160 
just flat up against there and not
warped<00:01:55.299> in<00:01:55.420> any<00:01:55.570> way<00:01:57.150> looks<00:01:58.150> good<00:01:58.390> for<00:01:58.899> some<00:01:59.080> of
