crochet I'm a little bit gifted with it
so<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> decided<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:04.260> somewhat<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
so I decided to do this somewhat of a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.700 
so I decided to do this somewhat of a
Catherine<00:01:06.270> Wheel<00:01:06.299> stitch<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.409> here

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
Catherine Wheel stitch as you see here

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
Catherine Wheel stitch as you see here
and<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> decided<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.540> put

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and so what I decided to do is then put

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.660 
and so what I decided to do is then put
in<00:01:09.869> my<00:01:10.020> beads<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.470> between<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.460> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
in my beads in between and just like so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
in my beads in between and just like so
so<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.510> my<00:01:12.659> very<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:12.930> bracelet<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:14.070> I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
so this is my very first bracelet but I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.190 
so this is my very first bracelet but I
struggled<00:01:14.640> with<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.600> much<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
struggled with it because as much as it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.440 
struggled with it because as much as it
kind<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.409> looks<00:01:16.619> cool<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.060> time<00:01:18.270> I'm

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
kind of looks cool now at the time I'm

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.999 
kind of looks cool now at the time I'm
thinking<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.900> looks<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.380> nothing<00:01:19.860> but

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
thinking this looks like nothing but

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.920 
thinking this looks like nothing but
wire<00:01:20.250> garbage<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.509> thought<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.810> myself

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
wire garbage and I thought to myself

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.990 
wire garbage and I thought to myself
there's<00:01:22.350> got<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.710> an<00:01:23.009> easier<00:01:23.460> way<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
there's got to be an easier way the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.149 
there's got to be an easier way the
woman<00:01:24.150> at<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.390> store<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:25.159> demonstrated

lot harder than I thought and what I was
doing<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.110> was<00:01:43.320> making<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.829> critical

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
doing is that I was making a critical

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
doing is that I was making a critical
mistake<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.939> it's<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
mistake and it's just like here in the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.710 
mistake and it's just like here in the
tutorials<00:01:46.649> sometimes<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.369> miss<00:01:47.720> telling

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
tutorials sometimes that we miss telling

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.569 
tutorials sometimes that we miss telling
you<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> step<00:01:49.290> that's<00:01:49.500> involved<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.070> some<00:01:50.310> point

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you a step that's involved in some point

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.030 
you a step that's involved in some point
and<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.180> she<00:01:51.270> was<00:01:51.509> miss<00:01:51.780> telling<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.770> actual

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and so she was miss telling me an actual

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.249 
and so she was miss telling me an actual
critical<00:01:53.549> point<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:54.090> actually<00:01:54.659> getting<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
critical point I'm actually getting to

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.190 
critical point I'm actually getting to
mean<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.920> successful<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.719> screwing

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
mean to be successful so I was screwing

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.780 
mean to be successful so I was screwing
up<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.619> over<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.890> place<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.549> wire

screwing up all over the place and I
just<00:02:21.630> can't<00:02:22.140> figure<00:02:22.350> out<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:22.800> I'm<00:02:22.980> doing

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
wrong and it seems like everybody online

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.660 
wrong and it seems like everybody online
is<00:02:25.020> able<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.350> do<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.650> crocheted<00:02:26.070> jewelry<00:02:26.490> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
I can't and I can't figure out why it is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.030 
I can't and I can't figure out why it is
until<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.790> met<00:02:29.970> somebody<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.930> end<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.350> 2010

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
until I met somebody and the end of 2010

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.100 
until I met somebody and the end of 2010
they<00:02:32.490> gave<00:02:32.730> me<00:02:32.880> one<00:02:33.090> piece<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.690> critical

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
they gave me one piece of critical

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.590 
they gave me one piece of critical
advice<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:35.340> was<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.850> problem<00:02:36.120> with<00:02:36.540> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
advice and that was the problem with the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.170 
advice and that was the problem with the
hook<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.740> hook<00:02:38.010> was<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.550> biggest<00:02:38.940> issue

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
hook and the hook was the biggest issue

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.900 
hook and the hook was the biggest issue
and<00:02:39.660> was<00:02:40.440> actually<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> very<00:02:41.130> easiest<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.820> be

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
and was actually the very easiest to be

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.060 
and was actually the very easiest to be
solved<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> didn't<00:02:43.140> realize<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.530> was<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
solved but I didn't realize that was the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.860 
solved but I didn't realize that was the
issue<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.850> let's<00:02:44.970> go<00:02:45.120> through<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> materials

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
issue so let's go through the materials

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.030 
issue so let's go through the materials
that<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.440> table<00:02:46.590> here

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
and let's go through a verbal

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.570 
and let's go through a verbal

that<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.360> see<00:02:54.390> here<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.260> biggest<00:02:55.590> problem

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
that you see here the biggest problem

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.590 
that you see here the biggest problem
that<00:02:55.980> there<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.790> that's<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.120> biggest<00:02:57.420> tip

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
that there is and that's the biggest tip

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.630 
that there is and that's the biggest tip
that<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:57.870> ever<00:02:58.110> get<00:02:58.350> from<00:02:58.530> me<00:02:58.709> with<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.400> is

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that you ever get from me with this is

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.150 
that you ever get from me with this is
the<00:03:00.030> actual<00:03:00.330> crochet<00:03:00.780> hook<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.650> exactly

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
the actual crochet hook this is exactly

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.340 
the actual crochet hook this is exactly
where<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.489> was<00:03:02.760> screwing<00:03:03.209> up<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.360> within<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
where I was screwing up so within the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.140 
where I was screwing up so within the
four<00:03:04.560> people<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.980> told<00:03:05.310> me<00:03:05.430> what<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> need<00:03:06.000> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
four people that told me what I need to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.600 
four people that told me what I need to
do<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.600> all<00:03:06.750> made<00:03:06.959> sense<00:03:07.200> only<00:03:07.739> one<00:03:08.160> person

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
do that all made sense only one person

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.449 
do that all made sense only one person
gave<00:03:08.760> me<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.030> idea<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.810> actually<00:03:10.800> it's<00:03:11.250> the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
gave me the idea that actually it's the

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.830 
gave me the idea that actually it's the
hook<00:03:11.640> that<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> problem<00:03:12.510> it's<00:03:12.660> not

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
hook that is the problem it's not

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.050 
hook that is the problem it's not
necessarily<00:03:13.410> my<00:03:13.530> technique<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.670> was

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
necessarily my technique and so I was

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.449 
necessarily my technique and so I was
using<00:03:15.270> resin<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.080> was<00:03:16.260> using<00:03:16.620> aluminum<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.340> I

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
using resin I was using aluminum and I

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.370 
using resin I was using aluminum and I
was<00:03:17.580> using<00:03:17.760> plastic<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.870> problem<00:03:19.230> with

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
was using plastic and the problem with

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.530 
was using plastic and the problem with
the<00:03:19.500> crochet<00:03:19.920> wire<00:03:20.220> here<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.330> likes

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
the crochet wire here is that it likes

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.810 
the crochet wire here is that it likes
to<00:03:21.720> gouge<00:03:21.989> in<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.500> snag<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.280> when<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.519> snags

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
to gouge in a snag and so when it snags

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.190 
to gouge in a snag and so when it snags
you<00:03:24.030> want<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> pull<00:03:24.450> extra<00:03:24.780> hard<00:03:25.019> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
you want to pull extra hard and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.590 
you want to pull extra hard and
therefore<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.040> get<00:03:26.190> extra<00:03:26.670> really<00:03:26.970> big<00:03:27.180> ugly

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
therefore you get extra really big ugly

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.330 
therefore you get extra really big ugly
loops<00:03:27.870> coming<00:03:28.080> out<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.500> your<00:03:28.650> work<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.190> then

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
loops coming out of your work and then

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.680 
loops coming out of your work and then
because<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:29.850> wire<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.239> has<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.390> permanent

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
because it's wire it has a permanent

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.570 
because it's wire it has a permanent

get yourself a steel crochet hook it has
to<00:03:40.470> be<00:03:40.590> steel<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.519> like<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.880> shaping<00:03:42.150> of

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
to be steel and I like the shaping of

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.199 
to be steel and I like the shaping of
the<00:03:42.690> ones<00:03:42.900> at<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.980> top<00:03:44.220> here<00:03:44.489> it's<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:45.060> lot

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
the ones at the top here it's a lot

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.420 
the ones at the top here it's a lot
easier<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.080> deal<00:03:46.230> with<00:03:46.260> when<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:46.709> shape<00:03:46.980> just

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
easier to deal with when it's shape just

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.479 
easier to deal with when it's shape just
like<00:03:47.549> so<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.450> says<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.840> size<00:03:49.049> J<00:03:49.410> or<00:03:49.650> 6.0

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
like so and this says the size J or 6.0

here and these wires here are really
amazing<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:35.039> work<00:04:35.189> with<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.879> you<00:04:36.000> don't<00:04:36.180> want

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
amazing to work with but you don't want

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.999 
amazing to work with but you don't want
to<00:04:36.389> scratch<00:04:36.750> them<00:04:37.050> up<00:04:37.169> too<00:04:37.349> much<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.740> want

and the surface coating for it also with
you're<00:04:45.449> looking<00:04:45.750> for<00:04:45.930> wire<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.409> you<00:04:46.650> don't

basis<00:06:29.669> so<00:06:29.909> over<00:06:30.210> time<00:06:30.449> what<00:06:30.900> we've<00:06:31.050> done<00:06:31.259> is

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:31.469 
basis so over time what we've done is

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:32.930 
basis so over time what we've done is
that<00:06:31.500> we've<00:06:31.680> gone<00:06:31.979> from<00:06:32.190> this<00:06:32.400> which<00:06:32.610> is<00:06:32.789> my

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
that we've gone from this which is my

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.180 
that we've gone from this which is my
very<00:06:33.000> first<00:06:33.419> one<00:06:33.569> that<00:06:33.629> I<00:06:33.839> ever<00:06:34.050> did<00:06:34.379> and<00:06:34.589> we've

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
very first one that I ever did and we've

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.490 
very first one that I ever did and we've
gone<00:06:35.399> now<00:06:35.729> to<00:06:35.789> something<00:06:36.330> like<00:06:36.569> this<00:06:36.870> that<00:06:37.380> is

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
gone now to something like this that is

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.249 
gone now to something like this that is
more<00:06:37.919> brilliant<00:06:38.219> it's<00:06:38.669> amazing<00:06:39.539> you<00:06:40.020> know<00:06:40.050> the

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
more brilliant it's amazing you know the

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.570 
more brilliant it's amazing you know the
course<00:06:40.560> the<00:06:40.860> the<00:06:41.130> choice

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
course the the choice

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.420 
course the the choice
of<00:06:41.849> actual<00:06:42.449> beads<00:06:43.169> make<00:06:43.590> all<00:06:43.800> the<00:06:44.099> world<00:06:44.280> a

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
of actual beads make all the world a

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.279 
of actual beads make all the world a
difference<00:06:44.819> and<00:06:45.060> so<00:06:45.599> basically<00:06:45.990> when<00:06:46.229> you

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289 
difference and so basically when you

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.080 
difference and so basically when you
look<00:06:46.379> at<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.740> two<00:06:46.889> side-by-side<00:06:47.189> you<00:06:47.580> can<00:06:47.759> see

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
look at the two side-by-side you can see

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.820 
look at the two side-by-side you can see
for<00:06:48.330> myself<00:06:48.689> there's<00:06:48.900> some<00:06:49.050> evolution<00:06:49.620> taking

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
for myself there's some evolution taking

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.980 
for myself there's some evolution taking
place<00:06:50.009> and<00:06:50.460> just<00:06:50.490> being<00:06:51.270> able<00:06:51.419> to<00:06:51.539> learn<00:06:51.780> the

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
place and just being able to learn the

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.080 
place and just being able to learn the
skills<00:06:52.289> in<00:06:52.680> order<00:06:53.129> to<00:06:53.280> get<00:06:53.460> everything<00:06:53.789> to

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
skills in order to get everything to

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.209 
skills in order to get everything to
work<00:06:54.240> properly<00:06:54.569> together<00:06:55.169> so<00:06:55.860> let's<00:06:56.039> go

00:06:56.209 --> 00:06:56.219 
work properly together so let's go

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.929
