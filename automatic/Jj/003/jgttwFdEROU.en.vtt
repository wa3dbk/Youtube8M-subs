00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.920 
their events so that gives some
credibility<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.170> an<00:00:49.680> apple<00:00:50.280> usually<00:00:50.610> gives<00:00:50.930> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
credibility I an apple usually gives the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.779 
credibility I an apple usually gives the
people<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.530> send<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> invitations<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
people that they send the invitations to

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
people that they send the invitations to
about<00:00:54.090> 10<00:00:54.420> days<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.899> confirm<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.680> not
