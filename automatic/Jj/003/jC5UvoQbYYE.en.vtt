00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.000
 Bass Kulcha ... 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 Muderah ... 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.680
 Give me your vibes, give me your support, give me warmth 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.840
 Share the energy, spread the message 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.240
 Give me the lighta, give me the vibes, give me your love. 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.230
 All to one, those hands in the air! 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.590
 Bass Kulcha, in a raggamuffin style, Muderah! 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.360
 Bass Kulcha original style, come follow me ... 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.000
 Bass Kulcha, universal music. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.760
 Since I woke up, playing in my area 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.420
 In English, in French, Spanish or patwa 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.060
 From Tenerife I can sing it, my given. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.820
 All the styles have me 'hooked', 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.440
 either on vinyl, on sound system or 'tocao' 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.560
 Dancehall, raggamuffin, roots reggae, dub style 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.060
 or that new move they call revival. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.980
 When I hold the mic I feel invincible, 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.640
 I know that scratching the soul of people is possible 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.270
 Bass Kulcha, it will be like fuel, 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.220
 when difficult moments arise in life. 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.129
 No competition, get out of that prison, 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.140
 Here each brother has his own mission. 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.340
 We are all important, that is my vision, 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 This way the scene will grow with each small action. 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.570
 Give me your vibes, give me your support, give me warmth 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 share the energy, spread the message, 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.920
 Give me the lighta, give the vibes, give me your love. 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.340
 All to one: those hands in the air! 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.120
 Bass Kulcha in a raggamuffin style, Muderah! 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.659
 Bass Kulcha original style, come follow me ... 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.419
 There were unscrupulous producers 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.220
 that for a paltry salary 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.360
 the artists exploded without any remorse. 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.800
 To those who were the origin, the key to this movement 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 we owe them respect and recognition. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.020
 Beyond the racial revolts in Brixton, 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.260
 of creating a bad name for dreadlocks in Kingston, 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.360
 of the sign that prohibited entry into the booths 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000
 NO IRISH, NO BLACKS, NO DOGS. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.840
 From Jamaica to London or Birmingham, 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.320
 from Studio One to La Pama, from Trojan to Island. 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.180
 Link between races, 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.000
 This culture came here to unify. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.100
 Give thanks! 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.880
 Give me your vibes, give me your support, give me warmth. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.300
 Share the energy, spread the message. 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.680
 Give me the lighta, give me the vibes, give me your love. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.620
 All to one, those hands in the air! 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.280
 Bass Kulcha in a raggamuffin style, Muderah! 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.560
 Bass Kulcha original style, come follow me ... 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.780
 Muderah ... 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.260
 Give me your vibes, give me your support, give me warmth, 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.520
 share the energy, spread the message, 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.780
 Give me the lighta, give the vibes, give me your love, 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.840
 All to one: those hands in the air! 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.900
 Bass Kulcha in a raggamuffin style, Muderah! 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.260
 Bass Kulcha, original style, come follow me ... 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.380
 ... Ras Kuko in the mic is going to put you in orbit, 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.239
 you will not be able to resist, grab your baby gyal, 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.000
 As a bulletproof vest against laziness, 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.320
 Swallow this scabbard like medicine. 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.400
 To all the queens I say that they are pretty well 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.900
 that they take to their manes to set fire in the bar 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.000
 And if they look for something real, fresh and of quality, 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.500
 join the massive Kulcha Bass 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.559
 When I hold the mic I feel invincible, 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.080
 I know that scratching people's souls is possible. 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.000
 Bass Kulcha will be like fuel 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.900
 When difficult moments arise in life. 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.000
 No competition, get out of that prison, 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.100
 here each brother has his own mission, 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.740
 we are all important, that is my vision, 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.020
 This way the scene will grow with each small action ...
