00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
adding another layer kind of in the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
adding another layer kind of in the
background<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.000> definitely<00:00:48.180> a

background on that it's definitely a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.580 
background on that it's definitely a
rhythm<00:00:48.960> layer<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.629> set<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:55.080> a<00:00:55.110> dotted

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590

eighth<00:00:55.769> delay<00:00:57.080> I'm<00:00:58.080> now<00:00:58.320> using<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.890> neck

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
eighth delay I'm now using my neck

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.579 
eighth delay I'm now using my neck
pickup<00:00:59.850> instead<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.659> bridge<00:01:00.870> pickup<00:01:01.290> I've

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
pickup instead of my bridge pickup I've

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.289 
pickup instead of my bridge pickup I've
got<00:01:01.830> my<00:01:01.979> tone<00:01:02.220> rolled<00:01:02.519> back<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.089> little

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
got my tone rolled back just a little

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.240 
got my tone rolled back just a little
bit<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.629> want<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.839> be<00:01:03.989> real<00:01:04.199> subtle<00:01:04.559> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
bit because I want to be real subtle and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.910 
bit because I want to be real subtle and
I'm<00:01:05.909> using<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.330> dotted<00:01:06.600> eighth<00:01:06.720> delay<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.830> I'm

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
I'm using a dotted eighth delay but I'm

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.560 
I'm using a dotted eighth delay but I'm
also<00:01:08.100> playing<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.150> dotted<00:01:09.450> eighth

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
also playing kind of a dotted eighth

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.910 
also playing kind of a dotted eighth
line<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.470> listen<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> play<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.370> line<00:01:15.920> you

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
line so listen when I play the line you

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
line so listen when I play the line you
almost<00:01:17.130> can't<00:01:17.490> tell<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:18.600> delay<00:01:18.900> is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
almost can't tell that the delay is

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.789 
almost can't tell that the delay is
there<00:01:19.430> until<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.760> deviate<00:01:21.570> from<00:01:21.840> playing<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
there until I deviate from playing that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
there until I deviate from playing that
exact<00:01:23.220> pattern<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
exact pattern and that's kind of the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
exact pattern and that's kind of the
point<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.520> wanted<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.510> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
point that I wanted to make with this is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.450 
point that I wanted to make with this is
that<00:01:28.260> we've<00:01:28.500> got<00:01:28.650> our<00:01:28.740> straight<00:01:28.950> eighth<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
that we've got our straight eighth and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880 
that we've got our straight eighth and
kind<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.700> our<00:01:29.790> dreamy<00:01:30.210> sound<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:31.590> had<00:01:31.710> some

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
kind of our dreamy sound that had some

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.470 
kind of our dreamy sound that had some
reverb<00:01:32.220> on<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.400> add<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.910> bit<00:01:33.000> delay<00:01:33.270> on

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
reverb on it add a little bit delay on

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.080 
reverb on it add a little bit delay on
it<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.710> we've<00:01:34.860> got<00:01:35.010> this<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:38.000> where<00:01:39.000> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it and then we've got this one where it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.620 
it and then we've got this one where it
actually<00:01:39.390> sounds<00:01:39.690> quite<00:01:39.870> dry<00:01:40.320> until<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.280> do

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.210 

until<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.660> do<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.050> little<00:01:46.230> line<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.770> we're

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
until I do that little line so we're

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.430 
until I do that little line so we're
here<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.790> fifth<00:01:48.240> fret<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:50.870> then<00:01:51.870> fifth<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
here the fifth fret and then fifth and

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.870 
here the fifth fret and then fifth and
seventh<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:52.980> a<00:01:53.100> string<00:01:53.400> that's<00:01:53.610> all

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
seventh on your a string that's all

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.690 
seventh on your a string that's all
you're<00:01:54.120> doing<00:01:54.590> but<00:01:55.590> you're<00:01:55.980> doing<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.370> in<00:01:56.520> such

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you're doing but you're doing it in such

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.380 
you're doing but you're doing it in such
a<00:01:56.730> way<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:58.280> you're<00:01:59.280> playing<00:01:59.580> exactly<00:02:00.240> with

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
a way that you're playing exactly with

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.170 
a way that you're playing exactly with
the<00:02:00.480> delay<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.080> then<00:02:01.470> you're<00:02:01.650> letting<00:02:02.120> by<00:02:03.120> it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the delay and then you're letting by it

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.560 
the delay and then you're letting by it
by<00:02:03.510> putting<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:03.990> little<00:02:04.230> riff<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:05.570> you're

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
by putting this little riff in you're

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
by putting this little riff in you're
letting<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.870> kind<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.310> blossom<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.459> in

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
letting that kind of blossom out in

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.369 
letting that kind of blossom out in
certain<00:02:09.090> places<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.659> kind<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.989> peak<00:02:10.170> out

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
certain places and just kind of peak out

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.890 
certain places and just kind of peak out
every<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.370> often<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.940> when<00:02:12.330> you're<00:02:12.450> arranging

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
every so often and when you're arranging

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.300 
every so often and when you're arranging
for<00:02:13.140> multiple<00:02:13.500> guitar<00:02:13.800> parts<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.220> you're

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
for multiple guitar parts and you're

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.809 
for multiple guitar parts and you're
using<00:02:14.459> effects<00:02:14.879> this<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.440> key<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.099> might

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
using effects this is so key you might

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.280 
using effects this is so key you might
have<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.120> effect<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> whole<00:02:18.810> time<00:02:19.050> but

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
have the effect on the whole time but

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.899 
have the effect on the whole time but
you<00:02:19.349> kind<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.650> hide<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.640> with<00:02:20.790> your

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
you kind of hide it and then with your

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.570 
you kind of hide it and then with your
playing<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.810> bring<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> delay<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:22.680> alright

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
playing you bring the delay out alright

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.130 
playing you bring the delay out alright
so<00:02:23.640> I'm<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:23.970> play<00:02:24.180> along<00:02:24.599> with<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.780> again

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
so I'm going to play along with it again

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.009 
so I'm going to play along with it again
listen<00:02:26.040> carefully<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.549> how<00:02:26.629> the<00:02:27.629> way<00:02:27.810> I'm

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
listen carefully to how the way I'm

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.530 
listen carefully to how the way I'm
playing<00:02:28.879> emphasizes<00:02:29.879> the<00:02:30.000> fact<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.360> have

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
playing emphasizes the fact that I have

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.000 
playing emphasizes the fact that I have
that<00:02:30.750> delay<00:02:31.049> effect<00:02:31.409> then<00:02:31.680> we'll<00:02:31.799> talk<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
that delay effect then we'll talk a

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.530 
that delay effect then we'll talk a
little<00:02:32.159> bit<00:02:32.370> more<00:02:32.519> about<00:02:32.879> exactly<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.450> I'm

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
little bit more about exactly what I'm

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:55.010 
little bit more about exactly what I'm
using

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.750 

so<00:02:56.020> I<00:02:56.050> kind<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.500> emphasized<00:02:57.069> it<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.370> little<00:02:57.580> bit

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
so I kind of emphasized it a little bit

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.940 
so I kind of emphasized it a little bit
more<00:02:58.000> but<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.810> can<00:02:58.959> tell<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.200> whenever<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.650> go

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
more but you can tell that whenever I go

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.000 
more but you can tell that whenever I go
to<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.310> thing<00:03:00.550> up<00:03:00.700> here<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:02.350> delay<00:03:02.680> stands

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
to this thing up here that delay stands

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.270 
to this thing up here that delay stands
out<00:03:03.220> because<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:04.060> cut<00:03:04.450> off<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.780> note<00:03:05.019> so

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
out because I I cut off that note so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.009 
out because I I cut off that note so
what<00:03:06.280> I'm<00:03:06.370> doing<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.970> I'm<00:03:07.120> writing<00:03:07.450> simple

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
what I'm doing is I'm writing simple

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.190 
what I'm doing is I'm writing simple
parts<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.860> accentuate<00:03:09.640> a<00:03:09.880> delay<00:03:10.600> effect<00:03:10.959> as

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
parts that accentuate a delay effect as

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.130 
parts that accentuate a delay effect as
opposed<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.769> writing<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:12.069> really<00:03:12.720> complex<00:03:13.720> you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
opposed to writing a really complex you

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.650 
opposed to writing a really complex you
know<00:03:14.170> fast<00:03:14.739> thing<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.370> then<00:03:15.790> slapping<00:03:16.510> some

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
know fast thing and then slapping some

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.910 
know fast thing and then slapping some
delay<00:03:16.870> or<00:03:17.019> slapping<00:03:17.350> some<00:03:17.470> chorus<00:03:17.709> on<00:03:17.830> it

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
delay or slapping some chorus on it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.890 
delay or slapping some chorus on it
which<00:03:18.040> sometimes<00:03:18.519> can<00:03:18.670> work<00:03:18.880> but<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.750> this

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
which sometimes can work but in this

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.070 
which sometimes can work but in this
case<00:03:20.140> I'm<00:03:20.380> writing<00:03:20.799> for<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.430> effect<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:22.080> want

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
case I'm writing for the effect I want

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.680 
case I'm writing for the effect I want
it<00:03:23.140> to<00:03:23.260> be<00:03:23.350> simple<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.920> want<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.250> be<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> layer

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
it to be simple I want it to be a layer

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.789 
it to be simple I want it to be a layer
let's<00:03:25.690> talk<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.900> little<00:03:26.170> bit<00:03:26.319> more<00:03:26.500> about<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
let's talk a little bit more about the

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.650 
let's talk a little bit more about the
exact<00:03:27.130> effect<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> stereo<00:03:30.970> delay<00:03:31.209> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
exact effect this is a stereo delay the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.410 
exact effect this is a stereo delay the
last<00:03:31.900> one<00:03:32.080> was<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.260> mono<00:03:32.500> delay<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.330> what<00:03:34.330> I've

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
last one was a mono delay and what I've

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.920 
last one was a mono delay and what I've
got<00:03:34.600> I've<00:03:34.720> got<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.900> ping<00:03:35.170> pong<00:03:35.200> delay<00:03:35.680> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
got I've got a ping pong delay and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.750 
got I've got a ping pong delay and
because<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.110> not<00:03:38.260> at<00:03:38.410> 8:00

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.620 

one<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:42.910> repeats<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.269> gonna<00:03:43.420> happen

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
one of the repeats is gonna happen

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.449 
one of the repeats is gonna happen
closer<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.350> your<00:03:44.590> right<00:03:44.739> speaker<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.310> the

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
closer to your right speaker and the

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.910 
closer to your right speaker and the
other<00:03:45.579> repeats<00:03:45.970> gonna<00:03:46.209> happen<00:03:46.709> closer<00:03:47.709> to

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
other repeats gonna happen closer to

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.800 
other repeats gonna happen closer to
your<00:03:48.040> left<00:03:48.220> speaker<00:03:48.579> when<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.269> get<00:03:49.420> this<00:03:49.540> riff

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
your left speaker when you get this riff

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.699 
your left speaker when you get this riff
going<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:54.640> creates<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.299> really<00:03:55.720> nice<00:03:55.900> space<00:03:56.200> now

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
going it creates a really nice space now

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.410 
going it creates a really nice space now
I<00:03:56.739> don't<00:03:56.890> have<00:03:57.280> any<00:03:57.489> reverb<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:58.060> this<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:58.390> have

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
I don't have any reverb on this I have

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.750 
I don't have any reverb on this I have
it<00:03:58.660> super<00:03:58.870> dry<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.590> I'm<00:03:59.950> letting<00:04:00.130> that<00:04:00.430> kind

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
it super dry and I'm letting that kind

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.330 
it super dry and I'm letting that kind
of<00:04:00.850> stereo<00:04:01.299> repeat<00:04:01.750> thing<00:04:02.109> create<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.100> space

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
of stereo repeat thing create the space

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.670 
of stereo repeat thing create the space
rather<00:04:03.609> than<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.970> reverb<00:04:04.299> I<00:04:04.480> think<00:04:05.320> that

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
rather than the reverb I think that

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.530 
rather than the reverb I think that
because<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.400> previous<00:04:06.850> line<00:04:07.120> was<00:04:07.329> so

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
because that the previous line was so

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.259 
because that the previous line was so
wet<00:04:07.840> with<00:04:08.500> that<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.640> know<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.820> little<00:04:10.180> bit

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
wet with that that you know a little bit

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.610 
wet with that that you know a little bit
more<00:04:10.329> feedback<00:04:10.660> on<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.019> delay<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.530> the

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
more feedback on the delay and the

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.979 
more feedback on the delay and the
reverb<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.190> this<00:04:12.670> one<00:04:12.850> needs<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.150> be<00:04:13.239> dry<00:04:13.660> but

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
reverb that this one needs to be dry but

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.080 
reverb that this one needs to be dry but
it<00:04:14.140> still<00:04:14.410> needs<00:04:14.620> space<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.519> opted<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:15.970> not

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
it still needs space so I opted to not

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.420 
it still needs space so I opted to not
go<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.750> reverb<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:17.289> that<00:04:17.799> helped<00:04:18.070> these<00:04:18.220> two

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
go for reverb and that helped these two

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.830 
go for reverb and that helped these two
parts<00:04:18.760> blend<00:04:19.180> together<00:04:19.390> well<00:04:20.070> alright

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
parts blend together well alright

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.620 
parts blend together well alright
I've<00:04:22.840> also<00:04:23.110> got<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.800> high-cut<00:04:24.729> set<00:04:25.120> up<00:04:25.270> on<00:04:25.479> the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
I've also got a high-cut set up on the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:34.520 
I've also got a high-cut set up on the
delay<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.650> where<00:04:27.600> if<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:28.690> listen<00:04:28.960> to<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.080> note

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.750 

notice<00:04:35.530> first<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.889> all<00:04:36.010> how<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.220> high<00:04:36.460> end<00:04:36.639> is

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
notice first of all how the high end is

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.659 
notice first of all how the high end is
really<00:04:37.120> lost<00:04:37.360> on<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.720> repeats<00:04:38.050> also<00:04:38.979> I've<00:04:39.190> got

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
really lost on the repeats also I've got

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.779 
really lost on the repeats also I've got
modulation

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.420 

set<00:04:43.629> kind<00:04:43.779> of<00:04:43.900> fast<00:04:44.169> so<00:04:44.499> there's<00:04:45.099> this<00:04:45.189> kind<00:04:45.339> of

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
set kind of fast so there's this kind of

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.299 
set kind of fast so there's this kind of
flutter<00:04:45.789> it's<00:04:46.449> not<00:04:46.689> a<00:04:46.949> gradual<00:04:47.949> kind<00:04:48.189> of

00:04:48.299 --> 00:04:48.309 
flutter it's not a gradual kind of

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:49.950 
flutter it's not a gradual kind of
smooth<00:04:48.699> thing<00:04:49.059> like<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.419> other<00:04:49.569> one

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
smooth thing like the other one

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.629 
smooth thing like the other one
it's<00:04:50.199> a<00:04:50.319> flutter<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:51.719> it's<00:04:52.719> kind<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.050> detuned

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
it's a flutter and it's kind of detuned

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.589 
it's a flutter and it's kind of detuned
but<00:04:54.639> when<00:04:54.819> you're<00:04:54.939> low<00:04:57.059> that<00:04:58.059> just<00:04:58.389> it

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
but when you're low that just it

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.360 
but when you're low that just it

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
is is a huge thing but hopefully this

gonna do a really rhythmic part try a
dotted<00:05:13.719> eighth<00:05:13.839> delay<00:05:14.169> if<00:05:14.289> it's<00:05:14.409> kind<00:05:14.589> of<00:05:14.650> a

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
dotted eighth delay if it's kind of a

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.879 
dotted eighth delay if it's kind of a
straight<00:05:15.009> straight<00:05:15.460> part<00:05:15.729> like<00:05:15.879> this<00:05:16.120> and

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
straight straight part like this and

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.529 
straight straight part like this and
combine<00:05:17.889> that<00:05:18.219> with<00:05:18.279> some<00:05:18.430> other<00:05:18.669> things<00:05:18.939> so

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
combine that with some other things so

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.749 
combine that with some other things so
there's<00:05:20.139> our<00:05:20.289> second<00:05:20.710> layer<00:05:20.889> hopefully

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759
