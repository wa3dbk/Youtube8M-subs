00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
embed gadget we're going to use the HTML

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.350 
embed gadget we're going to use the HTML
editor<00:00:10.110> on<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.440> page<00:00:11.010> itself<00:00:11.580> pretty<00:00:12.179> simple

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360

process let's review it here are a
couple<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.299> projects<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.529> inserted

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
couple of projects that we inserted

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.460 
couple of projects that we inserted
using<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.730> embed<00:00:17.880> gadget<00:00:18.570> let's<00:00:18.990> take<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> look

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
using the embed gadget let's take a look

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.400 
using the embed gadget let's take a look
at<00:00:19.590> how<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.859> use<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.400> HTML<00:00:20.600> editor<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.779> what

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
at how to use the HTML editor and what

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.019 
at how to use the HTML editor and what
they<00:00:22.529> would<00:00:22.710> look<00:00:22.830> like<00:00:23.039> well<00:00:23.519> first<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> all

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
we need to go get the HTML code so let's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.540 
we need to go get the HTML code so let's
go<00:00:27.660> get<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.019> code<00:00:28.320> here's<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.830> project<00:00:29.340> we

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
go get that code here's that project we

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.540 
go get that code here's that project we
worked<00:00:29.730> before<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.359> we're<00:00:30.630> looking<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:31.140> the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.679 
can see right here the embed gadget does
put<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> little<00:01:56.490> frame<00:01:56.880> around<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.570> an

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
put a little frame around it with an

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.719 
put a little frame around it with an
embed<00:01:57.990> gadget<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.740> place<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.159> some<00:01:59.340> text

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
embed gadget and a place for some text

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.630 
embed gadget and a place for some text
this<00:02:00.390> gives<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> little<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:00.930> cleaner<00:02:01.290> look

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
this gives a little bit cleaner look

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.649 
this gives a little bit cleaner look
really<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> same<00:02:03.000> thing<00:02:03.299> only<00:02:03.540> much<00:02:04.320> more

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
really the same thing only much more

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.570 
really the same thing only much more
much<00:02:06.659> more<00:02:06.840> quickly<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.560> terms<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.369> putting

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
much more quickly in terms of putting

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.600 
much more quickly in terms of putting
that<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.000> let's<00:02:09.629> try<00:02:09.810> another<00:02:09.869> one<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:11.250> down

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that on let's try another one so down

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
that on let's try another one so down
here<00:02:11.910> we<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.300> video<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:13.020> we

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
here we have a video that we

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.119 
here we have a video that we
embedded<00:02:13.950> using<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> embed<00:02:14.489> gadget<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:16.129> let's

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
embedded using the embed gadget so let's

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.850 
embedded using the embed gadget so let's
use<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.640> HTML<00:02:17.790> editor<00:02:18.540> let's<00:02:19.110> go<00:02:19.290> back<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
use the HTML editor let's go back to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.339 
use the HTML editor let's go back to
that<00:02:20.010> video<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.730> we<00:02:20.970> want<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.420> copy<00:02:21.989> that

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
like pretty much the same only we don't

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.909 
like pretty much the same only we don't
have<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.280> embed<00:03:20.669> gadget<00:03:21.060> up<00:03:21.180> there<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.919> it's

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
have that embed gadget up there and it's

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.409 
have that embed gadget up there and it's
a<00:03:23.099> little<00:03:23.370> bit<00:03:23.459> cleaner<00:03:23.669> to<00:03:23.790> look<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.120> little

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
faster to put it on there as well so

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.309 
faster to put it on there as well so
that's<00:03:26.760> how<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.030> use<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.540> embed<00:03:27.810> code<00:03:27.870> with

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
that's how you use the embed code with

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.449 
that's how you use the embed code with
the<00:03:28.530> HTML<00:03:29.489> source<00:03:29.910> code<00:03:30.329> editor<00:03:31.310> hope<00:03:32.310> you

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
the HTML source code editor hope you

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.950 
the HTML source code editor hope you
found<00:03:32.579> this<00:03:32.760> video<00:03:32.940> helpful<00:03:33.530> have<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.560> good<00:03:34.799> day
