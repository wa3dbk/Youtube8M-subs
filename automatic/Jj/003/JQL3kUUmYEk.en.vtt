I<00:00:09.970> think<00:00:10.970> there's<00:00:11.120> three<00:00:11.540> three<00:00:12.170> main<00:00:12.410> ways

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
I think there's three three main ways

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
the the first is with SAS based

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.800 
the the first is with SAS based
businesses<00:00:21.439> software<00:00:21.920> as<00:00:21.980> a<00:00:22.040> service<00:00:22.460> it's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
businesses software as a service it's

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.470 
businesses software as a service it's
typically<00:00:23.810> when<00:00:24.080> when<00:00:24.710> people<00:00:25.010> will<00:00:25.130> sort<00:00:25.369> of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
typically when when people will sort of

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.230 
typically when when people will sort of
come<00:00:26.480> in<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:26.990> create<00:00:27.410> a<00:00:27.470> web<00:00:27.980> service<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:29.060> web

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
come in and create a web service a web

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.920 
come in and create a web service a web
application<00:00:29.449> that<00:00:31.180> streamlines<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.419> process

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
application that streamlines a process

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.790 
application that streamlines a process
that<00:00:32.960> was<00:00:33.550> traditionally<00:00:34.550> done<00:00:34.820> often<00:00:35.570> by<00:00:36.199> by

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
that was traditionally done often by by

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.280 
that was traditionally done often by by
somebody<00:00:37.160> using<00:00:37.550> Excel<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:38.390> pulling

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
somebody using Excel and pulling

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.720 
somebody using Excel and pulling
information<00:00:39.410> in<00:00:39.980> from<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.340> bunch<00:00:40.519> of<00:00:40.670> different

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
information in from a bunch of different

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.639 
information in from a bunch of different
sources<00:00:41.270> and<00:00:41.570> trying<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.840> manage<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:42.290> by<00:00:42.440> hand

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
sources and trying to manage it by hand

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.389 
sources and trying to manage it by hand
in<00:00:42.829> Excel<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.320> people<00:00:45.320> will<00:00:45.620> create<00:00:45.950> a<00:00:45.980> web

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
in Excel and so people will create a web

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.729 
in Excel and so people will create a web
service<00:00:46.670> which<00:00:47.210> uses<00:00:47.660> a<00:00:47.690> database<00:00:48.379> is

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
service which uses a database is

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.350 
service which uses a database is
searchable<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:49.550> really<00:00:49.969> I<00:00:50.000> sort<00:00:50.300> of

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
searchable and really I sort of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.780 
searchable and really I sort of
step-by-step<00:00:50.800> processes<00:00:51.800> for<00:00:52.250> helping

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
step-by-step processes for helping

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.330 
step-by-step processes for helping
people<00:00:53.120> sort<00:00:53.539> of<00:00:53.570> manage<00:00:53.899> this<00:00:54.110> one<00:00:55.010> example

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
people sort of manage this one example

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.580 
people sort of manage this one example
of<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:56.149> a<00:00:56.239> company<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.140> worked<00:00:57.440> with

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
of this is a company that I worked with

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.549 
of this is a company that I worked with
it<00:00:57.770> the<00:00:57.890> I<00:00:57.920> accelerator<00:00:58.460> called<00:00:58.700> recruiterbox

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
it the I accelerator called recruiterbox

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.150 
it the I accelerator called recruiterbox
so<00:01:00.559> they're<00:01:00.800> an<00:01:00.920> applicant<00:01:01.370> tracking<00:01:01.489> service

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
it's app based businesses and so app

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.339 
it's app based businesses and so app
based<00:02:19.489> apps<00:02:20.150> tend<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:20.690> be<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> little<00:02:21.170> bit

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349

smaller<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:21.980> more<00:02:22.190> sing

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
smaller and more sing

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.700 
smaller and more sing
purpose<00:02:22.970> then<00:02:23.270> then<00:02:23.990> web<00:02:24.260> services

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
purpose then then web services

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.900

traditionally<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:27.740> nice<00:02:28.130> thing<00:02:28.400> about<00:02:28.520> them

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
traditionally the nice thing about them

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.420 
traditionally the nice thing about them
is<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.150> they<00:02:29.540> have<00:02:29.810> an<00:02:30.230> upfront<00:02:30.590> costs<00:02:30.980> and

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
so a lot of times a sort of an

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.830 
so a lot of times a sort of an
application<00:02:34.160> like<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.370> horoscope<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.330> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
application like a horoscope that you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.720 
application like a horoscope that you
would<00:02:35.960> be<00:02:36.110> used<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.440> getting<00:02:36.710> for<00:02:36.890> free<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
would be used to getting for free on the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.910 
would be used to getting for free on the
web<00:02:37.910> you're<00:02:38.750> sort<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.050> willing<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.410> pay<00:02:39.560> 99

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920
