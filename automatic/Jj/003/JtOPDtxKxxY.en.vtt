can<00:04:04.290> choose<00:04:04.590> what<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.920> want<00:04:05.130> now<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:05.579> can

can choose what you want now but you can
always<00:04:05.850> change<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.329> so<00:04:06.989> playing<00:04:07.290> with<00:04:07.470> sound

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
always change that so playing with sound

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.400 
always change that so playing with sound
will<00:04:08.609> make<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.060> game<00:04:09.269> lag<00:04:09.569> a<00:04:09.840> bit<00:04:10.139> more

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
will make the game lag a bit more

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.340 
will make the game lag a bit more
