00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
usually would play on fifa 12 would have

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.549 
usually would play on fifa 12 would have
played<00:00:54.059> single<00:00:54.510> matches<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> way<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.350> but

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
which I don't really know why I did that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.260 
which I don't really know why I did that
I<00:01:35.189> wasn't<00:01:35.549> paying<00:01:35.670> attention<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.150> just

there<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.470> our<00:01:46.590> team<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
there is our team as you can see and I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.039 
there is our team as you can see and I
think<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.520> changed<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.210> middle

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
think we just changed out the middle

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.920 
think we just changed out the middle
center<00:01:52.350> mid<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.720> bench

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
center mid because the one on the bench

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.090 
center mid because the one on the bench
was<00:01:55.140> better<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.649> we're<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.070> into

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
was better but we're going to go into

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.560 
was better but we're going to go into
our<00:01:56.310> first<00:01:56.579> game<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.880> our<00:01:56.969> first<00:01:57.180> game<00:01:57.390> was

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
gonna be honest now that was a it was

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.600 
gonna be honest now that was a it was
just<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.740> porting<00:02:29.070> playing<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.370> these<00:02:29.460> I

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
just a porting playing with these I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.220 
just a porting playing with these I
should<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.880> won<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.060> tackle<00:02:30.570> some<00:02:30.960> reason

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
should have won that tackle some reason

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.870 
should have won that tackle some reason
he<00:02:31.320> decided<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.770> lunge<00:02:32.070> instead<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.790> go

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
he decided to lunge instead of go

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.370 
he decided to lunge instead of go
straight<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.270> around<00:02:33.570> my<00:02:33.690> keeper<00:02:34.020> out<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.350> a

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
straight in around my keeper out like a

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.860 
straight in around my keeper out like a
fool<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.100> he<00:02:35.580> chipped<00:02:35.880> me<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.270> make<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.630> to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
fool and he chipped me to make it to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.840 
fool and he chipped me to make it to
nils<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.590> was<00:02:37.740> very<00:02:37.920> disappointing<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
nils so that was very disappointing and

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.400 
nils so that was very disappointing and
Dean<00:02:39.000> Italian<00:02:39.420> Balotelli<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.200> best

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
there that's my opinion anyway I think

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.280 
there that's my opinion anyway I think
they<00:02:44.940> are<00:02:44.970> probably<00:02:45.510> some<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> best

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
they are probably some of the best

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.530 
they are probably some of the best
strikers<00:02:46.800> there<00:02:46.920> are<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.190> again<00:02:47.640> my<00:02:47.940> defender

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
strikers there are but again my defender

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.820 
strikers there are but again my defender

Balotelli<00:02:50.310> runs<00:02:50.580> all<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.730> way<00:02:50.820> through<00:02:51.120> hits

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
but I mean I was a confident we're

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.749 
but I mean I was a confident we're
actually<00:04:38.560> getting<00:04:38.800> chances<00:04:39.280> but<00:04:39.400> then<00:04:39.550> we<00:04:39.610> get

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759
