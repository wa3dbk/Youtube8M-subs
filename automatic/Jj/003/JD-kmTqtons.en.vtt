00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 Hey people today, I'll show you mine 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.020
 Putin and I take you to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.300
 a wellness day I so at home 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.790
 have made completely relaxed and me that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.230
 first time on my phone and have a 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.880
 bit instagram peeked through or 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.529
 a very sweet subscriber had 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.930
 painted me that was great 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 because I like the picture so much 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
 and of course a bit 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.360
 in my bed on such a beauty day 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.710
 I had already breakfasted there but me 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.210
 was only in pajamas on wanted 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.800
 actually he prefers to sleep than 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.000
 to do something else but me 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 then have a little on your first 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.019
 comments answered and also one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.790
 heard a bit of music and then I have 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.350
 I also picked a song which made me so 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.570
 a bit motivated on the bed too 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.580
 climb and that was from calvin harris 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.890
 but that my absolute favorite song 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.530
 Right now and then I'm just out 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.089
 my cuddly bed out to mine 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.129
 desk and have mine first 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.080
 organizer looked and appears 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.450
 Of course there's a beauty day for this day 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.250
 and yes i love those days and days 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.869
 I always take that before when 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.200
 I'll make one again because that's easy 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.700
 it's just so cool and relaxed then I am 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.560
 I first get out of my room and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.420
 in the bathroom and have my hair first 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.190
 opened up and brushed because of me 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.660
 It absolutely hisses when my hair 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.430
 somehow knotted I know 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.960
 can not have that and have it here 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.340
 also again fought and that nice 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.660
 backwards because I agree 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 I decided to take a head 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.870
 because it is also important that in 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.760
 a beauty day all the hair times 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.650
 are out of the face and they actually 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.150
 Constantly disturbs fuel 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.400
 bit loosened up and I but 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.800
 man steps have always been seen that way 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.270
 out of what is funny but you good 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.860
 they grow out of the stages and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.870
 then I have another first 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.460
 bit of coconut oil in the hair done that way 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.170
 a little bit of hair care if you are 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.490
 Take a look at my complete hair care routine 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.540
 you want to see then you like now 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.220
 write in the comments 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.510
 then I will for you 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 Soon I will film many others 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.120
 try products and things and good 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.510
 find and always use and yes the whole 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.650
 junk 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.659
 then I decided to do that 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.039
 first take a bath and I had 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.659
 such a new bath salt what I 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.670
 wanted to try that out of tt 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.400
 even that was pretty weird 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.569
 that's like having turned red and first 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.909
 After that, the blue beads dissolve 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.890
 and then it will be purple but somehow 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.019
 This bath salt thing was not like that right now 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.120
 that all ghosts but no matter the main thing 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.190
 I tried it out afterwards 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.940
 dedicated to a little bit of facial care 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.130
 and have my face first 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.900
 That's done with clear water and then 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.280
 first slightly dry but still 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.470
 not completely finished then on mine 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.550
 wet face just from where 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.680
 a neutral ph something like that already 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.090
 I always use orders 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.010
 I really like it and I like it 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.380
 nourishes the skin quite well but stressed 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.280
 Do not be too much but pure xi and like 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.080
 I just love 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.660
 then I washed my face off 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.520
 dried and then with one 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.380
 toothbrush on my lips but 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.850
 actually to brush my teeth but me 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.470
 have the number is nice and warm first 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.120
 made with warm water and then have 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.650
 so that my lips pass and through 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.390
 the heat from the toothbrush and also 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.190
 general massage this will be the 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.630
 lips are totally chaotic and bleeding 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.040
 so soft and you see her too 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.140
 distinguished that the lower lip much 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.090
 red is as the upper lip so too 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.980
 is much more blood and then I am 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
 I get out of the bathroom in my 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.280
 room or did I think about whether I am with 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.290
 take my pajamas off already 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.940
 should and should wear normal things 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.950
 but a pajamas is kinda total 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.780
 I really like him by the way 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.460
 from aldi if anyone is interested or 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.140
 I decided to do that yet 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.940
 not only to draw so only once to 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.750
 my make-up fashion and wanted me 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.980
 makeup 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.989
 I make myself on one 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.520
 juti d I like to often and have 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.780
 first then discovered how terrible 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.430
 my nails look and because i see him 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.930
 already completely chipped senses have 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.370
 I then thought about it myself 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.260
 First she lay before me 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.610
 make up and have all the paints in me 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.140
 moment very well first time out 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.300
 because I'm not directly 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.090
 could decide and then have me 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.890
 ultimately for such a dealer helping 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.250
 sound blitzer things team 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.810
 that's from p2 son zen style nail polish 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.640
 thing and then I have my whole 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.170
 things I always get out to the nails 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.150
 Need to paint close there 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.110
 the same remover have all the stuff 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.420
 then first nail polish remover 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.800
 and you can see it here 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.110
 fast pace as I mean then 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.519
 nails painted with it and then 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.500
 I still have a bit of clear paint all 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.919
 applied normally and then in two 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.990
 Layer this helping purple nail polish 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.180
 whatever that is be there my 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.980
 Nails from I really like the look 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.020
 and then I finally was myself 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.620
 the other things decided to do that 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.419
 pull 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.430
 but then of course they had to 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.350
 be very comfortable things because it is yes 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.190
 he is still such a wellness beauty valley 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.450
 so cross a chilly day 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.520
 and then, of course, also have to be comfortable 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.140
 things and I mean mine again 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.600
 dresser because I am actually now 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.340
 really wanted to make up and I have 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.590
 then the drawer opened 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.960
 looked for my stuff together and then 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.090
 My eyes fell on the masks and then 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.710
 came to me an idea and was that I yes 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.390
 just wear some masks on 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.350
 could and then have me for the app 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.420
 the mask decided 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.610
 she has so much in Cologne and it 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.110
 is very pleasant and I always look 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.090
 like a four-year-old when I try 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.010
 But to make such a mask on it 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.840
 that is always the mess that is 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.490
 the requirement was to act for ten minutes 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.470
 and by the way I had it before too 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.790
 still the flight mode turned on because I 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.650
 the very relaxed not hit the mark 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.390
 mitzubekommen what in facebook whatsapp 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.250
 or somewhere else is going on but 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.260
 just to chill it in the 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.940
 kitchen while the mask has acted 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.680
 and I got something to eat 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.790
 of course, in addition to the normal 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.100
 Having lunch 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.020
 but I'll show you my wellness 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.970
 stick snack at least for me 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.470
 choose that is liable and that is if it is 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.880
 to eat a lot of calories for me 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.170
 or a mentor too 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:43.370
 jumped up and I think the tour is 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:45.050
 at the 38 watch my comfort so and so 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.730
 then I have a bit of marina on 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.200
 my toasts played on it and me 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.669
 ever thought about what I eat 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.860
 I would like to without the decision 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.450
 come that salami today something 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.910
 very nice who and have me because of that 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.760
 salami on it yes I am not 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.840
 vegetarian for the always ask and then 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.250
 I have a cup first 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.169
 I'm always one, too 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.760
 bit picky then stop though 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.440
 was normal made pure as you 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.510
 just started on cocoa have a bit 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.960
 the junk so the salami and so on 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.790
 admitted and then made out milk 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.530
 pure poured and of course then had 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.960
 on my cacau first quite a lot 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.090
 Sprühsahne on it because that for a 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.980
 Wellnesstag so I have to find something 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.330
 should s call to give what would be even better 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.190
 as that and have a bit 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.020
 made cocoa powder on it because I think 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.990
 that looks pretty nice 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.480
 deco appropriate and yes that was mine 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.040
 small wellness snack and then am 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.720
 I had my room back again 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.520
 washed off and it went now 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.950
 already at the second beauty thing and 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.080
 Although so that such eye pads of valea 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.890
 which act as cooling and decongestant 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.020
 should 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.580
 and since I have very strong eye rings 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.880
 always so that is also very swollen 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.350
 are 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.550
 that 's pretty handy I have 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.650
 then 15 minutes 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.820
 let it act and then I have 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.320
 withdrawn again 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.210
 that feels a bit disgusting 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.860
 and it shows in the running away from so 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.440
 These eyes are very much in the picture afterwards 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.850
 Dusty and then I have me too 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.810
 already made up 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.340
 you can see that in the 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.810
 fast running what we products I 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.490
 Well , you have not used 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.650
 fast run or edited 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.350
 and once concealer mascara 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.760
 highlighter a nice bright pale 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.650
 and then of course one more 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.660
 lipgloss and then looks like the finished 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.920
 look very nice so very nice 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.540
 but of course anyway 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.490
 make-up and it looks pretty good 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.590
 then I have to do things right 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.820
 picked out then also dressed and 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.140
 then my friend came over 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.390
 because then we went to the cinema 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:31.760
 are in the day and that was there now 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.770
 even the end of the home beauty day 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.360

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:36.920

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.810
