a wing once you've drawn the first wing
we're<00:01:51.159> going<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.369> create<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.580> second<00:01:51.940> one<00:01:52.060> just

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
we're going to create a second one just

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.940 
we're going to create a second one just
underneath<00:01:52.600> this<00:01:53.409> one's<00:01:53.590> going<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.830> be

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
underneath this one's going to be

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.410 
underneath this one's going to be
starting<00:01:54.340> off<00:01:54.399> from<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.700> lower<00:01:54.880> lid<00:01:55.090> instead

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
starting off from the lower lid instead

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.359 
starting off from the lower lid instead
of<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.630> applet<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.800> should<00:01:57.009> have<00:01:57.130> two

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
of the applet so you should have two

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.840 
of the applet so you should have two
winged<00:01:57.640> eyeliners<00:01:59.250> brush<00:02:00.250> out<00:02:00.460> any<00:02:00.580> of<00:02:00.729> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
winged eyeliners brush out any of the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.309 
winged eyeliners brush out any of the
fallout<00:02:01.179> which<00:02:01.300> is<00:02:01.450> landed<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.960> rushes

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
fallout which is landed on the rushes

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.260 
fallout which is landed on the rushes
and<00:02:02.649> then<00:02:02.800> with<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:02.950> red<00:02:03.130> lipstick<00:02:03.520> you're

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and then with a red lipstick you're

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.760 
and then with a red lipstick you're
going<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.509> dab<00:02:04.659> this<00:02:04.810> all<00:02:05.080> over<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.380> lip<00:02:05.530> so

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
going to dab this all over the lip so

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.320 
going to dab this all over the lip so
that's<00:02:05.950> faintest<00:02:06.429> shade<00:02:06.640> rather<00:02:06.880> than<00:02:07.119> going

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
that's faintest shade rather than going

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.169 
that's faintest shade rather than going
with<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.810> full<00:02:08.110> shade<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.970> we're<00:02:10.090> going

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
with a full shade and then we're going
