00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.950
 the euro cup fever no I have to say 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.599
 The Europa League fever has us again 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.089
 completely grabbed 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.890
 this week ajax travels to the distant 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.619
 Romania 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.960
 we have rarely been there yet 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 have a special bond with that country 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.170
 soccer field 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.170
 and then I call the name stefan kovacs 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.360
 in 1971 from ajax for the first time the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.640
 euro cup for national champions 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.290
 that was both a starting point and it 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 end of an era 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.070
 the end of an era because rinus 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.329
 michels who had built for six years 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 tinkered 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.920
 and done to that team of ajax and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.739
 ajax not only as t but also as 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.150
 organization a very professional touch 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.220
 had given 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.050
 Rinus Michels went to 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.670
 Barcelona 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.589
 the board knew something about it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.300
 did the idea and of course was looking 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.490
 gone to a new trainer 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.360
 the were fifteen candidates throughout 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.190
 Europe 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.570
 wanted and eventually ajax came it 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.259
 a very surprising choice 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.810
 they chose an unknown Romanian trainer 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.930
 you have known him to us in an accident 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.420
 Stefan Kovacs 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.240
 how I understand exactly behind that stefan 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.250
 Buy kovacs that is not entirely known 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.070
 or so he starts from the lot 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.990
 the cheapest was the least expensive 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.729
 in salary and that is because the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.380
 actually the Romanian Football Association 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.100
 Romanian State 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.510
 to watch coal 2 years to it 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.729
 to go abroad 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.840
 that was an exceptional situation 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.710
 the communist 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.710
 romania from then 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.360
 Stefan Kovac was a completely different one 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.820
 personality a completely different one 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.580
 so the trainer is also his predecessor 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.810
 rinus michels who didn't accidentally get the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.140
 General was mentioned 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.340
 the relationship with players and michels 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.179
 was something over the years 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.790
 deteriorated applied his strict stance 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:14.000
 actually no longer with the chambly you 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.190
 team and those kovacs 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.830
 we already knew who we did not know as a trainer 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.040
 indeed the great human gift 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.220
 to feel how he is with that team 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.140
 community of ajacists 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.030
 many players were now one of them 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.799
 become top player 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.190
 they might have a star allure 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.230
 own ideas and kovacs great quality 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.019
 He was in a good way 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.780
 those qualities do not go their own way 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.769
 that he is the creativity of it 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.380
 team increased what more room indicated 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.299
 the players to be themselves 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.920
 and that translated into the great 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.590
 highlight on the field 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 because among kovacs , ajax and the 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.450
 many people forget twice the 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.709
 the European Champions' Cup 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.459
 current champions league and he wants too 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.640
 the national titles 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.209
 he won the dutch cup he won the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.600
 european supercup 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.299
 in 1972 he and his team won the 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.489
 world cup he was the only man in it 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.100
 the netherlands who once with his club one 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.960
 super grandslam for over the 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.960
 you honor the other on football 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.450
 what is something about after 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.450
 eindhoven people young 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.310
 unfortunately had to sea ​​of kovacs after two years 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:42.939
 back that was the deal with 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.950
 the Romanian government now it was like that 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:47.260
 that there is a little resistance within ajax 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.480
 came against this man because he had the reins 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.129
 had too much to celebrate and that too 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.689
 much power would have come into the hands 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.920
 of the players 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.260
 it went well for a while at a 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.739
 moment became anarchy 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.870
 perhaps too large there were voices 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.819
 inside the club who said the time of it 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.620
 scope watch the 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.019
 is over well that coincided 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.090
 actually two years with the two years 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.000
 plan of romanians and kovacs 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.000
 returned to romania nevertheless 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.579
 but this man will never be forgotten as 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.970
 actually the most successful trainer 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.449
 from ajax because of all that is palmer 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.060
 of course he just had it 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:30.039
 fantastic players but stefan kovacs 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:32.229
 the gift also had the intelligence to be there 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.150
 deal with it in a good way 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.940
 because sometimes it is more important then 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.909
 training material on the field and discipline 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.760
 in the dressing room that dressing room too 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:45.340
 manage them and he could do that 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.770
 no one else he was a mabo man 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.780
 when he left again a lot too 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.750
 got a warm goodbye 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.820
 Stefan Kovacs was he he led the man 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.710
 who often cycle from where I am 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.849
 he lived came to the ajax Stadium 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.190
 got a car 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.880
 offered from the players' club 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.650
 also and and was really carried on 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.659
 done done from the lake 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:13.539
 we played ice and it was in 1995 that 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:16.000
 ajax after all that glory time 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.260
 whose was once in the final of the 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.270
 champions league 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.919
 the europacup for national champions and those 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.849
 won 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.830
 stefan kovacs was not there 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.349
 for which finale died me 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.270
 and with that no big looks on you 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.909
 maybe a little misunderstood with us 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.599
 but really a big one to you 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.599
 sees went 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:50.800
 yes the totality of the dutch 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.800
 top football that in recent years
