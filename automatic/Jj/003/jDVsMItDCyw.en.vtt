in<00:03:37.099> a<00:03:37.189> digi<00:03:37.459> pack<00:03:37.670> which<00:03:38.389> also<00:03:38.689> comes<00:03:38.959> with<00:03:39.049> the

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
in a digi pack which also comes with the

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.369 
in a digi pack which also comes with the
DVD<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:40.099> then<00:03:40.430> he<00:03:41.120> quickly<00:03:41.510> quit<00:03:41.900> out<00:03:42.049> of<00:03:42.230> it

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
DVD but then he quickly quit out of it

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.759 
DVD but then he quickly quit out of it
of<00:03:42.760> PayPal<00:03:43.760> because<00:03:44.720> he<00:03:44.959> didn't<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.379> PayPal

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
of PayPal because he didn't have PayPal

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.819 
of PayPal because he didn't have PayPal
on<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.099> so<00:03:46.549> he<00:03:47.239> didn't<00:03:47.510> so<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:47.989> think<00:03:48.349> he's<00:03:48.650> still

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
on it so he didn't so I think he's still

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.000 
on it so he didn't so I think he's still
bought<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:49.879> he<00:03:50.030> cancelled<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.720> order<00:03:51.260> so

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
bought it but he cancelled the order so

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.520 
bought it but he cancelled the order so
I<00:03:52.040> think<00:03:52.310> he's<00:03:53.000> paying<00:03:53.480> for<00:03:53.659> it<00:03:53.930> but<00:03:54.139> it's<00:03:54.349> not

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
I think he's paying for it but it's not

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.490 
I think he's paying for it but it's not
coming<00:03:54.919> I<00:03:55.389> don't<00:03:56.389> know<00:03:56.659> I'm<00:03:56.900> not<00:03:56.930> sure<00:03:57.079> how<00:03:57.379> it

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
coming I don't know I'm not sure how it

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.670 
coming I don't know I'm not sure how it
works<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:58.299> if<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.480> does<00:03:59.659> come<00:03:59.930> then<00:04:00.470> are
