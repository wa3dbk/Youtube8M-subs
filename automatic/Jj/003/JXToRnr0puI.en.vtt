you have noticed but the hair color that
was<00:01:09.620> displayed<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:11.600> whole<00:01:11.780> time<00:01:11.960> has<00:01:12.170> been

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
was displayed this whole time has been

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.830 
was displayed this whole time has been
like<00:01:12.740> partially<00:01:13.310> blonde<00:01:13.580> highlighted<00:01:14.210> the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
like partially blonde highlighted the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.570 
like partially blonde highlighted the
reason<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.260> that<00:01:15.290> is<00:01:15.560> because<00:01:15.710> I<00:01:16.130> haven't<00:01:16.460> in<00:01:16.520> a

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
reason to that is because I haven't in a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.030 
reason to that is because I haven't in a
moment<00:01:16.910> of<00:01:16.940> insanity<00:01:17.090> when<00:01:17.660> my<00:01:17.750> hair<00:01:17.930> was<00:01:18.040> not

moment of insanity when my hair was not

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.770 
moment of insanity when my hair was not
very<00:01:19.610> much<00:01:19.850> longer<00:01:20.180> than<00:01:20.270> this<00:01:20.360> probably<00:01:20.690> but
