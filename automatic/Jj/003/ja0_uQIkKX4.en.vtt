00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
time you reach to the end of the batter

you<00:00:52.069> do<00:00:52.309> now<00:00:52.519> is<00:00:52.729> after<00:00:53.210> you<00:00:53.300> have<00:00:53.479> fermented

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
you do now is after you have fermented

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.819 
you do now is after you have fermented
the<00:00:54.079> batter<00:00:54.289> you<00:00:54.889> have<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.129> add<00:00:55.280> salt<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.909> this

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
the batter you have to add salt to this

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.709 
the batter you have to add salt to this
since<00:00:57.829> we<00:00:58.039> had<00:00:58.159> not<00:00:58.339> added<00:00:58.729> salt<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.239> the

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
since we had not added salt to the

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.360 
since we had not added salt to the
batter<00:01:00.589> earlier<00:01:01.269> so<00:01:02.269> you<00:01:02.329> add<00:01:02.600> salt<00:01:02.929> and<00:01:03.409> just

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
batter earlier so you add salt and just

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.410 
batter earlier so you add salt and just
give<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:04.909> a<00:01:05.059> mix<00:01:05.920> mix<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.100> up<00:01:07.250> very<00:01:07.549> well<00:01:07.700> if<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
give it a mix mix it up very well if the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.630 
give it a mix mix it up very well if the
batter<00:01:08.689> has<00:01:09.020> fermented<00:01:09.409> well<00:01:09.920> for<00:01:10.340> about

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
batter has fermented well for about

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.789 
batter has fermented well for about
eight<00:01:10.939> hours<00:01:11.210> your<00:01:11.750> dosas<00:01:12.229> will<00:01:12.409> come<00:01:12.649> out

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
eight hours your dosas will come out

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.359 
eight hours your dosas will come out
really<00:01:13.729> nice<00:01:13.909> really<00:01:14.630> light<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.380> crispy

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
really nice really light and crispy

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.789 
really nice really light and crispy
since<00:01:16.820> we<00:01:17.000> have<00:01:17.149> added<00:01:17.479> fenugreek<00:01:18.020> as<00:01:18.350> well<00:01:18.649> in

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
since we have added fenugreek as well in

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.830 
since we have added fenugreek as well in
the<00:01:18.950> batter<00:01:19.130> fenugreek<00:01:19.850> will<00:01:20.149> give<00:01:20.359> it<00:01:20.479> the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
the batter fenugreek will give it the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.349 
the batter fenugreek will give it the
flavor<00:01:21.049> as<00:01:21.500> well<00:01:21.530> as<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.070> crispness<00:01:22.549> even<00:01:23.180> the

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
flavor as well as the crispness even the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.349 
flavor as well as the crispness even the
hora<00:01:23.539> dal<00:01:23.899> or<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.439> black<00:01:25.039> gram<00:01:25.369> split<00:01:25.969> dal

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:26.359 
hora dal or the black gram split dal

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:28.749 
hora dal or the black gram split dal
that<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.750> have<00:01:26.840> added<00:01:27.140> also<00:01:27.590> gives<00:01:27.859> it<00:01:28.070> the

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
that we have added also gives it the

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.670 
that we have added also gives it the
crispness<00:01:29.149> so<00:01:29.719> we<00:01:29.840> have<00:01:29.930> mixed<00:01:30.170> salt<00:01:30.320> in<00:01:30.560> this

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
crispness so we have mixed salt in this

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.580 
crispness so we have mixed salt in this
so<00:01:31.130> now<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.579> have<00:01:31.909> this<00:01:32.090> pan<00:01:32.509> which<00:01:32.869> is<00:01:32.899> nice<00:01:33.200> and

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
so now I have this pan which is nice and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.639 
so now I have this pan which is nice and
hot<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.880> make<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.119> dosa<00:01:35.450> we<00:01:36.229> do<00:01:36.409> not<00:01:36.500> need<00:01:36.619> a

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
hot but to make a dosa we do not need a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.649 
hot but to make a dosa we do not need a
very<00:01:36.920> hot<00:01:37.159> pan<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:37.729> we<00:01:37.850> lower<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.630> temperature

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
very hot pan so we lower the temperature

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.560 
very hot pan so we lower the temperature
by<00:01:39.200> splashing<00:01:39.409> some<00:01:39.740> water<00:01:39.979> like<00:01:40.219> this<00:01:40.570> you

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
by splashing some water like this you

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
by splashing some water like this you
see<00:01:41.719> this<00:01:41.929> so<00:01:42.890> by<00:01:43.060> water<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.990> temperature<00:01:45.140> is

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
see this so by water the temperature is

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.520 
see this so by water the temperature is
quite<00:01:45.799> low<00:01:46.159> now<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.579> just<00:01:46.969> wipe<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.390> off<00:01:47.539> I<00:01:47.869> am

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
quite low now and just wipe it off I am

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.130 
quite low now and just wipe it off I am
using<00:01:48.799> a<00:01:49.009> nonstick<00:01:49.219> tava<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.929> help

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
using a nonstick tava and with the help

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.929 
using a nonstick tava and with the help
of<00:01:51.289> a<00:01:51.469> round<00:01:51.710> little<00:01:51.979> like<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.670> am<00:01:52.729> going

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
of a round little like this I am going

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.139 
of a round little like this I am going
to<00:01:53.179> make<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.350> dosas<00:01:54.740> first<00:01:55.340> one<00:01:55.670> will<00:01:55.969> be<00:01:56.119> a

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
to make the dosas first one will be a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.840 
to make the dosas first one will be a
small<00:01:56.509> dose<00:01:56.780> up<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.649> is<00:01:57.829> basically<00:01:57.859> to<00:01:58.549> check

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
small dose up this is basically to check

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.230 
small dose up this is basically to check
if<00:01:59.149> the<00:01:59.479> tava<00:01:59.840> has<00:02:00.109> got<00:02:00.729> seasoned<00:02:01.729> or<00:02:01.850> no<00:02:02.030> but

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
if the tava has got seasoned or no but

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.630 
if the tava has got seasoned or no but
in<00:02:02.359> case<00:02:02.539> of<00:02:02.569> a<00:02:02.749> nonstick<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.560> problem<00:02:04.520> is

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
in case of a nonstick that problem is

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.459 
in case of a nonstick that problem is
never<00:02:04.880> there<00:02:05.179> but<00:02:05.630> still<00:02:05.929> we<00:02:06.140> will<00:02:06.229> make<00:02:06.439> a

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
never there but still we will make a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.910 
never there but still we will make a
small<00:02:06.740> dosa<00:02:07.130> very<00:02:07.909> little<00:02:08.179> batter<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.920> after

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
small dosa very little batter and after

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.640 
small dosa very little batter and after
you<00:02:10.039> pour<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.490> batter<00:02:10.690> just<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:12.170> round<00:02:12.380> and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
you pour the batter just go round and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.230 
you pour the batter just go round and
round<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:13.340> see<00:02:13.520> this<00:02:13.670> neat<00:02:14.330> its

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
round you see this neat its

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.900 
round you see this neat its
very<00:02:15.360> simple<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.560> go<00:02:16.860> slowly<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.580> tawa

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
very simple just go slowly the tawa

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.690 
very simple just go slowly the tawa
shouldn't<00:02:18.300> be<00:02:18.390> very<00:02:18.750> hot<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.160> should<00:02:20.520> be

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
shouldn't be very hot but it should be

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.000 
shouldn't be very hot but it should be
moderately<00:02:21.360> heated<00:02:21.930> otherwise<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.860> batter

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
moderately heated otherwise the batter

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.170 
moderately heated otherwise the batter
will<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.520> stick<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.840> tawa<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:26.400> after<00:02:27.030> that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
will not stick to the tawa so after that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.990 
will not stick to the tawa so after that
you<00:02:27.510> increase<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.590> heat<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.040> what<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.910> will

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you increase the heat and what we will

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.080 
you increase the heat and what we will
do<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.540> will<00:02:30.570> add<00:02:30.870> some<00:02:31.200> oil<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> what<00:02:32.880> we

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
do is we will add some oil so what we

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.350 
do is we will add some oil so what we
have<00:02:33.330> here<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.930> some<00:02:34.530> oil<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.040> oil<00:02:35.370> will<00:02:35.940> pour

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
have here is some oil and oil will pour

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.560 
have here is some oil and oil will pour
on<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.080> sides<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.220> now<00:02:38.940> if<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.510> are

will make one more dosa now we will
again<00:03:14.580> lower<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.150> temperature<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.790> water

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
again lower the temperature and water

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.770 
again lower the temperature and water
again<00:03:18.590> because<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.680> Saba<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.070> very<00:03:20.430> hot<00:03:20.750> use<00:03:21.750> a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
again because the Saba is very hot use a

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.240 
again because the Saba is very hot use a
muslin<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.470> wipe<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:23.040> off

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.500 

again<00:03:29.250> we<00:03:29.520> will<00:03:29.580> take<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.820> ladle<00:03:30.240> full<00:03:30.270> of

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
again we will take a ladle full of

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.370 
again we will take a ladle full of
batter<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:31.410> time<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.830> little<00:03:32.040> more<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:33.600> just

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
batter this time a little more and just

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:46.309 
batter this time a little more and just
spread<00:03:34.740> it

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.240 

after<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:49.909> increase<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.239> heat<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:52.250> now

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
after that we increase the heat and now

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.339 
after that we increase the heat and now
is<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.459> time<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.819> add<00:03:54.239> oil<00:03:54.680> all<00:03:55.680> on<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.040> sides

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
is a time to add oil all on the sides

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:06.619 
is a time to add oil all on the sides
like<00:03:58.349> this<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:59.900> some<00:04:01.220> on<00:04:02.220> top<00:04:02.730> as<00:04:03.000> well<00:04:05.629> it

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
like this and some on top as well it

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.080 
like this and some on top as well it
looks<00:04:07.019> simple<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:07.739> it's<00:04:08.280> also<00:04:08.610> very<00:04:08.849> simple

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
looks simple and it's also very simple

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.360 
looks simple and it's also very simple
to<00:04:09.299> make<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:10.860> follow<00:04:11.220> a

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
to make just that you have to follow a

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.640 
to make just that you have to follow a
technique<00:04:11.909> of<00:04:12.090> putting<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.109> bed<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.500> the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
technique of putting the bed and the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.879 
technique of putting the bed and the
center<00:04:14.099> and<00:04:14.310> very<00:04:14.670> slowly<00:04:15.440> you<00:04:16.440> have<00:04:16.650> to

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
center and very slowly you have to

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.879 
center and very slowly you have to
spread<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.940> by<00:04:18.539> rotating<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.229> ladle<00:04:19.590> there

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
spread this by rotating the ladle there

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.140 
spread this by rotating the ladle there
are<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.039> lot<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.160> people<00:04:20.430> who<00:04:20.699> use<00:04:20.820> stainless

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
are a lot of people who use stainless

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.420 
are a lot of people who use stainless
steel<00:04:21.359> kotori's<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.320> do<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.310> are

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
steel kotori's to do it if you are

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.250 
steel kotori's to do it if you are
comfortable<00:04:23.880> doing<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.600> can<00:04:24.750> try<00:04:25.020> that

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
comfortable doing that you can try that

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.500 
comfortable doing that you can try that
as<00:04:25.440> well<00:04:25.740> but<00:04:26.340> one<00:04:26.520> more<00:04:26.699> thing<00:04:26.729> important

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
as well but one more thing important

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.360 
as well but one more thing important
here<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.139> you're<00:04:28.380> not<00:04:28.410> supposed<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:29.100> cook

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
here is that you're not supposed to cook

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.279 
here is that you're not supposed to cook
this<00:04:30.030> side<00:04:30.330> as<00:04:30.539> and<00:04:30.660> you're<00:04:30.750> not<00:04:30.870> supposed<00:04:31.050> to

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
this side as and you're not supposed to

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.960 
this side as and you're not supposed to
flip<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.860> cook<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.160> other<00:04:32.190> side<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.760> dosa

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
flip and cook the other side of the dosa

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.620 
flip and cook the other side of the dosa
so<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.960> is<00:04:34.139> why<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.889> dosa<00:04:35.160> has<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.760> be<00:04:35.910> quite

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
so that is why the dosa has to be quite

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.920 
so that is why the dosa has to be quite
thin<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:38.130> that<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.370> cooks<00:04:38.639> on<00:04:38.880> one<00:04:39.150> side<00:04:39.479> and<00:04:39.750> it

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
thin so that it cooks on one side and it

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.500 
thin so that it cooks on one side and it
doesn't<00:04:40.229> stay<00:04:40.470> raw<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:41.699> in<00:04:42.000> case<00:04:42.240> of<00:04:42.419> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
doesn't stay raw so in case of the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.170 
doesn't stay raw so in case of the
center<00:04:43.020> will<00:04:43.800> still<00:04:44.100> cook<00:04:44.430> because<00:04:44.760> we<00:04:45.090> are

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
center will still cook because we are

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.230 
center will still cook because we are
giving<00:04:45.449> it<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.780> much<00:04:45.990> time<00:04:46.289> to<00:04:47.070> cook<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:48.210> you

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
giving it that much time to cook so you
