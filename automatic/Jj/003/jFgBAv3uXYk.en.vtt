00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.170
 tonight here at the stadium 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.200
 hot is that the eagles of america 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.390
 they made a historic afternoon of their 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.430
 heroic parties in which they defeated 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.830
 a tijuana club in his own house in 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.170
 hot territory by two goals to one 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.140
 besides this of playing with ten men 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.230
 for almost 70 minutes and 50 of them 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
 with nine players 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.369
 Miguel Herrera the technician of the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.230
 azulcremas highlighted the good work of his 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.239
 team in addition to spirit and courage 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.480
 that they left inside the field of play 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.949
 that put the big finishing team 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.570
 attitude that we have shown throughout 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.190
 the tournament and they took over we put a 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.019
 lose men not and the team 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.269
 worked well we knew we had a team 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.150
 difficult alone is a great team and good 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.410
 the term encimando but I think 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.630
 we work pretty well 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.180
 also the Turkish mohamed the technician 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.660
 English said that sooner or later he had 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 to get them a defeat 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.240
 as part of the game 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 I'm just a little bit more 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.920
 we thought we had three more points but not 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.030
 we have them but it is very cool always 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.580
 with the same we are prepared for 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.690
 any outcome we do not I'm 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.630
 same now when we were champions 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.909
 we lost football game nothing more like 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.280
 He won many to lose once played 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.350
 aquivaldo mosqueda the captain of the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.999
 Eagles of America said that with this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.219
 they will shut up many mouths when they say 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:37.590
 that America always brought him 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.179
 favors everyone who is giving 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.329
 mind that we say it is 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.459
 difficult to anyone the truth so much is 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.039
 wrong for the opposing team like 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.490
 for us then that's not from nor 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.259
 throw the referees to the body neither 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.990
 that they blame us for 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.750
 things that are happening are 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.399
 circumstances of human errors or of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.039
 soon appreciations bad views the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.840
 figure of this party moises muÃ±oz 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.360
 He highlighted the good work of all his 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.830
 companions 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.440
 the sacrifice of my companions 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.560
 really today they ran like never 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.080
 sacrificed they put the leg with 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.790
 They had to put it in and we were 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.200
 working defensively ordered already 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.580
 despite having two entrepreneurs we had 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.590
 the ability to score another goal that 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.840
 end is what allows us 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.900
 get the triumph really the merit 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.340
 It's from everyone but I honestly give my 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.220
 respects my colleagues who ran 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.230
 with the 40 the willow and joe crown say 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.030
 that defeats are always painful and 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.090
 more when they come up with these conditions 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.980
 and it hurts or hurts you because of the streak that 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.110
 we had because now he's going to talk 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.660
 everything against the team and this is so 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.340
 so be quiet in the second 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.260
 goal a sack that hits very well goal 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.670
 and good now that we will have to accept the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.720
 things and keep working 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.090
 yes yes you are that it affects you too 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.690
 a little bit to the team that has men of 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.370
 more that affects what they palm in 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.319
 such merits did not go well under 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.550
 from his bow we had a couple of 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.230
 relations between the ball 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.690
 and so in this way with this triumph 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.430
 after four games america finally 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.590
 manages to beat the tijuana club as the 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.920
 first two were draws and the last 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.260
 they had lost him in his house 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.170
 with images of go wires in tijuana 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.380
 Baja California to see the Caesar vision 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.380
 barrientos
