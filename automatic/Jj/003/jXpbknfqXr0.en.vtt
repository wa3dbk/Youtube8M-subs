00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
crease and then that's pretty much it

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.730 
crease and then that's pretty much it
until<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.609> start<00:00:29.939> drawing<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.050> shape<00:00:31.320> here

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
because the makeup forever flash colors

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.830

that even though it's obviously not

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.660 
that even though it's obviously not
working<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.290> well<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:40.800> just<00:02:41.070> just<00:02:41.459> throwing

of<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.970> all<00:03:15.150> does<00:03:15.450> not<00:03:15.600> bother<00:03:15.810> me<00:03:16.080> it's<00:03:16.230> just<00:03:16.410> I

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
of it all does not bother me it's just I

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.490 
of it all does not bother me it's just I
don't<00:03:17.190> know<00:03:17.459> what<00:03:18.060> else<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.510> use<00:03:18.810> product<00:03:19.350> wise

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
don't know what else to use product wise

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.990 
don't know what else to use product wise
to<00:03:19.739> make<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.070> long<00:03:20.220> lasting<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
to make this long lasting so that's the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.280 
to make this long lasting so that's the
only<00:03:21.120> reason<00:03:21.390> why<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.540> wouldn't<00:03:21.780> wear<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.140> I

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
only reason why I wouldn't wear it I

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.920 
only reason why I wouldn't wear it I
noticed<00:03:23.190> in<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> video<00:03:23.519> she<00:03:23.760> does<00:03:24.330> not<00:03:24.540> have

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
noticed in the video she does not have

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.350 
noticed in the video she does not have
any<00:03:25.260> lashes<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:26.040> don't<00:03:26.700> even<00:03:26.910> think<00:03:27.090> she<00:03:27.239> has

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
any lashes I don't even think she has

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.590 
any lashes I don't even think she has
black<00:03:27.810> mascara<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.850> need<00:03:30.920> lashes<00:03:32.150> too<00:03:33.150> I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
black mascara on but I need lashes too I

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.770 
black mascara on but I need lashes too I
feel<00:03:33.930> like<00:03:34.080> they<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.260> kind<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:35.150> clean<00:03:36.150> clean

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780

feel like they just kind of clean clean
it<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.350> kind<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.739> give<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.220> more

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
it up and kind of give it a more

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.580 
it up and kind of give it a more
finished<00:03:41.220> look<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:42.000> guess<00:03:42.239> so<00:03:42.780> for<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.140> lashes

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
definitely not gonna contour my nose

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.690 
definitely not gonna contour my nose
because<00:04:06.990> I'm<00:04:07.740> fine<00:04:08.430> with<00:04:08.700> my<00:04:08.730> nose<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.709> yeah

if<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.120> were<00:04:12.239> me<00:04:12.420> personally<00:04:13.170> I'm<00:04:14.150> comfortable

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
if it were me personally I'm comfortable

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.699 
if it were me personally I'm comfortable
like<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.340> would<00:04:17.340> just<00:04:17.370> put<00:04:18.019> maybe<00:04:19.019> not

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
like this I would just put maybe not

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.240 
like this I would just put maybe not
even<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.489> color<00:04:20.850> at<00:04:21.060> all<00:04:21.109> probably<00:04:22.190> actually<00:04:23.190> I

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
even a color at all probably actually I

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.220 
even a color at all probably actually I
think<00:04:23.370> if<00:04:23.639> I<00:04:23.760> wanted<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.150> be<00:04:24.270> super<00:04:24.720> daring<00:04:25.080> I

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
think if I wanted to be super daring I

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.510 
think if I wanted to be super daring I
would<00:04:25.470> do<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> hot<00:04:25.980> pink<00:04:26.360> or<00:04:27.890> if<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:29.100> wanted<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.400> go

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
would do a hot pink or if I wanted to go

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.400 
would do a hot pink or if I wanted to go
out<00:04:29.700> like<00:04:29.910> this<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.419> would<00:04:30.540> probably<00:04:30.960> do<00:04:31.140> more

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
out like this I would probably do more

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.120 
out like this I would probably do more
of<00:04:31.590> like<00:04:32.250> a<00:04:32.280> sheer<00:04:32.820> gloss<00:04:33.150> but<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.320> stay<00:04:34.740> true

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
of like a sheer gloss but to stay true

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.909 
of like a sheer gloss but to stay true
to<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.700> look<00:04:35.910> I'm<00:04:36.150> going<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.960> be<00:04:37.110> mixing<00:04:37.350> a

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
to the look I'm going to be mixing a

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.850 
to the look I'm going to be mixing a
little<00:04:38.580> bit<00:04:38.760> of<00:04:38.970> OCC's<00:04:39.810> butch<00:04:40.260> lip<00:04:40.890> tar<00:04:41.220> and

some leftover from the color that I made
for<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.640> also<00:04:48.150> before<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.570> put<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:48.930> on
