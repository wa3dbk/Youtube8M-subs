 miniature surprise Pokémon and the ogg and 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.030
 things that were not related either 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.540
 to drawings and such but that have been successful 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:30.910
 how it froze the cosmic ice ours and 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:33.100
 of a lot of those there in the dark the

 figures of the cup the players who 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.550
 absurd 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.790
 the garbage gang endangered animals

 ping pong chocolate surprise our 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.399
 There are too many things I can not speak of. 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.200
 Everyone but here in my hand I have 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.380
 two things that struck me the most 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.850
 beginning with the poster and also album of the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.850
 pokémon movie 2000 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.830
 the rubin in summer 2010 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.900
 the wine and chewing gum buzzi the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.960
 even if he had tattoos 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.600
 I also enjoyed the album very much. 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.440
 all logically with scenes 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.220
 of the movie 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.220
 very cool 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.739
 we accept 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.160
 It is this yes without doubt was what 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.950
 scored the target of dragon ball z 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.450
 In total there are 72 cards counting 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.000
 saga dragon ball z 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.680
 but logically briefly my text 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.140
 pig but who cares 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.120
 Let's finish the album, that 's it. 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.340
 I miss asking one or two reais to 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.680
 In the market, buy a chewing gum. 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.810
 especially with the cards and save the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.180
 rest of the freezer or it's no use talking 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.709
 but every one an eternity and that was 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.170
 fever in schools 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.120
 everybody changing and I remember 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.510
 very well that the first figure that the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.230
 bre has come to master these albums and kame 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.269
 It's from a friend who lent me his luck. 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.540
 of who managed to save this type of 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.370
 thing to this day and many of these albums 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.800
 if you complete you could exchange for 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.440
 public awards for getting pain and such 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.959
 but I've never seen anyone manage to win 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.080
 nothing with it so if you already got it 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.180
 comment there and comment if you had 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.569
