00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
 they are gods to mamani mamani 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.850
 totally 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.980
 hello everyone welcome to Sandra 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.400
 singstar today I bring you tutorial of this 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.650
 We are already in 2015 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.200
 for those who do not know they already know it 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.740
 are learning for me and one of the 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.100
 fashionable colors in 2015 is the sea salá 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.110
 that's why I decided to do this makeup 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.059
 using that color mostly and it's a 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.300
 color that will value not only the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.790
 girls of skin and dark hair but 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.010
 about all the girls with green eyes 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.770
 and blondes but how are you seeing the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.360
 Trigueñas as I also valorizes them 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.360
 I leave you with the tutorial 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.140
 The first thing I do is hydrate the 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.660
 lips especially when I know I'm going to 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.550
 put a dark color on the lips this 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.379
 will make the labial more homogeneous 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.149
 I've already had eye makeup and I'm going to 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.949
 place a pse corrector in the area of 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.660
 alojera to standardize the color of the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.610
 skin on the eyelid so that 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.130
 shadows that I will post later 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.869
 adhere and last me longer as you see 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.930
 I'm fading with this brush 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.970
 realtech nik that I love just for this 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.950
 because when finished in tip it allows me 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.049
 reach all the corners of the eye and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.090
 also diffuses the corrector very well 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.429
 leaving a homogeneous surface and 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.679
 perfect to start the makeup of the 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.050
 eye of the paddle vice of urban dike and 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.509
 I'm going to take this brick red color and 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.100
 He placed it on the entire mobile eyelid 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.140
 stopping in the basin and left free 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.720
 also the internal angle because to go to 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.399
 a light color to illuminate I open a 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.220
 parentheses in the tutorial for 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.679
 show them other options as you see this 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.110
 is the marsala color of the baix palette 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.030
 but I urge you to look among the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.920
 makeups they have and surely 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.780
 will find a way to get a color 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.340
 seemed for example here I am 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.039
 mixing a red 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.439
 a brown palette of 88 colors 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.229
 from costa al saint and also from the palette 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.350
 of the 88 gamer shadows can be obtained 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.780
 in motion mixing a red color to 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.490
 a bronze color as you can see 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.860
 very similar tones 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.019
 so experiment and take advantage of 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 what they already have at home now I'm going to 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.370
 take a color to light up and placed it 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.030
 in the inner corner of the eye and attached to 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.030
 the eyebrow 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.140
 and now with a looser brush I'm going to 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.930
 place a little brown tip on the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.970
 external angle of the eye in the form of vy 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.100
 I extend it throughout the entire basin 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.850
 to give depth and dimension the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.850
 makeup 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.129
 I'm blurring it up and for 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:50.260
 I'm going to help with a brush that 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.260
 brings even more open hairs 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.980
 now I return the color marcela and what 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.930
 I also apply on the lower eyelid and 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.450
 how do you see the one to the makeup of the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.450
 upper eyelid to create continuity 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.950
 Take a brown tip and place it 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.200
 stick to the eyelashes I will place a 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.360
 blue pencil on the water line because the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.850
 Blue complements Marsala color a lot 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.800
 and intensifies the final result but if 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.890
 they prefer something quieter they can 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.200
 put brown or black or beige if you have 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.300
 Small eyes curl the eyelashes and 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.820
 abundant mask now I'm trying 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.520
 the telescopic de l'oréal and has a 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.460
 dense formula or I do not know if it's mine 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.860
 Wine is dry, the truth is that in Pego 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.780
 until the eyelashes so it's my turn 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.210
 lose some time working the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.370
 but the final result I like now 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.230
 I will place a blush and I adore these 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.390
 shades that look like bronzers with their 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.940
 peach tone because they allow me to do 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.940
 also the touring in a single step 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.840
 the same goes for the pencil eyeliner 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.090
 of lips while having a color 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.760
 meat that goes well can use it 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.950
 always even with dark lipsticks you go 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.100
 to be able to define the edges of your lips 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.139
 without fear of it being too much there will be another 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.389
 parentheses to show you these 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.370
 labial the first one would put it in the 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.310
 category of the newt with sub tones 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.430
 pink the second is a marshall to 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.410
 all effects and the third a fuchsia 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.300
 I'm showing you these lipsticks 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.280
 although many of you ask me to 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.680
 give them more healthy makeup options 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.599
 that you are not in animals and these 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.699
 can buy on the internet no matter 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:43.080
 what country are you in the box 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.120
 information I leave the link to the 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.400
 page that sell them and respecting the 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.400
 year's trend I'm going to put the bullseye 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.660
 this would be the complete makeup and 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.789
 Now comes the part that I work the most 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.789
 given that it is to put face model 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.560
 good to here today's video 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.650
 I hope you are encouraged to do it as 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.690
 I always say if you decide to recreate this 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.300

 of makeup I always ask them 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.349
