00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
we recommend you service a generator at

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.290 
we recommend you service a generator at
least<00:00:07.410> once<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.859> year<00:00:07.890> whether<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.970> reach<00:00:09.120> our

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
least once a year whether you reach our

recommendation<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.070> most<00:00:20.279> manufacturers<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
recommendation for most manufacturers is

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.429 
recommendation for most manufacturers is
going<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.900> about<00:00:22.080> an<00:00:22.230> hour<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.500> week<00:00:23.060> if<00:00:24.060> not

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
going to be about an hour a week if not

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.540 
going to be about an hour a week if not
you're<00:00:25.439> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.769> problems<00:00:25.920> down<00:00:26.369> the

you're going to have problems down the
road<00:00:26.840> it's<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.960> proven<00:00:28.170> fact<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.310> run<00:00:29.550> that

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
road it's a proven fact if you run that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.970 
road it's a proven fact if you run that
generator<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> hot<00:00:30.599> day<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.230> run<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> roof

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and we're gonna check our air filter and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.499 
and we're gonna check our air filter and
it's<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.549> done<00:01:20.759> from<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.360> one

two latches let's swing down since

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
two latches let's swing down since
there's<00:01:36.329> an<00:01:36.420> exhaust<00:01:36.659> pipe<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.200> will<00:01:37.710> not

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
there's an exhaust pipe here will not

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.249 
there's an exhaust pipe here will not
let<00:01:38.070> us<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.369> access<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.060> door<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.110> we'll

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
let us have access to that door so we'll

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.380 
let us have access to that door so we'll
simply<00:01:40.439> close<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.700> remove<00:01:42.000> these<00:01:42.180> two
