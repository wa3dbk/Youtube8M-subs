00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
videos out there as a solution a

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.340 
videos out there as a solution a
temporary<00:00:19.199> solution<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.279> problem<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.350> we

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
temporary solution to this problem so we

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.929 
temporary solution to this problem so we
have<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:23.510> nexus<00:00:24.510> 7<00:00:25.010> the<00:00:26.010> broken<00:00:26.840> digitizer

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
have a nexus 7 the broken digitizer

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.220 
have a nexus 7 the broken digitizer
and<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.050> broken<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.160> this<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:34.050> don't

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and if it's broken like this you don't

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.680 
and if it's broken like this you don't
get<00:00:34.440> any<00:00:34.680> touch<00:00:34.980> response<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:36.290> most<00:00:37.290> areas<00:00:37.680> I
