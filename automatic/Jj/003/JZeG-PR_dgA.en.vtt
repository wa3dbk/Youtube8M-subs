00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.970
 hello to all and humility 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.170
 I hope you are well and 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.570
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.810
 new video and I'm really 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.790
 happy to introduce you to this so it's 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.419
 news makes it a little excluded for those 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.470
 who are aware 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.059
 there are a lot of people is aware 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.220
 because it has a lot to blab on the 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.790
 forum I would like to go back to a small 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.380
 point that sylfaen friends on the forum who 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.790
 really made me hot and who 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.520
 made me immediately vibrate there I am 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.620
 am saying oh yes so here I go 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.080
 you already say the basic quote or 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.490
 caunes who said the parceum inter 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.660
 servers should normally set the 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.140
 all the problems that you have 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.640
 mentionned 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.530
 it's a shame to spend hours 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 write as big a cobblestone while a 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.990
 little research would have allowed to 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.600
 find this information avoid 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.300
 lose so much time here and silva n 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.920
 answered completely we started to the 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.530
 hint lately after a 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.119
 long period of r &amp; d parcels inter 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.189
 servers and now seriously 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.439
 entered into development phase are 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.100
 arrived will open a new era for the 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.759
 coliseum 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.789
 and there I said casillas yes sir is 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.399
 frankly but yes what's the thing that 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.240
 i love in dofus and pvp multi so 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.429
 the coliseum 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.979
 and there we will be able to review right 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.530
 parceum earth servers I will be able 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.179
 no longer wait for the fighting and 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.130
 then confront people all the time 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.810
 that they have big level deal with 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.119
 big team of super tight matches 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.600
 hyper interesting matches throughout 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.209
 of the year 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.439
 fucking but it's too good it's just 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.509
 that I wanted what exactly is this 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.520
 than what I expected everything everything 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.289
 besides I say them on the forum I 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.969
 left a little message jean remy on my 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.569
 way that michael michael Drieberg 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.249
 yeah that's it so I was it really 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.249
 just to tell you that mainly 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.939
 is just I think there will be some 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.159
 points to review 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.170
 for example I do not think that the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.859
 parceum inter multi accounts servers 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.880
 a good idea 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:09.470
 I think it should not be 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.120
 possible the multi-account precisely 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.099
 during the collisions 21 are dead 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.060
 because it will create too hungry it will create 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.510
 too many imbalances 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.890
 because if a guy is just doing 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.670
 necklace with his three persos crowd to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.060
 small etc 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.069
 he has a clear advantage against a team 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.030
 who especially precisely if he chooses the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.420
 pre composed but here I am 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.410
 ideas actually already two compositions 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.180
 I really want to try 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.849
 and I really want to do some 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.239
 crazy stuff what i really want 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.410
 it starts and I'm really sorry 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.910
 I can not wait 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.190
 I do not know what you think but 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.530
 I invite you to react in comment 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.349
 and to say if you know it 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.890
 interesting that it sounds like a 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:58.709
 good thing and these games post them on 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.110
 facebook just now and you are 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.780
 already not bad to like there are some 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.069
 pretty interesting comments that says 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.090
 I think it's a very good topic 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.500
 allows to react the whole 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.630
 community also to give ideas to 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.910
 wax supports if he looks at this support this 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.870
 since the wii wheel watch it 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.079
 it's a great news 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.100
 so here are people saying it's a 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:22.410
 good idea but frankly me it's 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.239
 that's what i expect in dofus what 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.340
 if there is really something I was playing 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.200
 in dofus it would be that it would be 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.730
 parceum inter servers I've been waiting since 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.220
 so long has it been 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.950
 frankly successful no 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.420
 so that's so I hope in any case that 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.250
 it will be done very quickly 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.020
 but in my opinion it would surprise me I think 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.850
 than 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.070
 by the end of the year he will tell us 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.390
 will speak and start next year I 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.560
 think it will get going because if 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.810
 it's in development they have to 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.770
 test etc 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.460
 I also wanted to thank you 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.910

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:59.480
