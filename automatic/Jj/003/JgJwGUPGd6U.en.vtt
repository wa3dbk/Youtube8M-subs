a<00:00:31.230> face<00:00:31.439> around<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.099> thought<00:00:32.460> about<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
a face around it I thought about that

the best way to use flash is to hold on
to<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.820> long<00:00:56.879> as<00:00:57.000> possible<00:00:57.710> kind<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to it for as long as possible kind of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.110 
to it for as long as possible kind of
keep<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:58.980> us<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.280> fail-safe<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.850> can<00:00:59.969> fall

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
keep it us like a fail-safe I can fall

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.260 
keep it us like a fail-safe I can fall
back<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.359> oh<00:01:00.780> oh<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.399> kill<00:01:03.000> and

oh I don't know well how do you use
flash<00:01:34.020> pretty<00:01:35.020> much<00:01:35.140> we<00:01:35.290> think<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.860> best

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
flash pretty much we think that the best

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.429 
flash pretty much we think that the best
way<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.580> gauge<00:01:37.240> when<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.780> use<00:01:37.899> flash<00:01:38.080> will<00:01:38.320> not

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
way to gauge when to use flash will not

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.270 
way to gauge when to use flash will not
use<00:01:38.619> flash<00:01:38.799> is<00:01:39.159> value<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.890> we<00:01:45.039> mean<00:01:45.220> by

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
use flash is value and what we mean by

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.560 
use flash is value and what we mean by
value<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.789> that<00:01:45.909> there's<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.149> lot<00:01:46.299> of<00:01:46.390> things

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
value is that there's a lot of things

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.999 
value is that there's a lot of things
that<00:01:46.720> you<00:01:46.780> can<00:01:46.930> gain<00:01:47.080> by<00:01:47.259> using<00:01:47.440> such<00:01:47.740> a<00:01:47.770> long

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
that you can gain by using such a long

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.840 
that you can gain by using such a long
cooldown<00:01:48.280> just<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.000> instant<00:01:49.360> teleport<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
cooldown just that instant teleport you

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.060 
cooldown just that instant teleport you
can<00:01:52.030> secure<00:01:52.509> kills<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:52.899> get<00:01:53.049> objectives<00:01:53.590> you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
can secure kills to get objectives you

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.340 
can secure kills to get objectives you
can<00:01:54.310> secure<00:01:54.700> kills<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.119> get<00:01:55.299> cool<00:01:55.450> points<00:01:55.810> you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
can secure kills to get cool points you

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.609 
can secure kills to get cool points you
can<00:01:56.530> secure<00:01:56.860> kills<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.320> sake<00:01:59.590> of

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
can secure kills for the sake of

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.190 
can secure kills for the sake of
security<00:01:59.979> all<00:02:00.490> right<00:02:00.940> so<00:02:01.750> we're<00:02:01.899> gonna<00:02:02.020> go

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
security all right so we're gonna go

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.359 
security all right so we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.380> take<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.560> look<00:02:02.740> at<00:02:02.890> some<00:02:03.009> replays

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
ahead and take a look at some replays

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.580 
ahead and take a look at some replays
from<00:02:03.550> Samsung<00:02:04.270> blue<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:04.750> Samsung<00:02:05.140> white<00:02:05.350> in

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
from Samsung blue and Samsung white in

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.490 
from Samsung blue and Samsung white in
their<00:02:05.710> semifinals<00:02:06.399> games<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.940> worlds<00:02:07.299> and

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
their semifinals games and worlds and

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.809 
their semifinals games and worlds and
hopefully<00:02:08.500> find<00:02:08.830> some<00:02:08.979> good<00:02:09.160> examples<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.759> how

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
hopefully find some good examples of how

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.660 
hopefully find some good examples of how
to<00:02:10.000> use<00:02:10.239> flash<00:02:11.220> correctly<00:02:14.459> all<00:02:15.459> right<00:02:15.580> so

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
to use flash correctly all right so

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.490 
to use flash correctly all right so
we're<00:02:15.790> about<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.299> various<00:02:16.750> flash<00:02:17.200> vault

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
we're about to see various flash vault

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.410 
we're about to see various flash vault
in<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.769> mid<00:02:17.980> lane<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.850> doesn't<00:02:19.299> quite

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
in the mid lane and it doesn't quite

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.170 
in the mid lane and it doesn't quite
work<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.870> think<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.260> great<00:02:20.410> example<00:02:20.680> of
