00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.630
 Welcome to a new edition of her 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.100
 Culinary heritage today with one of the 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.200
 autumnal dish what a good year 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.830
 Although just fit cool says if we 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.990
 Of course we need to do that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.790
 bit of potatoes bacon 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 smoked best 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.020
 onions margarine for frying or 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.430
 butter is also up in vegetable stock, we 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.930
 You can also do it yourself and salt 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.560
 pepper sugar and thyme 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.960
 to spice up 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.550
 First we leave the butter or 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 the margarine resp 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.190
 that will burn out a hot pot 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.000
 before the onions we small 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.560
 cut names come to that and the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.560
 thinnest we first have nice glassy 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.660
 and then the bacon can come to it 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.190
 that of course gives everything an account 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.190
 SautÃ© the taste a bit 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.910
 before we weighed not rolled 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.890
 already on top of it is the mecklenburger 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.890
 Rogan did not say cabbage turnips 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.900
 and the potatoes on top of that too 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.730
 to sprinkle whole beautiful of the height 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.730
 but then spice it up 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.950
 if necessary, always spice it up 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.750
 when it's done 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 but first we leave that 45 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.560
 minutes to simmer at medium heat 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.630
 and then he is actually already 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.340
 finished our cabbage turnip stew where 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.289
 turnip stew one can also 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.969
 say is a bit disreputable 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.740
 after the second world war as a notebook 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.630
 but is really super delicious 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.950
 I can only recommend 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.720
