00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello to all guys today I'll show you 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.730
 how to put tricks on clash owens 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.280
 many of you will say that they do not exist 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 all and until recently I thought so 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.809
 me too 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.850
 just let's say some people of mine 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.400
 club made me known 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.880
 these update auser two points an inscription 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.119
 in Japanese by saint roch in in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.869
 practice after downloading it 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.690
 let's say it will work for you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.850
 the screen and you will choose the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 frequency and how many times then 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.980
 let's say you will be on clash of plants 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.579
 always online and will not be able to 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.969
 attack for example I put this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.860
 here I saved it to me I must melo 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.800
 touch every 100 seconds to find it ho 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.910
 put one and how many zeros I could and in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.910
 practice 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.809
 let's say that if I leave this on 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.809
 computer case 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:15.030
 I'll have the shield let's say the shield for that 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:20.310
 will be online for as many as 125 125 thousand e 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.280
 500 55 hours and 33 minutes and so we say 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.100
 no one will attack you there 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.890
 will steal resources I know you can do one 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.150
 climbed so for example I go to 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:41.490
 tap makes selected I go back 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.470
 so do it on clash of plants it's just 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.870
 will have loaded 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.490
 I can start start so let's say first 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.600
 I only leave all night 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.950
 so for example I start this here 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.940
 now it's done 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.320
 as i know i leave so taufers art 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.080
 is written below 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.780
 I leave him so I know I go out 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.630
 I'm going for a 5-hour walk 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.270
 I come back and even if I put the computer in 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.880
 standby anyway they can't 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.970
 attack because there is tau was active 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:23.430
 which in any case continues to touch me 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.730
 But this screen is what you can do 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.120
 only on android because this app is there 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.209
 only on the Apple Play Store you can't 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.790
 it can do indeed I have an iphone 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.120
 I did it on the computer because we say 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.610
 with this video with the video I have 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.790
 promised yesterday I think we say I have it 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.660
 put on the pc and it works like android 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:56.640
 and so anyway so and now now 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.680
 I will have the shield is obviously not not 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.860
 I leave because it makes you these was I want you 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.739
 play, for example, if tonight 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.890
 I want for example you see I have so much 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.019
 elixir to do something if for example 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.760
 I want to protect him and I don't want to 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.220
 take risks 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.170
 I put this I leave the computer ist ein 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.580
 by I don't turn it off because otherwise I won't 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.340
 it works 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.519
 also applies to the phone I go to 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.700
 sleep as soon as I wake up 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.739
 if I go to see you turn on the computer 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.890
 they did n't attack me because there's the tau 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:35.549
 ter and let's say this is a trick 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.870
 very beneficial and I hope the video 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.000
 you like them 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.140
 among other things he is touching me alone 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.780
 I'm doing nothing 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.970
 as you can see so it works alone 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.739
 I hope you enjoy the video as at 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.150
 I usually remind you to leave a light 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.150
 and sign up and beautiful
