worry about the opposition and then

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.560 
worry about the opposition and then
after<00:05:07.680> that<00:05:07.800> if<00:05:08.580> you<00:05:08.700> do<00:05:08.850> well<00:05:09.090> with<00:05:09.240> yourself

that<00:05:13.440> were<00:05:13.560> wolves<00:05:13.800> when<00:05:14.100> when<00:05:14.340> we<00:05:14.550> get<00:05:14.730> it

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
that were wolves when when we get it

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.250 
that were wolves when when we get it
right<00:05:14.970> doesn't<00:05:15.600> matter<00:05:15.720> we're<00:05:15.900> playing<00:05:16.140> the

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
right doesn't matter we're playing the

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.480 
right doesn't matter we're playing the
top<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.620> league<00:05:16.800> or<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.100> bottom<00:05:17.340> of<00:05:17.430> the

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
top of the league or the bottom of the

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.950 
top of the league or the bottom of the
league<00:05:17.640> when<00:05:17.820> we<00:05:18.000> get<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.270> right<00:05:18.390> we<00:05:18.450> can<00:05:18.780> win

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
league when we get it right we can win

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.690 
league when we get it right we can win
and<00:05:19.140> so<00:05:19.620> what<00:05:19.860> we<00:05:19.980> have<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.160> do<00:05:20.280> is<00:05:20.400> concentrate

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
and so what we have to do is concentrate

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.000 
and so what we have to do is concentrate
on<00:05:20.970> ourselves<00:05:21.090> make<00:05:21.570> sure<00:05:21.810> our<00:05:22.170> performance
