growing<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.699> Europe<00:00:51.359> and<00:00:51.510> Asia<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.920> here

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
growing up in Europe and Asia but here

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.029 
growing up in Europe and Asia but here
in<00:00:53.280> u.s.<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:55.410> down<00:00:55.710> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
in u.s. it's kind of going down and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.970 
in u.s. it's kind of going down and
that's<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.120> sad<00:00:57.359> because<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that's kind of sad because this is the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
that's kind of sad because this is the
capital<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.730> ball<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> league

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
capital of the ball I think the league

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.369 
capital of the ball I think the league
bowling<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.920> down<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.460> lot<00:01:02.910> here<00:01:03.420> and

bowling is going down a lot here and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.920 
bowling is going down a lot here and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
are doing well what I see is I mean

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.320 
are doing well what I see is I mean
there's<00:01:17.159> no<00:01:17.310> more<00:01:17.549> double<00:01:17.880> shift<00:01:18.090> leagues

there's no more double shift leagues

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.929 
there's no more double shift leagues
it's<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.810> single<00:01:19.170> shift<00:01:19.430> nobody<00:01:20.430> has<00:01:20.520> time<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
it's all single shift nobody has time to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.899 
it's all single shift nobody has time to
vote<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.299> lease<00:01:21.479> anymore<00:01:22.369> it's<00:01:23.369> too<00:01:23.460> busy

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
vote to lease anymore it's too busy

vote to lease anymore it's too busy
Bowens<00:01:24.810> getting<00:01:25.049> expensive<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:27.210> competitive

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
Bowens getting expensive the competitive

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.300 
Bowens getting expensive the competitive
nature<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:28.079> bowling<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.890> disappeared

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
nature of bowling of this is disappeared

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
nature of bowling of this is disappeared
basically<00:01:29.670> well<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.509> think<00:01:30.630> everybody<00:01:31.049> across

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
basically well I think everybody across

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.319 
basically well I think everybody across
the<00:01:31.470> board<00:01:31.680> knows<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> league<00:01:32.340> participation

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the board knows the league participation

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.429 
the board knows the league participation
is<00:01:33.360> probably<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> downward<00:01:34.290> spiral

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
is probably on the downward spiral

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.899 
is probably on the downward spiral
that's<00:01:34.860> probably<00:01:35.070> leveled<00:01:35.399> off<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> little<00:01:35.700> bit

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that's probably leveled off a little bit

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.200 
that's probably leveled off a little bit
at<00:01:36.119> least<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.390> our<00:01:36.450> areas<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:36.930> s<00:01:37.909> but<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.060> kind

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
at least in our areas at s but it's kind

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.190 
at least in our areas at s but it's kind
of<00:01:39.240> goes<00:01:39.390> back<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> youth<00:01:39.810> programs

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
of goes back to the youth programs

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600 
of goes back to the youth programs
there's<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.710> many<00:01:40.860> youth<00:01:41.070> programs<00:01:41.460> as

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
there's not as many youth programs as

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.670 
there's not as many youth programs as
there<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.990> state<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
there was state of the one I think is

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440 
there was state of the one I think is
still<00:01:43.890> very<00:01:44.040> popular<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.909> participation

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
still very popular the participation

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.380 
still very popular the participation
wide<00:01:45.780> side<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.500> very<00:01:47.070> popular

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
wide side of it is very popular

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.999 
wide side of it is very popular
obviously<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.540> throw<00:01:48.719> the<00:01:48.780> masses<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.530> do

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
obviously would throw the masses that do

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.550 
obviously would throw the masses that do
it<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> recreation<00:01:50.759> level<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.380> go

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it on a recreation level but I think go

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.050 
it on a recreation level but I think go
with<00:01:52.710> some<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.950> new<00:01:53.070> programs<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.759> set

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
with some of new programs that are set

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.399 
with some of new programs that are set
