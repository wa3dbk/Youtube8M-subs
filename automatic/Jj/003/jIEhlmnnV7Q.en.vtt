against<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.330> wall

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
against the wall

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.729 
against the wall
Colonel<00:00:16.320> Amara<00:00:16.770> Tran<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:19.140> reason<00:00:19.470> she<00:00:19.619> is

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:19.739 
Colonel Amara Tran and the reason she is

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.159 
Colonel Amara Tran and the reason she is
called<00:00:20.009> the<00:00:20.189> wall<00:00:20.399> is<00:00:20.759> because<00:00:21.239> she<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.899> very

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
called the wall is because she is very

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.290 
called the wall is because she is very
very<00:00:22.680> strong<00:00:23.599> defenses<00:00:24.599> and<00:00:25.820> very<00:00:26.820> very<00:00:27.090> high

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
very strong defenses and very very high

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.409 
very strong defenses and very very high
level<00:00:27.660> walls<00:00:28.489> so<00:00:29.489> I<00:00:29.759> didn't<00:00:30.090> want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.270> mess

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
level walls so I didn't want to mess

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.790 
level walls so I didn't want to mess
around<00:00:30.540> with<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.989> because<00:00:31.349> I'd<00:00:31.529> been<00:00:31.680> doing

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
around with this because I'd been doing

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
around with this because I'd been doing
a<00:00:31.950> lot<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> ground<00:00:32.399> troops<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.329> best<00:00:33.510> way

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
a lot of ground troops so the best way

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.740 
a lot of ground troops so the best way
to<00:00:33.719> counteract<00:00:34.140> walls<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:35.970> all<00:00:36.180> air<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
to counteract walls is to go all air so

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.360 
to counteract walls is to go all air so
I<00:00:36.780> decided<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.410> bring<00:00:37.560> my<00:00:37.740> drones<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
I decided to bring my drones out of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.320 
I decided to bring my drones out of
retirement<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.170> we<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.650> to<00:00:41.330> swarm

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
retirement and we are going to swarm

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.230 
retirement and we are going to swarm
over<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.870> top<00:00:43.080> of<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.320> walls<00:00:43.880> take<00:00:44.880> a<00:00:44.940> quick

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
over the top of these walls take a quick

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.230 
over the top of these walls take a quick
look<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:45.720> at<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.470> base<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:47.670> looks<00:00:47.970> like<00:00:48.120> we

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
look over at the base and looks like we

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.760 
look over at the base and looks like we
got<00:00:48.390> an<00:00:48.480> air<00:00:48.660> defense<00:00:48.810> right<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> middle

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
got an air defense right in the middle

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.430 
got an air defense right in the middle
you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:51.060> see<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> Patriot<00:00:51.840> looks<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.290> we

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you can see the Patriot looks like we

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.690 
you can see the Patriot looks like we
got<00:00:52.590> one<00:00:52.620> over<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> right<00:00:53.280> which<00:00:53.520> should

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
got one over on the right which should

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.890 
got one over on the right which should
not<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.880> an<00:00:54.090> issue<00:00:55.400> and<00:00:56.450> I<00:00:57.450> think<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.810> I'm

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.140 

drones<00:02:04.340> are<00:02:04.430> starting<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.760> spread<00:02:04.940> out<00:02:05.120> a

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
drones are starting to spread out a

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.570 
drones are starting to spread out a
little<00:02:05.360> bit<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.870> probably<00:02:06.530> could<00:02:06.920> have<00:02:06.950> went<00:02:07.490> a

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
little bit I probably could have went a

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.010 
little bit I probably could have went a
little<00:02:07.700> bit<00:02:07.910> slower<00:02:07.970> with<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.600> one<00:02:08.810> and

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
little bit slower with this one and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.950 
little bit slower with this one and
saved<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.470> few<00:02:09.590> of<00:02:09.680> the<00:02:09.770> drones<00:02:10.040> but<00:02:10.810> first<00:02:11.810> time

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
saved a few of the drones but first time

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.900 
saved a few of the drones but first time
coming<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.560> all<00:02:12.740> air<00:02:12.950> I<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.580> wanted<00:02:13.790> to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
coming in this all air I just wanted to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.620 
coming in this all air I just wanted to
be<00:02:14.060> safe<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.020> go<00:02:15.290> ahead<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.530> get<00:02:15.620> that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
be safe and go ahead and get that

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.760 
be safe and go ahead and get that
guaranteed<00:02:17.630> star<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.380> looks<00:02:18.530> like<00:02:18.620> I'm

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
guaranteed star and that looks like I'm

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.070 
guaranteed star and that looks like I'm
pretty<00:02:18.980> good<00:02:19.160> shape<00:02:19.690> still<00:02:20.690> gets<00:02:20.840> there<00:02:20.990> all

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
pretty good shape still gets there all

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.520 
pretty good shape still gets there all
the<00:02:21.170> drones<00:02:21.380> left<00:02:21.740> over<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:23.200> no<00:02:24.200> issue<00:02:24.380> there

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
the drones left over so no issue there

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.020 
the drones left over so no issue there
the<00:02:24.920> Patriots<00:02:25.310> over<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.640> far<00:02:25.760> right<00:02:26.000> side

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
the Patriots over on the far right side

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.960 
the Patriots over on the far right side
so<00:02:26.450> that's<00:02:26.600> not<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.780> problem<00:02:27.050> I'm<00:02:27.800> over<00:02:28.010> 80%<00:02:28.670> so

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
so that's not a problem I'm over 80% so

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.970 
so that's not a problem I'm over 80% so
all<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.510> defenses<00:02:29.960> are<00:02:30.080> down<00:02:30.320> it's<00:02:30.740> just

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
all the defenses are down it's just

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.000 
all the defenses are down it's just
cleaning<00:02:31.310> up<00:02:31.400> out<00:02:34.390> 95<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:38.650> there<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.770> see<00:02:39.980> it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
cleaning up out 95 and there you see it

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.410 
cleaning up out 95 and there you see it
perfect<00:02:40.700> 3<00:02:40.910> star<00:02:41.150> attack<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.170> wall<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:43.420> we

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
perfect 3 star attack on the wall and we

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.730 
perfect 3 star attack on the wall and we
didn't<00:02:44.630> damage<00:02:44.780> your<00:02:44.900> wall<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.440> can<00:02:45.470> have

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
didn't damage your wall so you can have

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.670 
didn't damage your wall so you can have
those<00:02:45.920> no<00:02:46.550> issue<00:02:46.730> but<00:02:47.570> we<00:02:47.690> did<00:02:47.840> get<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.050> perfect

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
those no issue but we did get a perfect

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.790 
those no issue but we did get a perfect
attack<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:53.090> let's<00:02:53.959> see<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.350> looks<00:02:54.440> like<00:02:54.560> we

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
attack and let's see it looks like we

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.830 
attack and let's see it looks like we
lost<00:02:54.830> about<00:02:55.400> 30<00:02:56.000> drones<00:02:56.300> so<00:02:56.510> I'll<00:02:56.600> take<00:02:56.780> that

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
lost about 30 drones so I'll take that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.229 
lost about 30 drones so I'll take that
and<00:02:57.440> we're<00:02:57.980> gonna<00:02:58.070> move<00:02:58.340> on<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.820> next<00:02:58.970> zone

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
and we're gonna move on to the next zone

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.150 
and we're gonna move on to the next zone
looks<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.320> next<00:03:00.440> Island<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.890> gonna<00:03:01.040> be

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
looks like the next Island is gonna be

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.510 
looks like the next Island is gonna be
