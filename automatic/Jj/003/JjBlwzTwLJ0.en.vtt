00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
the chameleon pen system works is you

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.590 
the chameleon pen system works is you
can<00:00:42.110> actually<00:00:42.470> use<00:00:42.740> the<00:00:43.250> whole<00:00:43.490> working<00:00:44.450> from

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
can actually use the whole working from

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.140 
can actually use the whole working from
absence<00:00:45.110> of<00:00:45.230> color<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:46.070> color<00:00:46.460> working<00:00:47.000> from

absence of color to color working from

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.870 
absence of color to color working from
that<00:00:47.210> light<00:00:47.660> mid-tone<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.710> dark<00:00:48.980> tone<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.820> your

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
that light mid-tone to dark tone to your

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.760 
that light mid-tone to dark tone to your
advantage<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.690> get<00:00:51.050> some<00:00:51.260> really<00:00:51.500> neat

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
advantage to get some really neat

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.700 
advantage to get some really neat
effects<00:00:52.400> with<00:00:52.640> color<00:00:52.850> overlays<00:00:53.240> so<00:00:53.570> I'm<00:00:54.530> going

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
effects with color overlays so I'm going

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.810 
effects with color overlays so I'm going
to<00:00:54.740> start<00:00:54.950> I'm<00:00:55.160> just<00:00:55.310> going<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.460> use<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.610> really

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
to start I'm just going to use a really

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.210 
to start I'm just going to use a really
simple<00:00:56.180> image<00:00:56.510> my<00:00:57.320> favorite<00:00:57.860> little<00:00:58.070> leaf

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
simple image my favorite little leaf

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.580 
simple image my favorite little leaf
because<00:00:58.970> it<00:00:59.120> gives<00:00:59.329> some<00:00:59.540> good<00:00:59.960> idea<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.350> depth

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
because it gives some good idea of depth

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.020 
because it gives some good idea of depth
and<00:01:00.739> dimension<00:01:00.800> at<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.430> same<00:01:01.610> time<00:01:01.820> it's

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
and dimension at the same time it's

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.359 
and dimension at the same time it's
really<00:01:02.239> able<00:01:02.810> to<00:01:02.930> see<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.350> colors<00:01:03.800> come

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
really able to see the colors come

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.340 
really able to see the colors come
through<00:01:04.729> alright<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:05.810> I'm<00:01:05.899> going<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.079> start

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
through alright so I'm going to start

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.550 
through alright so I'm going to start
with<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.859> yg3<00:01:07.280> this<00:01:07.850> spring<00:01:08.329> meadow<00:01:08.929> green

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
with the yg3 this spring meadow green

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.730 
with the yg3 this spring meadow green
and<00:01:09.920> I'm<00:01:10.399> going<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.609> fuse<00:01:10.880> this<00:01:11.210> for<00:01:11.600> about<00:01:12.380> 10

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
and I'm going to fuse this for about 10

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.700 
and I'm going to fuse this for about 10
seconds<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:14.659> just<00:01:14.960> want<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.229> be<00:01:15.350> able<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:15.590> get

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
seconds so I just want to be able to get

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.529 
seconds so I just want to be able to get
that<00:01:15.859> color<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.189> little<00:01:16.399> bit<00:01:16.549> lighter<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.119> the

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
that color a little bit lighter so the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.209 
that color a little bit lighter so the
whole<00:01:17.749> concept<00:01:18.229> here<00:01:18.499> is<00:01:18.590> I'm<00:01:18.740> actually<00:01:18.770> going

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
whole concept here is I'm actually going

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:20.889 
whole concept here is I'm actually going
to<00:01:19.280> work<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:19.759> a<00:01:19.789> color<00:01:20.119> blend<00:01:20.420> I'm<00:01:20.659> going<00:01:20.840> to

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
to work on a color blend I'm going to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.529 
to work on a color blend I'm going to
work<00:01:21.049> from<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.469> light<00:01:21.939> absence<00:01:22.939> of<00:01:23.030> color<00:01:23.270> and

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
work from a light absence of color and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.899 
work from a light absence of color and
I'm<00:01:24.289> going<00:01:24.439> to<00:01:24.469> take<00:01:24.679> that<00:01:24.889> into<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.310> mid-tone

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
I'm going to take that into a mid-tone

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:33.039 
I'm going to take that into a mid-tone
and<00:01:27.939> then<00:01:29.109> into<00:01:30.109> a<00:01:30.530> bit<00:01:31.100> darker<00:01:31.549> tone<00:01:31.789> and<00:01:32.240> as<00:01:32.899> I

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
and then into a bit darker tone and as I

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.480 
and then into a bit darker tone and as I
start<00:01:33.289> to<00:01:33.439> color<00:01:33.649> that's<00:01:33.920> going<00:01:34.189> to<00:01:34.249> start

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
start to color that's going to start

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.679 
start to color that's going to start
going<00:01:34.700> back<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.509> that<00:01:36.170> base<00:01:37.060> color<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.359> that

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
going back to that base color of that

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.260 
going back to that base color of that
nice<00:01:40.060> yg3<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.509> yellow<00:01:41.749> green<00:01:42.639> okay<00:01:43.639> so<00:01:43.700> maybe

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
nice yg3 that yellow green okay so maybe

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.149 
nice yg3 that yellow green okay so maybe
what<00:01:44.569> I<00:01:44.600> want<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:44.959> do<00:01:45.079> is<00:01:45.409> I<00:01:45.619> say<00:01:45.770> that's<00:01:45.920> nice

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
what I want to do is I say that's nice

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.859 
what I want to do is I say that's nice
but<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.639> actually<00:01:46.850> think<00:01:47.119> I'd<00:01:47.240> like<00:01:47.389> to<00:01:47.539> mute

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
but I actually think I'd like to mute

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.139 
but I actually think I'd like to mute
that<00:01:47.899> tone<00:01:48.409> down<00:01:48.649> a<00:01:48.679> little<00:01:48.950> bit<00:01:49.279> we<00:01:49.819> do<00:01:49.969> have

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
that tone down a little bit we do have

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.389 
that tone down a little bit we do have
an<00:01:50.329> olive<00:01:50.719> green<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:51.200> is<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.590> little<00:01:52.009> bit<00:01:52.189> more

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
an olive green that is a little bit more

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.819 
an olive green that is a little bit more
muted<00:01:53.770> from<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:55.219> one<00:01:55.609> for<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:56.529> so<00:01:57.529> that

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
muted from that one for you so that

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.059 
muted from that one for you so that
olive<00:01:58.310> green<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:59.499> just<00:02:00.499> so<00:02:00.590> I<00:02:00.649> can<00:02:00.799> color<00:02:00.950> that

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
olive green is just so I can color that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.239 
olive green is just so I can color that
beside<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:02.200> that's<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.349> little<00:02:03.560> bit<00:02:03.709> more<00:02:03.950> muted

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
beside it that's a little bit more muted

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.200 
beside it that's a little bit more muted
color<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:05.119> olive<00:02:05.479> gray

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
color the olive gray

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.630 
color the olive gray
so<00:02:06.930> maybe<00:02:07.440> I<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.770> want<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> tone<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.399> down<00:02:08.429> I

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so maybe I just want to tone that down I

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.810 
so maybe I just want to tone that down I
don't<00:02:08.940> want<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.119> quite<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.539> dark<00:02:09.960> but<00:02:10.820> want

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
don't want it quite that dark but want

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.440 
don't want it quite that dark but want
to<00:02:11.880> add<00:02:12.000> maybe<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.450> little<00:02:12.630> bit<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:14.420> tone<00:02:15.420> down

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
to add maybe a little bit of tone down

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.870 
to add maybe a little bit of tone down
this<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.260> color<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.070> first<00:02:17.580> what<00:02:17.790> I'm

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
this to that color so first what I'm

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.280 
this to that color so first what I'm
going<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.390> I'm<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.720> fuse<00:02:19.050> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
going to do is I'm going to fuse this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.930 
going to do is I'm going to fuse this
and<00:02:19.530> I'm<00:02:19.590> going<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.830> overlay<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.700> one

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
and I'm going to overlay it that's one

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.449 
and I'm going to overlay it that's one
way<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.150> doing<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.130> we're<00:02:23.130> going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.370> go

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
way of doing it so we're going to go

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.400 
way of doing it so we're going to go
from<00:02:23.670> absence<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.209> color<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.510> color<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.959> then

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
from absence of color to color and then

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.720 
from absence of color to color and then
we're<00:02:25.500> gonna<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.800> same<00:02:25.980> thing<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.640> that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
we're gonna do the same thing with that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.730 
we're gonna do the same thing with that
color<00:02:26.940> overlay<00:02:27.360> we're<00:02:28.080> going<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.290> start<00:02:28.530> on

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
color overlay we're going to start on

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.280 
color overlay we're going to start on
that<00:02:29.340> absence<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.000> color<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.870> we're<00:02:31.050> still

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that absence of color so we're still

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.530 
that absence of color so we're still
keeping<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.680> nice<00:02:31.950> highlighted<00:02:32.670> area<00:02:33.000> we're

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
keeping that nice highlighted area we're

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.180 
keeping that nice highlighted area we're
not<00:02:33.660> actually<00:02:33.840> changing<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.620> color<00:02:34.890> that's

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
not actually changing that color that's

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.120 
not actually changing that color that's
the<00:02:35.310> absence<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.790> color<00:02:35.970> now<00:02:36.300> as<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.500> see<00:02:37.800> I'm

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
the absence of color now as you see I'm

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.160 
the absence of color now as you see I'm
starting<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.880> color<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.540> see<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.870> green

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
starting to color can you see that green

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.740 
starting to color can you see that green
starting<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.739> change<00:02:41.209> see<00:02:42.209> it's<00:02:42.360> starting<00:02:42.660> to

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
starting to change see it's starting to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
starting to change see it's starting to
go<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.260> bit<00:02:44.220> more<00:02:44.250> muted<00:02:44.760> color<00:02:45.420> green<00:02:45.770> so

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
go to a bit more muted color green so

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.610 
go to a bit more muted color green so
it's<00:02:46.890> not<00:02:47.010> quite<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> olive<00:02:47.820> but<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:49.170> gives<00:02:49.440> it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
it's not quite the olive but it gives it

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.610 
it's not quite the olive but it gives it
this<00:02:49.800> sort<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.190> nice<00:02:50.430> peachy<00:02:51.270> tone<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:51.870> so

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
this sort of nice peachy tone to it so

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.010 
this sort of nice peachy tone to it so
that<00:02:52.650> quite<00:02:52.950> as<00:02:53.070> deep<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:54.330> olive<00:02:54.750> great

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
that quite as deep as that olive great

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.260 
that quite as deep as that olive great
if<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.739> want<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.160> can<00:02:56.310> actually<00:02:56.430> layer<00:02:56.850> olive

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
if you want you can actually layer olive

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.460 
if you want you can actually layer olive
green<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.630> top<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.140> make<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.290> even

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
green on top of that and make it even

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.560 
green on top of that and make it even
darker<00:02:58.770> possibly<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.700> different<00:03:00.000> color<00:03:00.150> this

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
darker possibly a different color this

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.880 
darker possibly a different color this
is<00:03:00.690> what<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.810> love<00:03:01.020> about<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.410> because<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.650> can<00:03:01.800> do

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
is what I love about is because I can do

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.010 
is what I love about is because I can do
color<00:03:02.090> experimentation<00:03:03.090> using<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.570> now

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
color experimentation using it now

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.770 
color experimentation using it now
that's<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.220> way<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.550> doing<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.970> another<00:03:06.420> way

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
that's one way of doing it another way

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.979 
that's one way of doing it another way
is<00:03:07.640> we're<00:03:08.640> going<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.820> start<00:03:09.180> with<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.660> color

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
is we're going to start with that color

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.460 
is we're going to start with that color
of<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:11.489> yg3<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.450> we're<00:03:12.989> going<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.170> fuse<00:03:13.440> that

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
of the yg3 and we're going to fuse that

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.199 
of the yg3 and we're going to fuse that
again<00:03:13.950> at<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.130> same<00:03:14.400> ten<00:03:14.580> seconds<00:03:15.030> we're

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
again at the same ten seconds we're

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.420 
again at the same ten seconds we're
going<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.390> do<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.720> same<00:03:15.900> thing<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:17.100> we<00:03:17.280> did

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
going to do the same thing that we did

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.130 
going to do the same thing that we did
over<00:03:17.730> here<00:03:17.760> we're<00:03:18.660> gonna<00:03:18.780> add<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> little<00:03:19.019> bit

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
over here we're gonna add a little bit

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.100 
over here we're gonna add a little bit
of<00:03:19.290> Twister<00:03:19.680> slightly<00:03:20.670> different<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.810> again

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
of Twister slightly different so again

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.710 
of Twister slightly different so again
we're<00:03:22.260> going<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.410> go<00:03:22.590> from<00:03:22.830> that<00:03:22.920> very<00:03:23.340> light

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
we're going to go from that very light

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.570 
we're going to go from that very light
into<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.810> tip<00:03:25.489> into<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.640> mid-tone<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:28.580> then

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
into the tip into the mid-tone and then

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.720 
into the tip into the mid-tone and then
to<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> darker<00:03:30.239> tones<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:32.100> way<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.430> creates

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
to the darker tones the way that creates

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.820 
to the darker tones the way that creates
your<00:03:32.850> such<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> nice<00:03:33.330> color<00:03:33.570> blends<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.650> then

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
your such a nice color blends and then

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.850 
your such a nice color blends and then
back<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.370> darker<00:03:35.700> color<00:03:35.730> okay<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:36.860> that

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
back to that darker color okay so that

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.490 
back to that darker color okay so that
is<00:03:38.160> that<00:03:38.280> exact<00:03:38.640> same<00:03:38.850> base<00:03:39.150> but<00:03:40.110> here's<00:03:40.320> what

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
is that exact same base but here's what

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.960 
is that exact same base but here's what
I'm<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.799> do<00:03:40.950> I'm<00:03:41.130> not<00:03:41.190> going<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.730> fuse

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
the Nu one i'm not going to fuse that

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.590 
the Nu one i'm not going to fuse that
this<00:03:44.130> color<00:03:44.400> i'm<00:03:44.880> actually<00:03:45.090> going<00:03:45.330> to<00:03:45.450> take

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
this color i'm actually going to take

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.680 
this color i'm actually going to take
that<00:03:45.870> at<00:03:46.140> its<00:03:46.769> purest<00:03:47.220> color<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:48.030> i'm<00:03:48.600> going

that at its purest color and i'm going

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.990 
that at its purest color and i'm going
to<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:48.900> right<00:03:49.140> back<00:03:49.350> over<00:03:49.650> top<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.310> what<00:03:50.880> I'm

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
to go right back over top and what I'm

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.930 
to go right back over top and what I'm
actually<00:03:51.180> doing<00:03:51.390> here<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.930> I'm<00:03:52.230> creating<00:03:52.940> just

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
actually doing here is I'm creating just

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.390 
actually doing here is I'm creating just
an<00:03:54.030> interesting<00:03:54.690> color<00:03:54.900> blend<00:03:55.290> because<00:03:56.280> I'm

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
an interesting color blend because I'm

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.770 
an interesting color blend because I'm
going<00:03:56.579> from<00:03:56.820> absence<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.329> colored<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.630> see

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
going from absence to colored you see

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.780 
going from absence to colored you see
how<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:57.959> just<00:03:57.989> happened<00:03:58.530> now<00:03:59.160> I'm<00:03:59.430> going

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
how that just happened now I'm going

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.880 
how that just happened now I'm going
into<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.120> color<00:04:00.390> transition<00:04:01.079> I'm<00:04:01.260> now<00:04:01.829> using

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
into that color transition I'm now using

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.759 
into that color transition I'm now using
that<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.910> change<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.480> colors<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.410> now<00:04:04.620> I'm

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
that to change the colors so now I'm

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.550 
that to change the colors so now I'm
getting<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.220> color<00:04:05.459> blend<00:04:06.230> so<00:04:07.230> that's<00:04:07.410> an

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
getting that color blend so that's an

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.380 
getting that color blend so that's an
interesting<00:04:07.799> way<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.220> get<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.519> really<00:04:08.610> cool

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
interesting way to get a really cool

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.160 
interesting way to get a really cool
seamless<00:04:10.380> color<00:04:11.130> gradation<00:04:11.790> going<00:04:12.180> from<00:04:12.510> a

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
seamless color gradation going from a

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.069 
seamless color gradation going from a
peachy<00:04:14.160> color<00:04:14.190> into<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.299> green<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:16.049> course

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
peachy color into a green of course

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.009 
peachy color into a green of course
that's<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:16.530> one<00:04:16.919> possible<00:04:17.639> combination<00:04:18.419> you

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
that's just one possible combination you

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:19.819 
that's just one possible combination you
can<00:04:19.200> do

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
can do

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.129 
can do
one<00:04:20.549> other<00:04:20.699> quick<00:04:20.970> way<00:04:21.209> we're<00:04:21.780> going<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.959> show

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
one other quick way we're going to show

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.809 
one other quick way we're going to show
you<00:04:22.259> this<00:04:22.530> remember<00:04:23.250> there's<00:04:23.430> 20<00:04:23.789> different

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 
you this remember there's 20 different

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.520 
you this remember there's 20 different
colors<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.360> can<00:04:24.419> go<00:04:24.599> up<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.900> down<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.139> tonal

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
colors you can go up and down the tonal

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.830 
colors you can go up and down the tonal
scale<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:28.129> you<00:04:29.129> can<00:04:29.159> do<00:04:29.669> tons<00:04:30.509> of<00:04:30.750> different

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
scale and you can do tons of different

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.719 
scale and you can do tons of different
color<00:04:31.470> combinations<00:04:31.710> in<00:04:32.250> what<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.490> want<00:04:32.669> to

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
color combinations in what you want to

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.670 
color combinations in what you want to
overlay<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.270> could<00:04:33.780> have<00:04:33.870> started<00:04:34.169> with<00:04:34.349> a

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
overlay I could have started with a

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.230 
overlay I could have started with a
different<00:04:35.280> color<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.580> base<00:04:35.729> and<00:04:36.000> for<00:04:36.120> the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
different color on the base and for the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.869 
different color on the base and for the
the<00:04:36.690> disc<00:04:36.900> on<00:04:37.080> top<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:38.220> actually<00:04:38.550> bisque<00:04:38.759> and

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
the disc on top that actually bisque and

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.580 
the disc on top that actually bisque and
Brown<00:04:39.120> look<00:04:39.389> that<00:04:39.509> it<00:04:39.629> is<00:04:39.780> together<00:04:39.960> alright

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
Brown look that it is together alright

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.140 
Brown look that it is together alright
I'm<00:04:40.740> going<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.889> try<00:04:41.069> something<00:04:41.310> opposite

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
I'm going to try something opposite

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.999 
I'm going to try something opposite
really<00:04:42.659> opposite<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.229> spectrum<00:04:43.620> I'm<00:04:43.800> going

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
really opposite the spectrum I'm going

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.790 
really opposite the spectrum I'm going
to<00:04:44.069> use<00:04:44.159> the<00:04:44.310> pr<00:04:44.639> for<00:04:45.229> purple<00:04:46.259> and<00:04:46.409> I'm

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
to use the pr for purple and I'm

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.089 
to use the pr for purple and I'm
actually<00:04:46.979> going<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.310> use<00:04:47.690> low<00:04:48.690> R<00:04:49.139> for<00:04:49.470> the

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
actually going to use low R for the

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.830 
actually going to use low R for the
orange<00:04:50.759> so<00:04:51.120> this<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.330> going<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.509> get<00:04:51.569> really

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
orange so this is going to get really

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.020 
orange so this is going to get really
neat<00:04:51.990> so<00:04:52.710> let<00:04:52.919> me<00:04:53.039> try<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:53.310> one

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
neat so let me try this one

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.110 
neat so let me try this one
and<00:04:54.870> I'm<00:04:55.590> going<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:55.830> actually<00:04:55.979> go<00:04:56.400> with<00:04:56.729> I

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and I'm going to actually go with I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.170 
and I'm going to actually go with I
think<00:04:57.569> purple<00:04:57.930> first<00:04:58.229> it's<00:04:58.860> kind<00:04:59.069> of<00:04:59.099> fun<00:04:59.250> this

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
think purple first it's kind of fun this

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.820 
think purple first it's kind of fun this
is<00:05:00.330> another<00:05:00.569> really<00:05:00.840> neat<00:05:01.110> way<00:05:01.289> that<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.620> can

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
is another really neat way that you can

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.499 
is another really neat way that you can
do<00:05:02.099> a<00:05:02.129> color<00:05:02.430> blend<00:05:02.759> but<00:05:03.210> I'm<00:05:03.300> going<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.449> use

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
do a color blend but I'm going to use

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.719 
do a color blend but I'm going to use
two<00:05:03.810> opposite<00:05:04.530> colors<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:05.370> do<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.490> color

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
two opposite colors to do a color

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.180 
two opposite colors to do a color
overlay<00:05:05.819> or<00:05:06.569> color<00:05:06.990> blend<00:05:07.789> overlaying<00:05:08.789> colors

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
overlay or color blend overlaying colors

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.510 
overlay or color blend overlaying colors

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 
now we're going back to the base color

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.230 
now we're going back to the base color
okay<00:05:37.319> so<00:05:38.099> now<00:05:38.279> I've<00:05:38.370> got<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.699> sort<00:05:38.969> of<00:05:39.029> color

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
okay so now I've got that sort of color

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.249 
okay so now I've got that sort of color
gradation<00:05:40.020> happening<00:05:40.469> there<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:42.110> I'm<00:05:43.110> going

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
gradation happening there and I'm going

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.110 
gradation happening there and I'm going
to<00:05:43.319> go<00:05:43.440> with<00:05:43.560> Norma's<00:05:44.039> now<00:05:44.610> here's<00:05:44.909> where<00:05:45.060> it

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
to go with Norma's now here's where it

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.809 
to go with Norma's now here's where it
gets<00:05:45.330> kind<00:05:45.509> of<00:05:45.630> neat<00:05:45.779> you<00:05:45.990> can<00:05:46.650> start<00:05:47.490> about

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:47.819 
gets kind of neat you can start about

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.399 
gets kind of neat you can start about
here<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.330> go<00:05:48.509> and<00:05:48.690> leave<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:48.900> little<00:05:49.050> bit<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.349> a

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
here and go and leave a little bit of a

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.920 
here and go and leave a little bit of a
clear<00:05:49.680> gap<00:05:49.919> in<00:05:50.159> between<00:05:50.279> or<00:05:50.759> you<00:05:50.940> can<00:05:51.180> actually

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
clear gap in between or you can actually

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.409 
clear gap in between or you can actually
start<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.469> clear<00:05:53.069> in<00:05:53.279> the<00:05:53.520> purple<00:05:53.909> area<00:05:54.210> and

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
start the clear in the purple area and

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.269 
start the clear in the purple area and
then<00:05:54.659> so<00:05:54.900> you<00:05:54.960> transition<00:05:55.620> into<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.919> orange

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:56.279 
then so you transition into the orange

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.800 
then so you transition into the orange
just<00:05:56.490> watch<00:05:56.819> what<00:05:57.060> I'm<00:05:57.150> doing<00:05:57.180> here<00:05:57.569> I'm<00:05:57.659> going

chamber on top wave lighting will stop
it's<00:06:14.190> a<00:06:14.250> good<00:06:14.370> way<00:06:14.520> to<00:06:14.550> remember<00:06:14.729> it<00:06:15.349> so<00:06:16.349> I<00:06:16.409> want

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
it's a good way to remember it so I want

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.110 
it's a good way to remember it so I want
to<00:06:16.620> make<00:06:16.740> sure<00:06:16.800> that<00:06:17.129> I've<00:06:17.250> got<00:06:17.400> a<00:06:17.430> nice<00:06:17.610> clear

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
to make sure that I've got a nice clear

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.820 
to make sure that I've got a nice clear
blend<00:06:18.539> I<00:06:18.659> just<00:06:18.840> tested<00:06:19.229> that<00:06:19.319> off<00:06:19.529> to<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:19.740> side

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
blend I just tested that off to the side

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.189 
blend I just tested that off to the side
give<00:06:20.219> it<00:06:20.279> a<00:06:20.340> couple<00:06:20.520> more<00:06:20.669> seconds<00:06:21.090> now<00:06:21.930> what

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 
give it a couple more seconds now what

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.350 
give it a couple more seconds now what
I'm<00:06:22.319> going<00:06:22.469> to<00:06:22.500> do

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
I'm going to do

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.459 
I'm going to do
I'm<00:06:23.569> actually<00:06:23.719> going<00:06:23.960> to<00:06:24.050> work<00:06:24.139> from<00:06:24.319> the

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:24.469 
I'm actually going to work from the

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:27.100 
I'm actually going to work from the
opposite<00:06:24.919> direction<00:06:25.569> I'm<00:06:26.569> going<00:06:26.750> to<00:06:26.870> start

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
opposite direction I'm going to start

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.050 
opposite direction I'm going to start
with<00:06:27.289> that<00:06:27.409> absence<00:06:27.979> of<00:06:28.099> color<00:06:28.310> on<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.580> orange

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
with that absence of color on the orange

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.700 
with that absence of color on the orange
so<00:06:29.300> you<00:06:29.360> can't<00:06:29.810> see<00:06:29.930> what's<00:06:30.110> going<00:06:30.169> on<00:06:30.409> here

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
so you can't see what's going on here

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.670 
so you can't see what's going on here
this<00:06:31.490> is<00:06:31.550> really<00:06:32.000> no<00:06:32.120> color<00:06:32.389> now<00:06:32.840> the<00:06:33.289> orange

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
this is really no color now the orange

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.490 
this is really no color now the orange
is<00:06:33.979> starting<00:06:34.340> to<00:06:34.430> come<00:06:34.639> through<00:06:34.669> and<00:06:35.270> you<00:06:35.500> can

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
is starting to come through and you can

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.770 
is starting to come through and you can
see<00:06:36.800> how<00:06:37.520> the<00:06:37.580> orange<00:06:38.090> we<00:06:38.330> starting<00:06:38.689> to

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
see how the orange we starting to

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.219 
see how the orange we starting to
overlay<00:06:39.289> on<00:06:39.590> top<00:06:39.650> of<00:06:40.580> where<00:06:40.879> that<00:06:41.780> kind<00:06:42.139> of

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:42.229 
overlay on top of where that kind of

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:45.760 
overlay on top of where that kind of
hint<00:06:42.530> of<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:43.310> purple<00:06:43.699> was<00:06:44.289> and<00:06:45.289> now<00:06:45.530> I'm<00:06:45.620> going

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
hint of the purple was and now I'm going

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.709 
hint of the purple was and now I'm going
to<00:06:45.830> go<00:06:45.919> back<00:06:46.159> to<00:06:46.460> that<00:06:46.580> keep<00:06:47.090> the<00:06:47.240> color<00:06:47.419> of<00:06:47.629> the

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:47.719 
to go back to that keep the color of the

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:51.909 
to go back to that keep the color of the
orange<00:06:49.389> right<00:06:50.389> there<00:06:50.719> so<00:06:51.409> that's<00:06:51.560> a<00:06:51.650> really

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
orange right there so that's a really

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.589 
orange right there so that's a really
interesting<00:06:51.949> way<00:06:52.610> that<00:06:52.639> you<00:06:53.060> can<00:06:53.210> actually

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 
interesting way that you can actually

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:56.529 
interesting way that you can actually
blend<00:06:53.949> two<00:06:54.949> opposite<00:06:55.490> colors<00:06:55.909> by<00:06:56.090> using<00:06:56.330> the

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
blend two opposite colors by using the

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:59.170 
blend two opposite colors by using the
overlay<00:06:56.900> of<00:06:57.020> the<00:06:57.169> clear<00:06:57.560> liquids<00:06:58.069> to<00:06:58.909> be<00:06:59.060> able

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
overlay of the clear liquids to be able

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.149 
overlay of the clear liquids to be able
to<00:06:59.360> create<00:06:59.599> that<00:06:59.750> blended<00:07:00.169> effect<00:07:00.469> so<00:07:00.680> kind<00:07:01.099> of

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:01.159 
to create that blended effect so kind of

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.529 
to create that blended effect so kind of
three<00:07:01.310> different<00:07:01.460> ways<00:07:01.669> we've<00:07:02.300> gone<00:07:02.479> through

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
three different ways we've gone through

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:06.730 
three different ways we've gone through
quick<00:07:03.169> recap<00:07:03.590> we<00:07:04.370> have<00:07:04.400> gone<00:07:05.289> with<00:07:06.289> the

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
quick recap we have gone with the

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.260 
quick recap we have gone with the
blending<00:07:07.099> from<00:07:07.189> absence<00:07:07.669> of<00:07:07.759> color<00:07:07.969> into

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
blending from absence of color into

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.390 
blending from absence of color into
color<00:07:08.629> on<00:07:08.779> the<00:07:08.870> base<00:07:09.050> and<00:07:09.379> absence<00:07:10.099> the<00:07:10.189> color

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
color on the base and absence the color

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.879 
color on the base and absence the color
into<00:07:10.669> color<00:07:10.879> on<00:07:11.060> the<00:07:11.150> overlay<00:07:11.680> then<00:07:12.680> what

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:12.889 
into color on the overlay then what

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:14.740 
into color on the overlay then what
we've<00:07:13.039> done<00:07:13.219> is<00:07:13.430> we've<00:07:13.639> gone<00:07:13.819> with<00:07:14.090> absence<00:07:14.629> of

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
we've done is we've gone with absence of

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.230 
we've done is we've gone with absence of
color<00:07:14.990> to<00:07:15.229> color<00:07:15.409> on<00:07:15.650> the<00:07:15.740> base<00:07:15.949> and<00:07:16.279> then<00:07:17.000> just

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
color to color on the base and then just

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.999
