00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.260
 A little blue skirt ... 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.980
 And a helmet with a propeller 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.240

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.880
 An additional skirt ... 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.620
 A wardrobe with wheels and hangers ... 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.680
 Have you noticed that it has a heart shape? 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.160
 It is ideal to travel! 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.300
 In the back it has a door 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.780
 It takes propellers in the nose ... 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.340

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.460

 Now I'm going to upload Pinkie Pie! 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.080
 Look, it has a hole in the foot to attach it to the helicopter 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.720
 See? 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.160
 I'm going to change the skirt 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.440
 This also fits very well! 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.160
 You are going to travel to the Magic Castle of the Rainbow 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.640
