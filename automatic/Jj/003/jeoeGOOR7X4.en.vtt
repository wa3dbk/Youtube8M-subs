00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.319 
do with Nash then let's go to what's
maybe<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.170> realistic<00:01:37.920> or<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> different

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
maybe more realistic or a different

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.410 
maybe more realistic or a different
scenario<00:01:39.630> which<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.380> Dallas<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.939> Dallas

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
scenario which would be Dallas so Dallas

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.999 
scenario which would be Dallas so Dallas
is<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.049> heard<00:01:43.290> Chris<00:01:43.560> report

for<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> start<00:02:19.290> you're<00:02:19.560> talking<00:02:19.890> way<00:02:20.130> down<00:02:20.340> here

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
for a start you're talking way down here

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.480 
for a start you're talking way down here
at<00:02:20.670> only<00:02:20.850> 64<00:02:21.480> million<00:02:21.920> that's<00:02:22.920> why<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.220> don't

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
at only 64 million that's why I don't

think he gives all this up he probably

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.110 
think he gives all this up he probably
goes<00:02:25.140> right<00:02:25.380> back<00:02:25.590> here<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.070> Knicks<00:02:26.280> it's

goes right back here to the Knicks it's
a<00:02:27.180> difference<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.600> 33<00:02:28.080> million<00:02:28.260> dollars<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.740> he

a difference of 33 million dollars if he

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.470 
a difference of 33 million dollars if he

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
joins another team and he still goes

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.570 
joins another team and he still goes
with<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> max<00:02:30.960> it's<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> big<00:02:31.830> difference<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.370> lot

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580
