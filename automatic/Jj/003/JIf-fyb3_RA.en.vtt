and then I tend to play three two and

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.510 
and then I tend to play three two and
one<00:04:34.780> again<00:04:35.110> here<00:04:35.410> you<00:04:35.800> could<00:04:36.040> just<00:04:36.070> play<00:04:36.400> the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
one again here you could just play the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.010 
one again here you could just play the
first<00:04:36.790> string<00:04:36.880> which<00:04:37.150> is<00:04:37.180> what<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.480> tab<00:04:37.720> says
