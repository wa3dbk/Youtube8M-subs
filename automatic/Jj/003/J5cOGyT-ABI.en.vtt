on<00:00:28.400> silicon<00:00:29.350> here<00:00:30.350> I've<00:00:30.710> already<00:00:31.130> cut<00:00:31.460> the

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
on silicon here I've already cut the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.569 
on silicon here I've already cut the
pieces<00:00:32.000> of<00:00:32.329> foam<00:00:32.570> core<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.380> now<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.040> can<00:00:34.370> see

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
pieces of foam core and now you can see

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.240 
pieces of foam core and now you can see
that<00:00:34.790> I've<00:00:34.910> hinged<00:00:35.360> them<00:00:35.690> by<00:00:36.350> just<00:00:36.620> going<00:00:36.860> and

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
that I've hinged them by just going and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.460 
that I've hinged them by just going and
folding<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.790> sides<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.540> now<00:00:38.600> I'll<00:00:38.900> tack<00:00:39.200> them

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
folding the sides and now I'll tack them

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.000 
folding the sides and now I'll tack them
down<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:41.300> then<00:00:42.110> hot<00:00:42.380> glue<00:00:42.410> them<00:00:42.890> into<00:00:43.070> place

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
down and then hot glue them into place

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.479 
down and then hot glue them into place
it's<00:00:46.010> an<00:00:46.220> ideal<00:00:46.610> of<00:00:46.820> construction<00:00:47.510> material

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
it's an ideal of construction material

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.460 
it's an ideal of construction material
here<00:00:49.489> I've<00:00:49.730> cut<00:00:50.060> the<00:00:50.270> foam<00:00:50.480> core<00:00:50.780> into<00:00:51.140> strips

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
here I've cut the foam core into strips

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.720 
here I've cut the foam core into strips
and<00:00:51.770> now<00:00:52.370> I've<00:00:52.700> measured<00:00:53.090> out<00:00:53.420> each<00:00:53.870> angle<00:00:54.470> of

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
and now I've measured out each angle of

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.380 
and now I've measured out each angle of
the<00:00:55.730> star<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.450> I'm<00:00:57.380> just<00:00:57.620> scoring<00:00:58.040> each<00:00:58.550> bolt

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
the star and I'm just scoring each bolt

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.680 
the star and I'm just scoring each bolt
that<00:00:59.840> I<00:00:59.870> will<00:01:00.230> make<00:01:00.410> with<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.920> foam<00:01:01.130> core

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
that I will make with the foam core

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.020 
that I will make with the foam core
saves<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.870> lot<00:01:03.020> of<00:01:03.079> time<00:01:03.200> in<00:01:03.590> the<00:01:03.680> long<00:01:03.890> run<00:01:04.159> and

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
saves a lot of time in the long run and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.870 
saves a lot of time in the long run and
I<00:01:05.180> can<00:01:05.360> just<00:01:05.570> glue<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.110> down<00:01:06.400> once<00:01:07.400> I'm<00:01:07.700> ready

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
I can just glue this down once I'm ready

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.899 
I can just glue this down once I'm ready
the<00:01:08.720> next<00:01:08.900> step<00:01:09.200> is<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.620> glue<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.340> sculpture

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
the next step is to glue the sculpture

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.840 
the next step is to glue the sculpture
to<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.210> foam<00:01:11.600> core<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:13.070> reason<00:01:13.430> why<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:13.610> want

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
to the foam core the reason why you want

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.560 
to the foam core the reason why you want
to<00:01:14.030> do<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:15.200> because<00:01:15.380> without<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.130> glue

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
to do this is because without the glue

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.080 
to do this is because without the glue
the<00:01:17.570> sculpture<00:01:18.080> will<00:01:18.260> float<00:01:18.619> upwards<00:01:19.220> after

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
the sculpture will float upwards after

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:28.660 
the sculpture will float upwards after
you<00:01:20.180> poured<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.659> silicon<00:01:21.290> down<00:01:27.369> let's<00:01:28.369> put

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
you poured the silicon down let's put

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.320 
you poured the silicon down let's put
that<00:01:28.850> foam<00:01:29.210> core<00:01:29.600> wall<00:01:29.869> down<00:01:30.200> now

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
that foam core wall down now

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.140 
that foam core wall down now
next<00:01:33.330> I<00:01:33.480> will<00:01:33.630> take<00:01:33.870> some<00:01:34.110> hot<00:01:34.320> glue<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.790> glue

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
next I will take some hot glue and glue

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.900 
next I will take some hot glue and glue
around<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.630> edge<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> box<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:38.550> make<00:01:38.730> sure

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
around the edge of the box to make sure

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.550 
around the edge of the box to make sure
that<00:01:39.090> there's<00:01:39.300> absolutely<00:01:39.810> no<00:01:40.110> leaks

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that there's absolutely no leaks

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.930 
that there's absolutely no leaks
possible<00:01:41.550> for<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.940> silicone<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.600> fine<00:01:42.900> I

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
possible for the silicone to fine I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.360 
possible for the silicone to fine I
marked<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:45.030> red<00:01:45.240> line<00:01:45.540> inside<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.380> box<00:01:46.620> so<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
marked a red line inside the box so that

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.210 
marked a red line inside the box so that
you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.730> see<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.960> where<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.620> intend

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you can see that that is where I intend

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.510 
you can see that that is where I intend
to<00:01:50.430> stop<00:01:50.820> pouring<00:01:51.270> my<00:01:51.540> silicone<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:53.340> will

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to stop pouring my silicone this will

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.510 
to stop pouring my silicone this will
add<00:01:53.700> about<00:01:54.000> 3/8<00:01:54.620> silicone<00:01:55.620> on<00:01:55.860> top<00:01:56.190> of<00:01:56.400> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
add about 3/8 silicone on top of the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.250 
add about 3/8 silicone on top of the
star<00:01:58.880> now<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:01:59.940> gonna<00:02:00.180> glue<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.780> final
