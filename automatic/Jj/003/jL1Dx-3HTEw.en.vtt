00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 Hi there, this is a review of the game far cry 3 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.830
 blood dragon 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.960
 no secret that ubisoft lately 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.120
 became very money-hungry company 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.800
 she rivets new assassins every year 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.780
 and the fact that the rivet is not every year with 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.340
 equally asassin and splinter cell 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.109
 will look like asasinov and watch dogs 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 will be similar to the assassins with headlights edge 3 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.970
 similar to asasinov but still to them 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 need more gold more gold bye 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.300
 didn't come the end of the year they needed 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.890
 somewhere somewhere to take more dough 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 they have already started releasing separate 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 episodes for assassin 3 which was called 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 tyranny george your three episodes they 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 all released call anyway need more 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.930
 where is the money where to get the money and here they are 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.730
 came up with they needed to take 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.219
 any game with his usual 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 mechanics to not have long 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.059
 develop so you can just 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 use what you already have and need 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.170
 it was to take some well, not an assassin 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.820
 because they have already released the same 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 the game was supposed to be not on disk 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.629
 because the clip drives are also very expensive 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.520
 it is necessary that it be cheaper 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.770
 download and would need two layers 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.620
 arcane caused layers of arquette restrictions 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.409
 on the weight of the game in two gigabytes so they 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.920
 took the edge edge as a basis but they decided 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 get rid of the hunt for zero no skins 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.100
 crafting some crafting bags 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.380
 Potions from pumping on the choice of the skills 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.180
 there you swing and you get and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 abilities of which they already have 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.200
 came up with the election and batch you have to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.939
 had to cut the island but set aside 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.640
 stupid side quests from the hunt 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.530
 killing the general they had to leave 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.970
 seizing bases make them smaller but 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.579
 more they needed to be reduced 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.290
 the number of weapons and most importantly need 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.360
 It was to get rid of all the commercials because 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.770
 that it takes a lot of weight because 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 instead of rollers you can just put 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.420
 pixel pictures with text 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.159
 but how to cheat the players like 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.350
 make them believe that 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.479
 must be and that is cool and they 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.729
 came up and they decided to give this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.009
 chopped off piece of shit for parody on 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.409
 modern shooters for let's say 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.329
 fiction of the 70s about the future where 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.009
 You can come up with a bunch of not funny jokes and 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.390
 say that this type is cool and should 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.650
 be and you player must from this 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.170
 rejoice and with 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.420
 since this game is about the future in 1007 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.850
 they add on will gnaw out the eye gamut and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.830
 dragons which is actually dinosaurs 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.050
 of course of course let the player suffer 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.210
 still say how cool this game is let him 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.920
 Let's sick sock something paddle here 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.320
 the real couple goes it's not cool bones 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.120
 I'm afraid ubisoft well done they are such moves yes 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.790
 yes yes yes come on money dude 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.920
 and the incorruptible quotes the press will deliver 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.810
 a lot of high marks and then it will be possible 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.610
 think they made us a continuation 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.860
 also such a cool formula we made this 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.230
 the game for a couple of months is just and made of 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.550
 so let's say out of shit and everyone is happy all 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.050
 pretty so let's do a sequel 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.880
 let's all be with them 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.790
 in general it will be great we will get more 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.740
 more gold damn it is ingeniously simple 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.560
 brilliantly 10 out of 10 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.570
 good lord 10 10 all this game of the year of masks 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.700
 masses play thank you all for your attention 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.010
 but actually everything is all 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.260
 very stripped down all tear out your eyes on and everything 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.180
 nasty all the same for the whole game 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.209
 literally three funny jokes only 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.300
 ninja turtles pro dinosaur who 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.790
 you expect spits and about the code word 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.010
 for an explosion of grenades, I honestly admire that 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.320
 they made such a call and issued it for 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.330
 sweetie because all aesthetic 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.610
 years I was taught the same thing that is 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.310
 on copies of others ideas make worse 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.959
 simpler but you yes it's a crap he hey 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.760
 project and everything will be cool i would even 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.709
 said I was taught to think so that is 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.400
 come up with projects like far cry 3 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.980
 blood dragon 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.780
 but objectively it is 6 bedrooms points out of 10 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.560
 Thank you all for your attention my name is 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.560
 Allen from bye
