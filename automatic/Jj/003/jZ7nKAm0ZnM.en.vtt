00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
okay well the werewolf seems better so I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
okay well the werewolf seems better so I
was<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.530> all<00:00:40.680> right<00:00:40.739> let's<00:00:41.010> use<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.219> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
was like all right let's use that and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.020 
was like all right let's use that and
then<00:00:42.500> spawned<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.010> gives<00:00:44.280> me<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> bullshit

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
then spawned in it gives me a bullshit

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.000 
then spawned in it gives me a bullshit
fucking<00:00:45.329> 84<00:00:46.020> which<00:00:46.530> basically<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.460> completely

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
fucking 84 which basically is completely

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.540 
fucking 84 which basically is completely
the<00:00:50.100> red<00:00:50.699> bar<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.719> energy<00:00:52.170> bar<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.589> i<00:00:53.129> call<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the red bar or energy bar when i call it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
the red bar or energy bar when i call it
doesn't<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.089> and<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:55.320> basically<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
doesn't go down and then basically you

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.829 
doesn't go down and then basically you
can<00:00:55.949> continuously<00:00:56.489> fire<00:00:56.850> until<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> point<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
can continuously fire until the point to

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.990 
can continuously fire until the point to
where<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.649> can't<00:00:58.890> fire<00:00:59.159> and<00:00:59.519> then<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.789> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
where you can't fire and then that's it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.549 
where you can't fire and then that's it
and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.359> until<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.780> die<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.019> can't<00:01:01.379> shoot

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and then until you die you can't shoot

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.010 
and then until you die you can't shoot
anymore<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.570> then<00:01:04.220> luckily<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:06.149> can<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
anymore and then luckily you can use the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.609 
anymore and then luckily you can use the
normal<00:01:07.380> home<00:01:08.690> it's<00:01:09.690> about<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.049> only<00:01:10.080> outside
