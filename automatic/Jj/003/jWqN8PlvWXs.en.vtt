00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to get it on current-gen because I know

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.660 
to get it on current-gen because I know
next<00:01:17.850> gen<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.390> better<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:20.280> didn't

know<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> could<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> code<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.380> get

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
know you could put the code in and get

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.960 
know you could put the code in and get
it<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.799> ten<00:01:23.009> dollars<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.520> didn't<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:23.939> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
then but I had my chance and I don't

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.609 
then but I had my chance and I don't
really<00:01:27.869> care<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.409> I'm<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.369> excited

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
really care because I'm not that excited

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.740 
really care because I'm not that excited
for<00:01:31.619> another<00:01:31.920> call<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.369> duty<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:32.970> honest<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
for another call of duty to be honest I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.499 
for another call of duty to be honest I
just<00:01:34.590> know<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.920> has<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.820> better<00:01:36.000> than<00:01:36.180> this

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
just know it has to be better than this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.050 
just know it has to be better than this
game<00:01:36.780> nothing<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.700> bad<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.960> game

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
game nothing can be as bad as this game

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.560 
game nothing can be as bad as this game
nothing<00:01:42.740> anyway<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.909> made<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> big

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
nothing anyway I think they made the big

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.499 
nothing anyway I think they made the big
maps<00:01:45.979> because<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.790> quick<00:01:48.030> scope<00:01:48.329> and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
maps because of the quick scope and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.740 
maps because of the quick scope and
being<00:01:48.780> taken<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.979> game<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.939> quick

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
being taken out of the game I know quick

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.020 
being taken out of the game I know quick
scoping<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> game<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.700> know

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
scoping is in the game right now I know

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.160 
scoping is in the game right now I know
the<00:01:54.390> spawns<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:55.170> bad<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:57.170> when

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the spawns are bad right now but when

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.270 
the spawns are bad right now but when
they<00:01:58.320> put<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> release<00:01:59.280> patch<00:01:59.759> for<00:02:00.149> download

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
they put the release patch for download

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.100 
they put the release patch for download
hopefully<00:02:02.280> quick<00:02:02.579> scoping<00:02:03.119> will<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.509> gone<00:02:03.750> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
hopefully quick scoping will be gone and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.459 
hopefully quick scoping will be gone and
then<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.159> fix<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> spawns<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.259> just

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
then they fix the spawns and I just

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.510 
then they fix the spawns and I just
rhymed<00:02:07.799> by<00:02:08.039> mistake<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.729> there

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
rhymed by mistake right there

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.160 
rhymed by mistake right there
but<00:02:10.120> my<00:02:10.270> overall<00:02:10.870> thoughts<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.560> goes<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:13.170> from

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
but my overall thoughts on goes on from

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.190 
but my overall thoughts on goes on from
what<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> played<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.400> played<00:02:15.520> two<00:02:16.270> maps<00:02:16.630> they

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
what I played I played two maps they

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.510 
what I played I played two maps they
both<00:02:17.680> were<00:02:17.890> big<00:02:18.450> hit<00:02:19.450> detection<00:02:19.690> was<00:02:20.520> perfect

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
both were big hit detection was perfect

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.300 
both were big hit detection was perfect
like<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.570> said<00:02:22.630> in<00:02:22.990> my<00:02:23.020> video<00:02:23.320> i<00:02:23.590> think<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.100> hit

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
like I said in my video i think the hit

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.880 
like I said in my video i think the hit
detection<00:02:24.490> is<00:02:25.030> gonna<00:02:25.210> be<00:02:25.450> modern<00:02:25.990> warfare<00:02:26.290> 2

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
detection is gonna be modern warfare 2

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.930 
detection is gonna be modern warfare 2
or<00:02:27.220> better<00:02:27.610> people<00:02:28.540> thought<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.780> was<00:02:28.900> crazy<00:02:29.260> I

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
or better people thought I was crazy I

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.020 
or better people thought I was crazy I
think<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.120> hit<00:02:31.330> detection<00:02:31.480> was<00:02:32.080> perfect<00:02:32.620> hi<00:02:33.400> I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
think the hit detection was perfect hi I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.410
