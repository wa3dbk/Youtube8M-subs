different<00:00:25.919> it's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.189> motion-detecting<00:00:26.779> door

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
different it's a motion-detecting door

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.839 
different it's a motion-detecting door
so<00:00:28.200> whenever<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.860> walk<00:00:29.040> by<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.520> doesn't

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
that does not affect the trap itself or

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.700 
that does not affect the trap itself or
not<00:00:50.220> trap<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:51.090> bad<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.840> motion<00:00:52.260> detecting

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
not trap my bad this motion detecting

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.800 
not trap my bad this motion detecting
door<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.250> we'll<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.730> again<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.600> works

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
door so we'll do it again and it works

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.380 
door so we'll do it again and it works
and<00:00:55.250> most<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.400> you<00:00:56.489> probably<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.970> how<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and most of you probably know how it

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270 
and most of you probably know how it
works<00:00:57.600> now<00:00:57.810> if<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.380> don't<00:00:58.590> let<00:00:58.950> me<00:00:59.010> go<00:00:59.130> ahead

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
works now if you don't let me go ahead

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.410 
works now if you don't let me go ahead
and<00:00:59.400> show<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.180> does<00:01:00.530> oops<00:01:01.550> okay<00:01:02.550> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and show you what it does oops okay so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.289 
and show you what it does oops okay so
this<00:01:03.690> works<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.140> simply<00:01:04.439> over<00:01:04.860> here

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
this works very simply over here

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.450 
this works very simply over here
obviously<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.659> walk<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:07.079> this<00:01:07.310> part<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
obviously when we walk by this part of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
obviously when we walk by this part of
the<00:01:08.520> door<00:01:08.880> thingy<00:01:09.149> we<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:10.850> this<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.810> whenever

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the door thingy we have this so whenever

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
the door thingy we have this so whenever
this<00:01:13.350> happens<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> block<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:14.640> which

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this happens we have a block here which

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.090 
this happens we have a block here which
keeps<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.539> door<00:01:15.659> closed<00:01:15.990> by<00:01:16.499> an<00:01:16.740> inverter

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
keeps the door closed by an inverter

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
keeps the door closed by an inverter
here<00:01:17.219> so<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.359> block<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.630> picked<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.079> when

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
here so when the block is picked up when

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
here so when the block is picked up when
you<00:01:19.350> walk<00:01:19.499> by<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.369> turns<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> door

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you walk by it turns on and the door

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.819 
you walk by it turns on and the door
opens<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.749> really<00:01:24.869> simple<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.499> easy

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
opens so it's really simple really easy

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.569 
opens so it's really simple really easy
the<00:01:26.549> doors<00:01:26.789> right<00:01:26.880> behind<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:28.340> right<00:01:29.340> there

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the doors right behind here right there

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.699 
the doors right behind here right there
and<00:01:31.310> this<00:01:32.310> comes<00:01:32.639> out<00:01:32.819> right<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.499> all

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
and this comes out right here so all

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:37.279 
and this comes out right here so all
this<00:01:34.829> button<00:01:35.130> does<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.899> shoots<00:01:36.899> a<00:01:37.020> redstone

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
this button does is it shoots a redstone

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.199 
this button does is it shoots a redstone
current<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:38.069> there<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.609> dispenser

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
current over there to the dispenser

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.019 
current over there to the dispenser
which<00:01:40.079> should<00:01:41.039> go<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.429> to<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.609> pressure<00:01:41.850> plate

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:42.029 
which should go on to the pressure plate

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.749 
which should go on to the pressure plate
yep<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.170> go<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.069> that's<00:01:44.219> why<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.429> built

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
yep there we go so that's why I built

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.529 
yep there we go so that's why I built
this<00:01:45.060> thing<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.749> keep<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.229> line<00:01:47.539> so

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
this thing here to keep it in line so

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.879 
this thing here to keep it in line so
whatever<00:01:48.749> we<00:01:48.959> just<00:01:49.170> come<00:01:49.319> over<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.560> we'll

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
whatever we just come over here we'll

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:51.320 
whatever we just come over here we'll
press<00:01:50.069> this<00:01:50.189> button<00:01:50.429> and

press this button and

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.510 
press this button and
it<00:01:51.690> works<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.230> charm<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:53.280> right<00:01:53.400> well

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
