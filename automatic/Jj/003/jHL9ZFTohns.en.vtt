00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
functionality of the box seems kind of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.080 
functionality of the box seems kind of
awkward<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.229> actually<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.619> cool

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the box has a sideways open flat so it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.990 
the box has a sideways open flat so it
doesn't<00:01:22.650> open<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.040> traditional<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.700> where

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000
