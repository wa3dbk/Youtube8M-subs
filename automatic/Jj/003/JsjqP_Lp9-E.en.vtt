00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello mtb friends but surely everyone 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 you are wondering how long I was going 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.460
 take specials in presenting your 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.740
 electric mountain well here the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.480
 you have turbo leggo with you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.279
 what happens I prefer that the present 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.070
 Miguel who apart from knowing her well has 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.500
 been testing the for time and so 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.110
 that here I leave you with the great design here 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.520
 I believe that the first thing that comes first 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.200
 appreciates on this bike is that it seems 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.170
 a real bicycle that is to say we have 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.700
 wanted to run away from the typical bicycle 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.910
 mountain bike with a visible engine 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.789
 hung up and do something own something very very 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.559
 ours and the first thing we did more than 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.840
 think about the engine was on the platform 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.879
 that we wanted to use and this year having 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.379
 the new stranger in pere ferrÃ© we wanted 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.300
 that was the perfect platform for 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.489
 put a motor and make a bike 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.809
 electric and even more with our wheels 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.079
 and static that provides a 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.989
 indescribable driving would tell you 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.629
 the engine that we use is a browser 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.939
 German manufacturing and what we wanted 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.619
 was to avoid resembling many other 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.659
 brands that what they do is a bicycle 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.700
 with a motor hanging here and a battery 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.200
 very voluminous and with this new frame 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.090
 of a strange process of reconstructing a 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.649
 aluminum m5 everything is very integrated and 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.080
 it looks like a real bicycle the 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.700
 battery goes in the diagonal tube 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.729
 absolutely hidden the engine goes 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.829
 clothed by this extruded m5 frame 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.090
 making a very compact and very 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.009
 stable because it has a center 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.159
 very low gravity and good has this 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.670
 Pure and hard mountain bike look 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.110
 another thing that we have done is eliminate 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.579
 buttons screens that can be 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.470
 susceptible to fall because it is a 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.780
 mountain bike really worth and is 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.299
 designed for any user of the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.579
 mountain bike is to say some have in 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.020
 mind that these bikes are apt 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.840
 for someone who is also so in 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.880
 way or maybe a little bit with a bit of 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.709
 overweight or an older guy and in 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.119
 absolute is for that audience but 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.610
 it's also for that other one who likes 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.799
 stick a ride get tired and 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.569
 say I have a battery left I'm going to do 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.189
 another rise to do it worked and 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.539
 for that audience is for which we have 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.940
 thought about removing all 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.849
 these additional controls one thing in addition 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.010
 good I think we have is that this 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.900
 bicycle you can download a 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.510
 application for two for your phone 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.489
 mobile in which you can regulate the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.290
 operating mode of the battery is 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.209
 say within modes that you handle 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.300
 also if you want from the eco box 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.160
 trail and turbo you can choose how you want 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.840
 ^ be very strong at the beginning at the end what 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.970
 you can even further you can say 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.620
 I want to go out three hours and guarantee 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.290
 and that in the end I have three hours of 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.720
 battery or I want to do 50 km and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.210
 guarantee me that I have 40 km of forgiveness 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.920
 40 percent battery at the end or 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.530
 even with our connection with 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.270
 was you can put your favorite route and 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.340
 I want to do this route is very easy 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.830
 to drive and arrive with an extra 40 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.570
 battery in case I want to do more and in that 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.910
 sense also that of non-duplicity 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.010
 of appliances here because if we had a 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.870
 great display plus you put a device 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.450
 to handle the extra goes that's not what 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.510
 what we want in terms of the engine as 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.030
 I said before is this browser but 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.940
 last evolution that we have done with 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.740
 they want to tell 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.870
 the modification that we have made 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.790
 battery allows us to use 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.710
 maximum engine is not about having 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.750
 much power that has it but of 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.490
 be able to use it because a power 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.260
 excessive or badly used is going to make you 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.810
 that in a trialera you leave the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 curves or that is almost already skids and what 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.500
 What we are looking for is someone who is like 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.950
 if you had a hand pushing you for the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.510
 back helping you make a rise not 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.200
 much more we will have eight models 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.180
 available three double suspension 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.460
 four rigid for where is a woman and 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.540
 a fal bike on a bad thing 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.170
 we have to wait for next spring 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.170
 to have it
