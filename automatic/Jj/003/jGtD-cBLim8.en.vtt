but uh we'll see how it is and since my

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.130 
but uh we'll see how it is and since my
computer<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.789> fixed<00:00:44.940> it'll<00:00:45.480> actually<00:00:45.719> render

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
computer is fixed it'll actually render

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.799 
computer is fixed it'll actually render
out<00:00:46.289> nicely<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.039> that's<00:00:47.280> good<00:00:47.489> um<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.480> got<00:00:48.629> some

out nicely so that's good um I got some

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
out nicely so that's good um I got some
gamma<00:00:49.140> labs<00:00:50.000> GPU<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> think<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.600> called<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.710> got

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
gamma labs GPU I think it's called I got

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.770 
gamma labs GPU I think it's called I got
the<00:00:53.640> free<00:00:53.820> sample<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> was<00:00:54.629> really

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the free sample of it and it was really

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.270 
the free sample of it and it was really
good<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.469> no<00:00:55.680> room<00:00:55.920> I'm<00:00:56.010> gonna<00:00:56.160> get

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
good so I was like no room I'm gonna get

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.750 
good so I was like no room I'm gonna get
some<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.940> uh<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.660> go<00:00:57.840> um<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.760> tried

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
some more so uh here we go um I tried

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.790 
some more so uh here we go um I tried
opening<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.180> box<00:01:00.449> earlier<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:01.109> i<00:01:01.379> think<00:01:01.770> i

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
opening the box earlier but i think i

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.139 
opening the box earlier but i think i
may<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> destroy<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> box<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.820> open<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
may have to destroy the box to open it

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.670 
may have to destroy the box to open it
