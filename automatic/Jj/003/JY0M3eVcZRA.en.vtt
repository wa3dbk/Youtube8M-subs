 how are you welcome to the course of 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:10.090
 basic computing my name is daniel 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.820
 gomez in this video you will learn how 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.780
 create a point of restoration in 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 windows 7 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.289
 you are about to install a program or 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.310
 computer driver 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:29.140
 you are going to make a system adjustment 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.840
 happened to modify the record 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.290
 I recommend that you first create a point 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.790
 of restoration because any of these 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.079
 tasks can bring results 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.840
 disastrous, something is always missing 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.760
 wrong and your computer no longer works well 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.760
 or become unstable 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.800
 restore points are a copy 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:05.610
 of the state configuration and registration of 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.610
 the computer at a certain time 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.590
 these points allow us to return to 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.290
 passed to a moment before doing 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.290
 changes that can cause us problems 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:26.929
 Next I will show you how to create a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.929

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.900

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.670

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.350

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.350
 press the create button 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.850
 here give a name to this point that you 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.910
 will help to identify it 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.510
 I'm going to use 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.510

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.230
 and then press the create button 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.660
 restoration point is being created 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.420
 this message tells us that the point of 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.920
 restoration was created correctly 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.920
 we can allow the close button 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.620
