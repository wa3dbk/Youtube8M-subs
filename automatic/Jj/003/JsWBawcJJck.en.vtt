00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
would be more Skyrim DLC on the way and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.490 
would be more Skyrim DLC on the way and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
then there's bethesda softworks which is

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.050 
then there's bethesda softworks which is
the<00:01:25.080> publisher<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.159> they<00:01:26.280> publish<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the publisher so they publish all the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
the publisher so they publish all the
games<00:01:27.689> developed<00:01:28.290> by<00:01:28.380> bethesda<00:01:28.920> game<00:01:29.070> studios

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
games developed by bethesda game studios

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.120 
games developed by bethesda game studios
and<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:29.790> they<00:01:29.939> also<00:01:30.090> publish<00:01:30.890> video<00:01:31.890> games

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and then they also publish video games

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.499 
and then they also publish video games
for<00:01:33.500> other<00:01:34.500> other<00:01:34.920> developers<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.180> guess

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
for other other developers so i guess

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.960 
for other other developers so i guess
examples<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.140> would<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.850> fallout<00:01:38.850> new

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
examples of that would be fallout new

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.990 
examples of that would be fallout new
vegas<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.540> was<00:01:39.810> made<00:01:40.590> by<00:01:41.000> obsidian

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
vegas which was made by obsidian

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.690 
vegas which was made by obsidian
entertainment<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.840> then<00:01:43.490> dishonored<00:01:44.490> which

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
entertainment and then dishonored which

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.080 
entertainment and then dishonored which

who's making that it's not the fez de
game<00:01:52.680> studios<00:01:53.070> though<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.549> published

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
game studios though it's just published

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
game studios though it's just published
by<00:01:54.210> Bethesda<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:56.070> confusing

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
by Bethesda and it's really confusing

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.270 
by Bethesda and it's really confusing
sometimes<00:01:57.170> because<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> fact<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.680> they

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
sometimes because of the fact that they

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
sometimes because of the fact that they
intentionally<00:01:59.729> don't<00:02:00.240> call<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.540> bethesda

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
intentionally don't call it bethesda

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.929 
intentionally don't call it bethesda
