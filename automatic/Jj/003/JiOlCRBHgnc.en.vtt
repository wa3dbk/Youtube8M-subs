now to turn the lights on you flip the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.180 
now to turn the lights on you flip the
switch<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.899> hit<00:00:51.899> twice<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> switching<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
switch I hit twice for the switching the

right guys my next invention i'm going

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.120 
right guys my next invention i'm going
to<00:01:25.860> show<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.700> auto<00:01:26.970> crop<00:01:27.390> Harvester

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
to show you is the auto crop Harvester

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.969 
to show you is the auto crop Harvester
this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> great<00:01:29.880> invention<00:01:30.979> sorry

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this is actually a great invention sorry

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.490 
this is actually a great invention sorry
about<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.369> squeak<00:01:33.020> now<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.380> add

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
about that little squeak now you can add

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890 
about that little squeak now you can add
this<00:01:34.650> longer<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.579> though<00:01:35.970> i<00:01:36.000> would<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.479> advise

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
this longer as though i would not advise

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.020 
this longer as though i would not advise
you<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> water<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.729> travel

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you to because the water will not travel

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.499 
you to because the water will not travel
all<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> way<00:01:39.509> down<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.189> do<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
all the way down to do this you just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
all the way down to do this you just
flip<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.290> switch<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.030> everything<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.149> go

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
flip the switch and everything will go

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.030 
flip the switch and everything will go
so<00:01:45.810> let's<00:01:45.960> see<00:01:46.229> switch<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:49.200> basically

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
so let's see switch and it basically

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.069 
so let's see switch and it basically
just<00:01:50.460> cuts<00:01:50.820> everything<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.810> gives

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
just cuts everything for you and gives

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.940 
just cuts everything for you and gives
you<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.890> wheat<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.119> seeds<00:01:54.360> back

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
you all the wheat and all the seeds back

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.560 
you all the wheat and all the seeds back
now<00:01:55.950> there's<00:01:56.159> nothing<00:01:56.579> wrong<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.420> doing

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
now there's nothing wrong with doing

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.649
