00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hi, everyone, I'm Argentinian Mr. 1999 and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.700
 today I bring you curiosities of mortal 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.440
 kombat part 2 I do it because I was made 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.340
 something short in the first but good 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.830
 let us begin 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.990
 in the arcade version of mortal kombat a 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.150
 reptile in the energy bar says 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.850
 scorpion but with the kind of fight of 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.460
 sub zero 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.980
 before being called mortal kombat the game 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.140
 originally it was going to be called committee and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.150
 then it was going to be called dragon attack and 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 after aclo and it was even going to be called 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 as the fatality technique but in the end 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.930
 steve rich and added the word deadly and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.900
 already written combat put him deadly 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.090
 kombat on stage the doors of the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.370
 palace you can observe icons of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 pacman in the upper arcs in turn 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.690
 the buddha statue that can be seen 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.850
 in the background it belonged to a neighbor of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.670
 one of the programmers who took it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.550
 borrowed to show it in the game 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.589
 when deadly came kombat 3 ran the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.629
 rumor that zaira csis hector were the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.149
 new forms of scorpion and sub zero 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.489
 sector could be the mac respectively 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.740
 in the first betas of mortal kombat 3 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.060
 both sa and box had other names 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.369
 identified as ketchup and mustard 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.510
 the character that ended up being called 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.060
 cabal and will be called zhang man 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.430
 johnny that and does not appear in this game and 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.170
 in ultimate mortal kombat 3 due to 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.720
 dismissal of the actor who represented him 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.670
 previously daniel pool so that 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.500
 was killed in the argument of the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.690
 history and his grave appears in the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.390
 scenario the cemetery the same fate 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.070
 ran temporarily carlos pool by 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.740
 that same raiden shines by its absence 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.810
 until mortal kombat the trilogy this 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.610
 forced that there were no girls of 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.250
 fact is the first title without girls 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.320
 except sub 0 that this time not 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.409
 hide your face 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.659
 tania was not originally in mk4 in 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.850
 their place was chitana and milena but 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.860
 evo or company should have thought that 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.410
 there were too many characters from another 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.229
 I fall mk4 and modified them in such 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.360
 so they created tania in the end so much 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.340
 Quitana as Milena were included 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.410
 in mk gold 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.599
 there are several theories about staples 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.790
 horizontals that seems to have here 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.280
 of mk bold in his body there are some that 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.349
 they say that one side made slices in mk2 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.540
 with that famous fatality in which 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.700
 split vertically to his adversary with 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.440
 his hat on the other hand there are those who 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.989
 says that if we go on his biography 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.090
 for here he never died so those 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.220
 staples would be only extensions 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.530
 Bones of your body 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.750
 you have probably heard of 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.330
 bellocq at first was going to debut in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.460
 mortal kombat goal and there are even images 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.040
 but he did not have time to finish it and 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.379
 it was finally deleted 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.170
 have you ever wondered about the 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.480
 race of zaira that then in its end in mk 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.330
 bold appears without a mask showing that 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.610
 It is black skin 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.680
 mortal kombat ago Adli there is the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.690
 only deadly kombat in which you can 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.790
 pay for weapons or most of them 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.890
 he is also the first mortal kombat in 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.080
 that opponents and scenarios are 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.210
 are bloodstained clothes 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.400
 the fighters are torn and there are environments 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.260
 destructible and is also the only mortal 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.950
 kombat in which you can not appear 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.230
 since the beginning of the game dies 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.569
 the heads buried in the peaks of 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.380
 stage the pit are the heads of the 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.960
 programmers 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.210
 I 'm the one of the developers of 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.980
 the bear saga disguised as a guard 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.400
 samsung to be included in the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.200
 scenario the court originally the 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.030
 game was going to be a video game of 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.310
 shots in the first person and at 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.470
 face certain enemies in 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.690
 melee combat would change the 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.600
 view and the gameplay becoming 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.850
 in a fighting game the name is not 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.950
 there are boats the inverse of the surnames of 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.020
 the creators of the bond and jon saga 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.270
