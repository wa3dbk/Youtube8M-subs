00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.190 
play that might been a first out I was
better<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.630> scrambling<00:01:55.020> with<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
better with scrambling with the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.389 
better with scrambling with the

quarterback instead we just run out of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.609 
quarterback instead we just run out of
bounds<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.149> third<00:01:57.420> down<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:58.140> gonna<00:01:58.229> hit

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
bounds but on third down I'm gonna hit

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.709 
bounds but on third down I'm gonna hit
you<00:01:58.770> out<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.040> Alban<00:01:59.640> not<00:02:00.090> always<00:02:00.329> he's<00:02:00.479> six

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
you out like Alban not always he's six

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.300 
you out like Alban not always he's six
five<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.110> he's<00:02:01.200> got<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.380> hundred<00:02:01.979> speed

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
five but he's got that hundred speed

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.090 
five but he's got that hundred speed
high<00:02:02.960> acceleration<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.560> he<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.740> gets

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
high acceleration you know he just gets

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.260 
high acceleration you know he just gets
that<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.310> hitch<00:02:05.520> around<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.000> takes

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
that little hitch around you just takes

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.059 
that little hitch around you just takes
off<00:02:06.630> down<00:02:06.899> feel<00:02:07.110> good<00:02:07.350> walk<00:02:07.560> getting<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> hand

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069

on<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
on that

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.740 
on that
and<00:02:08.849> that's<00:02:08.969> gonna<00:02:09.119> give<00:02:09.329> us<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.539> touchdown

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750

wide<00:03:47.430> open<00:03:47.699> touchdown<00:03:47.819> there<00:03:48.239> though<00:03:48.569> that

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
wide open touchdown there though that

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.210 
wide open touchdown there though that
was<00:03:48.840> due<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.229> offensive<00:03:49.650> lineman<00:03:49.919> he<00:03:50.009> sent

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
was due to the offensive lineman he sent

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.159 
was due to the offensive lineman he sent
a<00:03:50.280> five-man<00:03:50.729> blitz<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.329> it<00:03:51.689> was<00:03:51.870> just<00:03:51.959> not

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
a five-man blitz but it was just not

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.710 
a five-man blitz but it was just not
coming<00:03:52.439> through<00:03:52.680> there<00:03:52.919> in<00:03:53.209> blue<00:03:54.209> coverage

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
coming through there in blue coverage

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.990 
coming through there in blue coverage
that<00:03:54.810> allows<00:03:55.109> Bo<00:03:55.560> Jackson<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.099> get<00:03:56.220> wide<00:03:56.639> open

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
that allows Bo Jackson to get wide open

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.039 
that allows Bo Jackson to get wide open
there<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.299> Calvin<00:03:57.689> was<00:03:57.810> streaking

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
there I think Calvin was streaking

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.689 
there I think Calvin was streaking
downfield<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.769> couple<00:03:59.159> of<00:03:59.220> people<00:03:59.489> we<00:03:59.579> end
