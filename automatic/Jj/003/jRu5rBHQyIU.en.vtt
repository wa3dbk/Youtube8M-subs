it will look like when you're done like
that<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:44.510> harden<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.629> inside<00:00:46.219> squishy<00:00:47.219> on

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that and harden the inside squishy on

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.790 
that and harden the inside squishy on
the<00:00:47.579> outside<00:00:48.140> just<00:00:49.140> why<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.350> want<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.710> for

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the outside just why you want it for

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.860 
the outside just why you want it for
when<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.190> crawling<00:00:50.430> as<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.570> see<00:00:51.750> it's

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
when you're crawling as you can see it's

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
when you're crawling as you can see it's
kind<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> diagonal<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:53.039> good<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
kind of diagonal it's good so you get a

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.270 
kind of diagonal it's good so you get a
good<00:00:54.600> tread<00:00:54.960> pattern<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> inside<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
good tread pattern on the inside and you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
good tread pattern on the inside and you
can<00:00:56.399> wear<00:00:56.789> down<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.059> treads<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> inside

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
can wear down the treads on the inside

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.889 
can wear down the treads on the inside
then<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.710> flip<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> tire<00:00:59.600> over<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.840> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
then they can flip the tire over and you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
then they can flip the tire over and you
can<00:01:00.960> wear<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.920> treads<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.820> when

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
can wear down these treads so when

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.579 
can wear down these treads so when
you're<00:01:03.210> done<00:01:03.390> wiring<00:01:03.660> down<00:01:03.899> these<00:01:04.080> inside

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you're done wiring down these inside

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.460 
you're done wiring down these inside
ones<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> can<00:01:05.760> switch<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.350> i'm

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
