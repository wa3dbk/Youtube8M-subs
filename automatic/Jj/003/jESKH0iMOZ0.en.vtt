then get to the back okay then so here
at<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.380> very<00:00:41.530> very<00:00:41.800> front<00:00:42.040> is<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:45.450> basically

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
at the very very front is the basically

there's always an mermaids at the front
of<00:00:50.770> ships<00:00:51.070> and<00:00:51.430> that's<00:00:51.810> skeleton<00:00:52.810> one<00:00:53.250> then

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
of ships and that's skeleton one then

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.460 
of ships and that's skeleton one then
you<00:00:54.430> go<00:00:54.550> back<00:00:54.790> here<00:00:55.330> and<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:59.170> there's<00:00:59.410> a

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
you go back here and here there's a

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:11.960 
you go back here and here there's a

little basket okay little basket and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.130 
little basket okay little basket and
basically<00:01:12.970> when<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.330> take<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:13.750> black<00:01:14.110> thing

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
basically when you take this black thing

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:23.520 
basically when you take this black thing
off<00:01:15.420> inside<00:01:16.420> here<00:01:16.659> is<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.229> key<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:22.530> first

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
off inside here is the key to the first

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.969 
off inside here is the key to the first
chest<00:01:23.909> which<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:25.479> shall<00:01:25.990> show<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.229> where<00:01:26.860> that

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
chest which I shall show you where that

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:36.930 
chest which I shall show you where that
it's<00:01:27.190> Theta<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:34.390> there's<00:01:34.870> some<00:01:35.940> skeleton

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
it's Theta then there's some skeleton

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.250 
it's Theta then there's some skeleton
heads<00:01:37.500> holding<00:01:38.500> chains<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.900> holding<00:01:44.229> the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
heads holding chains is to holding the

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.090 
heads holding chains is to holding the
chains<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:45.460> think<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.820> are<00:01:45.909> critical

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
chains and I think that are critical

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.280 
chains and I think that are critical
quite<00:01:48.100> like<00:01:48.280> it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
quite like it

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.440 
quite like it
then<00:01:50.740> there's<00:01:50.979> basically<00:01:51.369> like<00:01:51.670> kind<00:01:52.150> of<00:01:52.270> like

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
then there's basically like kind of like

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.710 
then there's basically like kind of like
this<00:01:52.659> skeleton<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.700> dry<00:01:54.940> enormous<00:01:55.450> bones

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
this skeleton really dry enormous bones

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.950 
this skeleton really dry enormous bones
I<00:01:56.080> don't<00:01:56.890> know<00:01:57.310> what<00:01:57.400> they<00:01:57.610> they<00:01:58.360> are<00:01:58.540> but<00:01:58.780> it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
I don't know what they they are but it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.160 
I don't know what they they are but it
makes<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.320> look<00:01:59.409> cool<00:01:59.650> I<00:01:59.680> think<00:02:00.659> then<00:02:01.659> there<00:02:02.020> is

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
makes it look cool I think then there is

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.950 
makes it look cool I think then there is
the<00:02:02.320> mast<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.880> pirate

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
the mast that is the pirate

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.010 
the mast that is the pirate
 by<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.470> way<00:02:12.040> all<00:02:13.040> right<00:02:13.100> then<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.420> I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
 by the way all right then here I

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.960 
 by the way all right then here I
think<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:15.980> where<00:02:16.190> they<00:02:16.370> pulled<00:02:16.819> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
think this is where they pulled the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.240 
think this is where they pulled the
ankle<00:02:17.480> where<00:02:18.350> they<00:02:18.470> pull<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.770> up<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.100> down

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
ankle where they pull it up and down

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.460 
ankle where they pull it up and down
from<00:02:20.260> or<00:02:21.260> near<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.620> can't<00:02:21.830> spin<00:02:23.470> then

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
from or near that can't spin then

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.690 
from or near that can't spin then
there's<00:02:24.770> some<00:02:25.010> other<00:02:25.360> Sicilian<00:02:26.360> heads<00:02:27.700> then

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
there's some other Sicilian heads then

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.670 
there's some other Sicilian heads then
there<00:02:29.330> are<00:02:29.390> some<00:02:29.540> stairs<00:02:29.840> leading<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
there are some stairs leading up to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.810 
there are some stairs leading up to
where<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.220> drive<00:02:31.520> this<00:02:33.700> there<00:02:34.700> are

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
where you drive this there are

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.620 
where you drive this there are
quite<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> lot<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.360> skeletons<00:02:35.570> there<00:02:37.630> basically

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
quite a lot of skeletons there basically

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.560 
quite a lot of skeletons there basically
it's<00:02:38.840> kind<00:02:39.080> of<00:02:39.230> shielding<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:39.890> area<00:02:40.570> there's

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
it's kind of shielding that area there's

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:49.660 
it's kind of shielding that area there's
a<00:02:41.660> little<00:02:41.900> mouse<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:47.709> is<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:49.100> steering

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
a little mouse and that is the steering

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.580 
a little mouse and that is the steering
wheel<00:02:49.970> or<00:02:50.330> ever<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.840> want<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.080> call<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.380> at<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
wheel or ever you want to call it at the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.509 
wheel or ever you want to call it at the
ship<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.810> at<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.080> back<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.920> very<00:02:55.070> very<00:02:55.280> back

right then now you can see over here

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.820 
right then now you can see over here
underneath<00:03:07.280> these<00:03:07.640> days<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.150> not<00:03:08.360> underneath

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
underneath these days of not underneath

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.640 
underneath these days of not underneath
that<00:03:09.830> side<00:03:10.130> there<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.390> a<00:03:11.810> door<00:03:12.019> leading<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.530> the
