mean it was released last year but it
was<00:01:43.350> basically<00:01:43.560> top<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.279> the<00:01:44.340> pack<00:01:44.520> when<00:01:44.759> it

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
was basically top of the pack when it

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.029 
was basically top of the pack when it
was<00:01:45.060> having<00:01:45.779> said<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.109> outdoor<00:01:46.619> shots<00:01:46.859> have

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
was having said that outdoor shots have

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.379 
was having said that outdoor shots have
always<00:01:47.219> been<00:01:47.459> a<00:01:47.520> challenge<00:01:47.789> for<00:01:48.029> mobile

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
always been a challenge for mobile

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.719 
always been a challenge for mobile
devices<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.319> no<00:01:49.469> exception<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.579> can

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.279 
devices and this is no exception you can
see<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> colors<00:01:51.719> are<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:51.869> looking<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
see that the colors are just looking a

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.199 
see that the colors are just looking a
little<00:01:52.439> bit<00:01:52.679> washed<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.819> background

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
little bit washed out and the background

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.090 
little bit washed out and the background
the<00:01:54.359> sky<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.689> very<00:01:55.020> overexposed

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the sky is very overexposed

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.160 
the sky is very overexposed
so<00:01:56.639> anyways<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.149> actually<00:01:57.420> install<00:01:57.749> the<00:01:57.959> phone

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
so anyways to actually install the phone

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.319 
so anyways to actually install the phone
into<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.679> mount<00:01:58.889> you<00:01:59.310> simply<00:01:59.670> slide<00:01:59.939> open<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
into the mount you simply slide open the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.480 
into the mount you simply slide open the
bracket<00:02:00.719> slip<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.319> phone<00:02:01.529> in<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> you're

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
bracket slip the phone in and you're

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.699 
bracket slip the phone in and you're
good<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> go<00:02:02.849> where<00:02:03.779> any<00:02:03.899> slight<00:02:04.170> complaint<00:02:04.590> is

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
good to go where any slight complaint is

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.529 
good to go where any slight complaint is
that<00:02:04.859> my<00:02:05.009> phone<00:02:05.159> has<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> camera<00:02:05.490> button<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
that my phone has a camera button and

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.449 
that my phone has a camera button and
occasionally<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.469> mount<00:02:07.649> would<00:02:07.829> just<00:02:08.220> keep

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
occasionally the mount would just keep

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.280 
occasionally the mount would just keep
pressing<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.060> continuously<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.020> ended<00:02:10.259> up

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
pressing it continuously so I ended up

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.950 
pressing it continuously so I ended up
taking<00:02:10.470> about<00:02:10.740> 40<00:02:11.160> photos<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.790> my<00:02:12.000> table<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.750> is

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
taking about 40 photos of my table it is

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.390 
taking about 40 photos of my table it is
a<00:02:12.990> nice<00:02:13.230> table<00:02:13.500> but

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
a nice table but

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.309 
a nice table but
one's<00:02:14.670> enough<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.360> default<00:02:15.689> lens<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.140> is

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
one's enough the default lens here is

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.500 
one's enough the default lens here is
the<00:02:16.650> wide-angle<00:02:16.950> lens<00:02:17.489> which<00:02:17.700> uses<00:02:18.090> Japanese

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the wide-angle lens which uses Japanese

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.479 
the wide-angle lens which uses Japanese
optics<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.230> actually<00:02:19.500> increase<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:20.099> field<00:02:20.310> of

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
optics to actually increase the field of

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.160 
optics to actually increase the field of
view<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.939> I'll<00:02:21.329> be<00:02:21.420> using<00:02:21.689> that<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.049> my

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
view and I'll be using that for my

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.710 
view and I'll be using that for my
initial<00:02:22.530> shots<00:02:22.849> so<00:02:23.849> as<00:02:23.909> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.090> see<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.450> use

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
initial shots so as you can see in use

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.360 
initial shots so as you can see in use
the<00:02:25.110> actual<00:02:25.230> mount<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.829> the<00:02:25.860> phone<00:02:26.099> attached

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the actual mount with the phone attached

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.880 
the actual mount with the phone attached
looks<00:02:26.760> really<00:02:27.269> badass<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.079> super<00:02:28.590> cool<00:02:28.739> to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
looks really badass it is super cool to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.140 
looks really badass it is super cool to
look<00:02:29.010> at<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> first<00:02:29.670> thing<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:30.000> notice

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
look at and the first thing you notice

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.030 
look at and the first thing you notice
is<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.540> there's<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.900> ton<00:02:31.200> more<00:02:31.260> light<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
is that there's a ton more light in the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.530 
is that there's a ton more light in the
photo<00:02:32.250> which<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:32.609> great<00:02:33.329> for<00:02:33.420> actually

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
photo which is great for actually

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.390 
photo which is great for actually
illuminating<00:02:34.290> your<00:02:34.409> subject<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.040> capturing

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
illuminating your subject and capturing

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.910 
illuminating your subject and capturing
a<00:02:35.489> little<00:02:35.700> bit<00:02:35.819> more<00:02:35.970> detail<00:02:36.450> also<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.620> can

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
a little bit more detail also you can

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.410 
a little bit more detail also you can
see<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.069> tension<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.760> really<00:02:38.970> brought<00:02:39.239> to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
see that tension is really brought to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.880 
see that tension is really brought to
the<00:02:39.510> center<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.959> photo<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> edges

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the center of the photo with the edges

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.099 
the center of the photo with the edges
getting<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.549> sort<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.879> little<00:02:42.659> bit<00:02:42.750> strange

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
getting this sort of little bit strange

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.349 
getting this sort of little bit strange
blur<00:02:43.500> effect<00:02:43.980> now<00:02:44.609> let's<00:02:44.790> move<00:02:44.970> on<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
blur effect now let's move on to the

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.940 
blur effect now let's move on to the
micro<00:02:45.750> lens<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.470> where<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.769> device

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
micro lens and this is where the device

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.550 
micro lens and this is where the device
really<00:02:47.340> shines<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.569> initially<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.200> vivo<00:02:49.440> aqui

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
really shines so initially the vivo aqui

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.930 
really shines so initially the vivo aqui
shot<00:02:49.829> can<00:02:49.980> actually<00:02:50.250> capture<00:02:50.400> some<00:02:50.730> pretty

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
shot can actually capture some pretty

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.430 
shot can actually capture some pretty
nice<00:02:51.180> macro<00:02:51.659> image<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.139> can<00:02:52.260> see<00:02:52.349> I'm

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
nice macro image as you can see I'm

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.500 
nice macro image as you can see I'm
already<00:02:52.620> close<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.250> object<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:54.239> attaching

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
already close to the object be attaching

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.270 
already close to the object be attaching
the<00:02:54.750> lens<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.319> see<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.620> we're<00:02:55.709> now<00:02:55.859> two

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
the lens you can see that we're now two

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.759 
the lens you can see that we're now two
to<00:02:56.549> three<00:02:56.760> times<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.299> close<00:02:57.599> there's<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.379> huge

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
to three times as close there's a huge

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.559 
to three times as close there's a huge
difference<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.459> macro<00:02:59.819> shot<00:03:00.000> instantly

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
difference and macro shot instantly

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.360 
difference and macro shot instantly
become<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:01.859> something<00:03:02.189> quite

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
become really something quite

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.849 
become really something quite
spectacular<00:03:02.720> Jing<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> lens<00:03:04.079> mount<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.739> a

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
spectacular Jing the lens mount and a

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.319 
spectacular Jing the lens mount and a
different<00:03:05.189> coloured<00:03:05.459> lens<00:03:05.639> this<00:03:06.030> really

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
different coloured lens this really

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.059 
different coloured lens this really
starts<00:03:06.599> to<00:03:06.689> look<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.049> pro<00:03:07.560> piece<00:03:07.859> of

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
starts to look like a pro piece of

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.640 
starts to look like a pro piece of
technology<00:03:08.639> then<00:03:09.569> again<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.989> wasn't<00:03:10.439> exactly

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
technology then again I wasn't exactly

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.140 
technology then again I wasn't exactly
particularly<00:03:11.250> impressed<00:03:11.579> with<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.879> you<00:03:12.000> can

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
particularly impressed with it you can

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.030 
particularly impressed with it you can
see<00:03:12.299> that<00:03:12.480> there<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.900> slight<00:03:13.319> blue<00:03:13.590> tint<00:03:13.889> to

see that there is a slight blue tint to

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.349 
see that there is a slight blue tint to
the<00:03:14.129> top<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.459> photos<00:03:14.819> but<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.120> doesn't

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
the top of the photos but it doesn't

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.449 
the top of the photos but it doesn't
really<00:03:15.569> change<00:03:15.959> much<00:03:16.170> at<00:03:16.349> all<00:03:16.590> something<00:03:17.400> I

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
really change much at all something I

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.220 
really change much at all something I
found<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.760> little<00:03:17.909> bit<00:03:18.000> tricky<00:03:18.449> is<00:03:18.629> that<00:03:18.660> while

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
found a little bit tricky is that while

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.780 
found a little bit tricky is that while
normal<00:03:19.620> usage<00:03:19.949> of<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.160> Android<00:03:20.430> phone<00:03:20.639> is

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
normal usage of the Android phone is

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.430 
normal usage of the Android phone is
pretty<00:03:21.030> much<00:03:21.209> unchanged<00:03:21.840> some<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.379> the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
pretty much unchanged some of the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.110 
pretty much unchanged some of the
buttons<00:03:22.739> can<00:03:22.889> be<00:03:23.040> tricky<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.489> access<00:03:23.879> and<00:03:24.060> this

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
buttons can be tricky to access and this

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.759 
buttons can be tricky to access and this
is<00:03:24.239> especially<00:03:24.389> annoying<00:03:24.900> when<00:03:25.560> for<00:03:25.739> example

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
is especially annoying when for example

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.710 
is especially annoying when for example
you<00:03:26.190> use<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.489> volume<00:03:26.669> button<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.209> zoom<00:03:27.419> in<00:03:27.599> and

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
you use the volume button to zoom in and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.030 
you use the volume button to zoom in and
out<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.109> camera<00:03:28.500> which<00:03:28.739> is<00:03:28.859> what<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
out in the camera which is what I

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.409 
out in the camera which is what I
normally<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.730> although<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.299> image

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
normally do and although the image

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.300 
normally do and although the image
quality<00:03:30.629> is<00:03:30.930> improved<00:03:31.409> by<00:03:31.620> using<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:32.040> setup

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
quality is improved by using this setup

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.189 
quality is improved by using this setup
it's<00:03:32.970> not<00:03:33.180> really<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.480> main<00:03:33.629> selling<00:03:33.900> point

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
it's not really the main selling point

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.589 
it's not really the main selling point
of<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.440> kit<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.459> idea<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.970> basically<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.359> give

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
of the kit the idea is basically to give

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.449 
of the kit the idea is basically to give
you<00:03:36.720> much<00:03:36.870> more<00:03:37.079> flexibility<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.129> filmmaker

you much more flexibility as a filmmaker

before you take the plunge first of all
you've<00:03:59.310> got<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.549> make<00:03:59.639> sure<00:03:59.819> that<00:03:59.970> your

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
are your picture quality will be poor

are your picture quality will be poor
also<00:04:12.540> it's<00:04:12.989> worth<00:04:13.169> just<00:04:13.199> remembering<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:13.979> a

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
also it's worth just remembering that a

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.619 
also it's worth just remembering that a
lot<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.430> effects<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:14.849> can<00:04:14.940> create<00:04:15.239> using

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
lot of the effects you can create using

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.390 
lot of the effects you can create using
manual<00:04:15.810> controls<00:04:16.380> such<00:04:16.650> as<00:04:16.680> these<00:04:16.949> actual

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
manual controls such as these actual

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.909 
manual controls such as these actual
filters<00:04:17.820> can<00:04:18.389> be<00:04:18.570> replicated<00:04:18.780> with<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.530> similar

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
filters can be replicated with a similar

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.159 
filters can be replicated with a similar
effect<00:04:20.190> using<00:04:20.609> most<00:04:20.789> software<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.449> phones<00:04:21.959> and

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
effect using most software in phones and

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.290 
effect using most software in phones and
tablets<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.190> for<00:04:23.370> those<00:04:23.460> kind<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.820> users<00:04:24.180> who

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
tablets so for those kind of users who

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.610 
tablets so for those kind of users who
would<00:04:24.419> do<00:04:24.599> that<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:25.080> know<00:04:25.139> people<00:04:25.409> who<00:04:25.469> want

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
would do that you know people who want

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.050 
would do that you know people who want
to<00:04:25.680> post<00:04:25.889> on<00:04:26.039> Instagram<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.729> that<00:04:26.820> kind<00:04:27.029> of

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
to post on Instagram and that kind of

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.629 
to post on Instagram and that kind of
thing

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
thing

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.279 
thing
I<00:04:27.669> think<00:04:28.000> this<00:04:28.240> is<00:04:28.389> a<00:04:28.419> little<00:04:28.750> bit<00:04:28.900> overkill

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
I think this is a little bit overkill

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.420 
I think this is a little bit overkill
but<00:04:29.500> for<00:04:29.680> those<00:04:29.770> people<00:04:30.039> who<00:04:30.129> are<00:04:30.189> really

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
but for those people who are really

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.860 
but for those people who are really
passionate<00:04:30.639> about<00:04:30.939> their<00:04:31.180> photography<00:04:31.719> and

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
passionate about their photography and

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.020 
passionate about their photography and
videography<00:04:32.110> this<00:04:32.949> is<00:04:33.069> a<00:04:33.099> great<00:04:33.490> piece<00:04:33.699> of<00:04:33.729> kit

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
videography this is a great piece of kit
