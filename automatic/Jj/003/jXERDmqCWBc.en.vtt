00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
assuming that out of all the maps that's

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
assuming that out of all the maps that's
the<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.160> definitely<00:00:32.369> doesn't<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:33.000> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the one that definitely doesn't have it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
but I'm going to go back and go through

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.250 
but I'm going to go back and go through
every<00:00:35.430> single<00:00:35.670> map<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.239> look<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.809> each<00:00:36.960> one

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
every single map and look for each one

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.160 
every single map and look for each one
and<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> video<00:00:38.010> once<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.610> all<00:00:38.899> all<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
where to find them and stuff like that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290 
where to find them and stuff like that
and<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:46.860> maybe<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.430> has<00:00:47.670> something<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and see if maybe this has something to

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.850 
and see if maybe this has something to
do<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.780> storyline<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.649> maybe

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
do with the storyline see if maybe

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.740 
do with the storyline see if maybe
they're<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.190> going<00:00:51.059> backwards<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
they're in going backwards and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.450 
they're in going backwards and
reintegrating<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.649> into<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> storyline

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
reintegrating it into the storyline

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
reintegrating it into the storyline
somehow<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.300> if<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.840> affects<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.289> storyline

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
somehow and if it affects the storyline

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.389 
somehow and if it affects the storyline
in<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.039> way<00:00:56.600> probably<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.980> they<00:00:58.980> probably

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
in some way probably not they probably

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.849 
in some way probably not they probably
just<00:00:59.699> put<00:01:00.420> mule<00:01:00.690> kick<00:01:00.989> into<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.620> maps

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
just put mule kick into all the maps

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
just put mule kick into all the maps
because<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.579> pretty<00:01:02.969> neat<00:01:03.180> perk<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.719> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
because it's a pretty neat perk it's a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
because it's a pretty neat perk it's a
it's<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> pretty<00:01:04.680> fun<00:01:04.920> perk<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> now<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's a pretty fun perk and now that the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.420 
it's a pretty fun perk and now that the
series<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.420> over<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> done<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:08.070> wanted

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430

series is over and done with they wanted
to<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.640> people<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.210> back<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.450> play<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
to get people to go back and play the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.260 
to get people to go back and play the
old<00:01:10.049> maps<00:01:10.350> again<00:01:10.580> that's<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.790> guess<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:12.240> least

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
old maps again that's my guess at least

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.850 
old maps again that's my guess at least
anyway<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.080> figure<00:01:13.320> why<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.530> give

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
anyway so to figure why not give

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.820 
anyway so to figure why not give
everybody<00:01:14.130> three<00:01:14.700> guns<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.590> just<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:16.710> with

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
everybody three guns now just like with

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.270 
everybody three guns now just like with
mule<00:01:17.040> kick<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> big<00:01:18.299> question<00:01:18.659> is

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
mule kick because the big question is

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.200 
mule kick because the big question is
obviously<00:01:20.280> we're<00:01:20.460> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.790> zombies

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
obviously we're going to see zombies

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
obviously we're going to see zombies
again<00:01:21.650> next<00:01:22.650> year<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> new<00:01:23.340> Call<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
again next year when the new Call of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.920 
again next year when the new Call of
Duty<00:01:23.909> comes<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:24.450> when<00:01:24.570> they<00:01:24.689> come<00:01:24.840> out

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
Duty comes out or when they come out

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
Duty comes out or when they come out
with<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> call<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.530> duty<00:01:25.740> zombies<00:01:25.770> by<00:01:26.280> itself

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
with the call of duty zombies by itself

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.660 
with the call of duty zombies by itself
but<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.810> big<00:01:28.049> question<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.500> Curt's<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:29.400> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
but my big question is Curt's are the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
but my big question is Curt's are the
perps<00:01:29.939> gonna<00:01:30.180> make<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> comeback<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.079> mean<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
perps gonna make a comeback I mean it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.679 
perps gonna make a comeback I mean it
seems<00:01:31.890> unlikely<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.579> juggernog<00:01:33.299> would<00:01:33.540> not

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
seems unlikely that juggernog would not

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.810 
seems unlikely that juggernog would not
make<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> back<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:35.520> such<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
make it back just because it's such a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.440 
make it back just because it's such a
necessity<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.540> play<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> game<00:01:37.490> however<00:01:38.490> all

necessity to play the game however all
of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> other<00:01:39.900> person<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.770> don't<00:01:40.860> necessarily

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
of the other person we don't necessarily

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.499 
of the other person we don't necessarily
have<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:42.110> more<00:01:43.110> than<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.470> juggernog

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
have to have more than just juggernog

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.270 
have to have more than just juggernog
speedy<00:01:45.509> Cola<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.200> quicker<00:01:46.680> I've<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.100> don't

speedy Cola and quicker I've we don't

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.039 
speedy Cola and quicker I've we don't
even<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.670> need<00:01:47.939> double<00:01:48.329> tap<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
even really need double tap so it's a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.749 
even really need double tap so it's a
very<00:01:49.079> good<00:01:49.409> possibility<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.310> might<00:01:50.490> see
