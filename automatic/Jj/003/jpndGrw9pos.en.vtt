like<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> butterfly<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.270> looks<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:24.780> almost

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
like a butterfly it looks all almost

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.450 
like a butterfly it looks all almost
similar<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.970> butterfly<00:01:27.540> dragon<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.460> think

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
similar to the butterfly dragon I think

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
similar to the butterfly dragon I think
that's<00:01:29.670> what<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> dragon<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.479> called<00:01:30.780> let's

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that's what the dragon was called let's

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.030 
that's what the dragon was called let's
just<00:01:31.439> take<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> look<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.259> yeah<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.829> looks

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
just take a look at it yeah so it looks

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.660 
just take a look at it yeah so it looks
very<00:01:35.369> similar<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.420> butterfly<00:01:36.960> dragon<00:01:37.670> in

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
very similar to the butterfly dragon in

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.910 
very similar to the butterfly dragon in
my<00:01:38.729> opinion<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:39.990> opinion<00:01:40.320> though<00:01:40.650> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
my opinion that's my opinion though I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.810
