00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.020
 light 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.260
 let's start with the book review 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.350
 pregnancy 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.190
 the book of the destiny of san angel 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:16.830
 we start with the physical aspect 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.830
 It is a thin paste book without flaps 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:27.420
 are classified and the illustration is 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.630
 as in high relief beni 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.220
 in high reality of this health 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.180
 It is also like 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.180
 metallic 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.440
 each sheet 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.640
 it has like a frame around them 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 as if they were spots 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 Diamond 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.530
 in fact based on spots and in each 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 corner a plant 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.190
 I'm not the vice de fontana 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.300
 it's quite long are several chapters 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.990
 even though it is a pretty book 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 thin much 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.810
 they have 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.810
 the new chapters a love stack 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.370
 thanks and a little about the 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.370
 author 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.980
 Newspaper 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.050
 the chapter number 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.950
 a few lines as if they were made 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.950
 with pens 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.100
 and there are some like annotations either 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.229
 that is underlined for example 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.710
 or for example here is crossed the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.710
 word 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.790
 crossed out and corrected with a ballpoint 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.579
 Red 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.180
 some chapters are even more 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.180
 decorated 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.180
 some bad aspects but is that the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.180
 premise is 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.040
 I am about to be about teenagers 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.180
 they are students who go to a 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.400
 high school 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.099
 and then they have to sign the book of 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.799
 style that I imagine above and are 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.769
 accepting to be or reliving the history of 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.590
 his parents and then the parents of these 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.969
 guys are emblematic characters of 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.920
 fairy tales 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:57.430
 the main girls our books 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.550
 they are the daughter of snow white and the daughter 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.890
 from the white farm 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.140
 raven who is the daughter of fat and signature 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.870
 will accept to be the next stepmother 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.120
 of snow white and supports those who 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.489
 daughter of the monthly hobby sign will be 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.489
 it will be accepting visible 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.100
 regime has to be the stepmother of 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.840
 Snow white but she is good then 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.330
 he does not want to be 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.550
 and good when I put that is the photo 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.770
 of the book on facebook 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.780
 I showed it to my colleagues in the 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.930
 classes in English everybody told me 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.610
 that reminded them of the nuns I do not have 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.610
 the first book of Montejo and right now 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.470
 I do not have Monceau's first book 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.190
 favorite because he believes this but good 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.190
 is the second 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.660
 I do not know what the covers are for 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.120
 are the first cover of 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.530
 many the first hajj of monza not what 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.970
 is 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.970
 there really is no resemblance 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.069
 all the bad points I think there are 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.200
 much more 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.840
 they become books too 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.739
 commercial 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.380
 but the message is good, do not mark 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.600
 phrases because I liked some things 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.579
 many phrases and in fact if you want to read 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.270
 the phrases that I'll leave it down here in 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.160
 my board league 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.070
 the target for this type of books are 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.910
 between 12 and 15 years old girls who 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.090
 they are starting with adolescence but 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.210
 good good points 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.240
 It is counted from several perspectives 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.330
 they are even though it is a novel 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.040
 is based on fairy tales then 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.229
 you have a narrator and dislike around 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.419
 it goes from the perspective of raven isis 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.660
 the narrator about the strong perspective 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.280
 of apple and there are even parts where the 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.280
 daughter narrator speaks with him 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.260
 some parts when you talk to me with the 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.000
 narrator is very father 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.000
 of qualification I give to the book 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.139
 usually when they leave these 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.860
 books I imagine that if I had 12 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:22.050
 15 years old I would like it or not even 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.680
 I'm 20 and I'm doing the book then 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.930
 3.5 because it's a good book is a book 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.659
 I finished it in two days and had 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.400
 classes in the English class is not a 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.949
 book that changed my life but it's the 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.819
 book that I kept I actually read it 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.819
 very fast 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:44.260
 have 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:47.830
 It has 333 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:51.650
 333 pages then it is very very very 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.960
 I recommend it well, but 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.030
 I recommend it more than anything to children of 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.130
 between 12 and 15 years 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.410
 I like to leave a comment on what 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.120
 think about this book call them the 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.010
 attention does not attract attention if 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.200
 they read what they think of this book 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.970
 would love to read your comments and then 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.970
 nothing we see in another video night
