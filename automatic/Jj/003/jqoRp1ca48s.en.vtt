00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:08.810
 Now you can try on the Atenza diesel 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.810
 I would like to have what is finished to me what kind of car 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:35.329
 What kind of person is irritated and the vibration comes out 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.880
 Well riding like a I still very much is that kind of image contains seasonally first time I softening government bonds 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.870
 May be left 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:46.079
 people riding in cx 5 is also I think I get maybe 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:52.440
 It has become a ne Matta little mild is there sitting in a circle 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:57.060
 Because after all that can firmly be such Toka sound insulation it is the models of passenger cars 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.660
 Diesel other is more ne two crown of cx 5 is 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.480
 It was well-made 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:09.520
 It is a rhythm range and there is still a torque 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:13.810
 Gugu comes out a lot when it is rotating about 1500 rotations 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.180
 The different characteristics of at all To force and gasoline engines because diesel engine and it 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.159
 Since this turbo is attached 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.810
 High torque comes out from Tsukui opening store 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.800
 Well in this car 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.580
 When was I gas range of 4500 lion condition of about 4500 c 4 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.350
 I have a sense of torque 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.070
 Fukui turns 2 to open the accelerator 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.550
 I feel like this is going to go out before 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.710
 That's the horsepower for that, but I don't want Deez Resin 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.920
 It does not turn to high rotation 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.240
 If it is the usual gas range that is 6000 revolutions 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:55.080
 Well there is about 4500 revolutions that power comes out in the case of Deez range though there is 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:00.120
 Because there is no power until there is a feeling of high torque there 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:03.360
 It is such as turn pounding the engine engine that is falling and say which way or 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.030
 Well suited for usage like running a circuit 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.030
 Day 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.730
 d Range is used, so use it so as not to increase the number of revolutions throughout the city 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.760
 It is suitable for how to take it 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.910
 It is the city in terms of the sense 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.170
 The diesel engine also has no stress at all 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.680
 That's easy to handle 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:30.180
 Or is the latest diesel engine Otomo 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.960
 It is most gold if Kai level as long as you are in another house 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.210
 In dragon afternoon that 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:40.780
 I feel comfortable enough 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.430
 I only heavy minute towards the diesel engine than the gasoline engine in that sense 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.129
 Say is whether suspension from moving 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.020
 I feel that if you have this level of ability, no one will feel the drug's frustration 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.890
 think 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.150
 That body is 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.410
 Specials are more sedans 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.050
 There are paid people but 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.830
 That ordinary 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.950
 The low floor wagon has a slightly longer body 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.000
 It is than that if there is I'm singing at 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.940
 The station wagon has a longer wheelbase and the sedan sells longer. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.240
 Do you like the body of this sedan 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.180
 I think this is good if you like the low floor wagon body 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:26.719
 So this time I'm using the current car manual 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.939
 Which car very much I do not have almost sold, but that child in endangered species also I usually now manual 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.819
 It is and it is the development of 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:39.140
 It seems that the manual will hardly sell 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:43.970
 It seems to have been said , yet it is a manual that can not be sold for that 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.130
 It seems that a new manual mission has been developed, and this is Mazda's commitment 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.080
 Hey it will surprise or 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.920
 That 's why it happened 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.920
 If you try to open the lid 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:59.409
 11% of manual missions are out 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.050
 The unique at this time is also very well done, but this is the manual now 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.560
 I changed the board but 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.040
 If this was me I would not get lost anymore 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.930
 Manual is I abdominal pain recently what kind of car anymore 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.060
 It is the fuel consumption is the manual is bad when there manual and automatic ne However A 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.700
 It is 20 of the tender 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:23.490
 Manual content is good cherry drink father Ri jc 08 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.750
 It is worth to take in that web manual 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.820
 By say 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.830
 Right now 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.580
 this 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.580
 I would like to have the best with Atenza diesel and manual .
