00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.300
Let's take a look at a short teaser of my planned movie. After that the actual video will start.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.000
You really want to accomplish something...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You want to be somebody.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.400
But in fact you are...

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.280
NOBODY.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.560
I am Jamie Foxx and you're currently watching a video made by Davis Fucking Schulz!

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.440
Hi, I'm Davis Schulz and –

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.000
Damn it, someone's calling me.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.300
Yeah?

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.600
Holy shit, hang up!

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.200
Okay.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.040
In this video you're going to learn about

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.040
what's currently happening in my life.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.920
Except for eating.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.160
I love eating.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.000
- Hi Davis, umm, how about you introduce yourself to these people?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.080
Umm, alright, I'm an animal-friendly, nice but still dominant bad boy.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.120
- What, what does that – what?

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.600
I don't know...

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.240
- Introduce yourself properly!

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.080
You're in TV spots on Pro7 (German TV-channel), in several movies,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.360
you met people like Johnny Depp and Megan Fox, you –

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.200
Ok, woah, hold on there, stop.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.240
Who cares about that?

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.560
- Maybe, some women?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.240
Yeah, sure, whom else?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.800
- Yeah, Davis, but they'll only date you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.200
as long as you're not acting like a narcissistic fame bitch.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.040
I'm not, I mean,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.760
what's the point of being successful

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.520
if you have nothing in the end...

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.840
Nobody is a cut above somebody else. Everybody is nobody.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.720
- Well, you know, that's just like, uh, your opinion.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.160
Whatever, where are the women? I thought that'd be –

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.560
- Yeah, just introduce yourself again.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.560
Okay fine, I'm Davis and in some parts of Germany I'm the most famous celeb on earth.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.900
Oh yeah, you all are...hot...

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.680
But I bet you all just want me because of my fame...

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.880
Davis, I don't love you because of your fame, but...

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.120
Just because of your looks.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.800
Great. Come to our date tonight.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.160
Yeah, and then we'll...make a baby, Davis!

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.200
Ok, woah, you know, you're kinda cute and stuff...

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.880
But just because my "cream" is ready,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.840
doesn't mean I gotta "slice your pie", you know...

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.800
I beg you, Davis!

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.500
Okay, no, babe...

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.200
You stepped into my life...

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.360
Yes?

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.000
Yeah...

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.160
Just like in dog shit.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.920
You're so mean, Davis!

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.280
Come on, I was just kidding. Maybe I want to have children one day.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.040
With the right woman.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280
But who...is the right woman?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.080
Well, I don't know. A cute smart one, who is completely mine

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.760
and with whom I can spend my whole life...

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.800
Wow. Gay.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.960
Are you currently acting?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.960
You're acting right now, aren't you?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.040
Woah, where the hell do you always come from?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040
You're mostly the "tough guy".

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.120
No, I'm not acting at the moment.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.440
Thank god. You're not a good actor anyway...

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.080
Excuse me?

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.800
Ok, fine, come on. Play me!

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.600
You? Okay.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.720
That's it?

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.500
Well, I don't know how to play an idiot.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.200
Screw you!

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800
Screw yourself with your "public hair"-hairstyle.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.480
That was rude.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.200
Good enough for you.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.400
Do you at least have an idea how I'm supposed to style my hair properly?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.840
Yeah, I even got nine ideas. Eight. Five. Maybe two. No, none, you're not worth my thoughts.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.200
O-okay, you're thinking pretty fast.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.000
Or you're thinking too slow.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
"LOSER"

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.400
So, after three minutes of artistic freedom.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.440
Let's talk about the actual topics:

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.160
(Davis talks about German TV show)

00:03:32.320 --> 00:04:22.300
(Davis talks about a TV cell phone commercial he's in)

00:04:38.360 --> 00:05:24.100
(Davis talks about a motion picture he's in and the shooting breaks)

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.200
Well, that's it for today.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.900
And probably for the next few weeks because I'm not uploading that many videos. (:D)

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.160
Anyway, thank you for watching.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.680
Even this video took weeks of work, so I hope you liked it.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.080
Your loving lovely lover Davis.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.160
Well...I have to go.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.900
The planet needs me.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.900
Tell me your thougts in the comments below - thanks for watching!
