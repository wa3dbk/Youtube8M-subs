00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.009
 to remove all gamers here and as 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.230
 I always hope they are super mega 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.030
 jose tribe and welcome once again to the 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
 channel I am very excited because 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.740
 they just gave the microsoft the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.230
 halo 3 together with the games that give away 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.970
 for having gold the xbox goal membership 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.869
 live and the truth is that I am very happy 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.640
 because it is for me the game that most 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.350
 fun has brought me from all 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 games that I played until now in my 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.570
 life the halo 3 is the one that has most 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.149
 fun what I mean with fun 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.489
 It was where I looked for more friends in that game 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.329
 it was where we played every day with 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.460
 they 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.379
 we create our maps our tracks 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.420
 of racing and they were spent 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.000
 throwing the chat with friends in 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.250
 halo 3 the truth is that it is for me is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.809
 incredible that microsoft regal this game 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.570
 I say that they have already been delayed because 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.489
 it was a success this game was one of the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.920
 best-selling spins choose one of the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.660
 genres that most impressed maybe because 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.969
 it was announced as the last 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.070
 of the trilogy did not and there were not many 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.320
 things from halo 2 to turn 3 it shows 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.300
 quite the difference and the truth is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.490
 that I am very happy 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.220
 did not download yesterday had like 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.110
 a thousand people playing it and right now 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.450
 I raise and mouths and 10,000 people 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.890
 playing it and the truth is that I felt 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
 very happy because I say well at least since 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 It will not take half an hour to find a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.260
 split the truth is that it must 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.660
 look up a little faster because they are 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.370
 10,000 people and this is because 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.190
 as they just gave it away so much 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.770
 people are playing it for free 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.110
 the truth and the truth is that it's going to have 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.970
 many people, not many people, I mean 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.440
 what happened is not going to go up but what I 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
 I mean it is at least going to 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.060
 have a user base that is not 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.100
 will download knowing that it is free and 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.600
 let's see if it's already boring to play anymore 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.160
 is less already bored or play some other 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.500
 game and you do not have the turn three strips 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.720
 well let's try it no and you put on 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.940
 play it and the truth is that I'm very very 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.920
 but very happy some people tell me 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.450
 that they do not like halo 3 so much 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.690
 truth is that to me of all the turns 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.390
 that I played that they are all obviously I played 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.980
 all the turns is the one that I liked the most and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.020
 I tell you by that was that 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.360
 included the forge mode for the first time 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.830
 that was the mode of creation that you could 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.620
 create your maps and so on 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.720
 is that that was incredible because the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.590
 hours of fun that the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.760
 game was expanded normally played 1 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.280
 campaign as the campaign ended 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.920
 I played multiplayer but the truth is 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.830
 than with this game after playing 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.150
 multiplayer you could create your maps 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.230
 I'm doing it for people who 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.010
 he does not know and he has never played 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.140
 true 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.690
 you could create your maps that you can still 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.430
 you can create your maps create your modes 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.700
 of game your variants of game of 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.120
 zombies of whatever you want invite your 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.550
 friends and they start playing or if you do not go up 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.860
 your maps and people can 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.620
 download people who do not even know you go 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.780
 he got into bungie and they were looking for ways 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.390
 of most downloaded games by the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.820
 community and what they did was that 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.709
 they unloaded them I got myself for example 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.330
 and I was getting what were the most maps 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.400
 downloaded or more game modes 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.959
 downloaded and downloaded them and then 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.820
 invite my friends what wave are we going to 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.500
 to play is that it's not that I did it now 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.830
 joined and the whole roll the truth is that 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.989
 it was amazing incredible I'll try to 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.040
 bring some halo gameplays 3 if you 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.739
 can 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.079
 in this gameplay is garbage was left in 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:26.260
 last place but I wanted to upload it because 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.299
 I wanted to record my reaction all trunk 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.819
 go look at this I think I do not even kill him if 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.370
 he killed him but a bone screech wanted 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.230
 record my reaction the entire bone trunk 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.959
 as I still did not hold her 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.879
 controls does not grab it, I used to 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.220
 trying to run and run and he said no 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.079
 It serves my control is me and then I 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.790
 I agreed that I have the three not run by 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.950
 I loved that because it was more 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.030
 balanced the multiplayer to very 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.430
 balanced 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.159
 unlike halo reach or halo 4 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.760
 or etcetera where you can fly running 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:00.730
 to swim to jump to crouch to eat of everything not 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.500
 the truth is that I loved that 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.739
 halo multiplayer 3 of all 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.139
 multiplayer is the 2 was could be 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.750
 say that the best of 2 the halo 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:13.090
 2 anyone who has played 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.189
 all ages professionally you will 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.769
 to say that the 2 was the apogee of the 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:20.319
 multiplayer on 3 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.319
 It is also balanced but includes 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:25.440
 some things that could be half frustrating 

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.840
 the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.180
 the game not at the competitive level like 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.600
 the shields bubbles and little things so 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.510
 they could obviously get angry 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.830
 no but good the truth is that it is 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.620
 great the game is great if you have not 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.470
 downloaded download is worth it 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.390
 try it for a few days and if and if you 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.830
 they played hello 3 and they say for me 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.110
 you can load be it I played it not me 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.880
 I agree to download card 5 etcetera believe me 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.850
 It feels amazing to play again 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.610
 a game after quitting one game 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.890
 that you played a lot and left it abandoned 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.690
 and 23 years later you play it again 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.790
 feels incredible the truth is that I 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.820
 only since he said looking for players 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.910
 and remembered things start remembering if 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.040
 like that kind of movie not that is that you smell 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.390
 something and how it begins to remember all your 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.970
 life more or less action despite remembering 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.180
 many stories many things that I lived 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.070
 with halo 3 the truth is that it is 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.990
 incredible is not incredible the truth a 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.390
 very good experience and for those who 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.460
 ask how the game felt if 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.590
 with water etcetera the truth is that a 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.720
 I scored the restricted cream 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.210
 I still did not have the I did not have long in all the 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.090
 game 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.009
 if you do not know if I see from one 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.620
 another one who gave it to him was not going 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.000
 walking like that all zombie but I do not 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.699
 gave the truth would be thing to go 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.620
 trying and find out no but if I do not know 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.319
 they have downloaded it download it is worth it 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.780
 it's worth trying for at least a few days 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:57.400
 do not miss anything, it's free, it's not 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:00.259
 cold if it's free because it's not true 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.560
 download it and try to play it 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:06.590
 and remember there some little things there and now 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.250
 Then, if they want, they will return it to 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:12.349
 your people to 5 live piñata 4 or what 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.030
 you are currently playing but 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.759
 well I think that was all that 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.930
 I wanted to show you in this video 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.340
 invited them to download the game and 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.470

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.110

 gameplay with a choco adventure something 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.340
 here funny in something that entertains what 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.740
 that is good not the truth 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.990
 quickly to talk about the variety 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.880
 I will be uploading videos of league of 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.740
 legends although some do not like to 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.760
 Well, although many do not like it 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.139
 is bringing a little bit of 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.400
 minecraft a little bit of other games 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.830

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.330
 variety no and good see you and as 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.020
