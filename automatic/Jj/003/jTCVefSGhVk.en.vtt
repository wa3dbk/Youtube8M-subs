00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.970
 hi brito fishermen today we are going to do 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 a bust of a bus you have a decoy with 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.500
 I have an image with a plumb head that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.230
 then they are placed a few hairs of tail 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.469
 We're going to do it in two parts 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.450
 a first let's paint in the jeep what 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:32.040
 let's paint first with paint I have 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.000
 a plasticizer and then we give it 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.589
 some details with him with the airbrush 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.019
 for this good, few are needed 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.059
 materials besides the head the 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.140
 head plumb the head there good 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.999
 with a little paint I have 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.690
 plasticizer as I said some eyes 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:51.780
 to give you details and I usually give you the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.039
 paint your powder with a gun 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.269
 heat a gun like this and then 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.190
 applied the powder paint directly 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.610
 over the hot lead with a colander 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.370
 a good friend a good friend of the web me 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.490
 the gift this is all I do not know if what 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.870
 you know is one in a clip for you 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.020
 that you can find in almost any 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.880
 ticket office in quite the truth 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.410
 and can perfectly do the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.090
 Strainer functions if not against in 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.310
 one with the mesh enough 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.360
 small for that , and secure the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.640
 powder paint 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.370
 let's let's start painting 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.870
 it looks good on the wrinkled head 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:34.890
 we take hold the head with a plier 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:38.520
 of pressure a plier that allows us 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.520
 manipulate it without burning 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.990
 and we can give it the first layer of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.990
 paint in shape 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:13.700
 we distribute it well in such a way that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:16.570
 everything is well covered and we finish with 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.570
 another bit of heat 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.270
 once we have it once what 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.180
 we have definitely painted and just 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.360
 we need to put it in the water and leave it 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.360
 cool 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.890
 already the lure is totally hard and 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.640
 now let's proceed to paint it from a 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.640
 detail with the airbrush 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.720
 well we continue with the painting of the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.600
 painting of our taste as I said 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.100
 let's go to put the details that 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.240
 they are not essential, much less 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.990
 but good if it is true that they will give 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.990
 they will give you some detail 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.900
 of realism to our lure 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.140
 I had already thought about painting and painting 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.320
 a black fringe well diffused at 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.970
 length of the loin and then a resource that 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.890
 uses a lot with pointed out that is to paint him 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.310
 make them from some spot of red that 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.520
 is what will simulate is that the one 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.850
 express in this case is an expert for 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.400
 that's good with a little red paint 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.020
 what I'm sure you know those who 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.330
 they are already painting with airbrush 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.940
 it must always be with a density 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.370
 similar to milk milk whole milk 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.170
 then you try to catch a little bit 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.420
 of paint you pass through it by the edge 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.100
 and so they see more or less what density comes 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.720
 if I had it 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.459
 denser then surely I would have to 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.350
 Give a little more air to the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.060
 compressor the compressor we have it 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.520
 loaded we have the bottle totally 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.750
 loaded the exit we have it costs two 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.940
 atmospheres and more or less for this 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.670
 density is appropriate and good for there 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.830
 we need more than to give him the taps 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:38.540
 of detail to the Lord we load very little 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:41.070
 amount of paint because actually 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.980
 what we are going to need 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:49.170
 just a touch a little touch of 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.380
 details let's paint first in the 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.380
 guts 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.310
 a little 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:10.990
 unhappiness in the central part with this 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.940
 with this is already more than enough and 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.380
 Now, nothing changes, we change the 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.410
 paint you know that every time you paint 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.660
 with airbrush, well, you have to clean 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:28.449
 the bowl 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:30.610
 Each painter has his technique 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.949
 me when I change color just what 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:37.659
 that we see that he painted the bowl threw a 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:40.259
 little solvent to finish off 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.259
 clean it 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.620
 and good in principle with this is almost 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:50.070
 almost enough you have to be careful of 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:54.080
 do not stain anything that's why they always do 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.080
 paper tests 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.470
 with absorbent paper 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.470
 well we can load the color black 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.160
 we always try it first on a 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.969
 on a paper in a paper release 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.579
 absorbent and so 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.949
 We see that the painting is already 

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:23.019
 conveniently in this case as in 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.509
 pretty fine details we will have 

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:29.619
 that we get very close to what we are going to 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:32.379
 paint and open the button open it very 

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:34.829
 little so that the line is the finest 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.829
 possible 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.590
 and 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.590
 nothing more 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.880
 two 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.000
 i 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.490
 as I already mentioned as I mentioned in the 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.379
 These airbrushes are above brico 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.590
 the button has two functions if 

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:19.169
 Puls releases air and as you go 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.810
 bringing back your own 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:26.360
 push button then it casts more and more amount of 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:28.729
 paintings good sir is already 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.960
 is already painted that has the blow of 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:36.319
 hit of color both in both the area 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.870
 of the gills a stroke of red with and 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:43.120
 a black line on the top 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.100
 that we would be missing simply because 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.880
 What we have left is to give a capita 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.260
 varnish 

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.390
 I varnish I also only go with the 

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.130
 airbrush give it a capita of varnish and 

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.380
 get directly and ride the 

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.760
 hairs and fibrils of taste and in addition 

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.830
 of that to put him of course the eyes 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.840
 but if you think that's what we're going to do 

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.840
 in the next video a greeting
