00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.200
 what happens deadly snails here if 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.260
 retransmitting and again with a 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.240
 video of dark souls 2 in this video I'm going 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.090
 to show you how to get the famous 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.070
 golden wing shield first of all 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.109
 we will have to travel to the cell 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.199
 strike to be able to go faster 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.759
 possible in this case to get up 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.279
 here we have to go to the fortress 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.910
 lost and the fourth teleport that would be 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.830
 to be here 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.510
 although I am already here I will show you 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.220
 the way carefully with the 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.220
 mummies are these because they are annoying 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.330
 No unintentionally mentioned host is mentioned 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.190
 I hope it pissed us off 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.190
 efe 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.580
 I see that it has pissed us off well 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.970
 we have to go directly to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.970
 down 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.369
 another less 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.870
 well once we are here 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.280
 we will find room that there is not 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.830
 no door I already left that a 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.610
 message indicating the hidden path 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.290
 we just have to press the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.000
 wall here opposite a click with the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.400
 button to good with the button let's say that 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.170
 you have to interact and unlock this 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.180
 door you turn to find a 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.650
 road without exit also leaves the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.350
 good message but usually need a 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.580
 part of which I was connected in 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.780
 which indicated that there is a good way 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.729
 hidden but good simply that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.760
 pinchase go pricking by the wall 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.190
 with the button to take out then what you will do 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.870
 and we're going to appear in the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.340
 top wall 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.010
 here we have a series of objects 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.190
 quite interesting but what we 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.380
 interesting in this case is the shield of 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.640
 golden wing so we have to do 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.640
 is to jump on this ledge from here 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.310
 here we will also get objects 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.630
 quite interesting but what 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.060
 we want us is when a little bit 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.400
 further we have to follow what is the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.599
 Cornice is down to the bottom 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.599
 careful not to fall 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.700
 and here we have the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.640
 the golden shield because nothing here 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.829
 the tutorial comes any question 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.609
 doubt and others as you already know, do not hesitate 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.849
 ask and we'll see you in the next 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.849
 video
