little bit this is the brand new volvo
s60<00:00:07.770> for<00:00:08.099> 2011<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.120> one<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.750> features

s60 for 2011 and one of the features
that<00:00:10.139> volvo<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.620> introducing<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.280> car<00:00:11.490> is

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
that volvo of introducing this car is

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.129 
that volvo of introducing this car is
something<00:00:11.910> called<00:00:12.000> pedestrian<00:00:12.660> safe<00:00:12.929> now

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
something called pedestrian safe now

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.320 
something called pedestrian safe now
pedestrian<00:00:13.650> safety<00:00:13.799> uses<00:00:14.219> radar<00:00:14.549> which<00:00:15.210> is

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
pedestrian safety uses radar which is

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.880 
pedestrian safety uses radar which is
embedded<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> front<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> car<00:00:16.320> filter

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
embedded in the front of the car filter

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.349 
embedded in the front of the car filter
uses<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.160> small<00:00:17.340> camera<00:00:17.760> which<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.210> embedded

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
uses a small camera which is embedded

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.359 
uses a small camera which is embedded
underneath<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> mirror<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.039> Volvo

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
underneath the mirror and what Volvo

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.790 
underneath the mirror and what Volvo
tell<00:00:20.640> us<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.660> particular<00:00:21.960> sensing

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
tell us is that this particular sensing

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.310 
tell us is that this particular sensing
system<00:00:23.160> will<00:00:23.279> prevent<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.699> running<00:00:24.510> over<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
system will prevent you running over a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.130 
system will prevent you running over a
pedestrian<00:00:26.010> or<00:00:26.160> hitting<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.640> pedestrian<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:27.599> 22

miles<00:00:28.410> an<00:00:28.590> hour<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:29.010> three<00:00:29.220> miles<00:00:29.429> an<00:00:29.609> hour

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
miles an hour about three miles an hour

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.269 
miles an hour about three miles an hour
below<00:00:30.090> 22<00:00:30.689> miles<00:00:30.900> an<00:00:31.019> hour<00:00:31.109> great<00:00:31.500> system<00:00:31.980> we

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
below 22 miles an hour great system we

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.000 
below 22 miles an hour great system we
tested<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.000> system<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.660> dummies<00:00:34.350> now<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
tested this system on dummies now it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
tested this system on dummies now it
went<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.670> well<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.149> test<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.840> managed

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
went very well the test that we managed

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.139 
went very well the test that we managed
to<00:00:37.260> avoid<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> dummies<00:00:38.010> evolver<00:00:38.700> said<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
to avoid the dummies evolver said it

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.790 
to avoid the dummies evolver said it
works<00:00:39.420> much<00:00:39.540> better<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.960> human<00:00:40.260> beings<00:00:40.559> good

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
works much better on human beings good

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 
works much better on human beings good
but<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.129> actually<00:00:41.370> detects<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> body<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
but it actually detects the body for it

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
but it actually detects the body for it
and<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.079> can't<00:00:43.440> run<00:00:43.620> over<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.280> we

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and you can't run over them so we

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.709 
and you can't run over them so we
thought<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.670> tried<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.450> going

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
thought we tried we are actually going

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.930 
thought we tried we are actually going
to<00:00:45.840> attempt<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.379> run<00:00:46.680> over<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.160> show<00:00:47.399> producer

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
to attempt to run over the show producer

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
to attempt to run over the show producer
and<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> car<00:00:49.140> saves<00:00:49.410> him<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.010> could

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and see if the car saves him this could

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.580 
and see if the car saves him this could
go<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.850> very<00:00:51.000> bad<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.539> here's<00:00:51.750> Sean<00:00:51.989> the

Dyke say he's ready to die today but

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639 
Dyke say he's ready to die today but
hopefully<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.969> new<00:01:00.180> pedestrian<00:01:00.660> safe<00:01:01.230> system

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
hopefully the new pedestrian safe system

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.219 
hopefully the new pedestrian safe system
and<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> Volvo<00:01:02.250> assistant<00:01:02.820> will<00:01:03.300> stop<00:01:03.899> him

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
and the Volvo assistant will stop him

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
and the Volvo assistant will stop him
being<00:01:04.530> run<00:01:04.710> over<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.640> there's<00:01:05.820> nothing<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.119> do

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
being run over so there's nothing to do

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.080 
being run over so there's nothing to do
now<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.560> see<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.979> live<00:01:08.189> through<00:01:08.880> an

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
now but see if we can live through an

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:20.450 
now but see if we can live through an
attempted<00:01:09.659> running<00:01:09.990> over

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.280 

well<00:01:21.460> we're<00:01:21.790> both<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.240> little<00:01:22.270> bit<00:01:22.570> scared<00:01:22.960> and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
we managed to get through that ritual

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.510 
we managed to get through that ritual
and<00:01:25.659> still<00:01:25.900> being<00:01:26.080> alive<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:27.009> interesting

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
and still being alive the interesting

but he didn't want to go because he

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.810 
but he didn't want to go because he
knows<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.320> system<00:01:35.649> detects<00:01:36.130> fluids<00:01:36.670> in<00:01:36.789> the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
knows the system detects fluids in the

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.910 
knows the system detects fluids in the
body<00:01:37.030> if<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.720> want<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.140> make<00:01:38.350> sure<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:38.619> it's

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
body if you want to make sure that it's

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.649 
body if you want to make sure that it's
sort<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.220> we<00:01:39.670> test<00:01:39.909> there<00:01:40.090> multiple<00:01:40.600> times

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
sort of we test there multiple times

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.600 
sort of we test there multiple times
actually<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.530> pedestrian<00:01:42.039> safe<00:01:42.250> system

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
actually the pedestrian safe system

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.700 
actually the pedestrian safe system
works<00:01:42.789> explain<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.509> me<00:01:43.659> how<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:43.899> felt<00:01:44.140> I<00:01:44.380> put

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
works explain to me how you felt I put
