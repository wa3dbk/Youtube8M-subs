00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.440 

so<00:01:54.359> we<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.899> um<00:01:57.859> we<00:01:58.859> have<00:01:59.009> some<00:01:59.250> shops<00:01:59.640> this<00:02:00.240> is

okay

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.850 

so<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.540> killer<00:02:21.870> gaming<00:02:22.260> he's<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> one

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
so this is killer gaming he's the one

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.220 
so this is killer gaming he's the one
that<00:02:23.040> originally<00:02:23.310> asked<00:02:24.060> up<00:02:24.330> for<00:02:24.900> me<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.080> make

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that originally asked up for me to make

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.229 
that originally asked up for me to make
the<00:02:25.410> video<00:02:28.760> he<00:02:29.760> helped<00:02:30.060> design<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.840> spawn

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
the video he helped design this spawn

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:43.380 
the video he helped design this spawn
hey<00:02:33.239> here

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.960 

so<00:02:44.390> this<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.750> our<00:02:44.900> server<00:02:45.170> there<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.400> bike

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
so this is our server there is a bike

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.690 
so this is our server there is a bike
shop<00:02:47.000> sell<00:02:47.690> shop<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:49.130> can<00:02:49.280> buy<00:02:49.400> houses

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
shop sell shop and you can buy houses

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.200 
shop sell shop and you can buy houses
it's<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.450> survival<00:02:50.960> server<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:55.670> never<00:02:55.940> really

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
it's a survival server it never really

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.720 
it's a survival server it never really
ended<00:02:56.570> up<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:56.930> anyone<00:02:57.230> actually<00:02:57.700> having<00:02:58.700> to

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
ended up with anyone actually having to

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.850 
ended up with anyone actually having to
do<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.060> from<00:02:59.390> scratch<00:02:59.420> I<00:03:00.140> always<00:03:00.380> ended<00:03:00.710> up

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
do it from scratch I always ended up

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.180 
do it from scratch I always ended up
giving<00:03:01.040> everyone<00:03:01.550> like<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> million<00:03:02.210> diamonds

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
giving everyone like a million diamonds

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.160 
giving everyone like a million diamonds
so<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:06.910> turned<00:03:07.910> out<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.210> be<00:03:08.360> more<00:03:08.540> like<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.690> city

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
so it turned out to be more like a city

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.210 
so it turned out to be more like a city
I<00:03:10.750> don't<00:03:11.750> know<00:03:11.870> why<00:03:12.050> my<00:03:12.290> tongues<00:03:12.560> not<00:03:12.710> loading
