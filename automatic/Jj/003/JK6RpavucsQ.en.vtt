some<00:05:49.030> people<00:05:49.240> are<00:05:49.630> just<00:05:49.810> born<00:05:50.620> douchebags

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490

some<00:05:51.670> people<00:05:51.970> are<00:05:52.150> just<00:05:52.300> born<00:05:52.660> like<00:05:52.990> this<00:05:53.350> and

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
some people are just born like this and

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.040 
some people are just born like this and
really<00:05:54.790> we<00:05:54.970> can't<00:05:55.180> do<00:05:55.300> anything<00:05:55.510> about<00:05:55.690> it

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
really we can't do anything about it

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.770 
really we can't do anything about it
but<00:05:56.530> I<00:05:56.830> think<00:05:57.280> we<00:05:57.430> do<00:05:57.640> need<00:05:57.880> to<00:05:57.940> start<00:05:58.360> learning

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.840 
but I think we do need to start learning
that<00:05:59.410> especially<00:06:00.340> in<00:06:00.460> the<00:06:00.520> anime<00:06:00.820> community

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
that especially in the anime community

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.330 
that especially in the anime community
because<00:06:01.420> we're<00:06:01.630> getting<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:02.260> you<00:06:02.740> know<00:06:02.860> we're

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
because we're getting it you know we're

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.700 
because we're getting it you know we're
hitting<00:06:03.670> it<00:06:03.730> hard<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:04.090> most<00:06:04.300> is<00:06:04.570> that<00:06:05.230> people

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
hitting it hard the most is that people

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.940 
hitting it hard the most is that people
have<00:06:06.520> different<00:06:07.420> opinions<00:06:07.570> about<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.710> certain

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
series and if someone thinks different

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.240
