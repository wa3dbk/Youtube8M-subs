giant would be included in the roster

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.070 
giant would be included in the roster
but<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.920> never<00:02:39.129> took<00:02:39.370> place<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.360> with<00:02:40.870> this

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
but that never took place so with this

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
stars or one of the previous games like

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.280 
stars or one of the previous games like
it<00:02:45.849> did<00:02:46.000> appear<00:02:46.269> in<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.260> just

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
it did appear in so you can just

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.580 
it did appear in so you can just
disregard<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.310> for<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.610> time<00:02:48.790> pain<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.290> I

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
disregard that for the time pain so I

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.440 
disregard that for the time pain so I
guess<00:02:50.920> all<00:02:51.130> we<00:02:51.190> can<00:02:51.340> do<00:02:51.519> for<00:02:51.549> now<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.880> just<00:02:52.269> wait

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
guess all we can do for now is just wait
