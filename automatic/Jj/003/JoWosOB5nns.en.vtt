00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.060
 they could not be done and not the same 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.490

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.969
 a clear pot any one manual 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 Greetings to someone, especially Mr. 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.940
 we read gonzález I do not know why I remembered 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 we do not want it very much and good when 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.789
 speak of formal memo this one that this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.289
 He is a very good person and the boss in 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.289
 our front 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.590
 let's see already said that the beans 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.920
 perfectly remember that the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.320
 beans is a legume 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.170
 and this bean that I have in my 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.670
 hands that you buy unfortunately in 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.189
 a place where a long time has passed 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.380
 where it is not cool as when 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.970
 we go to a small town or when 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.640
 we buy outside of the markets is 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.280
 sitting the lady are in the glasses 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.530
 they are very fresh there are times that a 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.360
 year and a half when it comes to our 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.119
 stand or we already said it in the first in the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.700
 first block but how do we have to 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.330
 do from the beginning 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.060
 they wash perfectly with water and with 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.860
 soap me and the lakes and then let them 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.450
 soaking throughout the night already 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.450
 we can see how they are up to how they are 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.640
 as some pages look that's because 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.399
 they are very humid we went back to 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.340
 hydrate and you can see how it is 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.340
 will cover having already it is and 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:06.429
 now we are going to go together to praise the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.369
 let's wash it very hot let's 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.930
 with that twine and this half 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.140
 use some flatulence my favor because 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.659
 aside we affect the ozone layer many 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.379
 they affirm and that is really proven 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.750
 yes then and it is unpleasant to eat rich 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.599
 and then feel heavy not everyone 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.299
 they say that the pilots come to me 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.340
 pilots greetings to my son-in-law paco corona 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.780
 they want for the depressurization of 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.370
 plane are a little flatulent a lot of life 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.230
 I do not know if it's true if you go out 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.170
 something about this topic binds in the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.730
 stealing money is not good let's put 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.910
 yes I know very well the only thing we have 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.900
 what to do is add beans in a 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.970
 pot very well the story rinsed yes 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.970
 soaked revoked and rinsed 2 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.030
 piece of onion 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:09.300
 short 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.300
 here the joke is lard 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.170
 delicious 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.990
 and here I am like 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.810
 is where it takes off and I'll put enough 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.690
 water 9 the taste as I told them 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.550
 principle of the block varies a lot to 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.830
 me not tell me but if it varies 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.230
 much if I do it in a pot of 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.650
 pressure if I do it in my pot that already 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.930
 I have destined and thank you I have a 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.140
 be a pot for my beans 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.730
 truth the taste I do not know that it is I do not know by 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.760
 what was better as they say there 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.739
 more is like that historical palate that 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.959
 we can have or those taste families 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.910
 that we can see in the story of how 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.900
 they know things different from one to another 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.519
 do not 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.230
 so I am of the opinion that 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.090
 we take an hour and have it 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.650
 nothing more especially for that of 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.140
 complicated is to make beans from the pot 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.840
 and well look at what I 'm going to 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.370
 do right now and you're going to do evil little hand 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.769
 is going to be what my grandmother used to say 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.530
 peace rest having beans all 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.640
 the teeth a little sauce mané does not have 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.680
 one of what proportions 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.440
 with that can nothing more than beans is 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.400
 the richest smell I smell 18 ni to 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.979
 nothing else 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.040
 and I do not want to use the ones that already 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.840
 you saw them well nothing else I should not 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.479
 get me decorate because we do not need 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.669
 put absolutely nothing a mirror 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.889
 whole already well done but that you have 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.990
