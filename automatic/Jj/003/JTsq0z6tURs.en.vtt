want to do is give a quick overview of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.040 
want to do is give a quick overview of
some<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> aspects<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.210> event<00:00:27.359> give

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
some of the aspects of this event give

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.080 
some of the aspects of this event give
you<00:00:28.140> some<00:00:28.320> perspective<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.949> scale<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.910> also

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
you some perspective on scale and I also

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.479 
you some perspective on scale and I also
wanted<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> bring<00:00:31.560> out<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> point<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.279> even

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
wanted to bring out the point that even

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.330 
wanted to bring out the point that even
though<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.630> event<00:00:34.050> may<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.440> some<00:00:34.739> minor

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
though this event may have some minor

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310 
though this event may have some minor
effects<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.969> earth<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
effects on earth this is not really a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.440 
effects on earth this is not really a
huge<00:00:37.710> space<00:00:38.070> weather<00:00:38.340> event<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.270> not

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
huge space weather event and so it's not

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.580 
huge space weather event and so it's not
something<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.079> should<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.410> be

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
something that we should really be

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.340 
something that we should really be
concerned<00:00:40.950> about<00:00:41.420> now<00:00:42.420> let's<00:00:42.780> take<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> look<00:00:43.170> at

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
concerned about now let's take a look at

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.970 
concerned about now let's take a look at
just<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:44.100> 304<00:00:44.820> angstrom<00:00:45.480> image<00:00:46.260> giving<00:00:46.710> us<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
just the 304 angstrom image giving us a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.660 
just the 304 angstrom image giving us a
look<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.430> eighty<00:00:47.820> thousand<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:48.840> degrees

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
look at eighty thousand or so degrees

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
look at eighty thousand or so degrees
material<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.510> wanted<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> give<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
material and I just wanted to give you a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
material and I just wanted to give you a
perspective<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> sides<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> Sun

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
perspective on the sides because the Sun

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.170 
perspective on the sides because the Sun
is<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.870> unbelievably<00:00:55.770> huge<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.030> this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
is so unbelievably huge and so this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.680 
is so unbelievably huge and so this
event<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> really<00:00:58.500> hard<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.250> us<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
event is really hard for all of us to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.270 
event is really hard for all of us to
put<00:01:00.690> into<00:01:00.840> perspective<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.770> daily<00:01:02.070> life

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
put into perspective of that daily life

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
put into perspective of that daily life
so<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.699> I've<00:01:02.789> done<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.660> put<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> couple

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so what I've done is that put a couple

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.340 
so what I've done is that put a couple
of<00:01:04.320> green<00:01:04.589> dots<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:06.119> are<00:01:06.510> roughly

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
of green dots on here these are roughly

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
of green dots on here these are roughly
the<00:01:07.530> size<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> earth<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.760> put<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> bar

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the size of the earth and I put a bar

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.020 
the size of the earth and I put a bar
it's<00:01:09.600> about<00:01:09.840> 50<00:01:10.409> Earth's<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:10.920> ensign<00:01:11.610> length

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's about 50 Earth's in ensign length

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 
it's about 50 Earth's in ensign length
and<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> can<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.439> these<00:01:13.680> blobs<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
and so you can see that these blobs of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.770 
and so you can see that these blobs of
plasma<00:01:14.700> they're<00:01:14.939> hitting<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.330> surface<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
plasma they're hitting the surface of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.749 
plasma they're hitting the surface of
the<00:01:15.900> Sun<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.560> roughly<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> size<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> earth

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the Sun or roughly the size of the earth

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.020 
the Sun or roughly the size of the earth
and<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.570> huge<00:01:18.900> plasma<00:01:19.650> cloud<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.430> expands

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and this huge plasma cloud that expands

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270 
and this huge plasma cloud that expands
out<00:01:21.210> covers<00:01:21.840> almost<00:01:22.020> half<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.740> size<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
out covers almost half the size of the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.420 
out covers almost half the size of the
Sun<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.390> that's<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.900> amazing

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
Sun and that's just that's just amazing

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.190 
Sun and that's just that's just amazing
so<00:01:26.430> let's<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.210> look<00:01:27.479> quickly<00:01:27.720> at<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so let's take a look quickly at the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.520 
so let's take a look quickly at the
coronal<00:01:28.829> mass<00:01:28.979> ejection<00:01:29.610> we'll<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.900> this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
coronal mass ejection we'll see this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.310 
coronal mass ejection we'll see this
material<00:01:32.130> coming<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.930> coming<00:01:34.229> out

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
material coming out this is coming out

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
material coming out this is coming out
from<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.650> Sun<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> thousand<00:01:36.240> kilometers

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
from the Sun about a thousand kilometers

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.330 
from the Sun about a thousand kilometers
a<00:01:36.689> second<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> billion<00:01:37.799> tons<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
a second so this is a billion tons of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.060 
a second so this is a billion tons of
material<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> magnetic<00:01:39.450> field<00:01:39.920> traveling<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
material and magnetic field traveling it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.789 
material and magnetic field traveling it
several<00:01:41.880> million<00:01:42.180> miles<00:01:42.689> per<00:01:43.200> hour<00:01:43.350> or

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
several million miles per hour or

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.010 
several million miles per hour or
several<00:01:44.159> million<00:01:44.399> kilometers<00:01:45.270> per<00:01:45.299> hour<00:01:45.570> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
several million kilometers per hour and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.440 
several million kilometers per hour and
then<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.560> can<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.250> snow<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
then you can see all this snow on the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
then you can see all this snow on the
image<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.560> high-energy

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
image and that's actually high-energy

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.850 
image and that's actually high-energy
particles<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.119> impacting<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.020> camera

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
particles that are impacting the camera

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
particles that are impacting the camera
on<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.189> spacecraft<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.360> even<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
on the spacecraft and you can even see a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.929 
on the spacecraft and you can even see a
planet<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> guess<00:01:56.189> which<00:01:56.399> planet<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
planet can you guess which planet that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.969 
planet can you guess which planet that
is<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.369> we<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.640> conclude<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.320> solar

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
is so we want to conclude with the solar

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.270 
is so we want to conclude with the solar
flare<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:02.729> produced<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.869> gave<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.409> minor

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
flare that was produced it gave a minor

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.999 
flare that was produced it gave a minor
radio<00:02:05.700> blackout<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.869> was<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
radio blackout but this was one on a

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070 
radio blackout but this was one on a
scale<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.819> five<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> particle

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
scale of one to five and the particle

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.110 
scale of one to five and the particle
storm<00:02:10.200> was<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> scale<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
storm was one on the scale of one to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.850 
storm was one on the scale of one to
five<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.959> these<00:02:13.080> are<00:02:13.140> considered

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
five so these are considered

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.290 
five so these are considered
minor<00:02:14.160> storms<00:02:14.910> by<00:02:15.750> Noah<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.440> Noah<00:02:16.970> not<00:02:17.970> only

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
minor storms by Noah and Noah not only

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.570 
minor storms by Noah and Noah not only
monitors<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.050> weather<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.380> earth<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.340> our

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
monitors the weather on earth but is our

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.060 
monitors the weather on earth but is our
agency<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.600> monitors<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.080> weather<00:02:22.320> from

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
agency that monitors the weather from

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.440 
agency that monitors the weather from
space<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.790> then<00:02:24.570> lastly<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.230> CME<00:02:25.890> is

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
space and then lastly the CME is

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.970 
space and then lastly the CME is
probably<00:02:27.450> only<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.050> point<00:02:28.290> only<00:02:28.620> going

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
probably only going to point only going

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.710 
probably only going to point only going
to<00:02:29.100> brush<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.760> magnetic<00:02:30.120> field<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.510> earth

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
to brush the magnetic field of the earth

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.470 
to brush the magnetic field of the earth
and<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.860> does<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:32.520> may<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> minor

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
and if it does we may have a minor

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.460 
and if it does we may have a minor
magnetic<00:02:34.020> storm<00:02:34.490> again<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> scale<00:02:36.060> one<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:37.350> a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
magnetic storm again on a scale one on a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.740 
magnetic storm again on a scale one on a
scale<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.800> one<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.130> five<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.270> may<00:02:39.510> mean

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
scale of one to five but this may mean

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.710 
scale of one to five but this may mean
