find out more about me i'm going to talk
very<00:00:12.809> briefly<00:00:13.139> about<00:00:14.269> vibrato<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:16.410> left<00:00:17.279> hand

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
very briefly about vibrato the left hand

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.810 
very briefly about vibrato the left hand
vibrato<00:00:18.320> in<00:00:19.320> fiddle<00:00:20.100> music<00:00:21.109> violinists<00:00:22.109> learn

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
vibrato in fiddle music violinists learn

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.540 
vibrato in fiddle music violinists learn
to<00:00:24.019> generate<00:00:25.019> vibrato<00:00:25.650> through<00:00:26.160> several

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
to generate vibrato through several

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.689 
to generate vibrato through several
different<00:00:27.029> techniques<00:00:28.010> we<00:00:29.010> Fiddler's<00:00:29.429> we

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
different techniques we Fiddler's we

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.030 
different techniques we Fiddler's we
self-taught<00:00:30.240> Fiddler's<00:00:30.840> learn<00:00:31.560> all<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
self-taught Fiddler's learn all of this

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.790 
self-taught Fiddler's learn all of this
by<00:00:32.579> watching<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:34.370> leaping<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.730> sometimes

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
by watching and leaping to sometimes

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.299 
by watching and leaping to sometimes
inaccurate<00:00:37.879> conclusions<00:00:38.960> but<00:00:40.309> basically

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
inaccurate conclusions but basically

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.840 
inaccurate conclusions but basically
vibrato<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:43.010> sounds<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> word<00:00:44.370> vibrate

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
vibrato is sounds like the word vibrate

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.500 
vibrato is sounds like the word vibrate
and<00:00:45.860> it<00:00:46.860> involves<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> changing<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and it involves the changing of the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.450 
and it involves the changing of the
pitch<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.110> note<00:00:51.050> Fiddler's<00:00:52.050> use<00:00:52.410> vibrato<00:00:52.710> in

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
pitch of a note Fiddler's use vibrato in

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.779 
pitch of a note Fiddler's use vibrato in
waltzes<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> slow<00:00:55.020> airs<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.460> use

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
waltzes and slow airs they don't use

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
waltzes and slow airs they don't use
them<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.120> fast<00:00:57.420> tunes<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.020> isn't<00:00:58.530> really

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
them in fast tunes that isn't really

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.429 
them in fast tunes that isn't really
time<00:00:59.510> but<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.750> were<00:01:00.899> playing<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.530> waltz<00:01:06.439> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
time but if I were playing a waltz the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
time but if I were playing a waltz the
difference<00:01:07.860> between<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.869> note<00:01:09.869> without

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
difference between a note without

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.760 
difference between a note without
vibrato<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:11.720> that<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.200> simply<00:01:13.740> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
vibrato is that it's just simply a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.340 
vibrato is that it's just simply a
single<00:01:14.340> tone<00:01:17.030> with<00:01:18.030> vibrato<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.869> pitch<00:01:19.080> goes

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
single tone with vibrato the pitch goes

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.640 
single tone with vibrato the pitch goes
up<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> down<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:21.990> change

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
up and down a little bit and I change

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.590 
up and down a little bit and I change
the<00:01:22.920> amount<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.490> goes<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.030> down<00:01:24.119> by<00:01:24.390> how

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the amount it goes up and down by how

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.030 
the amount it goes up and down by how
far<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> roll<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:25.770> finger<00:01:26.580> tip<00:01:26.880> from<00:01:27.829> sharp<00:01:28.829> too

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
far I roll my finger tip from sharp too

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.760 
far I roll my finger tip from sharp too
flat<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.490> also<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.930> change<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.380> speed

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
flat and also I can change the speed

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
flat and also I can change the speed
with<00:01:32.159> which<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.490> rotate<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.000> fingertips<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.109 

yeah<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.799> context<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.579> waltz<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
yeah and in the context of a waltz it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.750 
yeah and in the context of a waltz it
sounds<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.539> this

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:02:02.600 

I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:35.280 

the<00:02:02.760> right

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.349 

you
