00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
trying to be inventive and trying to do

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.150 
trying to be inventive and trying to do
different<00:00:32.750> stuff<00:00:32.780> with<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.110> boots<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:33.650> we

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
different stuff with the boots and we

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.829 
different stuff with the boots and we
told<00:00:34.400> he<00:00:34.550> was<00:00:34.640> coming<00:00:34.940> out<00:00:35.059> with<00:00:35.269> a<00:00:35.300> loss<00:00:35.750> to

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
told he was coming out with a loss to

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.630 
told he was coming out with a loss to
start<00:00:36.050> making<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.350> blade<00:00:36.589> I<00:00:36.890> thought<00:00:37.489> that

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
start making a blade I thought that

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.430 
start making a blade I thought that
would<00:00:37.760> be<00:00:37.820> that's<00:00:38.629> awesome<00:00:38.809> knowing<00:00:39.379> I

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
would be that's awesome knowing I

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.320 
would be that's awesome knowing I
couldn't<00:00:39.949> wait<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.220> get<00:00:40.400> on<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:40.910> test<00:00:41.089> them

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
couldn't wait to get on and test them

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.880 
couldn't wait to get on and test them
out<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.750> that's<00:00:42.170> when<00:00:42.379> he<00:00:42.410> came<00:00:42.470> out<00:00:42.710> with<00:00:42.769> a

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
out and that's when he came out with a

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.790 
out and that's when he came out with a
 easy<00:00:43.850> record<00:00:44.329> with<00:00:44.629> Ricky<00:00:45.230> no<00:00:45.290> motifs

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
 easy record with Ricky no motifs

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.299 
 easy record with Ricky no motifs
and<00:00:46.070> it's<00:00:46.570> I've<00:00:47.570> had<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.900> really<00:00:48.190> great<00:00:49.190> time

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
and it's I've had a really great time

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.280 
and it's I've had a really great time
just<00:00:49.519> testing<00:00:50.390> different<00:00:50.540> blades<00:00:51.019> and<00:00:51.199> its

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
just testing different blades and its

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.030 
just testing different blades and its
really<00:00:51.379> opened<00:00:51.559> my<00:00:52.070> eyes<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.900> so<00:00:53.900> it<00:00:54.049> how<00:00:54.199> he'll

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
really opened my eyes to so it how he'll

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:07.770 
really opened my eyes to so it how he'll
bleed<00:00:55.339> can<00:00:55.610> really<00:00:55.850> affect<00:00:56.150> your<00:00:56.299> performance

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.310 

the<00:01:08.680> blade<00:01:08.950> has<00:01:08.979> been<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.280> tremendous<00:01:09.549> help

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the blade has been a tremendous help

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.920 
the blade has been a tremendous help
this<00:01:11.320> year<00:01:11.560> because<00:01:11.880> essentially<00:01:12.880> it's<00:01:13.270> the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
this year because essentially it's the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.130 
this year because essentially it's the
feeling<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:14.920> get<00:01:14.979> from<00:01:15.130> this<00:01:15.369> essentially

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
feeling I get from this essentially

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.660 
feeling I get from this essentially
stiff<00:01:17.140> in<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.409> corners<00:01:17.799> as<00:01:17.950> possible<00:01:18.520> on<00:01:18.580> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
stiff in the corners as possible on the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.390 
stiff in the corners as possible on the
straights<00:01:18.970> so<00:01:19.299> in<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.509> Straits<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:20.680> I've<00:01:20.920> it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
straights so in the Straits it I've it

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.100 
straights so in the Straits it I've it
flexes<00:01:21.850> enough<00:01:22.119> so<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.270> way<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.479> can<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:22.960> can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
flexes enough so that way I can I can

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.840 
flexes enough so that way I can I can
call<00:01:23.320> back<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.890> forth<00:01:24.159> and<00:01:24.340> get<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.520> maximum

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
call back and forth and get the maximum

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.960 
call back and forth and get the maximum
pressure<00:01:25.180> in<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.020> straight<00:01:26.500> so<00:01:26.860> I<00:01:26.890> it's<00:01:27.610> not<00:01:27.759> too

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
pressure in a straight so I it's not too

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.120 
pressure in a straight so I it's not too
much<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.360> where<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:28.509> can't<00:01:28.840> turn<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.290> but<00:01:29.950> it's

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
much to where I can't turn it but it's

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.710 
much to where I can't turn it but it's
there's<00:01:30.490> also<00:01:30.640> enough<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.240> where<00:01:31.450> it's<00:01:31.600> not

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
there's also enough that where it's not

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.270 
there's also enough that where it's not
just<00:01:31.960> kind<00:01:32.110> of<00:01:32.140> flopping<00:01:32.409> around<00:01:32.649> either<00:01:33.009> like

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
just kind of flopping around either like

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.830 
just kind of flopping around either like
i<00:01:33.399> can<00:01:33.759> feel<00:01:33.940> sticking<00:01:34.270> in<00:01:34.420> sea<00:01:34.570> ice<00:01:34.720> and

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
i can feel sticking in sea ice and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.060 
i can feel sticking in sea ice and
carbon<00:01:35.380> back<00:01:35.560> at<00:01:35.770> me<00:01:35.890> in<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.280> corner<00:01:36.549> it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
carbon back at me in the corner it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.010 
carbon back at me in the corner it
instead<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.130> flexing<00:01:39.610> its<00:01:39.789> it's<00:01:40.210> very<00:01:40.660> stiff

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
instead of flexing its it's very stiff

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.540 
instead of flexing its it's very stiff
and<00:01:41.200> sticks<00:01:41.470> in<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.679> corner<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.280> way

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
and sticks in the corner so that way

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.279 
and sticks in the corner so that way
there's<00:01:42.700> no<00:01:42.850> flex<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.539> i<00:01:43.600> get<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.929> maximum

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
there's no flex and i get the maximum

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.469 
there's no flex and i get the maximum
pressure<00:01:44.679> out<00:01:45.429> of<00:01:45.610> my<00:01:45.700> Turner's<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.330> way<00:01:46.450> I

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
pressure out of my Turner's that way I

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:55.070 
pressure out of my Turner's that way I
can<00:01:46.780> get<00:01:47.050> most<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.500> out<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.830> it

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.870 

I<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.890> search<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.430> feeling<00:01:56.730> I've

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
I have a search for this feeling I've

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240 
I have a search for this feeling I've
had<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.300> from<00:01:57.540> time<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.960> time<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.230> uh<00:01:58.620> all<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
had it from time to time but uh all the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.310 
had it from time to time but uh all the
blades<00:01:59.430> I've<00:01:59.640> tried<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.720> was<00:02:00.840> either<00:02:00.990> they

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
blades I've tried it it was either they

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020 
blades I've tried it it was either they
felt<00:02:01.530> good<00:02:01.710> inner<00:02:01.950> corners<00:02:02.370> with<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.580> fellow<00:02:02.820> in

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
felt good inner corners with a fellow in

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.610 
felt good inner corners with a fellow in
the<00:02:03.060> strings<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:04.380> or<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.590> other

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
the strings it was one or the other

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.920 
the strings it was one or the other
words<00:02:05.130> with<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.400> mark<00:02:05.550> easy<00:02:05.730> record<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.480> feel

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
words with the mark easy record I feel

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.730 
words with the mark easy record I feel
like<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.320> get<00:02:07.800> both<00:02:07.980> so<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:08.820> think<00:02:09.680> Mikey<00:02:10.680> T

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
like you can get both so I think Mikey T

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.350 
like you can get both so I think Mikey T
record<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.280> gonna<00:02:11.490> put<00:02:12.390> new<00:02:12.510> standards<00:02:12.960> blades
