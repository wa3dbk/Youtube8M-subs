00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.229
 next we are going to see the tab of 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.370
 global switches we will do the render setup 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:10.590
 we will click on global switches 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.290
 this tab allows us to control 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.080
 aspects of the global render 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.690
 we'll start with the displacement inside 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.270
 from the geometry box 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.240
 We activate and deactivate this tab if 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.210
 we want it to appear or disappear 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.939
 all the displacement maps of 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.720
 our from our sell by default 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.520
 is activated and if I turn it off it will not 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.370
 no map effect would appear 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.470
 scroll in our render 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.809
 activating this option the fox back face 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.330
 cooling the surfaces of the objects 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.879
 with the normals turning their backs on the 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.580
 camera or light source or in the shade 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.610
 flight 13 will appear completely 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.470
 transparent this allows us to observe 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.430
 or render the interior of objects 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.250
 closed when the camera is outside 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.800
 this obviously does not correspond with a 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.400
 Realistic photo network but it is an option 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.920
 that gives us v raid is usually 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.830
 deactivated the next box that is 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.470
 the lights 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.350
 allows us to modify activate or 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.640
 turn off the lights within our 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.940
 scene 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.880
 if I deactivated this button what 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.830
 with it is that all the lights of the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.130
 scene are deactivated therefore 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.270
 it's likely that the render comes out 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.010
 completely black the next option 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.930
 which are the default lights that 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.900
 provides max when i do not have 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.770
 no light in my scene I can either 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.810
 leave them off those lights that I 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.600
 has put max the study more in the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.270
 scene are disabled but not 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.210
 I have no light in my scene and with 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.440
 this disabled the logical thing is that the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.770
 render me appear completely in 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.770
 black 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.820
 it leaves the default lights activated not 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.479
 I recommend using it in this way 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.160
 and the other option is to remain 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.430
 deactivated when jordi active lahey 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.260
 the next button are the hidden lights 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.940
 usually or by default though 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
 although they remain hidden they continue 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.209
 illuminating the scene 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.459
 if I do not want this to happen 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.489
 I deactivate this option and all lights 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.830
 that I have hidden would be equivalent to how 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.630
 If I had turned them off 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.630
 by default it is activated 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.970
 feel option are shadows shadows 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.280
 and I do not want any 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.620
 shadow in my scene deactivated this 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.480
 option and in the render does not see me king I do not 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.239
 generates no shadow 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.610
 the next option is to show me 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.700
 that I tend 'I did only hey this 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.610
 it is only useful to verify that the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.530
 global lighting is correct but not 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.090
 corresponds or should not be used 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.970
 for a final render since the finish 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.590
 it's not a realistic finish by 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.590
 Dawn defect deactivated 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.969
 inside the box that corresponds to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.340
 materials we have the option of 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:18.079
 reflection and refraction if I text active 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.730
 this option any material you have 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.590
 the reflection properties and 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.540
 refraction a mirror with glass 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.400
 etc. disappears to those properties 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.500
 in all the scene there will be no 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.689
 material that reflects or has the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.459
 refraction will be replaced by a 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.459
 material that does not have those properties 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.400
 the next option is allows me 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.319
 activate in all materials the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.599
 maximum rebound depth if I by 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.180
 example I have a mirror is mirror and in 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.120
 in front of that mirror I have another 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.180
 mirror those mirrors are going to be 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.190
 reflecting up to a maximum in this case 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.129
 of two rebounds that I can go 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.040
 obviously increasing is a way of 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.140
 control render times 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.959
 decreasing this value I will get 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.730
 a few render times and if I 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.739
 deactivated it will be this parameter 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.260
 inside each material is the one that 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.959
 control the amount of bounces 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.790
 if instruction is maps maps 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.579
 that I put in each material can 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.100
 activate or deactivate the seven do not 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.320
 applied a park on a floor that 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.919
 park surely have a map a 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.539
 bigmac a park texture and if I what 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.550
 deactivated in all the scene no 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.000
 material will load the maps 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.070
 it will simply activate the color that 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.340
 have the diffuse and that will be the render by 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.340
 obviously it remains activated 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.919
 I can filter maps to avoid 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.130
 come out pixilated and I can also 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.460
 do when generating a calculation of 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.530
 global lighting 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.500
 here I can control the highest levels 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.020
 of transparency let's say that he opposed 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.030
 50 glasses the glasses are glass so 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.990
 they are both transparent one behind 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.270
 another one who made the glass number 51 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.699
 would look opaque and this this option controls 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.120
 the tracking of the king's rays 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.130
 after zinc in the past transparency 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.440
 those 50 levels that I have marked above 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.919
 with a threshold of 0 that has been rendering 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.819
 all those levels those 50 levels 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.750
 perfectly without any kind of 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.750
 deformation 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.449
 the next option that is loveride if 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.639
 the active thing allows me to overwrite all 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.440
 the materials of my scene by the 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.350
 material that I assign you in this 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.670
 box here we go to the effects of 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.010
 shine the gloss sing 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.750
 I can disable all gloss effects 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.640
 and from my scene to decrease the 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.460
 render times let's say to make a 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.890
 prior to a quick display for 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.070
 then activate them again we continue with 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:59.090
 the right tracking this second option 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:01.370
 letter boils allows me to apply a 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.320
 small positive displacement to the 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.150
 secondary rebounds in the calculation of 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.940
 lighting what can be used 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.070
 in case of overlapping 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.010
 faces the or the polygons within the 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.430
 scene and do not show up some spots 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.960
 blacks within global lighting 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.990
 This parameter is also useful when 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.360
 uses the render of three studies 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.760
 more the render to texture to avoid 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.760
 those those spots that he told us 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.160
 we go to the next box that is the 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.050
 equator compatibility first 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.800
 button is the legacy button 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.479
 for the model of sant sky and the raid 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.000
 camera the previous versions of v 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.770
 radio used calculation models a 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 little different to achieve sanz for 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.070
 achieve sky and so on 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.720
 let's say they did not have that much precision 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.430
 physical when this option is 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.020
 deactivated which is the option 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.020
 default 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.540
 ubera and use improved models and more 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.580
 precise calculation of lighting but 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.560
 when we have it activated uve ray 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.770
 change to the old models that are 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:13.530
 compatible with old scenes and about 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.530
 all with standard mark cameras 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.940
 the next button that allows me to use or 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:22.030
 work with scale with the scale 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.940
 photometric of the max studio when it is 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:28.780
 activated by default is this option 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.849
 adapt the lights the ubr by light power 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.460
 by sky etcetera and cameras 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:38.340
 dv rain to the photometric units that 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.340
 they come by default between studio max
