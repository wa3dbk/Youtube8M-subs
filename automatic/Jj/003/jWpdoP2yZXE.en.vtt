sounds like a lot but how you get a
great<00:00:27.430> ship<00:00:27.730> for<00:00:27.970> it<00:00:28.029> this<00:00:28.150> is<00:00:28.210> the

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
great ship for it this is the

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.109 
great ship for it this is the
multi-purpose<00:00:28.900> Cobra<00:00:29.890> Mike<00:00:30.070> free<00:00:30.369> it<00:00:30.730> can<00:00:30.939> do

multi-purpose Cobra Mike free it can do
anything<00:00:31.810> you<00:00:32.050> want<00:00:32.200> it<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.320> but<00:00:32.619> right<00:00:32.800> now

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
anything you want it to but right now

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.410 
anything you want it to but right now
I'm<00:00:33.100> going<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.280> show<00:00:33.460> you<00:00:33.520> how<00:00:33.730> to<00:00:33.790> set<00:00:34.150> it<00:00:34.180> up

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
I'm going to show you how to set it up

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.930 
I'm going to show you how to set it up
for<00:00:34.660> trading<00:00:35.380> it<00:00:35.829> can<00:00:36.100> have<00:00:36.250> a<00:00:36.280> huge<00:00:36.610> amount<00:00:36.790> of

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
for trading it can have a huge amount of

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.630 
for trading it can have a huge amount of
cargo<00:00:37.300> space<00:00:37.329> I<00:00:37.780> think<00:00:37.840> it's<00:00:38.140> above<00:00:38.710> 60<00:00:39.460> and

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
cargo space I think it's above 60 and

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.819 
cargo space I think it's above 60 and
that<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.600> great<00:00:40.989> upgrade<00:00:41.140> from<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.680> adder

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
that is a great upgrade from the adder

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.440 
that is a great upgrade from the adder
which<00:00:42.130> I'm<00:00:42.280> assuming<00:00:42.700> you've<00:00:42.820> now<00:00:42.970> come<00:00:43.210> from

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
which I'm assuming you've now come from

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.360 
which I'm assuming you've now come from
you<00:00:43.720> should<00:00:43.960> have<00:00:44.050> gone<00:00:44.200> Sidewinder<00:00:45.100> hauler

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
you should have gone Sidewinder hauler

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.819 
you should have gone Sidewinder hauler
probably<00:00:46.329> maybe<00:00:46.540> even<00:00:46.809> Sidewinder<00:00:47.500> straight

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
probably maybe even Sidewinder straight

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.529 
probably maybe even Sidewinder straight
to<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.039> adder<00:00:48.219> and<00:00:48.609> then<00:00:48.940> you've<00:00:49.090> gone<00:00:49.269> to<00:00:49.449> the

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
to the adder and then you've gone to the

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.119 
to the adder and then you've gone to the
Cobra<00:00:49.899> lat<00:00:50.019> free<00:00:50.260> this<00:00:50.379> is<00:00:50.530> assuming<00:00:50.980> that

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
Cobra lat free this is assuming that

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.650 
Cobra lat free this is assuming that
you've<00:00:51.219> just<00:00:51.429> been<00:00:51.550> doing<00:00:51.789> trading<00:00:52.239> so<00:00:52.420> how<00:00:52.600> do

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
you've just been doing trading so how do

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.990 
you've just been doing trading so how do
we<00:00:52.809> get<00:00:52.989> this<00:00:53.170> ship<00:00:53.410> up<00:00:53.769> to<00:00:53.829> a<00:00:54.100> trading<00:00:54.699> status

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
we get this ship up to a trading status

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.220 
we get this ship up to a trading status
well<00:00:55.269> I'm<00:00:55.359> going<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:55.539> show<00:00:55.660> you<00:00:55.750> what<00:00:55.929> it<00:00:56.050> comes

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
well I'm going to show you what it comes

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.869 
well I'm going to show you what it comes
with<00:00:56.410> first<00:00:56.679> off<00:00:56.920> you're<00:00:57.370> gonna<00:00:57.489> come<00:00:57.699> with<00:00:57.820> a

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
with first off you're gonna come with a

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.290 
with first off you're gonna come with a
16<00:00:58.600> fuel<00:00:59.500> tank<00:00:59.769> which<00:00:59.949> is<00:00:59.980> a<00:01:00.249> much<00:01:00.820> better<00:01:00.999> jump

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
16 fuel tank which is a much better jump

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.849 
16 fuel tank which is a much better jump
range<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:01.749> a<00:01:01.780> much<00:01:01.929> better<00:01:02.109> fuel<00:01:02.350> capacity<00:01:02.499> of

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
range and a much better fuel capacity of

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.720 
range and a much better fuel capacity of
course<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:04.239> then<00:01:04.420> 2<00:01:04.720> 8<00:01:05.080> capacity<00:01:05.890> cargo<00:01:06.460> racks

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
course and then 2 8 capacity cargo racks

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.399 
course and then 2 8 capacity cargo racks
I<00:01:06.880> think<00:01:07.030> though<00:01:07.150> is<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.300> class<00:01:07.600> 3<00:01:07.990> types<00:01:08.290> that

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
I think though is a class 3 types that

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.720 
I think though is a class 3 types that
it<00:01:08.530> gives<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:08.800> even<00:01:09.130> though<00:01:09.220> these<00:01:09.340> are<00:01:09.520> class

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
it gives you even though these are class

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.270 
it gives you even though these are class
4<00:01:10.230> slots<00:01:11.230> on<00:01:12.130> also<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.580> class<00:01:13.000> 2<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:14.530> 3<00:01:14.830> plus<00:01:15.070> 2

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
4 slots on also a class 2 or 3 plus 2

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.130 
4 slots on also a class 2 or 3 plus 2
slots<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.940> one<00:01:16.120> of<00:01:16.210> them<00:01:16.330> is<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.480> capacity<00:01:16.960> of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
slots and one of them is a capacity of

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.649 
slots and one of them is a capacity of
two<00:01:17.350> cargo<00:01:17.830> rack<00:01:18.010> and<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.550> class<00:01:18.820> 4<00:01:19.180> shield

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
two cargo rack and a class 4 shield

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.859 
two cargo rack and a class 4 shield
generator<00:01:20.079> and<00:01:20.320> a<00:01:20.920> basic<00:01:21.700> discovery<00:01:22.450> scanner

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
generator and a basic discovery scanner

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.499 
generator and a basic discovery scanner
so<00:01:23.850> that's<00:01:24.850> pretty<00:01:25.030> much<00:01:25.149> it

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
so that's pretty much it

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.730 
so that's pretty much it
you<00:01:25.659> also<00:01:25.810> get<00:01:26.020> utility<00:01:26.470> mounts<00:01:26.649> and

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
you also get utility mounts and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.569 
you also get utility mounts and
everything<00:01:27.040> of<00:01:27.159> course<00:01:27.189> it's<00:01:27.549> a

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
everything of course it's a

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.389 
everything of course it's a
multi-purpose<00:01:27.970> ship<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:29.110> if<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.070> go<00:01:30.159> into<00:01:30.280> the

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
multi-purpose ship so if we go into the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.530 
multi-purpose ship so if we go into the
outfitting<00:01:30.759> section<00:01:31.030> I'll<00:01:31.119> show<00:01:31.299> you<00:01:31.390> what<00:01:31.509> I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
outfitting section I'll show you what I

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.929 
outfitting section I'll show you what I
actually<00:01:31.869> do<00:01:32.320> so<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:32.890> remove<00:01:33.280> all<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.729> hard

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
actually do so I remove all the hard

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.940 
actually do so I remove all the hard
points<00:01:34.299> at<00:01:34.360> all<00:01:34.540> over<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.840> utility<00:01:35.380> mounts<00:01:35.799> I

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
points at all over the utility mounts I

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.440 
points at all over the utility mounts I
don't<00:01:36.430> feel<00:01:36.579> like<00:01:36.759> they're<00:01:36.909> needed<00:01:37.270> when

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
don't feel like they're needed when

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.300 
don't feel like they're needed when
you're<00:01:37.600> trading<00:01:37.930> at<00:01:38.290> all<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:38.920> they

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
you're trading at all and they

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.740 
you're trading at all and they
definitely<00:01:39.549> shouldn't<00:01:40.060> be<00:01:40.149> needed<00:01:40.479> if<00:01:40.600> you're

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
definitely shouldn't be needed if you're

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.749 
definitely shouldn't be needed if you're
feeling<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:41.170> again<00:01:41.500> interdicted<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.340> lot<00:01:42.579> I'll

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
feeling I again interdicted a lot I'll

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.759 
dealing with it very well then you can
actually<00:03:05.540> remove<00:03:05.989> that<00:03:06.019> as<00:03:06.319> that<00:03:06.410> is<00:03:06.560> another

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
actually remove that as that is another

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.619 
actually remove that as that is another
class<00:03:07.129> for<00:03:07.430> internal<00:03:07.910> compartments<00:03:08.510> and

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
class for internal compartments and

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.839 
class for internal compartments and
that's<00:03:08.750> another<00:03:08.930> cargo<00:03:09.739> rack<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.040> 16<00:03:10.609> right

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
that's another cargo rack of 16 right

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:11.259 
that's another cargo rack of 16 right
there

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
there

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.599 
there
so<00:03:11.510> total<00:03:12.049> on<00:03:12.709> your<00:03:12.890> class<00:03:13.099> forwards<00:03:13.489> you've

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
so total on your class forwards you've

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.500 
so total on your class forwards you've
got<00:03:13.730> 16<00:03:14.239> at<00:03:14.420> 32<00:03:14.989> 48<00:03:15.829> cargo<00:03:16.489> rack<00:03:16.879> possibilities

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
got 16 at 32 48 cargo rack possibilities

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.880 
got 16 at 32 48 cargo rack possibilities
right<00:03:17.690> there<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.140> then<00:03:18.530> you've<00:03:18.650> got<00:03:18.799> your

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
right there and then you've got your

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.789 
right there and then you've got your
class<00:03:19.160> 2<00:03:19.629> internal<00:03:20.629> compartments<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.470> that

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
class 2 internal compartments and that

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.789 
class 2 internal compartments and that
gonna<00:03:22.250> add<00:03:22.340> another<00:03:22.430> 12<00:03:23.150> now<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.959> know<00:03:24.530> that

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
gonna add another 12 now I I know that

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.430 
gonna add another 12 now I I know that
is<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.310> believe<00:03:25.690> one<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.720> them<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.079> discovery

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
is I believe one of them is a discovery

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.869 
is I believe one of them is a discovery
scanner<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:28.010> then<00:03:28.099> two<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.459> them<00:03:28.609> are<00:03:28.700> empty

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
scanner and then two of them are empty

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.259 
scanner and then two of them are empty
initially<00:03:29.510> so<00:03:30.220> 12<00:03:31.220> right<00:03:31.489> there<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:31.879> free<00:03:32.209> easy

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
initially so 12 right there is free easy

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.599 
initially so 12 right there is free easy
to<00:03:32.450> upgrade<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.900> think<00:03:33.109> they're<00:03:33.230> about<00:03:33.609> two

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
to upgrade I think they're about two

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.000 
to upgrade I think they're about two
thousand<00:03:35.419> credits<00:03:36.200> note<00:03:36.349> three<00:03:36.650> thousand

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
thousand credits note three thousand

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.009 
thousand credits note three thousand
credits<00:03:37.280> there<00:03:37.430> for<00:03:37.880> your<00:03:38.030> cargo<00:03:38.389> racks<00:03:38.660> for

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
credits there for your cargo racks for

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.599 
credits there for your cargo racks for
your<00:03:39.169> class<00:03:39.319> two<00:03:39.500> cargo<00:03:39.889> rack<00:03:40.069> and<00:03:40.280> then<00:03:40.370> your

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
your class two cargo rack and then your

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.059 
your class two cargo rack and then your
class<00:03:41.569> for<00:03:41.840> cargo<00:03:42.319> racks<00:03:42.530> are<00:03:42.680> actually<00:03:42.950> about

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
class for cargo racks are actually about

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.159 
class for cargo racks are actually about
thirty<00:03:43.400> thousand<00:03:43.910> credits<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.450> those<00:03:44.720> all<00:03:45.019> be

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
thirty thousand credits and those all be

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.920 
thirty thousand credits and those all be
probably<00:03:45.650> your<00:03:46.400> second<00:03:46.849> upgrade<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.569> then

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
probably your second upgrade and then

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
probably your second upgrade and then
your<00:03:48.019> show<00:03:48.139> generator<00:03:48.560> if<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.680> want<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:48.859> do

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
your show generator if you want to do

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.229 
your show generator if you want to do
that<00:03:49.099> as<00:03:49.190> well<00:03:49.340> that'll<00:03:49.819> be<00:03:49.910> your<00:03:50.030> next

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
that as well that'll be your next

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.460 
that as well that'll be your next
upgrade<00:03:50.389> after<00:03:50.780> than<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.230> what<00:03:51.380> should

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
upgrade after than that so what should

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.050 
upgrade after than that so what should
be<00:03:51.530> your<00:03:51.709> next<00:03:51.799> upgrade<00:03:52.220> after<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.639> internal

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
be your next upgrade after the internal

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.670 
be your next upgrade after the internal
compartments<00:03:53.660> well<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:53.900> pretty<00:03:54.019> simple<00:03:54.260> you

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
compartments well it's pretty simple you

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.559 
compartments well it's pretty simple you
only<00:03:54.859> going<00:03:55.340> for<00:03:55.579> your<00:03:55.669> frame<00:03:55.970> shift<00:03:56.299> driver

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
only going for your frame shift driver

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.670 
only going for your frame shift driver
that's<00:03:56.810> what<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:56.930> good<00:03:57.079> line<00:03:57.200> is<00:03:57.290> what<00:03:57.440> is<00:03:57.530> gonna

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
that's what a good line is what is gonna

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.220 
that's what a good line is what is gonna
mainly<00:03:58.130> increase<00:03:58.609> your<00:03:59.329> jump<00:03:59.720> range<00:04:00.019> which<00:04:00.200> is

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
mainly increase your jump range which is

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.259 
mainly increase your jump range which is
shown<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.799> bottom<00:04:01.069> right<00:04:01.280> here<00:04:01.579> but<00:04:02.180> of

shown in the bottom right here but of
course<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.690> power<00:04:02.870> your<00:04:03.019> frame<00:04:03.230> shift<00:04:03.440> around

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
course to power your frame shift around

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.720 
course to power your frame shift around
you're<00:04:03.799> going<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:03.980> want<00:04:04.099> to<00:04:04.130> be<00:04:04.250> changing<00:04:04.609> your

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
you're going to want to be changing your

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.699 
you're going to want to be changing your
power<00:04:04.910> plant<00:04:05.209> possibly<00:04:05.780> depending<00:04:06.500> on<00:04:06.590> the

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
power plant possibly depending on the

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:07.930 
power plant possibly depending on the
power<00:04:06.919> that<00:04:07.069> your<00:04:07.280> frame<00:04:07.430> shift<00:04:07.700> drive

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
power that your frame shift drive

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.550 
power that your frame shift drive
actually<00:04:08.389> needs<00:04:08.599> and<00:04:08.780> also<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.290> wanna<00:04:09.470> be

actually needs and also you wanna be
changing<00:04:09.950> your<00:04:09.980> power<00:04:10.250> distributor<00:04:10.849> so<00:04:11.120> your

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
changing your power distributor so your

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.479 
changing your power distributor so your
power<00:04:11.720> plant<00:04:12.019> this<00:04:12.859> is<00:04:12.980> what<00:04:13.129> powers<00:04:13.400> the

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
power plant this is what powers the

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.069 
power plant this is what powers the
frame<00:04:13.669> shift<00:04:13.910> drive<00:04:14.120> your<00:04:14.299> power<00:04:14.450> plant<00:04:14.750> wants

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
frame shift drive your power plant wants

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.110 
frame shift drive your power plant wants
to<00:04:15.349> be<00:04:15.500> as<00:04:15.709> light<00:04:16.340> as<00:04:16.549> possible<00:04:16.609> while

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
to be as light as possible while

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.050 
to be as light as possible while
providing<00:04:17.389> as<00:04:17.720> much<00:04:18.079> power<00:04:18.470> as<00:04:18.650> possible<00:04:19.060> for

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
providing as much power as possible for

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.089 
providing as much power as possible for
the<00:04:20.389> for<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.930> items<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.289> need<00:04:21.440> now<00:04:21.620> currently

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
the for the items you need now currently

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.070 
the for the items you need now currently
I<00:04:22.190> actually<00:04:22.430> only<00:04:22.760> have<00:04:23.120> about<00:04:23.300> eight<00:04:23.599> less

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
I actually only have about eight less

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.290 
I actually only have about eight less
than<00:04:24.260> eight<00:04:24.470> megawatts<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.580> I'm<00:04:25.639> using<00:04:25.970> and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
than eight megawatts that I'm using and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.460 
than eight megawatts that I'm using and
that<00:04:26.449> will<00:04:26.690> be<00:04:26.840> using<00:04:26.990> whenever<00:04:27.349> things

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
that will be using whenever things

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.740 
that will be using whenever things
deploy<00:04:27.860> if<00:04:28.099> you<00:04:28.190> have<00:04:28.400> any<00:04:28.520> hard<00:04:28.789> points<00:04:29.270> so

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
deploy if you have any hard points so

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.570 
deploy if you have any hard points so
actually<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.110> could<00:04:30.500> go<00:04:30.530> for<00:04:30.889> an<00:04:30.979> incredibly

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
actually I could go for an incredibly

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.620 
actually I could go for an incredibly
light<00:04:31.849> unit<00:04:32.389> like<00:04:33.699> like<00:04:34.699> this<00:04:34.820> one<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.210> could<00:04:35.539> go

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
light unit like like this one I could go

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.620 
light unit like like this one I could go
for<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.870> class<00:04:36.169> 2<00:04:36.650> rating<00:04:37.010> C<00:04:37.550> power<00:04:37.820> plan<00:04:38.349> for<00:04:39.349> a

my mask why salon is still gonna provide
enough<00:04:48.580> megawatts<00:04:49.580> for<00:04:50.120> what<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.270> actually

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
enough megawatts for what I actually

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.469 
enough megawatts for what I actually
need<00:04:51.050> it<00:04:51.380> so<00:04:52.009> it's<00:04:52.160> perfect<00:04:52.370> then<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.330> could

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
need it so it's perfect then that could

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.210 
need it so it's perfect then that could
be<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:53.630> downgrade<00:04:54.139> however<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.620> like<00:04:55.009> to

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
be a downgrade however I just like to

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.650 
be a downgrade however I just like to
have<00:04:55.370> their<00:04:55.550> possibilities<00:04:56.120> if<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.300> ever<00:04:56.389> go<00:04:56.599> to

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
have their possibilities if I ever go to

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.260 
have their possibilities if I ever go to
a<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:57.530> station<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.310> there's<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.550> higher<00:04:59.060> point

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
a a station and there's a higher point

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.400 
a a station and there's a higher point
where<00:04:59.449> anything<00:04:59.630> that<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.780> like<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.050> have<00:05:00.349> a

gonna have a matter of 10 tons and only
ten<00:05:12.349> point<00:05:12.590> four<00:05:12.710> megawatts<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.490> if<00:05:13.610> you're

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
ten point four megawatts and if you're

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.490 
ten point four megawatts and if you're
great<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:14.060> a<00:05:14.090> 4c<00:05:14.660> you're<00:05:15.139> actually<00:05:15.349> gonna<00:05:15.440> have

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
great to a 4c you're actually gonna have

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.290 
great to a 4c you're actually gonna have
a<00:05:15.620> half<00:05:16.099> the<00:05:16.340> mass<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.820> then<00:05:16.910> get<00:05:17.030> a<00:05:17.060> little

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
a half the mass and then get a little

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.610 
a half the mass and then get a little
bit<00:05:17.449> more<00:05:17.570> power<00:05:17.840> capacity<00:05:18.320> out<00:05:18.410> of<00:05:18.470> that

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
bit more power capacity out of that

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.050 
bit more power capacity out of that
that's<00:05:18.800> just<00:05:19.009> personal<00:05:19.370> preference<00:05:19.610> on<00:05:19.910> this

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
that's just personal preference on this

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.670 
that's just personal preference on this
but<00:05:20.240> make<00:05:20.389> sure<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.990> your<00:05:21.110> power<00:05:21.289> plant<00:05:21.560> can

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
but make sure that your power plant can

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.890 
but make sure that your power plant can
actually<00:05:21.919> power<00:05:22.130> all<00:05:22.490> of<00:05:22.880> your<00:05:23.030> things<00:05:23.330> when

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
actually power all of your things when

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.570 
actually power all of your things when
they<00:05:24.080> are<00:05:24.199> deployed<00:05:24.500> because<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:25.460> don't

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
they are deployed because you don't

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.700 
they are deployed because you don't
wanna<00:05:25.699> be<00:05:25.789> messing<00:05:25.940> around<00:05:26.120> with<00:05:26.509> them<00:05:26.900> you

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
wanna be messing around with them you

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.480 
wanna be messing around with them you
don't<00:05:27.740> really<00:05:27.919> wanna<00:05:28.099> be<00:05:28.160> messing<00:05:28.280> around

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
don't really wanna be messing around

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.180 
don't really wanna be messing around
with<00:05:28.789> your<00:05:29.110> power<00:05:30.110> distributor<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:30.889> thought

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
with your power distributor I thought

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.379 
with your power distributor I thought
it's<00:05:31.340> called<00:05:31.580> where<00:05:31.789> you<00:05:31.909> had<00:05:32.000> change<00:05:32.270> the

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
it's called where you had change the

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.820 
it's called where you had change the
priorities<00:05:32.870> of<00:05:32.900> everything<00:05:33.380> in<00:05:33.500> your<00:05:33.590> ship

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
priorities of everything in your ship

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.950 
priorities of everything in your ship
for<00:05:34.639> what<00:05:34.789> gets<00:05:35.000> powered<00:05:35.330> down<00:05:35.479> if<00:05:35.659> you<00:05:35.750> can't

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
for what gets powered down if you can't

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.870 
for what gets powered down if you can't
power<00:05:36.229> everything<00:05:36.620> so<00:05:36.889> just<00:05:37.070> make<00:05:37.190> sure<00:05:37.430> your

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
power everything so just make sure your

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.490 
power everything so just make sure your
power<00:05:38.060> come<00:05:38.330> from<00:05:38.360> power<00:05:38.840> plant<00:05:39.139> can<00:05:39.259> power

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
power come from power plant can power

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.689 
power come from power plant can power
everything<00:05:39.919> and<00:05:40.190> of<00:05:40.250> course<00:05:40.430> it's<00:05:40.610> gonna

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
everything and of course it's gonna

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.399 
everything and of course it's gonna
change<00:05:40.789> when<00:05:41.509> you<00:05:41.630> change<00:05:41.659> your<00:05:42.020> frame<00:05:42.169> shift

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
change when you change your frame shift

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.649 
change when you change your frame shift
drives<00:05:42.710> so<00:05:42.949> your<00:05:43.340> frame<00:05:43.490> shift<00:05:43.699> Drive<00:05:43.940> wants

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
drives so your frame shift Drive wants

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.810 
drives so your frame shift Drive wants
to<00:05:44.750> be<00:05:44.870> as<00:05:45.080> good<00:05:45.380> as<00:05:45.590> possible<00:05:45.949> and<00:05:46.490> of<00:05:46.610> course

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
to be as good as possible and of course

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.370 
to be as good as possible and of course
again<00:05:47.120> as<00:05:47.270> light<00:05:47.449> as<00:05:47.630> possible<00:05:48.050> so<00:05:48.199> if<00:05:48.289> I

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
again as light as possible so if I

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.379 
again as light as possible so if I
upgrade<00:05:48.740> for<00:05:48.889> instance<00:05:49.280> to<00:05:49.759> a<00:05:49.789> frame<00:05:50.240> shift

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
upgrade for instance to a frame shift

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.670 
you probably want to be maybe a four B
of<00:06:14.360> most<00:06:14.659> on<00:06:14.810> your<00:06:14.840> frame<00:06:15.080> shift<00:06:15.349> ride<00:06:15.530> because

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
of most on your frame shift ride because

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.800 
of most on your frame shift ride because
if<00:06:15.830> you<00:06:15.889> go<00:06:15.979> into<00:06:16.099> a<00:06:16.190> 4a<00:06:16.550> that's<00:06:17.090> I<00:06:17.360> think

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
if you go into a 4a that's I think

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.600 
if you go into a 4a that's I think
that's<00:06:17.990> almost<00:06:18.320> that's<00:06:18.830> over<00:06:19.159> six<00:06:19.370> hundred

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
that's almost that's over six hundred

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.159 
that's almost that's over six hundred
thousand<00:06:19.909> credits<00:06:20.240> by<00:06:20.360> that<00:06:20.509> time<00:06:20.719> you

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
thousand credits by that time you

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.719 
thousand credits by that time you
probably<00:06:21.409> want<00:06:21.560> to<00:06:21.590> be<00:06:21.710> upgrading<00:06:22.370> to<00:06:22.460> a<00:06:22.490> lake

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
probably want to be upgrading to a lake

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.379 
probably want to be upgrading to a lake
on<00:06:22.909> site<00:06:23.150> six<00:06:23.509> but<00:06:24.050> okay<00:06:24.409> so<00:06:25.340> class<00:06:25.820> 4c

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
on site six but okay so class 4c

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.120 
on site six but okay so class 4c
probably<00:06:26.930> very<00:06:27.110> possible<00:06:27.530> right<00:06:27.680> there<00:06:27.949> and

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
probably very possible right there and

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.950 
probably very possible right there and
you've<00:06:28.310> you've<00:06:28.699> increased<00:06:29.000> your<00:06:29.240> jump<00:06:29.659> range

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
you've you've increased your jump range

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.320 
you've you've increased your jump range
by<00:06:30.469> four<00:06:30.889> light<00:06:31.159> years<00:06:31.190> off<00:06:31.550> three<00:06:32.120> light

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
by four light years off three light

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.850 
by four light years off three light
years<00:06:32.539> the<00:06:32.659> boot<00:06:32.810> over<00:06:33.020> three<00:06:33.229> light<00:06:33.440> years<00:06:33.680> so

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
years the boot over three light years so

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.890 
years the boot over three light years so
that's<00:06:34.009> very<00:06:34.159> good<00:06:34.449> next<00:06:35.449> one<00:06:35.570> is<00:06:35.659> your<00:06:35.780> power

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
that's very good next one is your power

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.390 
that's very good next one is your power
distributor<00:06:36.380> a<00:06:36.409> lot<00:06:36.590> of<00:06:36.650> people<00:06:36.889> don't<00:06:37.130> seem

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
distributor a lot of people don't seem

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.610 
distributor a lot of people don't seem
to<00:06:37.430> upgrade<00:06:37.909> this<00:06:38.030> one<00:06:38.240> but<00:06:38.419> I<00:06:38.599> do<00:06:38.659> because<00:06:39.590> you

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
to upgrade this one but I do because you

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.510 
to upgrade this one but I do because you
can<00:06:39.830> have<00:06:39.949> constant<00:06:40.550> boost<00:06:41.229> for<00:06:42.229> it<00:06:42.289> so<00:06:42.680> right

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
can have constant boost for it so right

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.779 
can have constant boost for it so right
now<00:06:43.699> your<00:06:44.120> power<00:06:44.270> distributor<00:06:44.780> actually<00:06:45.789> does

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
now your power distributor actually does

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.100 
now your power distributor actually does
all<00:06:46.969> of<00:06:47.120> these<00:06:47.240> things<00:06:47.509> increases<00:06:47.990> your

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
all of these things increases your

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.659 
all of these things increases your
engines<00:06:48.409> capacity<00:06:48.860> mainly<00:06:49.190> for<00:06:49.370> us<00:06:49.430> though

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
engines capacity mainly for us though

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.540 
engines capacity mainly for us though
and<00:06:49.909> your<00:06:50.029> engines<00:06:50.449> recharge<00:06:51.080> with<00:06:51.830> what<00:06:52.430> I've

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
and your engines recharge with what I've

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.480 
and your engines recharge with what I've
got<00:06:52.699> right<00:06:52.729> now<00:06:53.000> it's<00:06:53.210> a

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
got right now it's a

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.749 
got right now it's a
last<00:06:53.669> three<00:06:53.940> a<00:06:54.270> power<00:06:54.840> distributor<00:06:55.440> me<00:06:56.250> allows

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
last three a power distributor me allows

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.760 
last three a power distributor me allows
me<00:06:56.940> to<00:06:57.060> stay<00:06:57.270> in<00:06:57.449> boost<00:06:57.810> constantly<00:06:58.620> so

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
me to stay in boost constantly so

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.219 
me to stay in boost constantly so
instead<00:06:59.069> of<00:06:59.220> traveling<00:06:59.610> at<00:06:59.729> less<00:06:59.940> than<00:07:00.080> 300<00:07:01.080> on

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
instead of traveling at less than 300 on

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:02.900 
instead of traveling at less than 300 on
the<00:07:01.650> speed<00:07:01.860> armor<00:07:02.099> when<00:07:02.280> you're<00:07:02.370> not<00:07:02.460> in<00:07:02.580> super

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
the speed armor when you're not in super

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.900 
the speed armor when you're not in super
cruise<00:07:03.150> I'm<00:07:03.419> actually<00:07:03.660> traveling<00:07:04.229> almost<00:07:04.910> 400

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
cruise I'm actually traveling almost 400

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.100 
cruise I'm actually traveling almost 400
all<00:07:06.090> of<00:07:06.360> the<00:07:06.449> time

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
all of the time

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.050 
all of the time
when<00:07:07.380> you<00:07:07.470> got<00:07:07.590> there<00:07:07.770> power<00:07:07.949> distributor<00:07:08.880> so

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
when you got there power distributor so

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.980 
when you got there power distributor so
as<00:07:09.150> soon<00:07:09.270> as<00:07:09.360> you<00:07:09.449> come<00:07:09.539> out<00:07:09.630> of<00:07:09.690> hyperspace

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990 
as soon as you come out of hyperspace

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.089 
as soon as you come out of hyperspace
and<00:07:11.449> super<00:07:12.449> cruise<00:07:12.710> station<00:07:13.710> you<00:07:13.830> can<00:07:13.979> now

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:14.099 
and super cruise station you can now

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.360 
and super cruise station you can now
track<00:07:14.400> be<00:07:14.520> traveling<00:07:14.849> at<00:07:14.970> 400<00:07:15.680> instead<00:07:16.680> of<00:07:16.830> 300

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370 
track be traveling at 400 instead of 300

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.309 
track be traveling at 400 instead of 300
much<00:07:17.759> better<00:07:18.270> so<00:07:18.720> with<00:07:18.840> those<00:07:18.930> things<00:07:19.139> up

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 
much better so with those things up

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.170 
much better so with those things up
Grady<00:07:19.560> you<00:07:19.949> can<00:07:20.069> also<00:07:20.220> grade<00:07:20.550> your<00:07:20.699> thrusters

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
Grady you can also grade your thrusters

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.939 
Grady you can also grade your thrusters
that<00:07:21.539> is<00:07:21.630> going<00:07:21.750> to<00:07:21.810> give<00:07:21.930> you<00:07:22.020> more<00:07:22.229> increased

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:22.949 
that is going to give you more increased

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:25.309 
that is going to give you more increased
speed<00:07:23.460> I<00:07:23.789> think<00:07:24.210> it's<00:07:24.330> cell<00:07:24.449> acceleration<00:07:25.080> and

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 
speed I think it's cell acceleration and

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:27.080 
speed I think it's cell acceleration and
more<00:07:25.470> top<00:07:25.710> speed<00:07:26.039> so<00:07:26.340> you<00:07:26.400> can<00:07:26.580> get<00:07:26.849> that<00:07:26.970> as

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.090 
more top speed so you can get that as

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.390 
more top speed so you can get that as
well<00:07:27.300> for<00:07:27.750> a<00:07:27.810> really<00:07:28.229> really<00:07:28.259> around<00:07:28.860> stations

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 
well for a really really around stations

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.430 
well for a really really around stations
and<00:07:29.610> of<00:07:30.150> course<00:07:30.419> your<00:07:30.659> life<00:07:30.840> support<00:07:31.289> and

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 
and of course your life support and

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.379 
and of course your life support and
senses<00:07:32.009> you<00:07:32.190> can<00:07:32.310> actually<00:07:32.460> get<00:07:32.729> the<00:07:32.880> lightest

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:33.389 
senses you can actually get the lightest

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.029 
senses you can actually get the lightest
version<00:07:33.599> of<00:07:33.960> them<00:07:34.080> that<00:07:34.229> you<00:07:34.289> can<00:07:34.349> find<00:07:34.740> and

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 
version of them that you can find and

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:36.800 
version of them that you can find and
that's<00:07:35.220> gonna<00:07:35.430> of<00:07:35.639> course<00:07:35.669> reduce<00:07:36.479> your<00:07:36.599> mass

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810 
that's gonna of course reduce your mass

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.529 
that's gonna of course reduce your mass
and<00:07:36.990> increase<00:07:37.440> your<00:07:37.470> jump<00:07:38.009> range<00:07:38.460> and<00:07:38.819> then<00:07:39.389> of

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:39.539 
and increase your jump range and then of

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:40.520 
and increase your jump range and then of
course<00:07:39.750> when<00:07:39.870> you<00:07:39.960> go<00:07:40.020> and<00:07:40.110> have<00:07:40.199> credit<00:07:40.440> to

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
course when you go and have credit to

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.170 
course when you go and have credit to
trading<00:07:40.710> the<00:07:40.889> ship<00:07:41.099> for<00:07:41.280> a<00:07:41.340> lake<00:07:41.490> on<00:07:41.610> top<00:07:41.880> seats

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 
trading the ship for a lake on top seats

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.610 
trading the ship for a lake on top seats
you<00:07:42.330> can<00:07:42.360> then<00:07:42.599> go<00:07:42.780> ahead<00:07:42.810> and<00:07:43.139> do<00:07:43.229> that<00:07:43.440> like

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 
you can then go ahead and do that like

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.260 
you can then go ahead and do that like
I'm<00:07:43.770> just<00:07:43.919> about<00:07:44.099> to<00:07:44.250> do<00:07:44.400> and<00:07:44.729> that<00:07:44.849> is<00:07:44.970> it<00:07:45.120> guys

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.270 
I'm just about to do and that is it guys

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.089 
I'm just about to do and that is it guys
so<00:07:45.509> hopefully<00:07:45.900> this<00:07:46.050> has<00:07:46.169> helped<00:07:46.620> if<00:07:46.770> it<00:07:46.889> has

00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:47.099 
so hopefully this has helped if it has
