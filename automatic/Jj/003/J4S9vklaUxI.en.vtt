00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.790
 at 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.790
 what is life on distant worlds 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.200
 habitability of celestial bodies so far 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.719
 remains in question 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.910
 even better astronomers do not dare 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.560
 speak out on this issue reason 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.040
 mainly lies in conceit 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.630
 man he does not want to admit 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.040
 embodiment in other conditions 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.040
 except earth 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 inhabited of course from an earthly point of view 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.840
 stay maybe not everywhere but how 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.840
 those are essentially world and inhabited 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.000
 all these are different evolutions 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.860
 accessible to each other 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 but it won't be a big mistake to say that 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.100
 all manifested 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.140
 space is inhabited 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.989
 microscope will show life on any 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.930
 throughout the planet the same law and in 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.480
 space 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 but it would be a mistake to imagine everything 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.400
 worlds life from our understanding on 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.190
 today we forget so easily yesterday and 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.970
 few imagine tomorrow that many of ours 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.740
 judgments only autumn leaves 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.860
 need to realize the simple thing is that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.060
 inhabited by steel space does not mean form 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.369
 land 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.420
 life on other planets can not be 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.640
 judged by the level of earthly life 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.380
 our way of being is by no means 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.790
 case cannot be considered as 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 way applicable to other planets 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.150
 nature and life on other planets of ours 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.640
 solar system 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.240
 completely different from those that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.680
 exists in our land 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.870
 human evolution is considered the crown 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.930
 the universe but the earth man is still very 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.360
 rough in its shape and fabric compared to 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.360
 the inhabitants of say jupiter and venus 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.619
 on higher planets there are fewer animals and they 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.649
 much committing so on venus at all 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.140
 no insects and predators there present 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.920
 the realm of flying fly and people fly 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.440
 birds and even fish, and birds understand 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.959
 human speech 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.980
 paint fish and bird plumage reach 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.959
 amazing combination of beauty 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.440
 people can't get close to far 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.780
 worlds in the earthly state but in fire 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.670
 the body the best perfume approached the other 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.099
 to the planets and carried away memories from 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.069
 surface structure and color 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.989
 populations 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.319
 rare are such experiences yet 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.230
 exist they can strengthen the mind about 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.319
 boundless reality 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.170
 in flights to distant worlds there is 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.670
 the peculiarity of their whole being can 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.650
 seem strange at the base 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.930
 unity are represented by so many 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.600
 differences even with phenomena that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.880
 resemble earthly 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.880
 also strikes their inner feature 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.650
 colors resemble earth colors but 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.590
 the essence of them is a completely different depth and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.380
 transparency of paints are not comparable with 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.190
 the seas of the earth 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.470
 the atmosphere itself is rosy 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.410
 such a rainbow is not like a rainbow 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.350
 terrestrial fish fly but their colors 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.990
 unrepeatable among earthly 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.510
 the plumage of birds is not similar in their colors to 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.970
 the most luxurious birds of the earth 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.989
 people resemble earthly but at the same time 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.689
 hit with the finest fabrics 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:39.360
 everything almost resembles the best singing of the earth 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:41.610
 but the meaning of the voices is different 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.760
 such a distinction strikes earthly consciousness 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.000
 need to get used to the diversity of spaces 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.790
 good for those who are already ready in a dense body 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.590
 perceive the diversity of worlds 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.870
 do not think that it is perceived and easy 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.280
 need to collect a lot of experience to 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.340
 allow reality 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.170
 the word admit is the meaning 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.180
 evolution 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.060
 what is told in the legend about flying to 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.910
 your planet 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.540
 friends we fly easily perceive 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.660
 the radiance of distant worlds we approached 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.280
 they know their essence 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.370
 I want to tell you how I remember 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.199
 distant world 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.169
 the state before him is huge but we are flying 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.690
 instantly you could not step on 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.520
 new soil which is alien to us even in 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.009
 fire body 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.039
 but you can see the outlines of the seas 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:37.419
 enjoy the beautiful colors even birds 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:41.370
 and fish are already visible people are not like us and 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:44.580
 wonderful to say they fly 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.970
 their language can not be heard because 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.540
 I remember blue as a sphere 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.710
 sapphires and emerald greens and emeralds 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.710
 similar mountains 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.120
 it seemed that 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.210
 century 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.880
 buy air on such clean soil 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.040
 can't take us on 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.080
 touching him we suffer 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.880
 returning to our body is stuffy as in 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.260
 narrow clothes 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.300
 so every experience is both sweet and hard 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.840
 heart longing for distant worlds 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.480
 makes up a special kind of longing 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:28.630
 can not fit into the Earth lesson 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.630
 aura of heart many have experienced 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.190
 but nothing will destroy 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.630
 worlds of those who approached them in 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.630
 fire body 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:45.590
 even the stars are immense and the memory of 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.840
 distant worlds are incompatible with words 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.390
 one vision of distant worlds already 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.280
 transforms all life 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.280
 understand at least a part of other life 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.080
 the worlds will remain a vivid memory 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.970
 forever and ever 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.190
 such an approximation is already an insight 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.190
 consciousness 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.700
 realize the world and inhabited need to understand 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.850
 these oceans of thought that give birth to music 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.850
 spheres
