00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 I'm sure you've heard that it's coming 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.609
 to her and is that Coca-Cola just 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.810
 throw that bottle inspired by that 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.179
 from 1915 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 I wanted to join this that arrives and I'm going to 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.719
 make a boom cake too that you know 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 which is a very traditional biscuit very 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.010
 classic from the USA made a cake of 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.080
 Coca-Cola with chocolate sabritas let's go to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.180
 start first of all by adding a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 little bit of lemon juice to our milk 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.510
 you already know that this is to create as 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.090
 homemade buttermilk that will do that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.529
 our cake is much juicier 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.789
 good when adding lemon juice what 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.040
 we're going to get is that the milk is 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 cut and then developed much more 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.239
 juicy and not worth if you have a package 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.469
 milk a little cut in the healthy fridge 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.000
 vale vale has to be is in the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.950
 moment and now what we are going to do is going 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.530
 to be heating the cocacola with the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.969
 Butter 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.969
 we place it in a saucepan 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.129
 and we're going to add the butter 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.170
 and we're going to warm it up until it founds the 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.699
 butter and it's important that I local 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.050
 in teis too much is simply worth a 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.050
 little bit is spreading little by little 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.620
 good as it is almost melted what 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 I'm going to do next is going to be 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.160
 sift the dry ingredients that are 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.750
 bicarbonate flours and cocoa is very 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.610
 important that cocoa be pure without 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 sugar is worth so that by reacting 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.220
 bicarbonate if not it will not work what 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.220
 sieve masters well 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.159
 we put it in the blender and then for 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.840
 here this has already been completely fused 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.630
 so what I'm going to do is going to be very 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.570
 simple I'm going to place these guys here 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.000
 of sugar the white 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.400
 and the brunette is going to make the car 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.370
 be super juicy for the remove very 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.690
 all right 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.690
 and we add the eggs 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.570
 as we see again 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.640
 and when this is already incorporated 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.899
 turn on the blender and add little to 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.549
 little I tell you that if you do not have 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.360
 hand blender you are stirring while 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.360
 add liquids 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.240
 and finally what we are going to incorporate 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.890
 it's the milk that you're going to see now 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.450
 when you add jce you will have like 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.680
 small groups do not panic what is it 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.780
 what we want is worth so that it is more 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.970
 juicy still the sponge cake 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.679
 well we mix it until the dough is 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.390
 homogeneous it is very important that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.800
 mix at low speed and if you are 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.970
 doing at home then that with 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.800
 tranquility is not necessary in 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.209
 white, you can beat the crazy thing 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.650
 let's do is going to be throwing the dough to 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.300
 our mold look I have a bowl of 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.830
 munt cakes are these that have a 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.480
 hole in the center that in these is 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.010
 very good and also very nice and what 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.780
 It has been grease what I used spray 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.160
 overflowing but if you do not have at home 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.500
 so you put some butter 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.000
 fused is what I painted jce with a brush 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.410
 or with butter ointment and then a 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.209
 little bit of flour in this case as it is 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.650
 of chocolate and cocacola what would I do 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.600
 would sift some cocoa powder 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.040
 no sugar on top so it does not 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.630
 take off but leave us white spots 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.580
 you see that it is a super liquid mass is 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.230
 which is very juicy later if 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.200
 spectacular and I have the oven 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.540
 preheated to 180 degrees is worth hot 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.670
 up and down and I'm going to put it in the oven 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.560
 one hour if you see that it is done in 50 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.140
 minutes can be but less than one hour 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.610
 in a mold of this difficult type so 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.800
 we are going to put it until when we click on 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.780
 stick out clean and then before 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.760
 unmold you have to wait at least 20 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.900
 minutes if it does not stick if it breaks you 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.030
 I say it from experience and face see you 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.760
 Well ki-moon already have the cake 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.530
 I have nothing already practically cold you see 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.599
 that has disassembled it without problems my 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.579
 advice is if you have doubts leave him 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.409
 cool half a long hour inside the 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.329
 mold so as not to risk me has 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.129
 Looked well below, look, you see, not what 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.260
 I had to cut or anything but there are times 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.150
 we grow too much on top because bad 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.890
 or by thais nobody will find out you cut 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.329
 what about good we put it here in 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.189
 the plate and we're going to prepare a glaze 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.629
 of cocacola so I have sugar here 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.560
 and what I 'm going to do is going to be 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.560
 add cocacola 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.170
 I'm going to start stirring and I'm going to continue 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.000
 adding until you have the consistency 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.100
 perfect that is more or less like that of 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.840
 a greek yogurt care that maybe 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.850
 You throw a little more and you spend like this 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.580
 that you have to have patience and stirring 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.810
 with strength you see that it is based more or 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.810
 less but it's too dense 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.060
 and now to touch it be what is what 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.740
 more nervous puts me what we are placing 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.550
 so that it is above and falls 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.300
 by the sides 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.980
 It looks like a cash coke with the foam 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.600
 this gives a great touch one if 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.000
 You see that you have a lot of fluid you are going to see 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.470
 that immediately falls and stains everything and 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.269
 for the next time then you have a little 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.650
 less coca-cola and that's it and now 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.700
 as a final touch I think we're going to 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.230
 put the sprinters red 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.020
 you have not seen how easy how fast 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.480
 the cocacola funk the only thing you already know 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.940
 grease the mold well or put it with 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.919
 butter and flour and cocoa and then 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.690
 Nothing expected to demold to be cold 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.420
 that if you load it and now I'm going to 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.630
 eat this let's go inside nothing 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.630
 do not 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.190
 do not
