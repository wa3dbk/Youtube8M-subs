00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
might try feeding her one more time a

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.009 
might try feeding her one more time a
small<00:03:49.030> amount<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.420> see<00:03:49.629> if<00:03:49.690> she<00:03:49.840> has<00:03:49.930> an

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
small amount and see if she has an

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.649 
small amount and see if she has an
adverse<00:03:50.290> reaction<00:03:50.769> to<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.480> seemed

like a weird coincidence that her nose
swelled<00:03:55.239> up<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.540> she<00:03:55.659> got<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.840> cold<00:03:56.109> right
