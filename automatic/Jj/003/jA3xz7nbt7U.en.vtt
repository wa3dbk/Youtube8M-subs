you<00:00:32.680> see<00:00:32.829> Ivan<00:00:33.130> Pavlov<00:00:33.640> he<00:00:33.790> completed<00:00:34.270> his

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
you see Ivan Pavlov he completed his

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.870 
you see Ivan Pavlov he completed his
research<00:00:34.960> in<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.710> laboratory<00:00:35.980> with<00:00:36.640> boundaries

however we have more in common with
Pavlov's<00:00:43.210> dogs<00:00:43.570> and<00:00:43.870> we<00:00:43.960> may<00:00:44.110> care<00:00:44.380> to<00:00:44.680> admit

you<00:00:48.070> see<00:00:50.250> Pavlov's<00:00:51.250> initial<00:00:51.760> research<00:00:51.970> was

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
you see Pavlov's initial research was

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.690 
you see Pavlov's initial research was
focused<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.829> salivation<00:00:54.460> of<00:00:54.850> dogs<00:00:55.810> at<00:00:56.700> the

salivated this led him to develop his

like those before us is here to stay and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.780 
like those before us is here to stay and
we<00:02:52.569> must<00:02:52.780> use<00:02:53.200> it<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.560> our<00:02:53.590> advantage<00:02:53.790> rather

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
we must use it to our advantage rather

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.590 
we must use it to our advantage rather
than<00:02:55.030> allow<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.630> lead<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.140> our<00:02:56.260> demise<00:02:57.600> it

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
than allow it to lead to our demise it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.240 
than allow it to lead to our demise it
is<00:02:59.290> my<00:02:59.610> thought<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.989> between<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.680> stimulus

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
is my thought that between the stimulus

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.030 
is my thought that between the stimulus
a<00:03:03.489> ka<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.090> notification<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:04.959> our<00:03:05.440> subsequent

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
a ka the notification and our subsequent

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.550 
a ka the notification and our subsequent
