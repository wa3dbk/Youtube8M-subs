wait a couple minutes for this product
to<00:03:01.910> kind<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.090> set<00:03:02.269> into<00:03:02.540> my<00:03:02.660> skin<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
to kind of set into my skin and the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.759 
to kind of set into my skin and the
foundation<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.790> I'm<00:03:05.060> actually<00:03:05.269> using<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
foundation that I'm actually using the

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.740 
foundation that I'm actually using the
is<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.100> Chanel<00:03:07.430> bottle<00:03:07.730> Lumiere<00:03:08.060> aqua<00:03:08.510> I

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
is the Chanel bottle Lumiere aqua I

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.960 
is the Chanel bottle Lumiere aqua I
wouldn't<00:03:09.350> say<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.530> this<00:03:09.830> foundation<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:10.880> a

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
wouldn't say that this foundation it's a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.460 
wouldn't say that this foundation it's a
completely<00:03:11.299> matte<00:03:11.570> foundation<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.260> think

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
completely matte foundation and I think

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.690 
completely matte foundation and I think
this<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.709> probably<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.100> best<00:03:13.310> foundation

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
this is probably the best foundation

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.580 
this is probably the best foundation
that<00:03:14.510> could<00:03:14.690> probably<00:03:14.900> test<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.320> out<00:03:15.410> with

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
that could probably test it out with

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.680 
that could probably test it out with
just<00:03:15.650> because<00:03:16.220> although<00:03:16.820> we<00:03:17.060> really<00:03:17.330> do<00:03:17.510> love

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
just because although we really do love

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.660 
just because although we really do love
this<00:03:17.840> foundation<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.709> probably<00:03:19.160> not<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
this foundation this is probably not the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.630 
this foundation this is probably not the
best<00:03:19.700> foundation<00:03:20.150> as<00:03:20.870> far<00:03:21.170> as<00:03:21.519> lasting<00:03:22.519> all

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
best foundation as far as lasting all

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.280 
best foundation as far as lasting all
day<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.090> preventing<00:03:23.540> my<00:03:23.630> skin<00:03:23.900> from<00:03:23.989> getting

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
day and preventing my skin from getting

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.940 
day and preventing my skin from getting
oily<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.920> as<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.549> was<00:03:25.700> applying<00:03:25.940> my<00:03:26.360> foundation

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
oily and as I was applying my foundation

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.300 
oily and as I was applying my foundation
and<00:03:27.250> powder<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.150> stuff<00:03:28.540> my<00:03:29.260> face<00:03:29.530> almost

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
and powder and stuff my face almost

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.510 
and powder and stuff my face almost
looked<00:03:30.670> really<00:03:31.360> dry<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.709> don't<00:03:32.770> know<00:03:33.130> if

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
looked really dry and I don't know if

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.339 
looked really dry and I don't know if
it's<00:03:33.700> because<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.300> already<00:03:34.510> working<00:03:34.959> or

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
it's because it's already working or

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.990 
it's because it's already working or
just<00:03:35.590> because<00:03:35.860> my<00:03:36.040> face<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.430> actually<00:03:36.580> really

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
just because my face is actually really

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.830 
just because my face is actually really
just<00:03:37.180> dry<00:03:37.420> today

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840
