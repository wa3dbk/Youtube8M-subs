to increase the pressure you can lift

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.460 
to increase the pressure you can lift
one<00:01:48.550> foot<00:01:48.820> up<00:01:49.000> one<00:01:49.390> they<00:01:49.540> got<00:01:49.690> good<00:01:50.230> all<00:01:50.410> over

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
pressure you're due to foam rolling like

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.860 
pressure you're due to foam rolling like
I<00:01:55.810> am<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:57.130> gonna<00:01:57.250> feel<00:01:57.460> good<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.780> gonna

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
I am it's gonna feel good it's gonna

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.780 
I am it's gonna feel good it's gonna
feel<00:01:59.080> intense

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.300 

now<00:02:02.360> we're<00:02:02.540> getting<00:02:02.720> into<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.960> IT<00:02:03.110> band<00:02:03.680> the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
now we're getting into the IT band the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.060 
now we're getting into the IT band the
lateral<00:02:04.610> side<00:02:04.820> of<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.000> diet<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:06.560> we're<00:02:06.980> going

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
lateral side of the diet so we're going

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.830 
lateral side of the diet so we're going
to<00:02:07.130> get<00:02:07.250> there<00:02:07.460> we<00:02:07.670> can<00:02:07.700> put<00:02:07.970> one<00:02:08.119> foot<00:02:08.300> in

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
to get there we can put one foot in

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.110 
to get there we can put one foot in
front<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.170> other<00:02:09.290> and<00:02:09.910> we're<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:10.970> gonna

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
front of the other and we're just gonna

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.340 
front of the other and we're just gonna
shift<00:02:11.450> our<00:02:11.630> bodyweight<00:02:12.310> left<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.520> right<00:02:13.700> now

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
shift our bodyweight left and right now

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:25.559 
shift our bodyweight left and right now
this<00:02:15.350> one's<00:02:15.560> going<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.740> be<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.860> bit<00:02:16.040> painful

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.980 

get<00:02:25.900> those<00:02:26.079> knots<00:02:26.379> out<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.920> Cena<00:02:27.129> fix<00:02:27.370> it

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
get those knots out and Cena fix it

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.840 
get those knots out and Cena fix it
so<00:02:28.350> hopefully<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.800> pain<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.310> eventually<00:02:29.550> go

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
so hopefully the pain we eventually go

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.770 
so hopefully the pain we eventually go
away

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
away

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.440 
away
now<00:02:32.230> we're<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.530> get<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.910> inside<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
now we're to get in the inside of the
