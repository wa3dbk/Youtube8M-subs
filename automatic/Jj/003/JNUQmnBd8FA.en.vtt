gate<00:00:15.750> C<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:18.330> interesting<00:00:18.840> thing<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.050> this

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
gate C the interesting thing about this

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.189 
gate C the interesting thing about this
gate<00:00:19.680> C<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:19.980> for<00:00:20.670> starters<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:22.020> an

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
gate C is for starters it's it's an

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.370 
gate C is for starters it's it's an
adapter<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:22.890> eetzi<00:00:23.670> Alpine<00:00:24.150> binding<00:00:24.390> it

adapter for eetzi Alpine binding it

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.339 
adapter for eetzi Alpine binding it
works<00:00:25.619> by<00:00:25.890> having<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.430> plastic<00:00:27.000> plate

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
works by having this plastic plate

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.320 
works by having this plastic plate
that's<00:00:28.349> screwed<00:00:29.039> underneath<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> toe<00:00:29.910> unit

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
that's screwed underneath the toe unit

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.569 
that's screwed underneath the toe unit
and<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.260> boots<00:00:31.439> put<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and the boots put in there and that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.090 
and the boots put in there and that
allows<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.899> lifting<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.649> heel

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
allows you the the lifting of the heel

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.299 
allows you the the lifting of the heel
and<00:00:35.309> then<00:00:36.210> when<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> put<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.980> binding<00:00:37.980> in

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and then when you put the binding in

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.270 
and then when you put the binding in
Alpine<00:00:38.700> mode<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> heel<00:00:40.350> unit<00:00:40.559> actually<00:00:41.070> goes

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
Alpine mode the heel unit actually goes

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.729 
Alpine mode the heel unit actually goes
back<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.730> forth<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.329> track<00:00:42.690> with<00:00:43.590> this

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
back and forth on this track with this

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
back and forth on this track with this
little<00:00:44.070> tab<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.260> move<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.559> hand<00:00:48.140> so

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
little tab you move with your hand so

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.170 
little tab you move with your hand so
when<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> tour<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:51.000> boot

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
when you want a tour you put your boot

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.729 
when you want a tour you put your boot
in<00:00:52.280> this<00:00:53.280> plate<00:00:53.670> system<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.110> strap<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
in this plate system you strap it in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.330 
in this plate system you strap it in
with<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:57.050> classic<00:00:58.050> leather<00:00:58.289> strap<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.340> it

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
with a classic leather strap and then it

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.649 
with a classic leather strap and then it
allows<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> heel<00:01:03.149> lift<00:01:03.619> theoretically

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
allows you to heel lift theoretically

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.640 
allows you to heel lift theoretically
you<00:01:06.659> probably<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> tighten<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.590> down

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
you probably have to tighten this down

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.980 
you probably have to tighten this down
pretty<00:01:08.159> good<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.909> give<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.210> thing<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
pretty good to give this thing to to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.289 
pretty good to give this thing to to
work<00:01:10.170> right<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> allows<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.060> freely

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
work right and then it allows you freely

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.320 
work right and then it allows you freely
limited<00:01:12.780> heel<00:01:12.960> lift<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.530> still<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:14.820> allows

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
limited heel lift but still use allows

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
limited heel lift but still use allows
you<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> ski<00:01:15.869> tour<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:16.500> alpine

adapter<00:02:14.180> system<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.200> gates<00:02:15.500> he<00:02:15.680> made

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
adapter system that the gates he made

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920 
adapter system that the gates he made
and<00:02:18.880> one<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.030> more<00:02:20.180> interesting<00:02:20.420> things

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
and one of the more interesting things

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.860 
and one of the more interesting things
about<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.410> gate<00:02:22.040> C<00:02:22.250> binding<00:02:22.760> was<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.569> it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
about this gate C binding was that it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.380 
about this gate C binding was that it
provided<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:24.500> heel<00:02:24.770> lift<00:02:24.950> which<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:26.209> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
provided a heel lift which in the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.320 
provided a heel lift which in the
mid-1960s<00:02:27.260> or<00:02:27.709> earlier<00:02:28.100> most<00:02:29.000> people

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
mid-1960s or earlier most people

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.030 
mid-1960s or earlier most people
actually<00:02:29.510> thought<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.940> heel<00:02:31.940> lift<00:02:32.180> was<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
actually thought that heel lift was a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.010 
actually thought that heel lift was a
relative<00:02:34.040> vented<00:02:34.340> by<00:02:34.489> Paul<00:02:34.730> rammer<00:02:35.030> but<00:02:35.390> this

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
relative vented by Paul rammer but this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.380 
relative vented by Paul rammer but this
binding<00:02:36.500> had<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.190> pretty<00:02:37.550> elegant<00:02:37.730> way<00:02:38.150> of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
binding had a pretty elegant way of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.199 
binding had a pretty elegant way of
providing<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.230> heel<00:02:39.500> lift<00:02:39.680> with<00:02:40.519> your<00:02:40.700> foot

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
providing a heel lift with your foot

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.000 
providing a heel lift with your foot
flat<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> ski<00:02:42.110> he<00:02:42.230> would<00:02:42.380> tour<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.830> way

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
flat on the ski he would tour this way

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.160 
flat on the ski he would tour this way
if<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.640> wanted<00:02:43.910> your<00:02:44.150> heel<00:02:44.330> flat<00:02:44.630> on<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> ski

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
if you wanted your heel flat on the ski

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.170 
if you wanted your heel flat on the ski
for<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> year<00:02:46.100> left<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.519> would<00:02:46.580> just<00:02:46.790> engage

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
for a year left you would just engage

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.810 
for a year left you would just engage
the<00:02:47.480> healing<00:02:48.440> unit<00:02:48.560> into<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.070> Alpine<00:02:49.489> mode

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
the healing unit into the Alpine mode

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.290 
the healing unit into the Alpine mode
and<00:02:50.090> then<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.170> heel<00:02:51.670> rests<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.790> top<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.239> the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
and then the heel rests on top of the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.470 
and then the heel rests on top of the
heel<00:02:53.480> unit<00:02:53.720> providing<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.530> heel<00:02:54.709> lift<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:56.450> uh

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
heel unit providing the heel lift was uh

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.540 
heel unit providing the heel lift was uh
really<00:02:57.260> fascinating<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.040> see<00:02:58.250> how<00:02:58.280> this

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
really fascinating to see how this

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.650 
really fascinating to see how this
worked<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.150> quite<00:02:59.840> elegant<00:03:00.410> really
