and they still need to remain 100%
accurate<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.079> we<00:01:30.109> started<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:30.649> what<00:01:30.770> a

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
accurate so we started with what a

accurate so we started with what a
customer's<00:01:31.340> told<00:01:31.609> us<00:01:31.700> was<00:01:31.880> important<00:01:32.390> keeping

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
customer's told us was important keeping

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.910

the belief that form follows function

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.380 
the belief that form follows function
we<00:01:36.460> started<00:01:36.790> with<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.030> important

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
we started with the important

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.930 
we started with the important
functionality<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.440> display<00:01:38.800> user<00:01:39.430> interface

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
functionality the display user interface

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.390 
functionality the display user interface
etc<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.930> then<00:01:41.050> we<00:01:41.080> thought<00:01:41.320> okay<00:01:41.560> what's<00:01:42.280> it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
etc and then we thought okay what's it

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.310 
etc and then we thought okay what's it
going<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.640> be<00:01:42.700> in<00:01:43.020> noodle<00:01:44.020> we're<00:01:44.110> going<00:01:44.260> to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
going to be in noodle we're going to

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.080 
going to be in noodle we're going to
have<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.470> hard<00:01:44.710> life<00:01:44.950> so<00:01:45.580> they<00:01:45.670> needed<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:45.970> be

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
have a hard life so they needed to be

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.450 
have a hard life so they needed to be
tough<00:01:46.330> that<00:01:47.140> toughness<00:01:47.500> was<00:01:47.890> created<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.400> a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
tough that toughness was created in a

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.359 
tough that toughness was created in a
few<00:01:48.670> ways<00:01:49.560> we've<00:01:50.560> added<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.890> dual<00:01:51.130> wall

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
few ways we've added a dual wall

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.130 
few ways we've added a dual wall
construction<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.330> outside<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.930> case

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
construction to the outside of the case

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.020 
construction to the outside of the case
this<00:01:54.100> is<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.340> couple<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.729> things

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
this is a couple of things

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.320 
this is a couple of things
it<00:01:55.420> really<00:01:56.200> makes<00:01:56.500> product<00:01:57.009> off<00:01:57.190> so<00:01:57.910> it's<00:01:58.030> its

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
it really makes product off so it's its

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.480 
it really makes product off so it's its
impact<00:01:58.780> resistance<00:01:59.290> but<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.590> also<00:01:59.920> protects

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
impact resistance but it also protects

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.730 
impact resistance but it also protects
this<00:02:00.700> seal<00:02:01.390> inside<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.170> it's<00:02:02.500> pretty

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
this seal inside so it's pretty

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.210 
this seal inside so it's pretty
innovative<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.960> seal<00:02:05.140> itself<00:02:05.500> is<00:02:05.800> flat<00:02:06.040> and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
innovative the seal itself is flat and

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.889 
innovative the seal itself is flat and
straight<00:02:06.430> we've<00:02:07.060> done<00:02:07.210> quite<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> bit<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.720> work

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
straight we've done quite a bit of work

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.690 
straight we've done quite a bit of work
on<00:02:08.050> this<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.229> from<00:02:08.679> our<00:02:08.860> experience<00:02:09.340> we<00:02:09.520> know

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
on this and from our experience we know

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.180 
on this and from our experience we know
that<00:02:09.880> having<00:02:10.479> seals<00:02:10.869> go<00:02:11.200> around<00:02:11.440> corners<00:02:11.680> and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
that having seals go around corners and

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.300 
that having seals go around corners and
change<00:02:13.030> plane<00:02:13.360> really<00:02:13.930> weakens<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.010> effect

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
change plane really weakens the effect

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.490 
change plane really weakens the effect
of<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.790> over<00:02:16.239> time<00:02:16.269> especially<00:02:16.630> when<00:02:17.230> it

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
of it and over time especially when it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.280 
of it and over time especially when it
gets<00:02:17.709> serviced<00:02:18.100> or<00:02:18.250> gets<00:02:18.400> opened<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:20.050> screw

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
gets serviced or gets opened the screw

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.140 
gets serviced or gets opened the screw
bosses<00:02:20.680> are<00:02:20.830> outside<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.340> seal<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.120> that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
bosses are outside the seal so that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.210 
bosses are outside the seal so that
allows<00:02:22.570> us<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.870> open<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.260> unit<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:23.680> servicing

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
allows us to open the unit for servicing

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.160 
allows us to open the unit for servicing
over<00:02:24.310> years<00:02:24.700> and<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.300> seal<00:02:25.510> still<00:02:25.720> remains

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
over years and the seal still remains

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.229 
over years and the seal still remains
intact<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:28.239> rubber<00:02:28.450> corners<00:02:28.900> absorb<00:02:29.290> impact

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
intact the rubber corners absorb impact

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.310 
intact the rubber corners absorb impact
and<00:02:31.239> we've<00:02:31.450> done<00:02:31.630> away<00:02:31.750> with<00:02:31.870> metal

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
and we've done away with metal

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.610 
and we've done away with metal
connectors

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
connectors

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.830

so<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.400> much<00:02:35.610> bulletproof<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.330> it

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
so it's pretty much bulletproof and it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.000 
so it's pretty much bulletproof and it
just<00:02:37.110> happens<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.590> look<00:02:37.739> great<00:02:42.860> one<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
just happens to look great one of the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.680 
just happens to look great one of the
best<00:02:44.310> features<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.030> design<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.629> a
