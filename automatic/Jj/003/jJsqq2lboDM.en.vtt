1999 suzuki esteem station wagon and

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.039 
1999 suzuki esteem station wagon and
you've<00:00:05.700> noticed<00:00:06.000> it's<00:00:06.210> starting<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.810> run<00:00:07.020> a

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
you've noticed it's starting to run a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.280 
you've noticed it's starting to run a
little<00:00:07.109> rough<00:00:08.120> maybe<00:00:09.120> even<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.540> stalled<00:00:09.929> out<00:00:10.139> on

little rough maybe even a stalled out on
you<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.469> couple<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.769> times<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.429> don't<00:00:12.030> get<00:00:12.120> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
you a couple of times you don't get the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.360 
you a couple of times you don't get the
gas<00:00:12.389> mileage<00:00:12.809> you're<00:00:12.960> used<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> get<00:00:13.410> sometimes

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
gas mileage you're used to get sometimes

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.120 
gas mileage you're used to get sometimes
there's<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.730> funny<00:00:14.940> gas<00:00:15.269> smell<00:00:16.130> no

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
there's a funny gas smell no

there's a funny gas smell no
acceleration<00:00:18.170> and<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.800> not<00:00:20.310> running

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
acceleration and it just is not running

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.400 
acceleration and it just is not running
right<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.060> then<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.539> sudden<00:00:21.600> check

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

right and then all of a sudden check
engine<00:00:22.619> light<00:00:22.890> comes<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:24.769> take<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.859> into<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
engine light comes on take it into the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.120 
engine light comes on take it into the
shop<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:27.260> they<00:00:28.260> run<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> bunch<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.710> tests<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
shop and they run a bunch of tests on it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.410 
shop and they run a bunch of tests on it
and<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.400> tell<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.670> your<00:00:29.849> mass<00:00:30.090> airflow

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
and they tell you your mass airflow

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.299 
and they tell you your mass airflow
sensor<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:31.109> faulty<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.859> you're<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
sensor is faulty and you're going to

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.470 
sensor is faulty and you're going to
have<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> replace<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
have to replace it and it's going to

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.370 
have to replace it and it's going to
cost<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.280> $1,100<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.640> up<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.930> reason<00:00:37.200> it's

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
cost you $1,100 and up the reason it's

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
cost you $1,100 and up the reason it's
going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.710> cost<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.129> much<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:38.760> what

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
going to cost that much is because what

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
going to cost that much is because what
they<00:00:39.059> want<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.660> replace<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.350> whole

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
they want to do is replace this whole

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.340 
they want to do is replace this whole
section<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:42.239> has<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> mass<00:00:42.870> airflow<00:00:43.140> sensor

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
section that has the mass airflow sensor

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.369 
section that has the mass airflow sensor
in<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.700> don't<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
in it you don't have to do that and in

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.900 
in it you don't have to do that and in
fact<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.770> may<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.070> need<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.340> replace<00:00:47.789> your

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
fact you may not need to replace your

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.290 
fact you may not need to replace your
mass<00:00:48.270> airflow<00:00:48.480> sensor<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:50.670> might<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.239> be

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
mass airflow sensor it might just be

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.840 
mass airflow sensor it might just be
dirty

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
dirty

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.819 
dirty
so<00:00:53.850> there's<00:00:54.270> sensors<00:00:54.809> all<00:00:55.199> around<00:00:56.210> the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
so there's sensors all around the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.709 
so there's sensors all around the
throttle<00:00:58.829> system<00:00:59.270> this<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> an<00:01:00.629> air

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
throttle system this one is an air

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.319 
throttle system this one is an air
temperature<00:01:01.230> sensor<00:01:01.879> not<00:01:02.879> sure<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.180> some<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
temperature sensor not sure what some of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
temperature sensor not sure what some of
the<00:01:03.449> other<00:01:03.480> ones<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.439> was<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:04.949> idle

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the other ones are this was your idle

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.780 
the other ones are this was your idle
set<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.549> mass

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
set in here but this one is a mass

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.890 
set in here but this one is a mass
airflow<00:01:09.060> sensor<00:01:09.210> easy<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.080> take<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:11.900> it's

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
airflow sensor easy to take out it's

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
airflow sensor easy to take out it's
just<00:01:12.930> two<00:01:13.320> screws<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:18.030> those<00:01:18.210> two

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
just two screws so you take those two

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
just two screws so you take those two
screws<00:01:18.930> out<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.440 

there's<00:01:24.060> your<00:01:24.690> mass<00:01:24.870> airflow<00:01:25.110> sensor<00:01:26.450> unplug

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
there's your mass airflow sensor unplug

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.540 
there's your mass airflow sensor unplug
it<00:01:30.110> you'll<00:01:31.110> see<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.470> got<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> hole<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
it you'll see it's got a hole in the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.660 
it you'll see it's got a hole in the
center<00:01:32.880> where<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.660> air<00:01:34.220> passes<00:01:35.220> over<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.550> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
center where the air passes over it it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
center where the air passes over it it
has<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:37.430> they<00:01:38.430> look<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:39.200> transistors<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
has to they look like transistors in

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.080 
has to they look like transistors in
there<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.250> those<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.370> you<00:01:41.550> who<00:01:41.640> remember<00:01:41.760> what

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
there for those of you who remember what

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.140 
there for those of you who remember what
transistors<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> air<00:01:44.730> flows<00:01:44.940> over

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
transistors are and the air flows over

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.840 
transistors are and the air flows over
that<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.080> whole<00:01:46.260> complex<00:01:46.770> way<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that and it's a whole complex way of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.220 
that and it's a whole complex way of
doing<00:01:48.120> things<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.510> what<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.780> does<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.080> it

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
doing things but what it does is it

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.810 
doing things but what it does is it
helps<00:01:49.470> control<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.010> mixture<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.550> air<00:01:50.790> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
helps control the mixture of air and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.270 
helps control the mixture of air and
fuel<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.960> provide<00:01:52.260> more<00:01:52.530> efficient<00:01:52.860> burning

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
fuel to provide more efficient burning

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.410 
fuel to provide more efficient burning
and<00:01:53.520> if<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.870> isn't<00:01:55.470> working<00:01:55.770> properly<00:01:56.420> it'll

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and if that isn't working properly it'll

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.960 
and if that isn't working properly it'll
screw<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.310> everything<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.880> way

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
screw up the everything about the way

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.660 
screw up the everything about the way
your<00:02:00.180> car<00:02:00.420> engine<00:02:00.780> runs<00:02:01.050> so<00:02:01.890> once<00:02:02.400> you've<00:02:02.550> got

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
your car engine runs so once you've got

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.600 
your car engine runs so once you've got
the<00:02:02.790> mass<00:02:02.940> airflow<00:02:03.210> sensor<00:02:04.040> out<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.520> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
the mass airflow sensor out you have to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.280 
the mass airflow sensor out you have to
be<00:02:05.700> very<00:02:05.880> careful<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> touch<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.140> wires

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
be very careful not to touch the wires

be very careful not to touch the wires
or<00:02:07.500> anything<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.980> apparently<00:02:08.820> it's<00:02:08.970> coated

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
with some kind of a special compound

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.310 
with some kind of a special compound
that<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.220> use<00:02:14.490> anything<00:02:14.910> but<00:02:15.320> sensor

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
that if you use anything but sensor

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.100 
that if you use anything but sensor
clean<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:18.090> damage<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.570> mass<00:02:18.720> airflow<00:02:18.930> sensor

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
clean can damage the mass airflow sensor

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.970 
clean can damage the mass airflow sensor
and<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.770> will<00:02:20.160> need<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.460> replace<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
and you will need to replace it so you

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.710 
and you will need to replace it so you
put<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.370> little<00:02:23.700> thing<00:02:23.850> in<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.390> just<00:02:24.540> kind

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
put that little thing in and just kind

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:35.570 
put that little thing in and just kind
of<00:02:31.610> give<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.760> couple<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.060> shots<00:02:34.580> right

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
of give it a couple of shots right

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.220 
of give it a couple of shots right
through<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:36.090> cleans<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> contacts<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.140> it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
through it cleans the contacts and it

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.840 
through it cleans the contacts and it
takes<00:02:37.380> any<00:02:37.760> grime<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:43.250> any<00:02:44.250> particulate

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
takes any grime and any particulate

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.420 
takes any grime and any particulate
stuff<00:02:45.209> that's<00:02:45.450> built<00:02:45.630> up<00:02:45.870> over<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.200> years<00:02:46.430> so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
stuff that's built up over the years so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.310 
stuff that's built up over the years so
I've<00:02:47.640> been<00:02:47.790> driving<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.270> car<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:49.520> 14<00:02:50.520> years

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
I've been driving this car for 14 years

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.040 
I've been driving this car for 14 years
and<00:02:53.330> never<00:02:54.330> once<00:02:54.570> cleaned<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.930> was

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
and never once cleaned it so it was

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.920 
and never once cleaned it so it was
probably<00:02:58.260> time<00:02:59.209> the<00:03:00.209> stuff<00:03:00.420> evaporates

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
probably time the stuff evaporates

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.340 
probably time the stuff evaporates
really<00:03:01.230> fast<00:03:02.480> now<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.810> going<00:03:04.020> to<00:03:04.080> tell<00:03:04.230> you

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
really fast now I'm going to tell you

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.199 
really fast now I'm going to tell you
one<00:03:04.590> thing<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:07.430> frustrated<00:03:08.430> me<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.790> no<00:03:09.000> end

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
one thing that frustrated me to no end

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.610 
one thing that frustrated me to no end
because<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.660> thought<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.900> was<00:03:10.140> going<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.350> have<00:03:10.500> to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
because I thought I was going to have to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.650 
because I thought I was going to have to
replace<00:03:10.980> this<00:03:11.780> because<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.230> cleaned<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.660> put

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
replace this because I cleaned it I put

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.000 
replace this because I cleaned it I put
it<00:03:15.750> back<00:03:15.900> in<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:18.269> car<00:03:18.480> ran<00:03:18.750> great<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:19.800> about

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it back in the car ran great for about

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.280 
it back in the car ran great for about
10<00:03:20.340> minutes<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.910> then<00:03:20.970> started<00:03:21.870> acting<00:03:22.230> up

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
10 minutes and then started acting up

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.259 
10 minutes and then started acting up
again<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.830> noticed<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.880> was<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> bit<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.180> a

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
again I noticed that was a bit of a

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.930 
again I noticed that was a bit of a
channel<00:03:24.780> around<00:03:25.230> here<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.489> looked<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:26.910> I

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
channel around here that looked like I

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.370 
channel around here that looked like I
should<00:03:27.180> probably<00:03:27.300> have<00:03:27.570> something<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
should probably have something in it and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.900 
should probably have something in it and
it<00:03:28.680> wasn't<00:03:28.830> until<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.130> went<00:03:29.370> back<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.790> looked

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
it wasn't until I went back and looked

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.970 
it wasn't until I went back and looked
at<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.150> pictures<00:03:30.180> online<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.530> realized

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
at the pictures online that realized

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.039 
at the pictures online that realized
there's<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.340> rubber<00:03:32.700> seal<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.540> goes<00:03:33.720> in<00:03:33.900> there

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
there's a rubber seal that goes in there

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.560 
there's a rubber seal that goes in there
and<00:03:34.290> if<00:03:34.560> you're<00:03:34.680> thinking<00:03:34.799> air<00:03:35.700> mixture<00:03:36.299> and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
and if you're thinking air mixture and

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.990 
and if you're thinking air mixture and
air

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
air

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.930 
air
sure<00:03:37.150> probably<00:03:37.900> important<00:03:38.770> I<00:03:38.800> found<00:03:39.340> this

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
sure probably important I found this

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.990 
sure probably important I found this
part<00:03:40.330> on<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.710> ground<00:03:41.710> underneath<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.460> car<00:03:42.700> so

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
part on the ground underneath the car so

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.480 
part on the ground underneath the car so
when<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.240> removed<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.740> had<00:03:44.830> obviously<00:03:44.950> been

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
when I removed it it had obviously been

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.540 
when I removed it it had obviously been
a<00:03:45.520> damaged<00:03:46.030> seal<00:03:46.770> no<00:03:47.770> good<00:03:47.950> anymore<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:48.460> you

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
a damaged seal no good anymore but you

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.100 
a damaged seal no good anymore but you
have<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.880> put<00:03:49.000> another<00:03:49.180> one<00:03:49.360> back<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.570> just<00:03:49.750> went

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
have to put another one back I just went

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.860 
have to put another one back I just went
in<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.800> plumbing<00:03:51.160> section<00:03:51.490> and<00:03:51.940> got<00:03:52.840> a

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
in to the plumbing section and got a

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.630 
in to the plumbing section and got a
little<00:03:53.080> o-ring<00:03:56.190> three-quarter-inch<00:03:57.190> seems

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
little o-ring three-quarter-inch seems

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
little o-ring three-quarter-inch seems
to<00:03:57.850> do<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.000> job<00:03:58.360> slides<00:03:59.200> right<00:03:59.470> over<00:03:59.530> there

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
to do the job slides right over there

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.380 
to do the job slides right over there
just<00:04:01.660> make<00:04:01.810> sure<00:04:01.959> it's<00:04:02.110> seated<00:04:02.320> well<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:03.390> your

put<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.780> just<00:04:07.810> back<00:04:08.410> in<00:04:09.270> very<00:04:10.270> carefully

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
put it just back in very carefully

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.180 
put it just back in very carefully
making<00:04:10.959> sure<00:04:11.080> not<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.380> damage<00:04:11.470> any<00:04:11.890> of<00:04:12.070> those
