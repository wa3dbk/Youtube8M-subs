incredible<00:00:56.899> performers<00:00:57.379> one<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.859> whom<00:00:58.039> is

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
incredible performers one of whom is

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.520 
incredible performers one of whom is
like<00:00:59.960> boxing<00:01:00.710> Lee<00:01:01.250> pioneer<00:01:01.909> in<00:01:02.210> Canada<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:03.379> is

standing and coaching fighters to the
Olympics<00:01:07.539> I<00:01:08.539> think<00:01:09.530> just<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.770> combination<00:01:10.009> of

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
Olympics I think just the combination of

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.590 
Olympics I think just the combination of
sort<00:01:12.229> of<00:01:12.259> fearlessness<00:01:13.130> of<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.880> sport<00:01:14.330> and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
sort of fearlessness of the sport and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.980 
sort of fearlessness of the sport and
the<00:01:15.590> vulnerability<00:01:16.369> that<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.180> can<00:01:17.420> get<00:01:17.750> to

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the vulnerability that you can get to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.350 
the vulnerability that you can get to
both<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.350> them<00:01:18.530> both<00:01:18.890> in<00:01:19.069> a<00:01:19.100> sport<00:01:19.550> when<00:01:20.149> you're

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
both of them both in a sport when you're

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.180 
both of them both in a sport when you're
really<00:01:20.929> pushing<00:01:21.140> yourself<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.770> go<00:01:21.860> beyond

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
really pushing yourself to go beyond

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.809 
really pushing yourself to go beyond
your<00:01:22.250> limits<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:23.840> singing<00:01:24.670> singing<00:01:25.670> by

your limits and in singing singing by

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.219 
your limits and in singing singing by
yourself<00:01:26.210> but<00:01:26.390> singing<00:01:26.630> with<00:01:26.750> other<00:01:26.899> people

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.580 
yourself but singing with other people
there's<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.500> there's<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.310> very<00:01:29.259> tender<00:01:30.259> place

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
there's a there's a very tender place

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.649
