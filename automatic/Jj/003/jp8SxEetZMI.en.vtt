00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.340
 hello my friends from youtube today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.220
 I'm going to show you how to protect your pass 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.230
 Avoid 2000 or slim 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.360
 well I have some ways here like 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.580
 can protect it to those who do not like 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:20.060
 the silicone can put this kind 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:24.289
 of tpv which is like a firmer rubber 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.340
 and what protects this would be the part 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.059
 back of the half and this stays that is 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.879
 as a kind of groove so I do not know 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.030
 stripe the touch and all the buttons and the 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.510
 camera is with access without any 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.929
 type of interruption 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.940
 already to those who do not like this species and 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:52.210
 prefer 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:56.079
 and prefer to have greater control of the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.260
 protection can put another style of 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:05.670
 protection that would be in this case a 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.670
 silicone for all 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.720
 then this would be the silicone 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.720
 it's like dressing in lilita 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.090
 Personally, I do not like it very much 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.560
 this impression like that is loose there 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.130
 people who like it so be more classic 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:39.970
 it also remains with a bit of reality 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.970
 so that we do not go to take the touch 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.560
 we take it out 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.080
 and now it's coming 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.430
 let's subtract keys 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.210
 that in my opinion 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.010
 is one of the best because they protect 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.390
 the contours of the console that are like 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.659
 a matte gives me the impression that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.880
 they tend to scratch 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.190
 so 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.700
 we put on 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.700
 there 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.680
 and it's closed 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.000
 then do not scratch at any kind of 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.570
 thing that I adjust the buttons of 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.570
 provision 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 and another accessory that in my opinion is very 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:37.730
 good as is this group 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.170
 and transforms the console 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.170
 in a kind of control 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.640
 I have a little thing here that is like 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.640
 for me 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.590
 It's a little thing to leave it that way 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.069
 as cinema format because it ensures to see 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.069
 movie 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.220
 and watch movies on youtube not for 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.900
 the things that you will play and also 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.940
 directly that is also quite 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.129
 common but already the fact that one does not 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.100
 can take and have more surface 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:22.250
 control of life that 's pretty good 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.250
 there is also one for the 2000 avoids 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.320
 is a bit shorter the issue of 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.240
 triggers but still gives us the same 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.640
 service and have a little more of 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.730
 surface in the part of the of the 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.310
 woods back here that is also 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.239
 bearable at the time of 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 of the game and the gameplay do not 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.580
 favors pretty well so good that 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.050
 would be the accessories for what the kid 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.510
 to 2000 or slim and hopefully the video has 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.000
 liked if it was like this edited up 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.250
 subscribe salt channels any kind of 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.739
 question they leave me and I try to 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.930
 answer shortly and that for me 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.359
 friends 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.959
 anything they write new many 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.349
 Thank you 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.349
 bye
