 red traffic jams and no walkways 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.879
 problem 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:55.559
 He drives up to 20 deliveries 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:57.570
 the lausitzer road especially packages 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.550

 Load wheels are being booked more and more often 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.060
 good for cock 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.250
 because the competition in the courier service 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 industry is tough some companies 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.930
 offer their drivers from haan drives better 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.450

 good friendly climate we will 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 not exploited 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.710
 So I give I have a monthly 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 fee to pay for that 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.229
 orders mediated get that's 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.899
 a good button 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.009
 But I get that with my sales 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.710
 I earn enough anyway 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.590
 and when I realize that I am always bothered 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.110
 or that you could improve something then 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.080

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.610
