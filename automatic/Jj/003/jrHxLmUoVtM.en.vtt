moves<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.029> five<00:00:24.210> different<00:00:24.419> directions<00:00:24.599> it

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
moves in five different directions it

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.679 
moves in five different directions it
can<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.590> push<00:00:25.800> straight<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:27.000> also<00:00:27.150> go<00:00:27.449> up

down left and right

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.590 
down left and right
so<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:33.720> turn<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> hoop<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.580> you<00:00:35.580> push<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.360> hold
