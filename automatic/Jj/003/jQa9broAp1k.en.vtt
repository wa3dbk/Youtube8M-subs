lesson once I'm happy with the sketch I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.259 
lesson once I'm happy with the sketch I
usually<00:02:19.450> go<00:02:19.629> in<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.170> give<00:02:20.439> it<00:02:20.560> some<00:02:20.739> ink<00:02:20.950> and

usually go in and give it some ink and
even<00:02:22.269> at<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.480> point<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.049> still<00:02:23.319> can<00:02:23.530> ink<00:02:23.739> in

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
even at this point you still can ink in
