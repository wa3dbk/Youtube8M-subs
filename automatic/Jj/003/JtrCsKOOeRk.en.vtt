00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.300 
having having Laserbeak sitting all the
way<00:02:55.810> for<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.139> door<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.470> close<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.889> Soundwave

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
way for the door to close on Soundwave

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.089 
way for the door to close on Soundwave
but<00:02:58.519> other<00:02:58.819> than<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.379> there's<00:03:00.379> no<00:03:00.650> real<00:03:00.889> big

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
but other than that there's no real big

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.929 
but other than that there's no real big
problems<00:03:01.489> with<00:03:01.639> them

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
problems with them

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.699 
problems with them
so<00:03:02.720> anyway<00:03:02.989> let's<00:03:03.200> move<00:03:03.319> on<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.560> the

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
so anyway let's move on to the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.640 
so anyway let's move on to the
transformation<00:03:04.280> now<00:03:04.819> now<00:03:05.470> simply<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.590> have

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
transformation now now simply you have

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.240 
transformation now now simply you have
to<00:03:06.889> fold<00:03:07.220> up<00:03:07.370> these<00:03:07.489> wings<00:03:07.849> like<00:03:08.599> this<00:03:08.930> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
to fold up these wings like this and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.619 
to fold up these wings like this and
then<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.549> take<00:03:10.730> these<00:03:10.909> two<00:03:11.209> panels

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
then you have to take these two panels

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.270 
then you have to take these two panels
here<00:03:11.840> fold<00:03:12.739> them<00:03:12.919> down<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:14.799> then<00:03:15.799> fold<00:03:16.189> the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
here fold them down and then fold the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:25.059 
here fold them down and then fold the
wings<00:03:16.430> back<00:03:16.669> and<00:03:21.370> fold<00:03:22.370> out<00:03:23.439> the<00:03:24.439> head<00:03:24.829> and

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
wings back and fold out the head and

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.210 
wings back and fold out the head and
then<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.730> can<00:03:25.849> bend<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.209> head<00:03:26.359> like<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.599> and

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
then you can bend the head like that and

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.629 
then you can bend the head like that and
then<00:03:28.220> you've<00:03:28.489> got<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:28.819> two<00:03:29.060> chromed<00:03:29.629> laser

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
then you've got the two chromed laser

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.719 
then you've got the two chromed laser
thrusters<00:03:31.690> just<00:03:32.690> pop<00:03:33.319> them<00:03:33.470> in<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.129> holes<00:03:34.459> on

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729 
thrusters just pop them in the holes on

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:45.189 
thrusters just pop them in the holes on
the<00:03:34.819> back<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:40.659> then<00:03:41.659> we<00:03:41.780> have<00:03:41.930> Laserbeak<00:03:44.199> in

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
the back and then we have Laserbeak in

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:49.119 
the back and then we have Laserbeak in
all<00:03:45.829> his<00:03:46.280> glory<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:47.090> mean<00:03:47.329> it<00:03:47.629> was<00:03:47.750> close<00:03:48.620> look

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
detailing still the chrome really does

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.759 
detailing still the chrome really does
make<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:54.260> pop<00:03:55.510> this<00:03:56.510> bit<00:03:56.750> here<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.379> red<00:03:57.560> bit

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769

here<00:03:57.979> is<00:03:58.190> diecast<00:03:58.790> metal<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.359> he<00:03:59.599> does<00:03:59.750> have<00:03:59.930> a

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
here is diecast metal so he does have a

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.809 
here is diecast metal so he does have a
bit<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.409> weight<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.680> him<00:04:01.069> it's<00:04:01.310> not<00:04:01.340> like<00:04:01.790> a

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
bit of weight to him it's not like a

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.610 
bit of weight to him it's not like a
light<00:04:02.120> piece<00:04:02.419> of<00:04:02.569> plastic<00:04:02.989> he's<00:04:03.169> actually<00:04:03.319> got
