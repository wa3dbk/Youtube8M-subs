you<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.160> demonstrate<00:00:05.339> that's<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.029> 1951<00:00:06.720> model

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
you to demonstrate that's a 1951 model

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.040 
you to demonstrate that's a 1951 model
now<00:00:08.610> although<00:00:08.970> some<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.450> controls<00:00:09.840> on

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
now although some of the controls on

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.230 
now although some of the controls on
this<00:00:10.260> may<00:00:10.860> be<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.160> little<00:00:11.370> different<00:00:11.639> than<00:00:12.120> what

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
this may be a little different than what

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.299 
this may be a little different than what
you<00:00:12.360> find<00:00:12.389> on<00:00:12.750> an<00:00:12.840> earlier<00:00:13.110> J<00:00:13.380> model<00:00:13.710> d2<00:00:14.040> all

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
you find on an earlier J model d2 all

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.189 
you find on an earlier J model d2 all
the<00:00:14.880> steps<00:00:15.120> are<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> same<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.750> sequence<00:00:16.080> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the steps are the same the sequence is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.769 
the steps are the same the sequence is
the<00:00:16.230> same<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.580> pretty<00:00:18.060> much<00:00:18.270> applies<00:00:18.600> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the same and it pretty much applies to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.210 
the same and it pretty much applies to
at<00:00:18.840> most<00:00:19.050> any<00:00:19.320> d4<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.310> same<00:00:20.520> vintage<00:00:20.760> -<00:00:21.180> so

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
at most any d4 of the same vintage - so

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.259 
at most any d4 of the same vintage - so
of<00:00:23.220> course<00:00:23.369> first<00:00:23.609> thing<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.939> want<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> do

Mane<00:00:38.640> clutch<00:00:38.879> engage<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.480> way<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
Mane clutch engage that way you know the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
Mane clutch engage that way you know the
crawler<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> start<00:00:41.610> moving

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
crawler is not going to start moving

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.000 
crawler is not going to start moving
when<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.149> start<00:00:42.360> cranking<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> engine<00:00:43.010> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
when you start cranking the engine you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.580 
when you start cranking the engine you
know<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.489> safer<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.059> way

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
know it's just safer that way

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.290 
know it's just safer that way
now<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.920> pony<00:00:47.160> motor<00:00:47.430> has<00:00:47.610> electric<00:00:48.059> start

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
now this pony motor has electric start

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
now this pony motor has electric start
so<00:00:48.480> I'll<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.809> using<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.170> button<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so I'll just be using the button if it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
so I'll just be using the button if it
did<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.730> electric<00:00:51.180> start<00:00:51.539> I'd<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
did not have electric start I'd have to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.049 
did not have electric start I'd have to
wrap<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.829> rope<00:00:52.949> around<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.399> flywheel<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
wrap a rope around the flywheel and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.020 
wrap a rope around the flywheel and
crank<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.230> over<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:55.949> I'll<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.910> using

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
crank it over that way but I'll be using

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.990 
crank it over that way but I'll be using
electric<00:00:57.570> start<00:00:57.809> today<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.730> turn<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> power

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
electric start today so turn the power

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.490 
electric start today so turn the power
on<00:01:01.250> I'll<00:01:02.250> come<00:01:02.430> over<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:03.260> turn<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> ignition

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
on I'll come over here turn the ignition

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.770 
on I'll come over here turn the ignition
on<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> pony<00:01:06.080> set<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> choke<00:01:08.659> pull<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
on for the pony set the choke pull the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.950 
on for the pony set the choke pull the
throttle<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.270> pull<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.689> that's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
throttle out and you pull it out that's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
throttle out and you pull it out that's
low<00:01:13.140> speed<00:01:13.439> when<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.710> push<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.310> high

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
low speed when you push it in it's high

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.370 
low speed when you push it in it's high
speed<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.540> want<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> take<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> off<00:01:16.200> at

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
speed so I don't want to take it off at

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
speed so I don't want to take it off at
wide<00:01:16.530> open<00:01:16.560> throttle<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.340> close<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
wide open throttle so close it down a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.010 
wide open throttle so close it down a
little<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:20.420> engage<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.450> compression

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
little bit engage your compression

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.359 
little bit engage your compression
release<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:24.320> turn<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> gas<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> pony

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
release and turn the gas on for the pony

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.649 
release and turn the gas on for the pony
motor<00:01:28.790> now<00:01:29.790> we're<00:01:29.909> ready<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> try<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.479> start

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
motor now we're ready to try and start

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.410 
motor now we're ready to try and start
pony<00:01:31.070> once<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.220> get<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> pony<00:01:32.729> running<00:01:33.210> it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
pony once I get the pony running it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.819 
pony once I get the pony running it's
going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.689> too<00:01:33.810> loud<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.170> explain<00:01:34.439> anything

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
going to be too loud to explain anything

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.740 
going to be too loud to explain anything
so<00:01:34.979> I'll<00:01:35.100> kind<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> talk<00:01:36.150> about<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> next

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
so I'll kind of talk about the next

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.080 
so I'll kind of talk about the next
couple<00:01:37.079> steps<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.579> first<00:01:38.579> thing<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> want<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
couple steps now first thing you want to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.319 
couple steps now first thing you want to
do<00:01:39.240> take<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.200> lever<00:01:40.790> put<00:01:41.790> tension<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
do take this lever put tension on it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.670 
do take this lever put tension on it
back<00:01:42.869> towards<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.320> rear<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> machine

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
back towards the rear of the machine

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
back towards the rear of the machine
what<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> does<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.640> engages<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.180> break<00:01:45.390> for

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
what that does it engages the break for

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.499 
what that does it engages the break for
the<00:01:45.689> pinion<00:01:46.020> shaft<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> stops<00:01:47.939> turning

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the pinion shaft so it stops turning
