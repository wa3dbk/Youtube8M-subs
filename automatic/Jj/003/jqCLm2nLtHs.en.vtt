00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
one of the sound modules this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.520 
one of the sound modules this
synthesizer<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> first<00:01:01.050> sound

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
synthesizer will have is the first sound

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
synthesizer will have is the first sound
module<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.160> built<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.000> bass<00:01:03.180> drum<00:01:03.539> some

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
module I built is the bass drum some

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
module I built is the bass drum some
sound<00:01:04.589> module<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:06.080> it's<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.320> sound<00:01:08.010> module

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
sound module so it's a sound module

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.359 
sound module so it's a sound module
which<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.060> should<00:01:09.570> emulate<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.470> bass<00:01:10.710> drum<00:01:10.740> or

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
which just should emulate a bass drum or

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.350 
which just should emulate a bass drum or
create<00:01:11.700> artificial<00:01:12.180> bass<00:01:12.540> drum<00:01:12.930> sounds<00:01:13.680> so

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
create artificial bass drum sounds so

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.899 
create artificial bass drum sounds so
let's<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.840> directly<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.810> test<00:01:19.409> setup<00:01:19.909> we

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
let's go directly to the test setup we

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.890 
let's go directly to the test setup we
have<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:22.880> briefly<00:01:23.880> explained<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.869> have

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
have here just briefly explained we have

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.310 
have here just briefly explained we have

part<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> circuit<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.119> test

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
part of the circuit then we have a test

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.480 
part of the circuit then we have a test

have<00:01:58.200> some<00:01:58.469> variation<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.820> able<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
have some variation to to be able to to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.910 
have some variation to to be able to to
charge<00:02:03.180> how<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> mode<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.350> both<00:02:04.590> behaved

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
charge how how to mode you both behaved

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.639

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
in the drums synthesizer itself then we

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.100 
in the drums synthesizer itself then we
have<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.899> bass<00:02:10.080> drum<00:02:10.619> module<00:02:10.830> itself

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
have the bass drum module itself

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.130 
have the bass drum module itself
some<00:02:14.010> operational<00:02:14.760> amplifiers<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:17.060> some

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
some operational amplifiers and some

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.470 
some operational amplifiers and some
capacitors<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:21.090> some

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
capacitors and so on we have some

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.870 
capacitors and so on we have some
potential<00:02:22.080> mate<00:02:22.410> potential<00:02:23.400> mates<00:02:23.550> which

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
potential mate potential mates which

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.060 
potential mate potential mates which
control<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.360> sound<00:02:24.750> first<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.650> all<00:02:25.770> we<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
control the sound first of all we have a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.580 
control the sound first of all we have a
tone<00:02:26.460> knob<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.210> controls<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.110> basic

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
tone knob this controls the basic

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.760 
tone knob this controls the basic
frequency<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.700> oscillator<00:02:30.120> used<00:02:30.770> then

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
frequency of the oscillator used then

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.190 
frequency of the oscillator used then
this<00:02:32.430> one<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:32.880> really<00:02:33.420> used<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:33.960> just

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
this one is not really used it's just

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.340 
this one is not really used it's just
for<00:02:34.530> testing<00:02:34.910> purposes<00:02:35.910> then<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
for testing purposes then we have the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.560 
for testing purposes then we have the
amount<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.860> frequency<00:02:38.280> modulation<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.420> will

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
amount of frequency modulation you will

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.990 
amount of frequency modulation you will
hear<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.500> sound<00:02:40.770> sample<00:02:41.310> what<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.760> mean

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
hear in the sound sample what I mean

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.690 
hear in the sound sample what I mean
with<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.380> have<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> length<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
with this and we have the length of the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.480 
with this and we have the length of the
polls<00:02:44.940> itself<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.690> gate<00:02:46.310> potential<00:02:47.310> meter

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
polls itself the gate potential meter

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.400 
polls itself the gate potential meter
and<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.990> frequency

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
and then we have the frequency

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.470 
and then we have the frequency
modulation<00:02:50.250> decay<00:02:51.709> envelope<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:53.480> controls

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
modulation decay envelope this controls

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.370 
modulation decay envelope this controls
t<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.610> will<00:02:56.610> say<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.240> decay<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
t I will say that the decay of the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.870 
t I will say that the decay of the
frequency<00:02:59.040> the<00:03:00.140> oscillator<00:03:01.140> has<00:03:01.470> when<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.640> is

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
frequency the oscillator has when it is

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:12.130 
frequency the oscillator has when it is
triggered<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:04.170> let's<00:03:09.500> increase<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.040> volume

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
triggered so let's increase the volume

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.949 
triggered so let's increase the volume
just<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.290> little<00:03:13.770> note<00:03:14.010> about<00:03:14.610> how<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.690> thing

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
just a little note about how this thing

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.740 
just a little note about how this thing
is<00:03:16.140> connected<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.860> output<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.340> directly

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
is connected to the output is directly

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.470 
is connected to the output is directly
connected<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.959> my<00:03:19.170> stereo<00:03:19.800> chain<00:03:20.220> just<00:03:20.940> to

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
connected to my stereo chain just to

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.229 
connected to my stereo chain just to

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
have a sound which is unprocessed as

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.820 
have a sound which is unprocessed as
possible<00:03:26.630> for<00:03:27.630> your<00:03:27.750> thing<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.140> valid<00:03:28.290> that

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
possible for your thing is valid that

possible for your thing is valid that
you<00:03:29.040> are<00:03:29.730> able<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.090> charge<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.780> sound<00:03:31.590> quality

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
you are able to charge the sound quality

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.020 
you are able to charge the sound quality
of<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.340> module<00:03:32.580> without<00:03:33.150> any<00:03:33.420> processing<00:03:35.030> so

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
of this module without any processing so

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:44.449 
of this module without any processing so
let's<00:03:36.360> turn<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.750> first<00:03:36.959> not<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.890> tone<00:03:43.400> by<00:03:44.400> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
let's turn the first not the tone by the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.699 
let's turn the first not the tone by the
way<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.670> started<00:03:45.390> with<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.630> bass<00:03:46.110> drum<00:03:46.140> sound

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
way I started with a bass drum sound

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.530 
way I started with a bass drum sound
which<00:03:46.950> is<00:03:46.980> already<00:03:47.580> quite<00:03:47.850> common<00:03:48.450> in

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
which is already quite common in

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.990 
which is already quite common in
electronic<00:03:49.140> music<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.650> just<00:03:49.830> played<00:03:50.280> around

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
electronic music I just played around

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:14.990 
electronic music I just played around
with<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.600> knobs<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:52.050> little<00:03:52.290> bit<00:03:52.440> before<00:04:14.000> then

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
with the knobs a little bit before then

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.940 
with the knobs a little bit before then
frequency<00:04:15.690> modulation<00:04:16.080> around

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
frequency modulation around

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.400 
frequency modulation around
till<00:04:17.640> now<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:17.850> hear<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:19.049> pitch<00:04:19.229> is

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
till now you hear that the pitch is

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.159 
till now you hear that the pitch is
always<00:04:19.769> decreasing<00:04:19.950> when<00:04:20.700> based<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.840> signal

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
always decreasing when based on signal

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.300 
always decreasing when based on signal
is<00:04:22.260> triggered

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
is triggered

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.790 
is triggered
fight<00:04:24.020> increase<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.169> frequency<00:04:25.410> modulation

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
fight increase the frequency modulation

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.879 
fight increase the frequency modulation
amount<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:27.540> page<00:04:27.750> isn't<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.320> decrease<00:04:28.680> that

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
amount the page isn't to decrease that

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.710 
amount the page isn't to decrease that
much<00:04:29.990> here's<00:04:30.990> no<00:04:31.200> frequency<00:04:31.770> modulation

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
much here's no frequency modulation

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.570 
much here's no frequency modulation
because<00:04:33.720> quite<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:35.419> soft<00:04:36.419> sounding<00:04:36.930> bass<00:04:37.080> drum

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.100 

let's<00:04:41.580> add<00:04:41.820> some<00:04:42.120> again<00:04:44.570> then<00:04:45.570> here<00:04:45.930> we<00:04:46.080> have

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
let's add some again then here we have

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.790 
let's add some again then here we have
the<00:04:46.590> gate<00:04:46.770> pulse<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.360> make<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:49.560> sound

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
the gate pulse you can make the sound

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:59.600 
the gate pulse you can make the sound
sustain<00:04:50.400> longer<00:04:56.479> this<00:04:57.479> is<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.660> longest<00:04:58.610> very

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
sustain longer this is the longest very

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:09.409 
sustain longer this is the longest very
short<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.840> end<00:05:07.669> let's<00:05:08.669> just<00:05:08.910> increase<00:05:09.090> the

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
short the end let's just increase the

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.719 
short the end let's just increase the
frequency<00:05:09.690> modulation<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.740> show<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:10.979> the

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
frequency modulation to show you the

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:22.640 
frequency modulation to show you the
decay<00:05:12.090> of<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.540> frequency<00:05:13.110> modulation<00:05:21.650> to

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
decay of the frequency modulation to

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.810 
decay of the frequency modulation to
make<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:23.010> very<00:05:23.220> short<00:05:28.669> decrease<00:05:29.669> the

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
make it very short decrease the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:39.050 
make it very short decrease the
frequency<00:05:30.000> modulation<00:05:37.430> see<00:05:38.430> is<00:05:38.610> able<00:05:38.910> to

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
frequency modulation see is able to

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.740 
frequency modulation see is able to
create<00:05:39.360> a<00:05:40.070> quite<00:05:41.070> wide<00:05:41.100> variety<00:05:42.090> of<00:05:42.120> sounds

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.120 

well<00:05:45.750> of<00:05:45.900> course<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.289> doesn't<00:05:46.710> really<00:05:46.830> sound

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
well of course it doesn't really sound

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.510 
well of course it doesn't really sound
exactly<00:05:47.580> like<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.120> bass<00:05:48.270> drum<00:05:48.539> of<00:05:48.690> the<00:05:49.520> tr-808

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
exactly like the bass drum of the tr-808

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.890 
exactly like the bass drum of the tr-808
when<00:05:51.180> I'm<00:05:51.300> in<00:05:51.419> line

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
when I'm in line

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.710 
when I'm in line
I<00:05:51.930> think<00:05:52.350> but<00:05:52.710> well<00:05:53.100> for<00:05:53.430> for<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> first<00:05:54.300> attempt

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
I think but well for for a first attempt

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:02.189 
I think but well for for a first attempt
it's<00:05:55.229> the<00:05:55.380> first<00:05:55.620> time
