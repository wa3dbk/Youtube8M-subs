00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
itself as you can see we're using the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.340 
itself as you can see we're using the
adder<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.789> number<00:00:36.059> 5<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.510> I've<00:00:36.719> gone<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.289> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
adder so number 5 here I've gone for a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990

more it's always a nice idea to go with

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.709 
more it's always a nice idea to go with
a<00:01:26.039> dark<00:01:26.340> shade<00:01:26.609> underneath<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.179> the<00:01:27.270> metallic

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
a dark shade underneath on the metallic

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.269 
a dark shade underneath on the metallic
and<00:01:27.869> then<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.529> with<00:01:28.709> a<00:01:28.799> lighter<00:01:29.039> version

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.739 
and then just go with a lighter version
for<00:01:29.639> the<00:01:29.729> pearlescent<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.569> works

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
for the pearlescent I think it works

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:32.719 
for the pearlescent I think it works
really<00:01:31.109> well<00:01:31.259> with<00:01:31.469> green<00:01:31.889> green<00:01:32.459> is<00:01:32.609> a<00:01:32.639> color

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
really well with green green is a color

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.580 
really well with green green is a color
that<00:01:33.119> looks<00:01:33.209> really<00:01:33.689> great<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.049> cars<00:01:34.349> but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that looks really great on cars but

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.019 
that looks really great on cars but
sometimes<00:01:34.950> difficult<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.609> a<00:01:35.639> balance

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:36.029 
sometimes difficult to get a balance

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.089 
sometimes difficult to get a balance
between<00:01:36.149> IVA<00:01:36.719> are<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.349> loud<00:01:37.679> and

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:38.099 
between IVA are really loud and

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:39.919 
between IVA are really loud and
outlandish<00:01:38.759> kind<00:01:38.969> of<00:01:39.060> lime<00:01:39.270> green<00:01:39.539> softened

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
outlandish kind of lime green softened

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.899 
outlandish kind of lime green softened
too<00:01:40.109> much<00:01:40.349> but<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> dark<00:01:41.189> greens<00:01:41.520> are<00:01:41.670> often<00:01:41.849> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
too much but the dark greens are often a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.999 
too much but the dark greens are often a
bit<00:01:42.060> too<00:01:42.240> boring<00:01:42.569> but<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.139> you<00:01:43.200> combine<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.619> dark

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
bit too boring but if you combine a dark

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.919 
bit too boring but if you combine a dark
green<00:01:44.279> with<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> nice<00:01:44.789> lime<00:01:45.090> green<00:01:45.389> pearlescent

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
green with a nice lime green pearlescent

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.749 
green with a nice lime green pearlescent
you<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.349> this<00:01:46.529> really<00:01:47.039> nice<00:01:47.159> finish<00:01:47.579> that

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you get this really nice finish that

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
you get this really nice finish that
stands<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.299> nicely<00:01:48.569> but<00:01:49.139> still<00:01:49.439> stays<00:01:49.709> pretty

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
stands out nicely but still stays pretty

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.159 
stands out nicely but still stays pretty
classy<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.639> opinion<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.270> number<00:01:51.599> four<00:01:51.810> is

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.169 
classy in my opinion so number four is

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:53.989 
classy in my opinion so number four is
the<00:01:52.380> dark<00:01:52.679> green<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> lime<00:01:53.759> green

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
the dark green with the lime green

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.800 
the dark green with the lime green
pearlescent<00:01:54.569> a<00:01:56.179> number<00:01:57.179> three<00:01:57.389> I've<00:01:57.509> decided

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
pearlescent a number three I've decided

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.659 
pearlescent a number three I've decided
to<00:01:57.929> go<00:01:58.109> over<00:01:58.319> nice<00:01:58.499> blue<00:01:58.919> kind<00:01:59.279> of<00:01:59.399> color

00:01:59.659 --> 00:01:59.669 
to go over nice blue kind of color

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:01.190 
to go over nice blue kind of color
however<00:02:00.179> you<00:02:00.389> probably<00:02:00.569> wouldn't<00:02:00.959> know<00:02:01.049> it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
however you probably wouldn't know it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.929 
however you probably wouldn't know it
just<00:02:01.380> from<00:02:01.499> looking<00:02:01.739> at<00:02:01.859> this<00:02:02.039> but<00:02:02.489> this<00:02:02.669> isn't

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
just from looking at this but this isn't

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.239 
just from looking at this but this isn't
a<00:02:03.270> blue<00:02:03.659> metallic<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.529> is<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.709> chocolate

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:05.249 
a blue metallic this is a chocolate

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.699 
a blue metallic this is a chocolate
brown<00:02:05.759> metallic<00:02:06.389> with<00:02:06.779> an<00:02:06.899> ultra<00:02:07.499> blue

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
brown metallic with an ultra blue

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:09.889 
brown metallic with an ultra blue
pearlescent<00:02:08.520> now<00:02:08.970> blue<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.360> another<00:02:09.569> color

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
pearlescent now blue is another color

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.210 
pearlescent now blue is another color
again<00:02:10.319> where<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> don't<00:02:10.890> want<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> go<00:02:11.160> too

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
again where you don't want to go too

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.100 
again where you don't want to go too
outlandish<00:02:11.849> sometimes<00:02:12.270> but<00:02:12.540> really<00:02:12.750> dark

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
outlandish sometimes but really dark

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.810 
outlandish sometimes but really dark
blue<00:02:13.380> can<00:02:13.560> look<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.770> little<00:02:13.800> bit<00:02:14.160> boring<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
blue can look a little bit boring so I

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.310 
blue can look a little bit boring so I
think<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> perfect<00:02:16.020> color<00:02:16.200> to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
think this is a perfect color to

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.140 
think this is a perfect color to
actually<00:02:16.710> combine<00:02:17.010> with<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> pearlescent<00:02:17.640> to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
actually combine with a pearlescent to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.470 
actually combine with a pearlescent to
make

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
make

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.910 
make
things<00:02:18.690> stand<00:02:18.959> out<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> little<00:02:19.349> bit<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.709> just

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
things stand out a little bit and I just

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.130 
things stand out a little bit and I just
found<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.190> really<00:02:20.550> nice<00:02:20.790> combination<00:02:21.180> that

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
found this really nice combination that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.630 
found this really nice combination that
I<00:02:22.200> thought<00:02:22.440> works<00:02:22.739> really<00:02:23.040> well<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.430> looks

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
I thought works really well it looks

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520 
I thought works really well it looks
like<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> blue<00:02:24.150> car<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.930> also<00:02:25.080> has<00:02:25.349> that

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
like a blue car but it also has that

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.170 
like a blue car but it also has that
subtle<00:02:25.799> darkness<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.549> see<00:02:26.670> when<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
subtle darkness you see when it's in the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.089 
subtle darkness you see when it's in the
shadows<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.720> looks<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.019> kind<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.319> dark<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
shadows it looks like kind of dark and

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.830 
shadows it looks like kind of dark and
mysterious<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.940> then<00:02:30.120> out<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.599> sunlight

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
mysterious but then out in the sunlight

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.990 
mysterious but then out in the sunlight
it<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:31.260> shines<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:31.860> ultra<00:02:32.250> blue<00:02:32.489> just

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
it just shines and that ultra blue just

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.580 
it just shines and that ultra blue just
kind<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.299> shines<00:02:33.599> off<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.959> paint<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.349> looks

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
kind of shines off of the paint it looks

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.070 
kind of shines off of the paint it looks
really<00:02:35.160> nice<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.700> my<00:02:35.970> number<00:02:36.269> three<00:02:36.420> pick<00:02:36.629> is<00:02:37.049> a
