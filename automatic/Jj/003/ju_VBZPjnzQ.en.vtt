I'm not to keep the best flow under wraps
and not to keep his best gold on the map/

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.879
Living with all the dimension to keep my intention
from ripping apart/

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.030
Now I'm bleeding this pen that's seizing to
start/

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.180
It's season to kill, so I'm leading to stop/

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.000
I said, it's season to kill, so I'm leading
to stop.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.300

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:29.000
[banging]

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.560

&gt;&gt;CHIEF TONY: He's compelled to rap? Yeah,
well, what a coincidence.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.900
All of a sudden I feel compelled to put my
foot up a tumbleweed's ass.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.700
And I guess you gotta follow your heart, right?

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.200
That's what we do, right? Yolo!

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.000
