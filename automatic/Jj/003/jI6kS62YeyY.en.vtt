00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.700

 lÃ¼ttgers lingen i am very special 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.620
 gastes have our things are different 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.030
 we also do business together 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.240
 so have made quite green time in 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.859
 scene 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.480
 and I have to say I'm a bit 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.430
 excited to stand next to them now 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 because i know him from our app and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.119
 active between looking and now 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.580
 personally with him so how 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:36.660
 healthy honor for me and I am pleased 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:38.520
 First of all , and so what 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.540
 follow me around this busy again 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.180
 short interview here nobody comes easy 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.950
 So it has a history to return 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.170
 and I have my story and I want to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.940
 now with him for a short time 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.910
 history once again count that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
 Maybe you are a bit nervous too 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.789
 what did that ever happen 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.600
 that's probably what his cause 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.600
 to come to food 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:10.670
 what moves you like the vast majority 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.540
 we are just about the disease away 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.939
 come to the post 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.590
 how many of them because our second son 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.680
 the jaro was very sick of the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.810
 had until the end of the chronic 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.430
 clean and skin problems neurodermatitis 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.760
 and we were a little bit over many 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.830
 different doctors and 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.510
 Medicines booked up and we have 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.460
 everything does not work says the doctor 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.660
 until we were weird we were total 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.160
 desperate because he does not sleep at night 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.680
 could sleep because he describes it that way 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.440
 both groups must also be correct 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.080
 bad and at the desperate point 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.820
 in our family history we have 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.560
 just heard about the rockers are there 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.120
 neck over head rhine jumped as his 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 as a family, the rovers did 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.390
 within a few days everything was one 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.190
 symptoms disappeared 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.590
 that is now ten years ago we have 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.539
 bought back and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.280
 see it as our task to the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.930
 people and especially family 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.460
 help that it is just different 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.290
 that you do not care about the doctors 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.000
 exclusively for ministries needs 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.900
 but of self-responsible healthy 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.850
 can be 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.289
 it is my message or that of 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.170
 my wife is doing business for us as a family 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.880
 as a focus family and you had completely on 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.140
 beginning as won so that's all 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.250
 to go through difficulties and 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.910
 gone alley 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.680
 that's just a way off so we had it 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.690
 in strong reason because of the years so 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.270
 i was sick, i just fun and then 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.130
 that's why it's pretty easy against us 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.140
 a pretty quick to go through though 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.620
 Of course, like everyone else, 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.840
 funny art 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.400
 again and again but then really 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.920
 even months or half a year 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.569
 years really completely rororo and then 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.370
 tried something again or something like that 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.409
 that is also a normal process 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.959
 and there would be an important note 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.659
 that's why you do not care 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.120
 guilty or the shit going on or off 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.500
 something like that but just as part of 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.140
 understanding travel is it is true the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.879
 that is not a linear process in the world 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.319
 process son and is back before again 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.549
 give everything so far is always possible 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.810
 actually still so on 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.730
 if you do not lose sight of your goal 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.690
 then you want to become healthier 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.609
 Can you step backwards 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.900
 and how few you think of yourself as 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.819
 feels guilty or bad 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.770
 Can you play faster again? 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.850
 above present 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.420
 that we have this source or this heating 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.300
 or sometimes brought 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.739
 30 go and it has to happen that she should 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.440
 allow with types ripped then 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.660
 maybe too 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.640
 yes, well, well, I'll tell you 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.740
 maybe you should mine too 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.570
 approach that I just impulse 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.670
 pursue after bad it 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.500
 all then look already quasi as a 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.110
 little 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.030
 who discipline a bit 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.350
 but basically in the form that finds 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.080
 keep coming and I just come 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.980
 Really, that's what people transmit 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.110
 I do that then it's fine that way 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.180
 How long has anyone spent? 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.799
 because now is called by a whole project 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.230
 now with a relaxed attitude 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.909
 so to speak, europe needs to be that 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.549
 Of course he is totally different 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.390
 has its many many years 400,000 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.950
 seen people 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.110
 it is everyone has the right one 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.730
 completely own way so and I like 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.410
 now highlight again 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.030
 if is not sold at all 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.190
 the target up way too high that 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.290
 wants to become a master or that 100 percent 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.570
 where vegan or labels or only 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.750
 fruits or something and it is quite often 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.550
 to that one from the beginning because 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.319
 she goes on to make it clear 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 if you bring such a high goal so sets 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.280
 I say it's so important what you are 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.720
 do not go as what you really do 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.039
 My job in the market so I think you 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.659
 now only have to eat raw food but 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.340
 Do not leave out a little bit of alcohol 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.210
 bit meat off a bit of white 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.530
 sugar the white salt animal products 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.150
 coffee and drugs 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.740
 the seven things yes if you are the 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.780
 again a little less market there 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.830
 we do not even have vegan raw food 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.169
 talk too much and that was abstract 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.759
 let's bring that is very tangible 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.810
 Everyone can start with themselves then 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.580
 just a little bit more into that 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.780
 Healthy way to go what I am 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.050
 We will then have to 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.250
 born 100 percent of origami 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.659
 We do not have to talk about fear 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.379
 his 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:05.379
 to have my opinion 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.409
 are not 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.509
 no perfectionists 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.419
 Now I have to call it critical 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.629
 even does not always create 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.639
 a few foods over now 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.710
 shot 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.560
 2 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.910
 with it 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.860
 That's why we still noticed 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.170
 but still with the underground 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.840
 important political considerations 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.640
 Harmful the thing away and perfect 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.410
 because of wake csu so a left 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.430
 half high right as a result 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.830
 perfect with you lloris describe how 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.820
 it is felt to be warmly welcome now 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.820
 all a sense of life 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.220
 We use every person but that is 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.710
 especially if you are totally in the mood 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:59.730
 you will become emotional 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.560
 Charging exactly with their contact are 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:05.400
 especially physically much better 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.840
 skin on it will be nice to white people if 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.740
 you do it the right way or off 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.470
 will you get yours someday ? 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.430
 are ideal weight but if you do the 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.370
 the topic is really about hessen 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.690
 Another topic that concerns you 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.160
 If you are welcome , you will see them 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.190
 you eat and how much you have 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.810
 next eat something unhealthy if you 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.910
 of which is relatively little and so full 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.460
 I am happy to be here then you can 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.010
 be healthier than the missing ones today 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.170
 harried vegans break or break here 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.570
 curry or red the carrots sticks 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.510
 called and unhappy act it 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.770
 is more than just nutrition 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.229
 I would say 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.389
 more like again and again in any medium 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.860
 Wise the theme is raw food is very 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.009
 I have to diversify myself 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.629
 Setting is a philosophy of life 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:50.699
 lifestyle makes you bigger within 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:53.490
 Impact I think I go and many just 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:56.389
 so they also need to know 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.389
 I 'll be right back 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.620
 cellar that from her piece of our 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:11.220
 first meeting - different and me 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.110
 Hope you liked it otherwise 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.599
 thumbs up and like me on facebook
