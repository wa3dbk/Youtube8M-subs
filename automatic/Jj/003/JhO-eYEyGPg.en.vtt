have<00:00:58.199> steel<00:00:58.500> rail<00:00:59.809> rusty<00:01:00.809> rail<00:01:01.019> which<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.350> kind

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
have steel rail rusty rail which is kind

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
have steel rail rusty rail which is kind
of<00:01:01.650> like<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> joints<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.640> whether<00:01:03.540> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
of like for the joints and whether it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.680 
of like for the joints and whether it's
tie<00:01:04.190> and<00:01:05.190> I've<00:01:05.790> been<00:01:05.940> just<00:01:05.970> kind<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.300> testing

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
tie and I've been just kind of testing

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.990 
tie and I've been just kind of testing
different<00:01:06.840> colors<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> ballast<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.190> just<00:01:08.850> how

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
different colors of ballast and just how

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
different colors of ballast and just how
to<00:01:09.030> apply<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.250> kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> where

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
to apply it and this is kind of where

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.520 
to apply it and this is kind of where
I'm<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.940> this<00:01:12.900> would<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> completed<00:01:13.920> piece

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
I'm at this would be a completed piece

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.320 
I'm at this would be a completed piece
right<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.590> here's<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.120> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
right here here's one with just the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.830 
right here here's one with just the
rails<00:01:18.600> done<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:20.120> then<00:01:21.120> there's<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
rails done and then there's just a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000 
rails done and then there's just a
normal<00:01:22.710> piece<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.920> fast<00:01:23.310> track<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:25.010> so

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
normal piece of fast track and so

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.830 
normal piece of fast track and so
basically<00:01:26.430> what<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.760> did<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.420> went<00:01:27.630> over

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
basically what I did was I went over

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.190 
basically what I did was I went over
each<00:01:27.990> rail<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> steel<00:01:29.310> rail<00:01:29.520> pen<00:01:30.200> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
each rail with the steel rail pen and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.610 
each rail with the steel rail pen and
added<00:01:31.530> some<00:01:31.830> just<00:01:32.280> little<00:01:32.730> rust<00:01:33.470> pieces<00:01:34.470> you

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
added some just little rust pieces you

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.900 
added some just little rust pieces you
can<00:01:34.710> kinda<00:01:34.980> see<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.520> looks<00:01:35.700> kind<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
can kinda see it there it looks kind of

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.760 
can kinda see it there it looks kind of
messy<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.270> I'm<00:01:36.480> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> clean<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:37.130> and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
messy but I'm going to clean it up and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
messy but I'm going to clean it up and
then<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.070> took<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> scenic<00:01:41.730> glue<00:01:42.120> I'm

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
then I just took the scenic glue I'm

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.080 
then I just took the scenic glue I'm
trying<00:01:42.510> a<00:01:42.600> new<00:01:42.630> way<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:42.930> apply<00:01:43.230> the<00:01:43.350> ballast

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
trying a new way to apply the ballast

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.340 
trying a new way to apply the ballast
this<00:01:45.090> scenic<00:01:45.480> glue<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:47.120> basically<00:01:48.350> I'm

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
this scenic glue and basically I'm

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.130 
this scenic glue and basically I'm
taking<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.010> scenic<00:01:50.250> glue<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:51.480> the<00:01:51.600> blank<00:01:51.840> fast

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
taking the scenic glue on the blank fast

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.660 
taking the scenic glue on the blank fast
track<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.650> just<00:01:52.710> taking<00:01:53.040> my<00:01:53.130> finger<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:53.550> I'll

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
track and just taking my finger and I'll

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.180 
track and just taking my finger and I'll
rub<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.910> all<00:01:54.510> along<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.980> in<00:01:56.070> between

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
rub it all along and get it in between

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.010 
rub it all along and get it in between
the<00:01:56.400> ties<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.090> all<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.540> try<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.810> clean

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the ties and all that and try to clean

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560 
the ties and all that and try to clean
the<00:01:58.140> ties<00:01:58.320> off<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:01:59.820> put<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.090> ballast<00:02:00.450> on

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the ties off and then put the ballast on

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.660 
the ties off and then put the ballast on
there<00:02:00.840> let<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.080> dry<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.340> shake<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
there let it dry and then just shake the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.820 
there let it dry and then just shake the
excess<00:02:03.120> off<00:02:03.330> sand<00:02:03.660> on<00:02:03.720> not<00:02:04.080> only<00:02:04.110> am<00:02:04.440> i<00:02:04.500> using<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
excess off sand on not only am i using a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.809 
excess off sand on not only am i using a
lot<00:02:05.010> less<00:02:05.040> ballast<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.350> reuse<00:02:07.800> what<00:02:08.519> falls

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
lot less ballast I can reuse what falls

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.750 
lot less ballast I can reuse what falls
off<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.349> space-saving<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.550> can

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
off so it's really space-saving you can

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.460 
off so it's really space-saving you can
see<00:02:11.940> there's<00:02:12.120> still<00:02:12.209> some<00:02:12.540> little<00:02:12.900> pieces<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
see there's still some little pieces in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.809 
see there's still some little pieces in
there<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.780> need<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> be<00:02:15.900> evened<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.379> but

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
there that need to be evened out but

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.820 
there that need to be evened out but
yeah<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:17.849> think<00:02:17.970> it's<00:02:18.239> a<00:02:18.530> really<00:02:19.530> big

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
yeah I think it's a really big

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.040 
yeah I think it's a really big
improvement<00:02:21.319> over<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.470> normal<00:02:22.739> fast<00:02:23.129> track

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
improvement over the normal fast track

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.330 
improvement over the normal fast track
and<00:02:25.050> once<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.379> on<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> layout<00:02:25.860> obviously

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and once it's on the layout obviously

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
a video showing that maybe embody some

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.380 
a video showing that maybe embody some
ideas<00:02:42.190> for<00:02:42.550> how<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.670> whether<00:02:42.940> they're<00:02:43.150> track

and make it look better I think it's a
