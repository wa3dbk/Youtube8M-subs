00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.310
 in study we will know this excellent 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.319
 I play a light and car game the 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.750
 body is about zigzagging before the 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.980
 traffic have enough points with some 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.200
 pretty pretty cars 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.300
 elegant and then we can also buy 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.010
 cars improvements etcetera etcetera 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.109
 for the majority in their devices 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.109
 android so let's go with the video 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.119
 the playstation games wii and be and 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.260
 in the blog if they have their way 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.150
 corresponding also just let that 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.059
 Here we share settings 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.470
 and we want some adjustment a bit of the 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.470
 quality we have a high 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.790
 to take them manual and good action 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.760
 let's finish we can share 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.989
 our games and we will be 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.660
 then we can car that we have 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.370
 we have no emergence or arrays 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.910
 we skip a little bit then as 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 working 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.710
 there is 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.420
 all the accelerator that we have for 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.960
 brake and here we have an accelerometer 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.720
 which is quite pretty soft and but it is 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.190
 pretty cool does not have much to 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.390
 example if we pass to team the edge and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.390
 They hurt us in points 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.580
 this is the police 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 makes a game making entertaining 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.510
 fairly good 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.560
 well, we crashed 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.560
 we have to start 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.259
 and seek to see the camera we can but in 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.369
 the other adjustments and here we have the 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.369
 speed on the right side 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.849
 and well sometimes that's why I hope 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.680
 Enjoy it and I hope you can 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.480
 work pretty well do not forget 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.400
 comment the video give it a good like if 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.420
 they liked it with a greeting for all we see 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.420
