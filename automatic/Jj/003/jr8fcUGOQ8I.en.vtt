00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
gears or something but as of right now

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.030 
gears or something but as of right now
that's<00:04:13.730> it

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
that's it

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.820 
that's it
metallic<00:04:16.040> gold<00:04:16.310> HPS<00:04:17.000> bowl<00:04:17.780> cold<00:04:18.140> air<00:04:18.350> intake

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
metallic gold HPS bowl cold air intake

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.670 
metallic gold HPS bowl cold air intake
you<00:04:19.820> can<00:04:19.970> also<00:04:20.150> run<00:04:20.540> it<00:04:20.570> as<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.870> shorthand<00:04:21.320> I

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
you can also run it as a shorthand I

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.340 
you can also run it as a shorthand I
think<00:04:22.040> that's<00:04:22.220> another<00:04:22.490> bonus<00:04:22.850> feature<00:04:23.320> why<00:04:24.320> I

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
think that's another bonus feature why I

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.010 
think that's another bonus feature why I
got<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.430> know<00:04:25.550> not<00:04:25.820> all<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.060> them<00:04:26.330> make<00:04:26.840> it

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
got it you know not all of them make it

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.050 
got it you know not all of them make it
so<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:27.260> can<00:04:27.500> use<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.890> short<00:04:28.160> Ram<00:04:28.460> or<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.820> full

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
so you can use the short Ram or the full

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.830 
so you can use the short Ram or the full
thing<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:31.150> yep<00:04:32.150> that's<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.900> sounds<00:04:33.680> good
