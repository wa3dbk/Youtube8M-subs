00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
knight B takes takes back we advance and

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.070 
knight B takes takes back we advance and
now<00:03:22.700> we<00:03:23.330> are<00:03:23.480> checking<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.930> King<00:03:24.230> as<00:03:24.500> well<00:03:24.920> as

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
after this white should end up ahead by

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.110 
after this white should end up ahead by
at<00:03:36.650> least<00:03:36.770> two<00:03:37.010> points<00:03:37.040> let's<00:03:37.670> play<00:03:37.880> through

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
at least two points let's play through

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.430 
at least two points let's play through
one<00:03:38.330> of<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.600> couple<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.650> variations

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
one of the couple of the variations

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.880 
one of the couple of the variations
Bishop<00:03:42.440> takes<00:03:43.180> c7<00:03:44.180> notice<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.630> now<00:03:44.860> white<00:03:45.860> is

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
Bishop takes c7 notice that now white is

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.190 
Bishop takes c7 notice that now white is
threatening<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.670> Queen<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.330> black<00:03:47.989> is

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
threatening the Queen and black is

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.310 
threatening the Queen and black is
threatening<00:03:48.560> whites<00:03:48.920> Queen<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.900> we'll<00:03:51.110> have

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
threatening whites Queen now we'll have

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.520 
threatening whites Queen now we'll have
a<00:03:51.769> couple<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.910> ways<00:03:53.330> this<00:03:53.630> could<00:03:53.840> go<00:03:53.900> this

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
a couple of ways this could go this

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.310 
a couple of ways this could go this
could<00:03:54.680> go<00:03:54.800> down<00:03:54.860> one<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.580> that<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.930> Queen<00:03:57.140> can

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
could go down one is that the Queen can

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.560 
could go down one is that the Queen can
go<00:03:57.440> ahead<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.890> take<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:59.590> the<00:04:01.570> threatening

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
go ahead and take the the threatening

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.380 
go ahead and take the the threatening
pawn<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.680> then<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:07.190> would<00:04:07.370> leave<00:04:07.580> white<00:04:07.910> two

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
pawn and then that would leave white two

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.540 
pawn and then that would leave white two
points<00:04:08.750> ahead<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.989> material<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:10.130> other<00:04:10.250> thing

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
points ahead of material the other thing

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.400 
points ahead of material the other thing
that<00:04:10.580> could<00:04:10.850> have<00:04:10.970> happened<00:04:11.000> was<00:04:11.600> Bishop

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
that could have happened was Bishop

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.039 
that could have happened was Bishop
takes<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:13.040> four<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:14.920> then<00:04:16.660> white<00:04:17.660> would<00:04:17.930> go

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
takes a four and then white would go

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.640 
takes a four and then white would go
ahead<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.850> take<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.000> Queen<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.570> call<00:04:21.109> check

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.450 

rook<00:04:24.650> would<00:04:24.830> take<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.750> then<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.919> whites

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
rook would take that and then the whites

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.150 
rook would take that and then the whites
work<00:04:28.700> would<00:04:28.880> take<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.300> black<00:04:30.020> Bishop<00:04:30.229> leaving

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
work would take the black Bishop leaving

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.640 
work would take the black Bishop leaving
white<00:04:31.340> ahead<00:04:31.580> by<00:04:31.729> five<00:04:32.060> points<00:04:32.419> in<00:04:32.510> material

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
white ahead by five points in material

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.190 
white ahead by five points in material
so<00:04:35.650> basically<00:04:36.640> those<00:04:37.300> are<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.570> things<00:04:37.870> I

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
so basically those are the things I

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.100 
so basically those are the things I
guess<00:04:38.350> it's<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.620> bit<00:04:38.770> complicated<00:04:39.160> of<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:40.090> of<00:04:40.870> a

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
guess it's a bit complicated of a of a

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.750 
guess it's a bit complicated of a of a
puzzle<00:04:41.500> but<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.710> got<00:04:42.010> I<00:04:42.220> went<00:04:42.430> ahead<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:42.730> threw

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
puzzle but I got I went ahead and threw

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.170 
puzzle but I got I went ahead and threw
it<00:04:42.970> out<00:04:43.090> there<00:04:43.240> for<00:04:43.450> you<00:04:44.550> let's<00:04:45.550> go<00:04:45.700> ahead<00:04:45.820> and

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
it out there for you let's go ahead and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.730 
it out there for you let's go ahead and
look<00:04:46.390> at<00:04:48.810> look<00:04:49.810> at<00:04:49.900> this<00:04:50.080> puzzle<00:04:50.290> from<00:04:50.650> a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
look at look at this puzzle from a

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.290 
look at look at this puzzle from a
different<00:04:50.980> point<00:04:51.310> of<00:04:51.400> view<00:04:53.970> this<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.180> the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
different point of view this is the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.090 
different point of view this is the
original<00:04:55.540> position<00:04:56.140> of<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.320> puzzle<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:56.890> the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
original position of the puzzle and the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.730 
original position of the puzzle and the
question<00:04:57.490> is<00:04:57.730> what<00:04:58.660> is<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.810> better<00:04:59.140> move<00:04:59.440> for

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
question is what is a better move for

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.170 
question is what is a better move for
black<00:05:00.570> it's<00:05:01.570> black<00:05:01.780> smooth<00:05:02.940> what<00:05:03.940> would<00:05:04.090> have

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
black it's black smooth what would have

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.930 
black it's black smooth what would have
been<00:05:04.300> a<00:05:04.360> better<00:05:04.630> move<00:05:04.960> for<00:05:05.200> black<00:05:06.600> well<00:05:08.940> go

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
been a better move for black well go

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.040 
been a better move for black well go
ahead<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.150> pause<00:05:10.270> the<00:05:10.450> video<00:05:10.690> and<00:05:10.780> try<00:05:10.960> to

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
ahead and pause the video and try to

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.740 
ahead and pause the video and try to
solve<00:05:11.320> a<00:05:13.290> better<00:05:14.290> move<00:05:14.560> for<00:05:14.740> black<00:05:15.630> would<00:05:16.630> have

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
solve a better move for black would have

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.890 
solve a better move for black would have
been<00:05:18.780> Knight<00:05:19.780> to<00:05:19.960> e7<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:21.520> retreats<00:05:22.030> black<00:05:22.690> to

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
been Knight to e7 this retreats black to

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.220 
been Knight to e7 this retreats black to
a<00:05:22.930> safe<00:05:23.230> square<00:05:24.000> note<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.300> night<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:26.020> be

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
a safe square note that night to be

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.270 
a safe square note that night to be
eight<00:05:26.500> would<00:05:27.130> have<00:05:27.280> been<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.700> blunder<00:05:29.280> for

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
eight would have been a blunder for

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.540 
eight would have been a blunder for
example<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:31.330> move<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:31.630> knight<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:31.960> be<00:05:32.140> eight

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
example to move the knight to be eight

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.980 
example to move the knight to be eight
the<00:05:33.550> reason<00:05:33.850> this<00:05:33.940> is<00:05:34.000> a<00:05:34.150> blender<00:05:34.570> is<00:05:34.660> because

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
the reason this is a blender is because

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.500 
the reason this is a blender is because
it<00:05:35.140> blocks<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.740> retreat<00:05:36.310> square<00:05:36.640> for<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:36.970> c7

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
it blocks the retreat square for the c7

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.810 
it blocks the retreat square for the c7
Bishop<00:05:37.870> this<00:05:38.290> Bishop<00:05:38.680> here<00:05:38.920> and<00:05:39.220> in<00:05:40.180> this<00:05:40.600> case

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
Bishop this Bishop here and in this case

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.420 
Bishop this Bishop here and in this case
the<00:05:44.520> bishop<00:05:45.520> would<00:05:45.700> would<00:05:46.030> eventually<00:05:47.430> be

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
the bishop would would eventually be

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.560 
the bishop would would eventually be
lost<00:05:48.700> so<00:05:49.660> that's<00:05:50.410> the<00:05:50.620> puzzle<00:05:50.800> I<00:05:51.450> hope<00:05:52.450> you

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
lost so that's the puzzle I hope you

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.150 
lost so that's the puzzle I hope you
enjoyed<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.080> I<00:05:53.770> will<00:05:55.860> try<00:05:56.860> to<00:05:56.890> post

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
enjoyed it and I will try to post

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.230 
enjoyed it and I will try to post
another<00:05:57.460> another<00:05:58.180> puzzle<00:05:58.570> soon<00:05:58.780> thanks
