00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.000

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.630
 launched so since yesterday martin monday 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.990

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.130
 doubs i think but i want to be 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 vegan so I'm leaving a week 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.220
 life guines that you ate no 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.330
 product of animal provenances so no 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 red meat not white meat 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.230
 like chicken no fish eggs 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.320
 or cow's milk yeah so that's it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 why did you know this challenge knows it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.480
 that in fact I saw but in fact it is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.420
 a show with oprah in my friend 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.469
 oprah then she she raise the tax 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 parade with about 378 employees I 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.700
 believe then it's really interesting to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.329
 see his child see the reaction of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.100
 people 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.230
 and I did not want to see 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.600
 point I depend on the products 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.030
 animals then I thought I was thinking you 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.739
 look a long time that I say that I 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 can eat red meat so a 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.790
 style no matter I do not mind 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.299
 I do not miss it I could live 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.119
 without 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.880
 it would not bother me really I think 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.080
 but it's more the milk is true than the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.520
 eyes that is really it's missing a lot 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.360
 today the second day it's missing 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.009
 cow's milk 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.990
 finally when I see anyway 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.710
 day in my coffee and I eat 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.750
 gourds us froman so this obviously 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.920
 put me breeding for nothing but good 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.960
 it is not serious 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.299
 r since they complicate me the task 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.890
 also it is that at hergÃ© Caunoise 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.939
 snatched since chance is very 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.860
 soy tolerant 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.689
 so I'm not drinking this almond milk 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.810
 road fitting can eat a small 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.509
 so that was more complete but 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.460
 I did I made my own milk from 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.090
 rice and its damage it's really 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.430
 horrible 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.820
 first coffee years it's deueueu 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.979

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.370
 tools or in a big one probably has 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.370

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.720

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.070
 a letter is not really good no 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.540
 more but it's less bad than milk 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.090
 of rice so yes why not in the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.210
 background yesterday morning I ate a bowl 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.160
