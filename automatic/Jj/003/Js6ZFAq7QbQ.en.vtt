00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.170
 people at that time my decoration 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.080
 so different and is how to make a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.429
 popcorn machine materials 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.250
 materials we will be for this month 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.140
 decoration are a red wool and a lullaby 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.699
 yellow although you can change the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.590
 colors I liked these two 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.119
 but you can change which you can for 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.849
 example a violet wool and a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 blue band for example is 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.150
 it depends but you do not buy 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.669
 same because if not good depends if 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.100
 you want if you want a bar 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.770
 that this is done with iron a crystal 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.660
 two buttons and two slabs so we're going to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.040
 catch and let's make our nor is it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.809
 decoration first thing we're going to do 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.899
 is going to be putting the red wool in the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.840
 base one here and another here after it goes to 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.520
 put a bar here and all 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.289
 we would jump because it is on top 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 we put them to put the slabs here 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.210
 and now here and so we get to have a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 popcorn maker that does not 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.350
 You see, look at me 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.049
 to make popcorn 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.210
 if you do not see it is a machine to make 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.850
 Here we can, for example, put a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.850
 poster that puts machine 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:22.340

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.690
