get there I think we're going to bring
in<00:05:44.150> wheel<00:05:44.450> just<00:05:45.050> so<00:05:45.110> we<00:05:45.230> can<00:05:45.470> possibly<00:05:46.340> snipe

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
in wheel just so we can possibly snipe

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:55.260 
in wheel just so we can possibly snipe
those<00:05:47.180> things

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.270 

i<00:05:55.330> don't<00:05:55.990> think<00:05:56.050> i<00:05:56.200> can<00:05:56.350> get<00:05:56.530> aggressive

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
