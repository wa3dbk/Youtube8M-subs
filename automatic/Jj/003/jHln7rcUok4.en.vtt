00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.240
 Hello, you are watching the topic of the week 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.010
 studio Catherine Semenchenko deputies 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.120
 Petersburg Parliament supported 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.620
 Smolny initiative 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.089
 on amending the city 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.719
 utility resettlement program 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.730
 apartments 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.710
 now for social benefits 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.170
 program participant is not required 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 agreement of all neighbors whether new will help 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.510
 rules to solve the problem of St. Petersburg 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.349
 communal watch in this issue 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.670
 filling program resettlement 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.800
 communal apartments valid 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.910
 Petersburg for more than six years for it 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.250
 time managed to settle 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.800
 about 26 thousand communal apartments 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 however as of January 1, 2015 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.250
 Petersburg has more than 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
 eighty eight thousand communal 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.670
 which live about two hundred 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.980
 seventy-three thousand families of them 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.110
 about 99,000 are on housing records 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.700
 exactly the problem of urban waiting list 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.440
 the government intends to decide first 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.320
 queue by the first of January 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.320
 for the first time in many decades decades 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.989
 waiting lists in our communal remains 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.449
 less than 100 thousand families and I agree with 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.860
 deputies of united Russia 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.510
 tough times will be fair 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.979
 focus on improving life 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 exactly waiting 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.420
 and on the resettlement of all utilities 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.930
 apartments in a row we are a little bit 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.030
 I think dad noticed for this 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 the decision is already being prepared by the government 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 city today to get 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.159
 program grants are needed including 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.960
 other things get the consent of all 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.939
 living apartment on the resettlement 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.619
 a change in the law will allow urban 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.119
 waiting list to claim such 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.390
 subsidy regardless of opinion 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.619
 neighbors change they recommend 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.420
 waiting list regardless of the opinion of neighbors 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.100
 that is, they allow the waiting list at 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.909
 get this social one from the city 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 payout 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.040
 and resolve the issue specifically 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.899
 currently about 9 thousand families 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.149
 applied for housing 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.720
 subsidies and only 10 percent reached 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.060
 consent of the neighbors to the settlement 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.710
 Another question is whether this will help. 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.210
 relief in law to solve the problem 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.790
 Petersburg communal once and for all 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.860
 we asked about this our experts at 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.140
 This solution has its drawbacks 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.899
 the rest of the communal apartment 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.060
 it also remains communal with 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.490
 resettlement 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.010
 that is, the actual relocation of such 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.400
 owner of a communal apartment he 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.750
 realizes his shares in place of this 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.640
 owner appears new 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.740
 an owner who is theoretically later 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.630
 a certain amount of time may 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.550
 also claim resettlement 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.340
 communal apartments can turn out 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.160
 so that we will be saved 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.090
 channel someone who didn't want on saturday 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.130
 so it will not remain and the task of destruction 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.440
 communal as such about to identify 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.660
 remaining in Soviet times she and 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.580
 it will be harder to solve this way 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.200
 initial goal of the exercise program 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.740
 communal apartments using data 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.510
 amendments 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.160
 realized can not be true many 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.930
 families become hostages of their 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.550
 intractable neighbors thanks 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.820
 changes in legislation will 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.380
 move to separate apartments 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.180
 besides officials smolny are planning 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.430
 make another amendment to this law 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.140
 concerning financing ie 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.670
 align law with real 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.769
 budget opportunities first 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.090
 the actions of this law annually means 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.040
 stood out much less than 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.660
 planned so for the current year should 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.160
 were allocate 10 billion two hundred 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.350
 eleven million rubles however 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.690
 in fact, only three budgeted 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.650
 billion sad in law would you say 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.380
 for the first 5 years 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.150
 that's 35 billion really would you pick out 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.680
 Well, to give the effect of the whip in the program 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.750
 This is stalled at the same time representative 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.400
 Governor of St. Petersburg in the registry office Mikhail 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.200
 Brodsky assured that the government 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.209
 allocates the amount of funds which 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.730
 used by citizens according to him in 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.470
 2009 out of five billion laid in 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.480
 the program budget was 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.890
 spent just one this is due 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.840
 so that low-cost housing on the market 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.970
 a little and people come for subsidies 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.860
 who have already found a suitable apartment 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.750
 however, some deputies believe that 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.030
 program funding cannot be reduced 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.040
 on the contrary, it would be worth increasing the amount 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.570
 social benefits is such a decision 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.840
 would move resettlement 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.099
 communal with a dead center 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.599
 perhaps it is logical to assume that 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.469
 lifting the ban on resettlement without 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.450
 neighbors consent 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.459
 number of citizens willing to receive 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.170
 target program subsidy will increase 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.790
 is there enough money laid down by the city 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.739
 budget to satisfy everyone 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.450
 willing mountains lived exchange organization 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.370
 which is the official operator 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.289
 This program assumes that social benefits 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.299
 enough for everyone even people who 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.340
 For example, we got official 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.860
 payment that year yes here they are per year on 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.720
 its implementation after all not all of it can 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.060
 realize the ultimate in order 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.270
 so that for various reasons even those who are already 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.289
 got kinda got agreement 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.630
 one hundred percent is the implementation of such 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.099
 social benefits and so there is some 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.750
 vazir official mind from which also 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.650
 go to the same program that is 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.150
 lack of funds 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.389
 partly offset by 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.180
 unused subsidies so 2015 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.949
 their living conditions will be able to improve 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.900
 4,400 families the same next year 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.940
 the average payout will be about 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.130
 300 thousand rubles per person and 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.289
 priority right to receive money from 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.930
 cities will have those communal residents 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.310
 who found a compromise neighbors such 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.349
 way if not found 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.659
 the optimal solution to the issue in order 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.380
 to settle 99 thousand families only 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:09.110
 waiting list 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.520
 will take more than 20 years you watched 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.300
 topic of the week with you was Catherine 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.300
 Semchenko
