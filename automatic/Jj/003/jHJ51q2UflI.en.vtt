00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.310
 friends, I 'm going to show you what 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.010
 locality were based to design what 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.260
 it's andy yours not without first mentioning 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.110
 who brought this first comparison 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 this idea was mister 2 for the wind them 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.379
 I will leave your original video in the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.520
 description of the video and also in the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.430
 description of the video I will leave you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.530
 two videos of bombay beach which is the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.930
 place that was taken as a reference for 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.270
 design sandy shorts and well here we have 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.520
 let's say a side walk to 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.770
 a board that is the one that is towards the 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.420
 part of the lake and here clearly in the 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.660
 real life we also have this part that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.670
 it's too similar to it's amazing the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.780
 similar as you make the journey 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.280
 let's say in this part of the map is 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.360
 incredibly the likeness here we have 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.489
 a structure also very 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.340
 feature of bombay beach where 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.219
 are the houses with a kind like 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.980
 platform like balcony in the part 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.780
 high of the house here we can see the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.030
 we can appreciate we 're going to get on 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.640
 she and then she has a kind of 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.799
 stairs have we also say above 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.290
 So it has some amenities for 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.410
 enjoy let's say the view 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.020
 this scenario let's say that to do it 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.670
 more enjoyable go and here we have in 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.340
 real life in the video as they show 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.310
 as it will be like a tapanco 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.670
 as a platform a little high for 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.620
 enjoy the view from here of bombay 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.220
 beach and in this case in the video game 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.350
 as it is now georg salt if not 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.330
 in front of us we can locate what is 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.120
 the Trevor airport where you have the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.940
 small plane I bring though here towards 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.040
 the bottom there are some agricultural fields you see 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.229
 clearly from some greenhouses and in 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.360
 the real life that they believe afterwards if in the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.780
 real life going through this part of the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.330
 lake opposite we have what is also 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.970
 some agricultural fields some fields where 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.320
 they plant some plants then it is 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.400
 totally impressive the resemblance that 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.340
 there will be in the video is in the description 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.380
 of the video of this video is to travel two the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.500
 first is what he does on the way 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.989
 in the car where it is clearly seen 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.900
 let's say an impressive resemblance that is 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.950
 the truth is that is let's say that what 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.410
 more surprising 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.360
 now and within the video we can 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.150
 identify also these vehicles that 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.910
 they are like golf are electric and so 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.500
 who was visited have said he knows that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.569
 suddenly those who also share this 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.780
 type of vehicles already up to these 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.660
 details were printed in the version 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.430
 of gta 5 and well also that other things 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.590
 we can pick up on one take take what 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.690
 what are the palms, the palms there are 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.390
 many palm trees in the video game too 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.569
 in real life we have incredibly 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.640
 many palms the fences let's say that 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.890
 also the current state of this 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.319
 locality also with an apparent 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.940
 deterioration with a sign of abandonment 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.920
 we also have it in real life 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.620
 in real life they are also houses that 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.299
 they sounded that they are already abandoned 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.000
 structures that have already say that the 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.489
 track of time and then we see this 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.160
 clearly let's say rockstar made a 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.530
 good job when designing sandy shorts 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.390
 taking as reference bombay beach and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.940
 Well what to say go enjoy the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.410
 comparison there will be in the video that 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.810
 found in the description of this 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.980
 video to be seen and surprised 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.260
 of the likeness 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.550
 and these two locations as well 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.550
 friends this was all goodbye
