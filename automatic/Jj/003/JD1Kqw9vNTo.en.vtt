00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:16.289
 discover a conventional milling machine 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.789
 here is a conventional milling machine 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.650
 does it serve the tool 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.660
 strawberries turn 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.820
 the room she is moving 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.820
 we get in general and flat surface 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.949
 these are different forms obtained in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:59.059
 milling flat surfaces but also 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:04.379
 boring different shapes of grooves 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:14.210
 holes the year and its architectures 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:20.070
 and main organs the base the frame 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 the console the table that will receive the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.330
 means of a blocking the universal head and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:36.259
 its pin the viewing screen 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:40.399
 discount or view the electrical controls 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.399
 the security cover 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.459
 the electric box the operation 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.069
 of the machine 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:52.069
 let's first see the manual movements 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.140
 longitudinal displacement 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 the transverse displacement the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.340
 vertical displacement 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.079
 the longitudinal locking levers 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.610
 cross 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.020
 vertical 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:57.010
 the rotation of the spindle turned on 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.800
 stop 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.060
 automatic movements set in 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.060
 engine running ahead 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.450
 the name jesus din al 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.310
 the transverse 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.170
 the vertical 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.069
 fast movements 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.489
 longitudinal 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.040
 transversal 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.870
 vertical 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:38.130
 the safeties for the milling machine 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:43.430
 works the protective casing must 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:46.320
 to be lowered the rising stops the machine 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.919
 who can not get going without 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.919
 rearm 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:03.710
 emergency stop 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:04.670
 here again it will be necessary to rearm here on the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.890
 electric box 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.010
 another emergency stop and the 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.930
 general cutout you will not find 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.710
 not necessarily this type of milling machines in 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.000
 your workshop 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.190
 you will see that all the milling machines 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.600
 Conventional have the same elements 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.600
 and the same functions
