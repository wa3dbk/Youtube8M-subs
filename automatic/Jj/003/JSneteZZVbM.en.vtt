 belgium visit during which the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.980
 cooperation between the Ivory Coast and the

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.800
 I met all the people in charge of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 the european union be it the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.629
 President of the European Council 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.789
 chairman of the commission the present of the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.619
 thank them for the political support 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.909
 and diplomatic than we have 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.890
 benefited during this crisis period 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.020
 post election but also for their 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 nation the direction we will sign

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.130
 billion CFA francs for the 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.680
 several health sectors 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.590
 infrastructure and I think these are 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.500
 kasmas that we get done quickly 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.630
 they were impressed to know that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.360
 at the end of the year the skin lasts quite rare 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.320
 the full summer the only country that will have 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.670
 consumed in 1h mans 99% although as soon 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.500
 that they have been allocated 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.350
 so that is to say that 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.090
 the administration worked well I 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.640
 take the opportunity to congratulate all 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.770
 sectoral ministers who contributed to 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.740
 that evolution 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.000
 we also met the full 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.890
 and Belgian threat says perinicious 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.270
 several miss disengagement also 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.850
 been private and I welcome it 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.190
 I was naked before meeting with 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.630
 economic operators operators 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.400
 Belgian Luxembourg operators 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.430
 many they were a lot 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.459
 are already working in Ivory Coast that this 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.910
 either in the door area in the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.600
 field of rubber cultivation and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.030
 other sectors 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.270
 we had a good exchange they are 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.160
 I could say that the Ivory Coast 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.709
 is a country in full growth 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.690
 there were opportunities and he 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.540
 had to come he had to invest and 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.310
 several have made commitments to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.989
 invest here feels the big 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.140
 estimated bedside investment 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.530
 indications of finacement 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.780
 almost 2 billion euros is 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.900
 so a large sum 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.250
 as you see it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.890
 one more of that we met the 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.099
 european investment bank ce 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.709
 significant decline in funding the plenum 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.730
 and stadium who was finance minister 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.930
 and that we know well also 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.700
 indicated strong interest for the highway 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.640
 yamoussoukro ouagadougou for the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.859
 rehabilitation of the railway for the 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.069
 hydroelectric dam of soubre 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.859
 so that's very much investment 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.420
 important we also asked that 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:36.260
 the european union helps us to 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.480
 place a study fund because we 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.470
 now want to go to these countries 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.079
 had records so organized in 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.109
 the all outlines without adjusting the 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.689
 amount of funding the duration for that 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.530
 dia not state in disbursements 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:57.970
 the realization of projects and well 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.040
 heard I had a very pleasant evening 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.109
 on the occasion of the meeting that I 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.620
 with our compatriots living in 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.930
 belgium in the european region of 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.370
 North 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.730
 it was the moment of choice and I 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.489
 been struck on this occasion to see that 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.479
 little by little ten years the gathering 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.320
 is done there were some responsible 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:27.380
 of three big parties the pdc he f 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.690
 pay last and all 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.060
 components of our society is it 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.770
 joked is to say that truly 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.389
 reconciliation is running 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.370
 the president alassane ouattara is 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.300
 also the guest of the television news 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.050
 rtbf 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.240
 answering journalists' questions 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.139
 on the sphere of three journalists 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.880
 arrested 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.409
 the president of the republic asked 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.360
 journalists to demonstrate 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.909
 responsibility I propose you to 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.740
 listen 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:58.520
 I am for freedom of expression 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.870
 remember that selma more mature than 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.449
 the dove release in you the audiovisual 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:11.030
 diola the radios were robbed 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:13.610
 the press also and there I consider that 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.909
 we are in a state of law there 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.789
 things that are done in this context 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.470
 I 'm going to appeal again 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.710
 journalists' responsibility 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.020
 I think journalists of course 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.500
 can have their opinion but it takes 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.380
 of the TV does the fact so the 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.380
 lies that led to this crisis 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.789
 are truly unacceptable and but 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.449
 justice does its job 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.099
 I am therefore optimistic about 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.349
 the evolution of things because it takes 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.030
 that we are in a new context 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.460
 that's what I call Ivory Coast 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.069
 news that journalists are doing 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.690
 their work in all serenity but 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:57.580
 also that justice can do 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.580
 his work and that's what's going on
