00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
when what was being processed there's

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.150 
when what was being processed there's
some<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.360> gets<00:00:12.629> lost<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.980> process

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
some that gets lost in that process

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.980 
some that gets lost in that process
at<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.340> beginning<00:00:15.820> and<00:00:16.000> there's<00:00:16.570> some<00:00:16.750> at<00:00:16.869> the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
at the beginning and there's some at the

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.950 
at the beginning and there's some at the
end<00:00:17.140> and<00:00:17.590> it's<00:00:18.070> unspun<00:00:18.670> fiber<00:00:19.090> it<00:00:19.570> just

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
end and it's unspun fiber it just

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.630 
end and it's unspun fiber it just
doesn't<00:00:20.140> get<00:00:20.350> completely<00:00:21.010> pulled<00:00:21.430> through

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
doesn't get completely pulled through

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.570 
doesn't get completely pulled through
the<00:00:21.760> process<00:00:22.210> into<00:00:22.630> yarn<00:00:22.900> we<00:00:23.650> use<00:00:24.250> their

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
the process into yarn we use their

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.620 
the process into yarn we use their
recycled<00:00:25.330> wool<00:00:25.750> to<00:00:26.740> make<00:00:26.770> a<00:00:27.189> line<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.820> yard<00:00:28.360> and

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
recycled wool to make a line of yard and

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.290 
recycled wool to make a line of yard and
we<00:00:29.290> thought<00:00:29.529> we<00:00:30.040> could<00:00:30.250> do<00:00:30.460> more<00:00:31.060> than<00:00:31.240> just

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
we thought we could do more than just

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.700 
we thought we could do more than just
one<00:00:31.830> line<00:00:32.830> and<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:34.420> also<00:00:34.570> like<00:00:35.019> the<00:00:35.260> idea<00:00:35.290> of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
one line and we also like the idea of

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.700 
one line and we also like the idea of
our<00:00:36.280> reserve<00:00:36.699> lines<00:00:37.210> of<00:00:37.540> yarn<00:00:37.809> they<00:00:38.110> come<00:00:38.350> in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
our reserve lines of yarn they come in

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.600 
our reserve lines of yarn they come in
they<00:00:39.280> go<00:00:39.309> out<00:00:39.670> we<00:00:39.820> can<00:00:39.970> kind<00:00:40.150> of<00:00:40.300> play<00:00:40.629> so<00:00:41.610> we

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
they go out we can kind of play so we

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.829 
they go out we can kind of play so we
have<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.860> family<00:00:44.860> of<00:00:45.250> a<00:00:45.519> reserve<00:00:45.910> line<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:46.600> it's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
have a family of a reserve line and it's

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.799 
have a family of a reserve line and it's
called<00:00:47.110> full<00:00:47.559> circle<00:00:48.100> meaning<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:48.969> course<00:00:49.239> all

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
called full circle meaning of course all

the<00:00:50.320> yard<00:00:50.530> is<00:00:50.680> being<00:00:50.920> reused<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:52.059> we've<00:00:52.270> come

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
the yard is being reused and we've come

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.160 
the yard is being reused and we've come
to<00:00:53.110> a<00:00:53.140> complete<00:00:53.469> full<00:00:53.890> circle<00:00:54.370> with<00:00:54.399> it<00:00:55.170> some

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
to a complete full circle with it some

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.959 
to a complete full circle with it some

when the boxes of these yarns arrived at

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.510 
when the boxes of these yarns arrived at
the<00:01:05.710> office<00:01:06.039> I<00:01:06.160> was<00:01:06.399> actually<00:01:06.580> home<00:01:07.289> working

Allison called me at home squealing
about<00:01:12.039> these<00:01:12.250> yarns<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.300> thing<00:01:13.479> is<00:01:13.660> this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
about these yarns and the thing is this

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.960 
about these yarns and the thing is this
the<00:01:14.350> hand<00:01:14.560> spinning<00:01:14.860> colors<00:01:15.310> are<00:01:15.490> amazing

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
the hand spinning colors are amazing

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.650 
the hand spinning colors are amazing
that<00:01:16.660> they<00:01:16.840> just<00:01:17.170> have<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.410> depth<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.280> them<00:01:18.670> the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
that they just have a depth to them the

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.130 
that they just have a depth to them the
next<00:01:19.959> size<00:01:20.530> up<00:01:20.950> we<00:01:21.550> have<00:01:21.910> is<00:01:22.300> worsted<00:01:22.959> weight

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
next size up we have is worsted weight

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.710 
next size up we have is worsted weight
what<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.890> need<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.130> remember<00:01:24.220> is<00:01:24.789> the<00:01:25.270> yarns

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
what you need to remember is the yarns

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.449 
what you need to remember is the yarns
themselves<00:01:26.380> we<00:01:26.530> have<00:01:26.560> worsted<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.520> we<00:01:28.119> have<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.459 
themselves we have worsted and we have a

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.660 
themselves we have worsted and we have a
look<00:01:30.459> at<00:01:30.610> this<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:31.030> bulking<00:01:32.039> they<00:01:33.039> are<00:01:33.340> all

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
look at this a bulking they are all

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.190 
look at this a bulking they are all
single<00:01:34.660> spun<00:01:35.349> yarns<00:01:36.130> okay<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.539> you<00:01:38.050> have<00:01:38.140> a

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
single spun yarns okay so you have a

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.059 
single spun yarns okay so you have a
worsted<00:01:38.590> weight<00:01:38.800> single<00:01:39.490> spun<00:01:40.050> lofty<00:01:41.069> soft

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
worsted weight single spun lofty soft

worsted weight single spun lofty soft
don't<00:01:42.819> think<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.209> recycled<00:01:43.750> yarn<00:01:43.989> is<00:01:44.369> like

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
don't think that recycled yarn is like

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.900 
don't think that recycled yarn is like
scratchy<00:01:46.750> old<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.679> key<00:01:48.250> parts<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.700> yarn

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
scratchy old a key parts of the yarn

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.839 
scratchy old a key parts of the yarn
it's<00:01:49.179> just<00:01:49.539> your<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:50.080> didn't<00:01:50.410> get<00:01:50.830> home<00:01:51.520> one

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
it's just your that didn't get home one

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.059 
it's just your that didn't get home one
into<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.450> process<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.229> other<00:01:53.410> it's<00:01:53.860> just

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
into the process to the other it's just

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.710 
into the process to the other it's just
typical<00:01:54.819> okay<00:01:55.599> so<00:01:56.319> it<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.739> soft<00:01:57.039> yarn<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.720> it's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
typical okay so it is soft yarn and it's

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.080 
typical okay so it is soft yarn and it's
a<00:01:58.929> single<00:01:59.289> ply<00:01:59.470> you<00:02:00.039> can<00:02:00.220> use<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.520> in<00:02:00.640> worsted

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
a single ply you can use it in worsted
