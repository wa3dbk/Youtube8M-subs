00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.659
 swedish of the mount of bodybuilding without nonsense dotcom 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:15.849
 in another video training lesson 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.719
 Today I want to ask you a question before we talk about the best 

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.480
 exercises to burn fat 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.480
 which muscle group will burn most of the calories 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.409
 my biceps 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.619
 with my legs 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.719
 look at it small that are my arms look how big my legs are 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.160
 muscle group is going to create the largest caloric expenditure 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.730
 now lets ask you something 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.130
 remembering the exercises you've been doing lately to get rid of 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.510
 the fat of your stomach 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.030
 the program you are following right now consists predominantly of 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.780
 isolation exercises or coast mainly of multi exercises 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.950
 joint 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.450
 in which you work in multiple muscle groups in the same event 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.260
 for now you should know the answer what I want to hear is talk about 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.010
 six exercises 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.630
 main 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.990
 we will associate each exercise with a primary movement of your body 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.580
 when they say it's an effective program to lose fat you should be sure 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.100
 that you have 1 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.780
 with a variation of what I like to call it 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.670
 head of the family tree for each muscle movement so divide 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.370
 that 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.850
 we will start with the upper part of the body the upper part of the body 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.049
 is divided into four movements and horizontal thrusts 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.710
 horizontal halons 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.850
 what this implies is that for each exercise push you have 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.870
 the best thing is that you also have a milestone exercise 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.850
 who four push exercises also have four exercises that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.140
 involve balloons otherwise you will create instability in the joint 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.870
 of your shoulder 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.430
 that also applies to vertical thrust and pulls and has made four 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.880
 exercises with thrusts above your head you should also do four 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.410
 exercises that pull down otherwise it will be without such stability 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.070
 it does not happen now but in five or ten years you will have to visit tutor 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.110
 problems on your shoulders then move towards the bottom of the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.910
 body have shown and live the lower part of the body in two let's 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.610
 divide it into frontal plane and the back plane whenever I do I crisis in the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.039
 frontal plane such as an exercise dominated by the quadriceps 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.999
 always to an exercise from behind such as an exercise dominated by the hip 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.039
 any exercise that works the lower back the glutes and the knees 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.649
 let's review the above 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.679
 let me ask you which muscle group we are working with when we are crisis 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.619
 the chest horizontal thrust which is the king of the family tree for the chest 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.879
 the banking press 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.469
 the push com / weight or dumbbell plane inclined all the above are 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:38.189
 options 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.620
 then after the horizontal pushes we go with the milestones 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.670
 horizontal which head the familiar tree of a milestone exercise 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:45.450
 horizontal 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.799
 it can be any variation matches 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.839
 can be a hostage 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:53.589
 dumbbell can be a dumbbell with a single arm can 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:57.039
 be an oar with old grip and I want variation of a return is the opposite of 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.299
 the chest press now let's move towards the range of motion of the fighter 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.059
 vertical shoulder which is the head of the family tree the shoulder thrust 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:08.369
 the shoulder press with dumbbells has already sat ok stopped again 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:12.099
 You must have one of these exercises in your program to burn fat 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:14.459
 by last 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 we must focus on the vertical pull 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.479
 which is the head of the vertical pulldown tree the pulls with wide grip 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.730
 dominated with wide grip chin lifts lifts 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.269
 of the slow with closed grip heels with closed grip any variation goes to 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.030
 put your laterals to work then you need at least one exercise in 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:38.230
 those four planes of movements to create an effective program to burn 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.899
 grease 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:42.839
 let's look at the lower part of the body is a little more obvious which is the head on 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.619
 familiar tree for your quadriceps squats 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:49.309
 which is the long familiar head for your hip this could be obvious 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.889
 for most people the long head family with exercise dominated by 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.209
 the hip are the dead prisoners and the aces properly you will take it to 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.929
 through your gluteos corbacho lower back and that is an exercise for 

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:02.799
 buttocks the quadriceps are working the dead prisoners are a 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.629
 exercise dominated by the hip thus during the week rehearses the kids of 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.159
 do bench press you must do an oar sitting you must make a press 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.069
 of shoulders despite being a milestone an exercise for the quadriceps as 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.050
 squats 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.830
 a hip exercise like dead weights if you attack all those exercises 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.390
 during the week you'll be one step closer to having a six pack the next 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.980
 step is to join those exercises and that's what I'm going to teach your program 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.030
 laundry search for all this 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.840
 I look forward to helping you as well as seeing your progress we speak soon
