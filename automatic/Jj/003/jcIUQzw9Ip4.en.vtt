00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.660 
from a trailer it had really good music
in<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.840> really<00:03:45.140> liked<00:03:45.350> that<00:03:45.590> song<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.520> was

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
in it I really liked that song that was

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.610 
in it I really liked that song that was
a<00:03:46.700> really<00:03:47.230> good<00:03:48.230> song<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.830> put<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.160> there

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
a really good song to put in there

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.130 
a really good song to put in there
I<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:50.400> it<00:03:50.519> added<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.060> chills<00:03:51.480> I'm

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
I think it added to the chills I'm

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.229 
I think it added to the chills I'm
excited<00:03:52.650> for<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.950> battle<00:03:53.340> sequences<00:03:53.849> because

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
excited for the battle sequences because

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.550 
excited for the battle sequences because
