my Twitter so you can see what it looks

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.549 
my Twitter so you can see what it looks
like<00:00:54.149> while<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.629> melting<00:00:54.989> because<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.379> does

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
like while it's melting because it does

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.119 
like while it's melting because it does
melt<00:00:55.829> evenly<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.480> candle<00:00:57.930> sleeve<00:00:58.199> because

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
melt evenly in the candle sleeve because

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.479 
melt evenly in the candle sleeve because
i<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.789> show<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> wick

i do want to show you one thing the wick
is<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.270> far<00:01:03.930> over<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> left<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:05.129> there's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
is so far over to the left but there's

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
is so far over to the left but there's
no<00:01:05.489> way<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.000> candle<00:01:06.420> should<00:01:06.540> even<00:01:06.750> be

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
no way that this candle should even be

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
no way that this candle should even be
melted<00:01:07.320> easily<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:08.939> took<00:01:09.119> out

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
melted easily at all and see I took out

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
melted easily at all and see I took out
of<00:01:09.570> camel<00:01:09.869> sleeve<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> now<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:11.369> starting<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
of camel sleeve and now it's starting to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.660 
of camel sleeve and now it's starting to
harden<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.900> sides<00:01:13.310> okay<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
harden around the sides okay and it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
harden around the sides okay and it
wasn't<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.180> minute<00:01:15.420> ago<00:01:15.479> I've<00:01:16.229> had<00:01:16.560> this

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
wasn't just a minute ago I've had this

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.609 
wasn't just a minute ago I've had this
melting<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.610> an<00:01:17.759> hour<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.470> half

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
melting for about an hour now and a half

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.210 
melting for about an hour now and a half
and<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> left<00:01:21.750> I

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
and as you can see more to the left I

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.649 
and as you can see more to the left I
mentioned<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.580> Friday<00:01:23.850> video<00:01:24.060> this

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
mentioned this in my Friday video this

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.390 
mentioned this in my Friday video this
tends<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.170> melt<00:01:25.530> down<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> lot<00:01:25.950> more<00:01:26.100> quicker

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
tends to melt down a lot more quicker

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.670 
tends to melt down a lot more quicker
because<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.119> wick<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.720> leaning

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
because of the wick you know leaning

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
because of the wick you know leaning
very<00:01:28.920> far<00:01:29.220> over<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> left<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.210> over<00:01:30.689> here

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
very far over to the left and over here

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
very far over to the left and over here
it<00:01:30.960> takes<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.380> bit<00:01:31.560> longer<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.579> my

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it takes a little bit longer but in my

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.330 
it takes a little bit longer but in my
candle<00:01:33.150> sleeve<00:01:33.420> after<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.560> two<00:01:34.829> hours<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
candle sleeve after about two hours of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
candle sleeve after about two hours of
melting<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.479> an<00:01:36.600> even<00:01:36.960> pool<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> wax

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
melting this this is an even pool of wax

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
melting this this is an even pool of wax
going<00:01:38.549> across<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.090> took<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.780> you

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
going across I took it out so that you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.950 
going across I took it out so that you
could<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.220> candle<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.939> know<00:01:42.750> there's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
could see the candle and know there's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.499 
could see the candle and know there's
frost<00:01:43.229> cupcake<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.189> then<00:01:44.640> I've<00:01:45.000> had<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.360> out

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
frost cupcake and then I've had it out

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.170 
frost cupcake and then I've had it out
for<00:01:45.540> about<00:01:46.020> 20<00:01:46.439> minutes<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.880> side

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
for about 20 minutes and now this side

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.899 
for about 20 minutes and now this side
is<00:01:48.600> hardening<00:01:49.140> whereas<00:01:49.920> before<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.340> was<00:01:50.549> one

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
is hardening whereas before it was one

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120 
is hardening whereas before it was one
even<00:01:51.360> pool<00:01:51.659> black<00:01:51.960> well<00:01:52.229> take<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> picture<00:01:52.890> and
