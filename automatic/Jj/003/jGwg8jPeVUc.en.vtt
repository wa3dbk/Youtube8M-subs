00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.870
 a new series of variations that is of course 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.049
 call seconds special 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.029
 persons foul 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.279
 percent developer also what emulator 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.720
 obse sex then my brother and I rub 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.640
 as you can see I did not become a place to help 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 but nonetheless 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.499
 work in a tone everything is noticeably better we 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.649
 filmed a video 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.589
 on which they recorded the toy tune 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.540
 words besides side 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.310
 for the plaintiff exploit try below card 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.810
 I recommend to see that is 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.760
 points 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 because say what works 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 noticeably faster project 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.310
 means to say that very little is needed 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 to kill 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.250
 but exactly all the prerequisites 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.260
 first nobody evsyukova but then not 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.120

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.300
 Yekaterinburg 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.870
 Yatsenko 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.160
 it is important for me to lower 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
 also the federal center 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.740

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 present 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.030
 suddenly the moment doesn't fall again 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.030
 henchmen that we have it is always the opposite 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.980
 taraz but it's not going to be a little bit 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.229
