 But I have been writing a newsletter since January 2009 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.420
 After all, when I wrote it out, I thought it would seem like what I would say today and I came back 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.130
 But after all 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.720
 It and also continued for 5 years I already almost positive 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.230
 It is such Among them, sometimes Well is it is not able to write every day 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:36.290
 There are times when it seems like that we write each other's 5 strengths 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:41.360
 Although happened today it was the kind of day that say or wrote it in even without me 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.560
 It says there is no to write the subject Tteyuu there is no story to write to the e-mail magazine until sedan Zenmeru 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.540

 I wrote something like that should I write in the wind Tteyuu is not to write Well 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.960
 Cormorants war situation is that it like a kind there is no neta place to write the e-mail magazine 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:04.320
 As I write, there is a feeling of excitement just a while ago What a human brain is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.530
 This is been gradually activated the start and brain 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.090
 As you can actually 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.970
 There is also that first the even of such things do Well in I'm there is something like that'm not willing 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.280
 Also I I think that something like a come I begin to spear But 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:24.700
 For example, a little start something riding thought cumbersome's or Naa in the form which made cleaning Toka also something 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.550
 Would What do hair all devices have Paderri will be that this work good luck 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.120
 Is because I 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:37.520
 Also So e-mail magazine is trying to do I wonder there is no story to write today when is not multiplied by the horse 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.540
 It is why you or over Well vibrant and going to change like a has various troubled real is in 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.350
 so 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:48.229
 8 Well what do you want to say? 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.070
 I've been doing medicine and I've been talking about something like an e-mail magazine that I should have done absolutely 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.760
 But also 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.270
 Well , it's good to be a marketing coach or a service now or a lab ocean 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.630
 is not it 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:02.300
 Well there are a lot of people who can't start well 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.570
 8 newsletter important thing is there is no confidence to keep writing something but it is known whether You know I large 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.360
 By 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:09.090
 Of One up a saying like, such that there is no in it I have not be able to easily start 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.030
 First of all 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:18.340
 In but it is the fact that try to start 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.700
 If you start thinking about what you want to continue and what happens, you have to write a member 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.950
 Because there is a sense that I can not do everything I can see everything in the world 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.870
 You can see it as a member's news 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:33.050
 App a look at the Do Toka something train of advertising available in Akore e-mail magazine even read a book 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.850
 Even if you can read e-mail magazines or newspapers , you ca n't use members. 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.880
 It's coming, so it's easier to write stock more and more 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.890
 So that's that 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.690
 Such a sense of mind after deciding to write after all that is not prior to starting the e-mail magazine 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.810
 It means that it becomes 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.620
 In fact, even if I didn't ask, let's say there is no news written by the horse today 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.500
 To say 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.470
 It is good if I use it as a news source and try him again 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.830
 Anyway, the beginning try that it is I'm important to say to 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.490
 I think that's right I think so 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:11.160
 I think there were 2 points of recession, but first of all 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.660
 If there are people who are upset to start things anyway, just start 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.310
 It is to try 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.300
 Because various consciousness changes by starting , it will be able to actually do it 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.390
 It is a thing 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:28.230
 And one more thing comes out working syntax When human beings begin to work 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:33.180
 It says more of the brain is to be able to tell fact activated 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:38.760
 If I can give you another one, I really feel comfortable when writing that e-mail magazine . 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.269
 But it is not also in the story is such a thing members of the impact I'd not Toka looking 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.220
 A little more of the truly readers had just kind of story you want to have Well Well 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.049
 I think that it will be a warm welcome to the readers , but because sometimes such things are included 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.970
 I think it's interesting 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:56.290
 That's why today 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:00.850
 Anyway, I tried to talk on such a theme when I saw it for the first time 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.670
 Well then my my youtube a My Channel Honest 1500 people 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.060
 Beyond raised directly below 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.490
