00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.780 
my that's Hart palette using a pink eye
shadow<00:01:52.140> I'm<00:01:52.409> applying<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.890> all<00:01:53.040> over<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:53.550> lid

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
shadow I'm applying that all over my lid
and<00:01:54.300> I<00:01:54.390> thought<00:01:54.570> pink<00:01:54.900> was<00:01:55.140> perfect<00:01:55.590> for

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and I thought pink was perfect for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.460 
and I thought pink was perfect for
Valentine's<00:01:56.280> Day

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.500 

then<00:01:59.100> I'm<00:01:59.250> using<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.730> it's<00:01:59.880> duty<00:02:00.270> time

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
then I'm using that it's duty time

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.750 
then I'm using that it's duty time
palette<00:02:00.900> and<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.410> using<00:02:01.440> that<00:02:01.890> color<00:02:02.160> on<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
palette and I'm using that color on the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.260 
palette and I'm using that color on the
crease<00:02:03.650> with<00:02:04.650> my<00:02:04.830> bubby<00:02:05.070> brush

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300 

then<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:09.960> applying<00:02:10.260> more<00:02:10.530> pink<00:02:10.860> because<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
then I'm applying more pink because it

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.680 
then I'm applying more pink because it
kind<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.580> went<00:02:11.730> away<00:02:11.880> when<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.210> applied<00:02:12.570> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
kind of went away when I applied the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.630 
kind of went away when I applied the
crease<00:02:12.930> color<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:14.130> I'm<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.550> go

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
crease color and now I'm going to go

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.460
