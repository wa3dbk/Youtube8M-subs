00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.410 

this<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.980> third<00:00:05.279> mini<00:00:05.580> Zephyr<00:00:05.970> I've<00:00:06.120> built

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
this is the third mini Zephyr I've built

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.360 
this is the third mini Zephyr I've built
the<00:00:06.839> first<00:00:07.049> one<00:00:07.200> worked<00:00:07.440> really<00:00:07.649> well<00:00:07.770> save

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
the first one worked really well save

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.370 
the first one worked really well save
the<00:00:08.460> link<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.910> description<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:09.510> video<00:00:10.170> of

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
the link in the description for video of

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.190 
the link in the description for video of
that<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.730> eventually<00:00:11.940> expired<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
that but it eventually expired the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.690 
that but it eventually expired the
second<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> built<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.040> couple<00:00:14.219> months<00:00:14.490> ago

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
second one I built a couple months ago

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.250 
second one I built a couple months ago
and<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.299> had<00:00:15.450> some<00:00:15.660> funky<00:00:16.020> flight

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
and it had some funky flight

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.320 
and it had some funky flight
characteristics<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.220> think<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:18.000> because

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
characteristics I think this was because

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.450 
characteristics I think this was because
I<00:00:18.359> pulled<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> leading<00:00:19.289> edge<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> top<00:00:19.920> and

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I pulled the leading edge on the top and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
I pulled the leading edge on the top and
not<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> bottom<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:22.380> should<00:00:22.680> have

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
not on the bottom and I should have

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980 
not on the bottom and I should have
beveled<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.580> top<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.090> bottom<00:00:24.210> equally<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
beveled the top and bottom equally I

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.839 
beveled the top and bottom equally I
decided<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.769> build<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> third<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:26.760> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
decided to build the third one because I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.970 
decided to build the third one because I
wanted<00:00:27.090> an<00:00:27.269> fpv<00:00:27.810> platform<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.470> carry<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
wanted an fpv platform to carry the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.150 
wanted an fpv platform to carry the
