now this is gonna sound pretty bad in

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.870 
now this is gonna sound pretty bad in
regular<00:00:42.890> standard<00:00:43.190> tuning<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:43.670> I'm<00:00:43.760> just

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
regular standard tuning so I'm just

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
bad those are shapes you wouldn't

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.690 
bad those are shapes you wouldn't
normally<00:00:56.570> play<00:00:57.020> with<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.680> regular<00:00:58.340> standard

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700

and it's always good to tune up to a
note<00:01:30.890> -<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.640> not<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:32.000> down<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:32.450> go<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.630> little

be<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.790> B

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.650 

and<00:02:10.590> finally<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.670> high<00:02:11.820> e<00:02:11.850> string<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.540> going

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and finally the high e string is going

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.960 
and finally the high e string is going
to<00:02:12.750> come<00:02:12.960> down<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.530> D<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.220> well<00:02:14.430> one<00:02:14.730> step

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
to come down to a D as well one step

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:26.340 
to come down to a D as well one step
lower

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.110 

okay<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.560> we're<00:02:27.770> tuned<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.460> our<00:02:28.580> open<00:02:28.880> G

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
okay now that we're tuned to our open G

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.510 
okay now that we're tuned to our open G
give<00:02:29.720> all<00:02:29.930> six<00:02:30.230> strings<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.890> good<00:02:31.010> strums<00:02:31.280> just

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
give all six strings of good strums just

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.950 
give all six strings of good strums just
to<00:02:31.610> get<00:02:31.730> an<00:02:31.820> idea<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.240> what<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.630> tuning

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
to get an idea of what this tuning

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.130 
to get an idea of what this tuning
sounds<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.440> with<00:02:33.620> all<00:02:33.710> open<00:02:34.010> strings

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.899 

okay<00:02:38.140> now<00:02:38.709> what<00:02:38.859> we're<00:02:38.980> gonna<00:02:39.040> do<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.519> we're

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
okay now what we're gonna do is we're

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.879 
okay now what we're gonna do is we're
just<00:02:39.939> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.239> do<00:02:40.359> a<00:02:40.390> basic<00:02:41.019> finger<00:02:41.620> picking

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
just going to do a basic finger picking

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.849 
just going to do a basic finger picking
pattern<00:02:42.609> and<00:02:42.819> move<00:02:43.689> just<00:02:44.019> two<00:02:44.260> shapes<00:02:44.560> around

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
pattern and move just two shapes around

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.160 
pattern and move just two shapes around
the<00:02:45.010> fretboard<00:02:45.219> and<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:46.450> gonna<00:02:46.599> give<00:02:47.079> our

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
the fretboard and it's gonna give our

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.509 
the fretboard and it's gonna give our
your<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.349> really<00:02:47.680> cool<00:02:47.829> sound<00:02:48.099> let<00:02:48.249> me<00:02:48.310> show<00:02:48.430> you

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
your a really cool sound let me show you

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.099 
your a really cool sound let me show you
the<00:02:48.639> pattern<00:02:48.819> on<00:02:49.120> our<00:02:49.269> right<00:02:49.450> hand<00:02:49.689> first<00:02:49.930> of

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
the pattern on our right hand first of

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.559 
the pattern on our right hand first of
all<00:02:50.230> it's<00:02:50.620> really<00:02:50.680> easy<00:02:51.010> all<00:02:51.939> I'm<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.359> do

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
all it's really easy all I'm going to do

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.400 
all it's really easy all I'm going to do
is<00:02:53.439> put<00:02:53.650> my<00:02:53.680> thumb<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.129> a<00:02:54.159> string

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.630 

then<00:02:58.410> you're<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.710> to<00:02:58.770> roll<00:02:59.040> your<00:02:59.250> index

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
then you're going to roll your index

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.790 
then you're going to roll your index
finger<00:03:00.030> second<00:03:00.660> finger<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.050> third<00:03:01.230> finger<00:03:01.290> on

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
finger second finger and third finger on

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.420 
finger second finger and third finger on
the<00:03:01.890> third<00:03:02.370> second<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.360> first<00:03:03.450> strings

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.710 

and<00:03:08.430> that's<00:03:08.670> your<00:03:08.820> basic<00:03:08.940> pattern<00:03:09.420> for<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
and that's your basic pattern for the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.620 
and that's your basic pattern for the
whole<00:03:09.870> thing<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.880> first<00:03:12.090> shape<00:03:12.360> we're

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
whole thing so the first shape we're

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.330 
whole thing so the first shape we're
gonna<00:03:12.720> do<00:03:12.990> is<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.380> right<00:03:13.560> here<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:14.130> got<00:03:14.220> to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
gonna do is this right here you got to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.930 
gonna do is this right here you got to
take<00:03:14.460> your<00:03:14.610> middle<00:03:14.760> finger<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:17.580> put<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.820> on

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
take your middle finger and put it on

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.980 
take your middle finger and put it on
the<00:03:18.060> ninth<00:03:18.270> fret<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:19.020> your<00:03:19.250> fourth<00:03:20.250> string

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
the ninth fret of your fourth string

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.200 
the ninth fret of your fourth string
take<00:03:21.990> your<00:03:22.110> index<00:03:22.260> finger<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.820> put<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.000> on<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
take your index finger and put it on the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.920 
take your index finger and put it on the
eighth<00:03:24.390> fret<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:25.680> your<00:03:26.340> second<00:03:26.700> string<00:03:26.930> that's

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
eighth fret of your second string that's

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.630 
eighth fret of your second string that's
the<00:03:28.050> first<00:03:28.290> shape<00:03:28.470> we're<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.800> do<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.310> if

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
the first shape we're going to do so if

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.920 
the first shape we're going to do so if
you<00:03:29.760> hit<00:03:29.910> your<00:03:30.060> fifth<00:03:30.330> string<00:03:30.630> with<00:03:30.900> your

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
you hit your fifth string with your

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.710 
you hit your fifth string with your
thumb<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.760> then<00:03:32.760> just<00:03:33.090> do<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.300> role<00:03:33.570> we

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
thumb and then just do the role we

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.570 
thumb and then just do the role we
talked<00:03:33.930> about<00:03:34.050> with<00:03:34.500> your<00:03:34.710> index<00:03:34.950> middle<00:03:35.370> and

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
talked about with your index middle and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.100 
talked about with your index middle and
ring<00:03:35.940> finger

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.070 

do<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.400> then<00:03:40.700> again<00:03:41.480> we're<00:03:41.690> gonna<00:03:41.750> do

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
do that and then again we're gonna do

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.440 
do that and then again we're gonna do
instead<00:03:42.410> of<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.770> fifth<00:03:43.160> string<00:03:43.520> we're<00:03:44.330> going

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
instead of the fifth string we're going

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.360 
instead of the fifth string we're going
to<00:03:44.510> start<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.470> fourth<00:03:45.710> string<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.040> do<00:03:46.280> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
to start on the fourth string and do the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.110 
to start on the fourth string and do the
same<00:03:46.550> role

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.880 

that's<00:03:49.660> gonna<00:03:49.780> be<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.020> entire<00:03:50.260> pattern<00:03:50.590> for

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
that's gonna be the entire pattern for

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
that's gonna be the entire pattern for
this<00:03:51.040> little<00:03:51.250> lick<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.090> came<00:03:52.330> up<00:03:52.450> with<00:03:52.600> so

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.880 

now<00:03:57.750> move<00:03:57.930> your<00:03:58.080> shape<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.440> have<00:03:58.590> right<00:03:58.740> here

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
now move your shape you have right here

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.120 
now move your shape you have right here
down<00:03:59.220> two<00:03:59.460> frets<00:04:00.020> and<00:04:01.020> play<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.710> exact<00:04:01.950> same

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
down two frets and play the exact same

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.460 
down two frets and play the exact same
thing

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.560 

and<00:04:08.430> now<00:04:08.550> here's<00:04:08.760> where<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:08.970> changes<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.360> bit

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
and now here's where it changes a bit

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.330 
and now here's where it changes a bit
the<00:04:09.840> shape<00:04:10.050> changes<00:04:10.470> with<00:04:10.620> our<00:04:10.710> left<00:04:10.920> hand

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
the shape changes with our left hand

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.430 
the shape changes with our left hand
but<00:04:11.820> our<00:04:11.940> strumming<00:04:12.360> pattern<00:04:12.720> or<00:04:13.110> picking

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
but our strumming pattern or picking

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.600 
but our strumming pattern or picking
pattern<00:04:13.680> with<00:04:13.770> our<00:04:13.860> right<00:04:14.040> hand<00:04:14.070> stays<00:04:14.460> the

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
pattern with our right hand stays the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.330 
pattern with our right hand stays the
same<00:04:14.870> instead<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.960> having<00:04:16.110> a<00:04:16.260> shape<00:04:16.410> like<00:04:16.590> this

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.250 

you're<00:04:19.940> gonna<00:04:20.030> slide<00:04:20.389> down<00:04:20.419> with<00:04:20.930> your<00:04:21.109> middle

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
you're gonna slide down with your middle

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.500 
you're gonna slide down with your middle
finger<00:04:21.380> two<00:04:21.799> frets<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.400> then<00:04:23.300> you're<00:04:23.419> gonna

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
finger two frets and then you're gonna
