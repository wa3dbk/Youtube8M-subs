he<00:03:10.690> makes<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:10.989> second<00:03:11.440> effort

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
he makes that second effort

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.890 
he makes that second effort
and<00:03:12.220> picks<00:03:12.640> up<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.850> touchdown<00:03:13.540> or<00:03:13.750> should<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
and picks up the touchdown or should I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.780 
and picks up the touchdown or should I
say<00:03:14.079> first<00:03:14.260> down<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.829> get<00:03:15.040> sacked<00:03:15.430> once

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
say first down and I get sacked once

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.479 
say first down and I get sacked once
again<00:03:16.329> so<00:03:17.140> here<00:03:17.290> comes<00:03:17.500> starting<00:03:17.799> 13<00:03:18.160> Michael

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
again so here comes starting 13 Michael

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.819 
again so here comes starting 13 Michael
Vick<00:03:18.640> is<00:03:18.790> going<00:03:19.150> deep<00:03:19.360> in<00:03:19.570> my<00:03:19.690> receiver<00:03:20.260> uh-oh

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
Vick is going deep in my receiver uh-oh

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.819 
Vick is going deep in my receiver uh-oh
it<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:22.739> intercepted<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.070> again<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.829> believe

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
it is intercepted and again I believe

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.190 
it is intercepted and again I believe
that<00:03:27.100> was<00:03:27.280> number<00:03:27.579> 21<00:03:28.060> I'm<00:03:28.239> not<00:03:28.390> sure<00:03:28.660> yet<00:03:28.959> but

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
that was number 21 I'm not sure yet but

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.930 
that was number 21 I'm not sure yet but
it<00:03:29.380> was<00:03:29.590> one<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.040> safeties<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.519> their

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
it was one of the safeties and their

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.240 
it was one of the safeties and their
safety<00:03:31.239> their<00:03:31.630> core<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.140> safeties<00:03:32.650> they

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
safety their core of safeties they

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.160 
safety their core of safeties they
didn't<00:03:33.459> get<00:03:33.579> burnt<00:03:33.850> on<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.030> plays<00:03:34.510> but<00:03:34.900> most

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
didn't get burnt on the plays but most

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.390 
didn't get burnt on the plays but most
of<00:03:35.320> the<00:03:35.410> time<00:03:35.620> they<00:03:35.769> were<00:03:35.829> there<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.130> make<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
of the time they were there to make the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.220 
of the time they were there to make the
tackles<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.150> obviously<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:37.900> guys<00:03:38.019> see

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
tackles and obviously you guys see

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.500 
tackles and obviously you guys see
interception<00:03:38.829> so<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.070> 24<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.519> 28<00:03:39.760> we<00:03:40.360> have<00:03:40.480> a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
interception so it's 24 to 28 we have a

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.910 
interception so it's 24 to 28 we have a
minute<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.989> work<00:03:41.110> with<00:03:41.350> here<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.739> third

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
minute to work with here in the third

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.020 
minute to work with here in the third
quarter<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.430> was<00:03:42.549> like<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.760> know<00:03:42.850> what

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
quarter and I was like you know what

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.370 
quarter and I was like you know what
it's<00:03:43.180> time<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.450> pick<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:43.720> up<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.170> game<00:03:44.350> I

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
it's time to pick it up on the game I

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.130 
it's time to pick it up on the game I
have<00:03:44.590> 300<00:03:45.070> yards<00:03:45.370> but<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:45.910> also<00:03:46.299> have<00:03:46.780> three

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
have 300 yards but I also have three

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.930 
have 300 yards but I also have three
interceptions<00:03:47.650> as<00:03:47.950> well<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.610> is<00:03:48.760> not

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
interceptions as well so that is not

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.120 
interceptions as well so that is not
good<00:03:49.120> at<00:03:49.209> all<00:03:49.329> because<00:03:49.600> at<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.930> same<00:03:50.110> time<00:03:50.380> you

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
good at all because at the same time you

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.550 
good at all because at the same time you
do<00:03:51.430> want<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.850> still<00:03:52.180> impress<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.989> colleges

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
do want to still impress the colleges

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.380 
do want to still impress the colleges
that<00:03:53.860> you're<00:03:54.190> gonna<00:03:54.340> probably<00:03:54.700> end<00:03:54.910> up<00:03:55.209> going

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
that you're gonna probably end up going

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.140 
that you're gonna probably end up going
to<00:03:55.690> because<00:03:56.019> they<00:03:56.530> want<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.829> see<00:03:57.040> how<00:03:57.579> you<00:03:57.640> play

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.870 
to because they want to see how you play
in<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:59.200> game<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.890> matters<00:04:00.400> so<00:04:00.430> we're<00:04:00.730> not

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
in the game that matters so we're not

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.069 
in the game that matters so we're not
playing<00:04:01.090> selfish<00:04:01.450> here<00:04:01.630> we're<00:04:01.750> gonna<00:04:01.840> give<00:04:02.049> it

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
playing selfish here we're gonna give it

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.500 
playing selfish here we're gonna give it
to<00:04:02.200> my<00:04:02.380> running<00:04:02.560> back<00:04:02.859> and<00:04:03.010> finally<00:04:03.510> regain

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
to my running back and finally regain

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.289 
to my running back and finally regain
the<00:04:04.810> lead<00:04:05.079> so<00:04:05.440> we<00:04:05.470> have<00:04:05.829> four<00:04:06.730> minutes<00:04:07.090> here

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
the lead so we have four minutes here

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.590 
the lead so we have four minutes here
into<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.690> fourth<00:04:07.959> quarter<00:04:08.260> scores<00:04:09.070> 31<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:10.120> 20

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
into the fourth quarter scores 31 to 20

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.289 
into the fourth quarter scores 31 to 20
a<00:04:10.750> look<00:04:11.200> at<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.410> clutch<00:04:11.739> catch<00:04:12.160> by<00:04:13.030> my

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
a look at that clutch catch by my

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.960 
a look at that clutch catch by my
receiver<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.170> overall<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.220> goal<00:04:15.400> is<00:04:15.610> still<00:04:15.790> to

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
receiver so overall the goal is still to

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.180 
receiver so overall the goal is still to
score<00:04:16.450> in<00:04:16.539> this<00:04:16.630> possession<00:04:17.200> but<00:04:17.470> like<00:04:17.979> we

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.890 
gonna have to simulate they can't do
anything<00:04:42.160> with<00:04:42.669> their<00:04:42.880> possession<00:04:43.419> you<00:04:43.630> guys

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
anything with their possession you guys

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.379 
anything with their possession you guys
see<00:04:44.110> they<00:04:44.259> have<00:04:44.470> no<00:04:44.830> timeouts<00:04:45.580> remaining

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
see they have no timeouts remaining

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.050 
see they have no timeouts remaining
