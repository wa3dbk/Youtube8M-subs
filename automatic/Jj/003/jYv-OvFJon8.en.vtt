00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
 expensive 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.030
 didn't her mother teach her how to get out 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.030
 follows 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.310
 Well, look here, she finally 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.320
 I learned how to erase my mind 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.440
 she got to this question easily 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.820
 answer you will be surprised but I got up 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.490
 does it happen that we look through 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.640
 the pane of glass that first followed 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.730
 Would we take out the conclusion without knowing 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.360
 all the facts, the savior burned you 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.440
 see the speck in your brother's eye and 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.580
 the log in your eye you don't notice or 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.190
 to paraphrase 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.310
 why are you looking at dirty laundry in 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.490
 your neighbor's house and not notice 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.450
 dirty window 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.040
 own home there is no way 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.650
 know the heart 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.460
 human intention or circumstances 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.390
 whose words or deeds we have gathered 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.310
 criticize that's why we have 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.310
 do not judge a commandment
