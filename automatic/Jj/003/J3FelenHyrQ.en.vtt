00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.270
 well it's it's Mr. values 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.760
 good finds himself a new video 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.230
 commented on black ops two points 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.000
 gameplay in match to their pack and so 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.269
 in a new mode so the word neither 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.859
 bonus that is to add you 50 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.840
 points to each kill 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.809
 so it comes down to 150 points each kill 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.540
 it seems to me that it's also 50 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.120
 points for assistance so a mode 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.140
 from it seems to me that's called the mode 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 outbidding or riding horses 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.550
 of calls makes sure to think about 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.960
 put for another end mode that you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.360
 not see from the coast of cure 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.690
 north have not left really the same 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.250
 mad madk ahmad's style quite nice and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.079
 play so there is only the m 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.730
 I think it's pretty normal 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.430
 since it's true that sold drops 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.110
 get faster your strict scores 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.090
 necessarily if you find in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.650
 dominance I can tell you that you 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.450
 go see a lot of hunting groups 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.680
 in the air it's a little normal 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.049
 that they put that same same if 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 it's true that glam goes pretty fast 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.409
 so that's why the video so 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.840
 it lasts a little bit of time so the least 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.509
 of five minutes so know that I have not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.040
 frankly debate you finally I have not 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.439
 not much to tell you but 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.030
 so here I saw a little bit changed 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.869
 a little bit of fashion with the same ones 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.329
 do not see it often 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.909
 especially you have access to be a very 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.009
 good gameplay so you say that very little 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 can be a strike before the nuclear 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.060
 so I'm seems to me that I'm going 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.560
 die at 19 2 nd series and then so here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.970
 my street scores that sort that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.070
 I had the lot of terns the dogs 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.360
 as well as hunting groups so 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.970
 frankly the scores is that I you 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.049
 advise greatly on the notes to his 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.850
 discoveries 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.579
 so this setting back up of there is not bad 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.439
 maps that do not have a lot of 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.420
 buildings even that's true there is no 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.680
 wrong in some maps but hey 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.509
 still remains maps we will say 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.130
 pleasant enough it's true that on this 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.090
 opus is not fortuitously frank of 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.040
 map that I hate 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.380
 I had a little bit all the maths even 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.000
 if we have maybe one or two bombs 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.190
 never a little less played and me that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.360
 a little normal 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.590
 so here is the score then I can 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.230
 to tell you that it's still a pretty 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.660
 versatile but that's pretty random 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.910
 for me because sometimes frankly 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.530
 if you have enough good connection 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.480
 would be that one can easily the jirs 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.160
 and especially with a silencer that goes down 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.120
 really the level of damage so I 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.950
 can you guarantee that it's not 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.380
 frankly pleasant start playing with 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.260
 these terms if you have more of that 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.030
 a connection to these averages or even very 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.370
 no one i can guarantee you that you have 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.820
 galley with this weapon but it remains 3rd 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.800
 a weapon that for me has a small side 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.600
 friendly good is it anyway 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.460
 when his rate of fire catches up with her 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.860
 although it's true that the level of 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.720
 damage is frankly very low and 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.690
 again there was a dish a flat patch 1 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.660
 a patch so recently which consisted 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.850
 seemed to me to decrease the decline of this 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.900
 armed 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.970
 good she has a little less than 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.580
 backward than before even though they are 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.920
 that crises by the level of damage 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.150
 were a little bit diminished good this is getting 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.400
 Feel a little bit for me 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.780
 I see a little bit before even simon 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.660
 then I recovered a little bit 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.220
 decerto I was doing a little bit less 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.530
 multiplayer I was really all his 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.380
 bed and its sewage fencing me good side 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.150
 and so that's it so it's a weapon 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.950
 which for me is quite random 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.239
 if you have a good connection so much 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.000
 better I think you can do 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.020
 something not bad with this weapon 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.120
 but that and that when you have a 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.550
 a little mean connection I can you 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.000
 to guarantee a little galloping with 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.010
 this weapon 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.810
 but well so that's it so I'll try 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.310
 to send this video so to 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.540
 asshole so a big thank you to them 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.160
 if they pose on their channel for 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.709
 change their own to this video while 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.540
 simply to be at an excellent 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.580
 gameplay I need to remind you too 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.920
 it's v6 cices so I did a very 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.600
 big ratio especially place portion that is 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.090
 not necessarily and anywhere necessarily 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.430
 in in youtube so I'm for not 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.660
 a little bit and if you have gameplay 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.010
 with weapons a little less 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.870
 used even on art just like 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.269
 often at last I can say good you 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.730
 often compared to fags wmp 7th 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.370
 smc messai with a weapon found 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.290
 a little less often than this kind 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.459
 So here I am for myself 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.830
 make a small description of myself 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.540
 so I 'm making videos since a few 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.600
 years so it'll do a little bit 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.300
 less money 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.360
 that I'm doing videos I'm on 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.860
 youtube have a little bit over three years 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.990
 I make visitors touched videos 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.690
 so on the massacres whose most 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.310
 quiet and muller and that's fine 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.460
 I have little concept so his 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.320
 picture of little moment that finally decerto 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.030
 I let you see coming on my channel 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.850
 if it tempts you and then why not 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.800
 subscribe and lakes and the video on 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.050
 the subject code string if he accepts 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.510
 so here's for the video so I'll you 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.260
 make a nice video 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.750
 to give you a little bit of my 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.750
 news we end up on a 41 for a 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.550
 dead very straight you are a very beautiful 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.570
 part today the next door 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.570
 you beat everybody
