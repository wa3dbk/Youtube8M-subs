real quick so if we just make my self

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.999 
real quick so if we just make my self
prestige<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:44.930> as<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.829> not

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
prestige one as you can see it's not

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.550 
prestige one as you can see it's not
it's<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.610> level<00:01:47.729> 55<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.899> that's<00:01:49.350> how

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
it's not level 55 because that's how

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.340 
it's not level 55 because that's how
this<00:01:49.829> Tool<00:01:50.040> Works<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> prestige<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
then you do the rank like that and then

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.280 
then you do the rank like that and then
obviously<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.170> exit<00:01:58.170> out<00:01:58.259> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
obviously if I if I just exit out of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.789 
obviously if I if I just exit out of
that<00:01:58.880> or<00:01:59.880> minimize<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.630> whatever<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.439> can<00:02:01.590> see

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that or minimize it whatever you can see

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.870 
that or minimize it whatever you can see
that<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> XP<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.640> absolutely<00:02:03.240> perfect<00:02:03.740> so

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
that the XP is absolutely perfect so

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.800 
that the XP is absolutely perfect so
yeah<00:02:06.079> if<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:07.680> over<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.599> barracks<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
yeah if we go over to barracks I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.780 
yeah if we go over to barracks I
actually<00:02:09.989> did<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.619> fresh<00:02:10.890> start<00:02:11.129> before<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.610> made
