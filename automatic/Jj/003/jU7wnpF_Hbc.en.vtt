onto<00:02:01.979> our<00:02:02.100> next<00:02:02.369> feature<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.659> new<00:02:03.689> version

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
onto our next feature in the new version

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.810 
onto our next feature in the new version
of<00:02:04.469> word<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.920> believe<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> other

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
of word and I believe in all the other

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.960 
of word and I believe in all the other
apps<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.270> well<00:02:07.009> word<00:02:08.009> will<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.310> look<00:02:08.759> at<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
apps as well word will now look at the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.790 
apps as well word will now look at the
metadata<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.599> images<00:02:10.020> spit<00:02:10.319> out<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
metadata that images spit out and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.320 
metadata that images spit out and
automatically<00:02:11.700> correct<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> orientation<00:02:13.080> of

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
automatically correct the orientation of

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.990 
automatically correct the orientation of
photo<00:02:13.770> sadly<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.800> can't<00:02:15.100> get<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.400> working<00:02:15.520> maybe

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
photo sadly I can't get it working maybe

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.210 
photo sadly I can't get it working maybe
because<00:02:16.330> my<00:02:16.510> photos<00:02:16.990> don't<00:02:17.710> spit<00:02:17.950> out<00:02:18.070> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
because my photos don't spit out the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.370 
because my photos don't spit out the
correct<00:02:18.490> metadata<00:02:18.970> however<00:02:19.540> if<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.990> was<00:02:20.200> to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
correct metadata however if this was to

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.870 
correct metadata however if this was to
work<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.770> image<00:02:21.040> would<00:02:21.130> automatically

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
work the image would automatically

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.030 
work the image would automatically
rotate<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.260> way<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.620> should<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.950> been

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
rotate to the way it should have been

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.000 
rotate to the way it should have been
taken<00:02:25.200> also<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.350> don't<00:02:26.500> know<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:26.740> noticed

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
there but there's a new sort of weird

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.980 
there but there's a new sort of weird
rotation<00:02:29.290> rule<00:02:30.300> regarding<00:02:31.300> photo<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.810> if<00:02:31.900> I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
rotation rule regarding photo so if I

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.350 
rotation rule regarding photo so if I
rotate<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.410> image<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.860> image<00:02:32.890> actually

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
rotate the image the image actually

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.880 
rotate the image the image actually
moves<00:02:34.360> around<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.690> page<00:02:34.900> like<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.230> which<00:02:35.620> I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
moves around the page like that which I
