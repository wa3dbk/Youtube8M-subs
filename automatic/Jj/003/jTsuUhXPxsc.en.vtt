00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:14.200
 We went to the Nikon booth Here at the Nikon booth 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:19.180
 It is a newly announced lens 1835 mm f 3.5 4.5 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:24.310
 I would like to introduce here it is even if it is here that anything 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:27.320
 First Karl Now is the amazing fact of it is that weight here 385g 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:33.110
 That is 8 here 16 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.460
 The size is different this much in comparison with which one with 35 years 3 4 year here from here 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:42.820
 680 g 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:42.820
 The weight is also quite light with this being 385g. Actually this lens 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:53.200
 and put Let's go to the d 800 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:57.510
 There is a camp like a light and easy to hold hold maybe this very perfect 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.510
 What's wrong with this d 800 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.620
 The price is that the 99,750 yen hope posted price 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.930
 hey 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.270
 This lens called has also become a very affordable kana 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.420
 Here is 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.690
 It is 800mm 5.6 that was announced this time 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:28.860
 I think the size is a bit confusing 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:38.970
 About 400mm f to by using the actual weighs I went 4590 ducati Mr. 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:46.240
 There is an impression of buber as much as 4 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.310
 Here is a dedicated teleconverter of 800 mm here 1.25 times 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.939
 It seems to be 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.290
 The aperture is f 7.1 by setting this. 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.910
 It is so become 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.950
 Since it is 1.25 times equivalent to about 800 mm, a telephoto equivalent to 1000 mm by attaching this 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.950
 It will be called a lens
