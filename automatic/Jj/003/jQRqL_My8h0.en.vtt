only<00:00:30.119> half<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.599> bar<00:00:30.810> we're<00:00:30.990> looking<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.320> here

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
only half a bar we're looking at here

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.600 
only half a bar we're looking at here
and<00:00:31.470> we're<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:31.679> gonna<00:00:31.830> repeat<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.369> round

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and we're just gonna repeat that round

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.360 
and we're just gonna repeat that round
and<00:00:32.790> round<00:00:32.940> around<00:00:33.200> so<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.950> look<00:00:35.070> at

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and round around so if we just look at

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.490 
and round around so if we just look at
the<00:00:35.430> hands<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> first<00:00:37.079> drum<00:00:37.350> beat

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the hands this is the first drum beat

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.080 
the hands this is the first drum beat
you<00:00:37.649> might<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.070> learned<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.579> your<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:39.059> your

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
you might have learned in your in your

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
you might have learned in your in your
drumming<00:00:39.510> career<00:00:39.960> we've<00:00:40.500> got<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.739> snare<00:00:40.980> hi-hat

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
drumming career we've got a snare hi-hat

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:55.600 
drumming career we've got a snare hi-hat
one<00:00:45.620> we've<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.800> snare<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.250> two<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.520> four

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.479 

easy<00:00:56.610> right<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.800> basis<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
easy right so that's the basis of the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.670 
easy right so that's the basis of the
beat<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.329> gives<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.690> funky<00:01:01.199> edge<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
beat and what gives it the funky edge is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.979 
beat and what gives it the funky edge is
the<00:01:01.859> sixteenth<00:01:02.340> note<00:01:02.520> bass<00:01:02.699> drum<00:01:02.969> pattern<00:01:03.120> so

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the sixteenth note bass drum pattern so

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.510 
the sixteenth note bass drum pattern so
um<00:01:06.350> I'll<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.590> play<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> bass<00:01:08.040> drums<00:01:08.340> we're

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
um I'll just play the bass drums we're

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
um I'll just play the bass drums we're
breaking<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:08.850> slowly<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.420> you've<00:01:09.510> got<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
breaking down slowly if you've got the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.480 
breaking down slowly if you've got the
sheet<00:01:10.049> music<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.530> look<00:01:11.159> at<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
sheet music there look at that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
sheet music there look at that
look<00:01:11.939> whenever<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:13.049> how<00:01:13.229> I'm

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
look whenever it and see how I'm

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
look whenever it and see how I'm
counting<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.250> first<00:01:14.490> ones<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.850> beat<00:01:15.030> one

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
counting it the first ones on beat one

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.660 
counting it the first ones on beat one
then<00:01:15.960> we've<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.259> two<00:01:16.470> consecutive<00:01:16.979> sixteenth

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
then we've got two consecutive sixteenth

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
then we've got two consecutive sixteenth
notes<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:27.049> okay<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
notes on and out so we go okay with the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
notes on and out so we go okay with the
hi-hat

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.810 

so<00:01:43.710> that's<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> first<00:01:44.250> part<00:01:44.460> there's<00:01:44.670> one

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so that's the first part there's one

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.249 
so that's the first part there's one
more<00:01:45.000> base<00:01:45.180> now<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.840> beat<00:01:46.020> two

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
more base now and this is on beat two

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.620 
more base now and this is on beat two
it's<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> 2e<00:01:47.100> there's<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> second

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it's on the 2e there's on the second

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's on the 2e there's on the second
sixteenth<00:01:49.200> note<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.590> beat<00:01:49.770> two<00:01:50.100> straight

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
sixteenth note of beat two straight

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.370 
sixteenth note of beat two straight
after<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> snare<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.869> hat

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
after a snare and hat

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.980 
after a snare and hat
so<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.640> beat<00:01:53.820> two<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.600> then<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> hi-hat

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
so for beat two we go and then a hi-hat

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:17.750 
so for beat two we go and then a hi-hat
on<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> and<00:02:07.880> second<00:02:08.880> part<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:17.010> that's<00:02:17.250> tricky

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
on the and second part so that's tricky

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.030 
on the and second part so that's tricky
the<00:02:18.120> way<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.360> practice<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.500> basically

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the way to practice it is is basically

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.259 
the way to practice it is is basically
what<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.550> did<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.819> we<00:02:20.910> break<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.299> down

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
what I just did so we break it down

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.860 
what I just did so we break it down
really<00:02:24.269> slow

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
really slow

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.180 
really slow
get<00:02:24.989> those<00:02:25.110> limbs<00:02:25.410> locked<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.010> do<00:02:26.069> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
get those limbs locked in and do the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.400 
get those limbs locked in and do the
base<00:02:26.370> with<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> hat<00:02:26.910> make<00:02:27.840> sure<00:02:28.019> it's<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.380> a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
base with a hat make sure it's with a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.030 
base with a hat make sure it's with a
hat<00:02:33.140> only<00:02:34.140> when<00:02:34.290> you're<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.830> comfortable

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
hat only when you're really comfortable

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.280 
hat only when you're really comfortable
both<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.640> those<00:02:35.760> two<00:02:36.060> sections<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.959> bring<00:02:37.200> it

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
both of those two sections you bring it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:03:02.380 
both of those two sections you bring it
together<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.160> whole<00:02:38.370> phrase<00:02:38.670> together

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.470 

however<00:03:03.390> if<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.620> want<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:05.070> there<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.209> bit<00:03:06.390> of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
however if you want to there is a bit of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.539 
however if you want to there is a bit of
room<00:03:06.630> for<00:03:06.690> adding<00:03:07.140> another<00:03:07.739> snare<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.370> goes

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
room for adding another snare it goes

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.030 
room for adding another snare it goes
like<00:03:08.790> snare<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.359> out<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.720> two<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.799> far

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
like snare on the out of two so so far

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.949 
like snare on the out of two so so far
to<00:03:11.370> beat<00:03:11.609> to<00:03:11.820> go<00:03:13.910> we<00:03:14.910> then<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.329> snare<00:03:15.660> on<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
on the sheet music with a bracket around

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.860 
on the sheet music with a bracket around
the<00:03:22.290> brackets<00:03:22.590> suggesting<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.459> go<00:03:23.579> tonight

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
the brackets suggesting it to go tonight

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.530 
the brackets suggesting it to go tonight
to<00:03:24.870> e<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.440> AH<00:03:29.000> now<00:03:30.000> I'll<00:03:30.120> play<00:03:30.299> with<00:03:30.450> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
to e and AH now I'll play with the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:54.160 
to e and AH now I'll play with the
dynamics

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.840 

just-just-just<00:03:55.170> use<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.160> sometimes<00:03:56.550> they<00:03:56.700> use

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
just-just-just use it sometimes they use

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.180 
just-just-just use it sometimes they use
it<00:03:56.970> all<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.150> time<00:03:58.040> okay

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
it all the time okay

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.160 
it all the time okay
obviously<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.640> tracks<00:03:59.910> a<00:04:00.060> lot<00:04:00.300> faster<00:04:00.930> so

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
obviously the tracks a lot faster so

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:09.200 
obviously the tracks a lot faster so
it's<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:01.500> more<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:01.890> speed<00:04:07.700> that's<00:04:08.700> more<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
it's so more the speed that's more the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.240 
it's so more the speed that's more the
kind<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.570> tempo<00:04:09.930> we've<00:04:10.080> got<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.380> up<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.530> I'm

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
kind of tempo we've got to get up to I'm

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.690 
kind of tempo we've got to get up to I'm
really<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.760> main<00:04:11.970> challenge<00:04:12.480> there<00:04:12.720> is<00:04:13.700> those

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
really the main challenge there is those

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.400 
really the main challenge there is those
two<00:04:14.910> consecutive<00:04:15.300> sixteenth<00:04:15.930> notes<00:04:16.170> on<00:04:16.260> that

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
two consecutive sixteenth notes on that

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:47.780 
two consecutive sixteenth notes on that
and<00:04:45.530> people<00:04:46.530> talk<00:04:46.710> about<00:04:46.890> for<00:04:47.280> playing<00:04:47.490> bass

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
and people talk about for playing bass

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.820 
and people talk about for playing bass
drums<00:04:48.950> I'm<00:04:49.950> using<00:04:50.190> here<00:04:50.490> up<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:52.530> is<00:04:52.650> just

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
drums I'm using here up and this is just

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.950 
drums I'm using here up and this is just
for<00:04:53.370> me<00:04:53.490> I<00:04:53.520> mean<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:53.970> don't<00:04:54.030> like<00:04:54.480> to<00:04:54.600> be<00:04:54.690> drawn

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
for me I mean I don't like to be drawn

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.170 
for me I mean I don't like to be drawn
on<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.290> whole<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.770> on<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.850> whole<00:04:56.940> subject

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
on the whole and on the whole subject

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.490 
on the whole and on the whole subject
saying<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.750> right<00:04:57.930> others<00:04:58.200> are<00:04:58.350> wrong

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
saying is that right others are wrong

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.350 
saying is that right others are wrong
because<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:59.010> seems<00:04:59.250> there's<00:04:59.700> there's<00:05:00.000> lots<00:05:00.240> of

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
because it seems there's there's lots of

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.930 
because it seems there's there's lots of
people<00:05:00.600> that<00:05:00.870> can<00:05:01.050> play<00:05:01.169> really<00:05:01.830> well<00:05:01.980> with

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
people that can play really well with

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.370 
people that can play really well with
every<00:05:03.210> technique<00:05:03.600> so<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:03.960> think<00:05:04.020> it's<00:05:04.260> more

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
every technique so I think it's more

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.080 
every technique so I think it's more
about<00:05:04.560> finding<00:05:04.770> what<00:05:05.100> suits<00:05:05.370> you<00:05:05.580> best<00:05:05.610> what

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
about finding what suits you best what

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.800 
about finding what suits you best what
you're<00:05:06.210> comfortable<00:05:06.450> with

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
you're comfortable with

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.900 
you're comfortable with
I<00:05:07.040> definitely<00:05:08.040> think<00:05:08.370> it's<00:05:08.520> worth<00:05:08.700> exploring

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
I definitely think it's worth exploring

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.060 
I definitely think it's worth exploring
all<00:05:09.480> the<00:05:09.630> options<00:05:09.990> which<00:05:10.650> we're<00:05:10.770> not<00:05:10.860> going<00:05:10.919> to

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
all the options which we're not going to

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.820 
all the options which we're not going to
go<00:05:11.190> into<00:05:11.370> here<00:05:11.700> I'm<00:05:12.050> just<00:05:13.050> going<00:05:13.200> to<00:05:13.290> quickly

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
go into here I'm just going to quickly

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.700 
go into here I'm just going to quickly
show<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.190> what<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.460> personally<00:05:15.440> prefer<00:05:16.440> for

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
show you what I personally prefer for

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.680 
show you what I personally prefer for
this<00:05:16.830> kind<00:05:17.100> of<00:05:17.160> technique<00:05:17.490> but<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.510> know<00:05:18.630> I'm

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
this kind of technique but you know I'm

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.060 
this kind of technique but you know I'm
the<00:05:18.750> same<00:05:19.020> I'm<00:05:19.260> constantly<00:05:19.680> experimenting

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
the same I'm constantly experimenting

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.220 
the same I'm constantly experimenting
trying<00:05:20.520> new<00:05:20.760> things<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:21.210> adapting<00:05:22.080> the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
trying new things and adapting the

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.870 
trying new things and adapting the
technique<00:05:22.710> depending<00:05:23.250> on<00:05:23.370> what<00:05:23.580> I'm<00:05:23.700> playing

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
technique depending on what I'm playing

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.880 
technique depending on what I'm playing
but<00:05:24.690> for<00:05:24.870> something<00:05:25.050> like<00:05:25.320> this<00:05:25.470> it's<00:05:25.680> quite

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
but for something like this it's quite

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.420 
but for something like this it's quite
rocky<00:05:26.190> quite<00:05:26.640> funky<00:05:27.150> I'm<00:05:28.050> here<00:05:28.380> that<00:05:28.590> we've

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
rocky quite funky I'm here that we've

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.890 
rocky quite funky I'm here that we've
got<00:05:29.550> two<00:05:29.700> consecutive<00:05:30.120> sixteenths<00:05:30.720> I'm

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
got two consecutive sixteenths I'm

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.370 
got two consecutive sixteenths I'm
playing<00:05:31.140> the<00:05:31.260> first<00:05:31.590> no<00:05:32.479> more<00:05:33.479> on<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.750> toe<00:05:33.990> and

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
playing the first no more on the toe and

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.710 
playing the first no more on the toe and
then<00:05:35.160> coming<00:05:35.490> down<00:05:35.520> onto<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.090> ball<00:05:36.330> of<00:05:36.510> my

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
then coming down onto the ball of my

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.250 
then coming down onto the ball of my
foot<00:05:37.110> for<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.590> second<00:05:38.070> note<00:05:38.780> so<00:05:39.780> that's<00:05:39.990> how<00:05:40.229> I

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
foot for the second note so that's how I

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.350 
foot for the second note so that's how I
do<00:05:40.440> it<00:05:40.860> so<00:05:41.070> what<00:05:41.610> I'll<00:05:41.700> do<00:05:41.850> now<00:05:41.880> is<00:05:42.060> I'll<00:05:42.300> show

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
do it so what I'll do now is I'll show

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.650 
do it so what I'll do now is I'll show
you<00:05:42.630> that<00:05:42.750> foot<00:05:43.050> technique<00:05:43.290> slowly<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.729> fast

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
you that foot technique slowly and fast

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.990 
you that foot technique slowly and fast
and<00:05:46.140> then<00:05:46.590> with<00:05:46.770> a<00:05:46.800> bit<00:05:47.010> of<00:05:47.040> wizardry<00:05:47.430> maybe

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
and then with a bit of wizardry maybe

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.880 
and then with a bit of wizardry maybe
I'll<00:05:48.240> play<00:05:48.360> it<00:05:48.510> fast<00:05:48.780> but<00:05:49.050> slow<00:05:49.290> it<00:05:49.410> down<00:05:49.530> so

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
I'll play it fast but slow it down so

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.770 
I'll play it fast but slow it down so
you<00:05:49.979> can<00:05:50.100> actually<00:05:50.190> see<00:05:50.550> precisely<00:05:51.510> the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
you can actually see precisely the

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.900 
you can actually see precisely the
technique<00:05:52.080> I'm<00:05:52.200> using<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.590> speed<00:05:52.860> but<00:05:53.580> slow

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
technique I'm using that speed but slow

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.790 
technique I'm using that speed but slow
down

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
down

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.559 
down
easy<00:05:55.009> to<00:05:55.190> see<00:05:55.310> what's<00:05:55.430> actually<00:05:55.580> going<00:05:55.909> on<00:05:56.090> -

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
easy to see what's actually going on -

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.129 
easy to see what's actually going on -
check<00:05:56.810> that<00:05:56.840> out<00:05:56.990> now<00:05:58.180> so<00:05:59.180> as<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.509> explained<00:05:59.930> the

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
check that out now so as I explained the

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.670 
check that out now so as I explained the
first<00:06:00.379> sixteenth<00:06:01.190> note<00:06:01.930> of<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.169> bass<00:06:03.379> drums

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
first sixteenth note of the bass drums

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.110 
first sixteenth note of the bass drums
I'll<00:06:03.860> actually<00:06:04.039> come<00:06:04.340> up<00:06:04.370> higher<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:04.849> play<00:06:05.030> on

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
I'll actually come up higher and play on
