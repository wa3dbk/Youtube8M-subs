00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.510
 good 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.440
 hi everyone knows that the echo and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.780
 welcome on final fantasy xiv for a 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.980
 deny group training it's true that 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.869
 it's a bit like the name of a mission 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 commando but that's not the case 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.779
 some asked me in 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 youtube reviews is what there is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.810
 a search for dungeon groups and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.310
 well yes indeed there is one 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 so I started looking for 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.020
 dungeons for classic dungeons because 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.940
 that I have to make of my lebel but 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.300
 except that the bomb has its own camp 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.380
 first for a group c is mission 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.960
 the very first mission its missions 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.960
 level 10 it's really going to be the b to 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.940
 ba du pve ie time which is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.260
 caring about the pastures and where you go 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.379
 see you will quickly understand any 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.730
 way beginning of the mission 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.960
 so eliminate the enemies are you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.539
 show enemies of the same group 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.890
 fighting solitary attention does 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.390
 not attract the attention of many 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.680
 groups at the same time monitored the field 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.700
 admitted vision take also keep 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.290
 attacked or that they project the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.460
 characters back if legault goal 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.960
 you spot all the enemies you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.250
 will attack stay out of his field of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.580
 vision eliminate like apart from a 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.130
 well that's how it is when you stop at the pot then 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.020
 the time that is gone then I want 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 eliminate the small threat 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.130
 first league but i'm going to do my 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.270
 new to water that rips visuals from 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.560
 phew then by cons his part not 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.560
 why that sometimes I do not know 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.799
 exactly okay we are all levels 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.060
 12 that's why as it is a single 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.829
 I got level 18 we are a little 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.409
 little constricted in our fate since it's 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.549
 the ba level that's why I'm 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.840
 bridled in my lot so I can not 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.159
 use my lover otherwise it's true 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.689
 a little too fast I have to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.509
 admit it I do not know what is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.349
 extremely powerful but good it makes 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.399
 three times more damage 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:58.020
 when you have three peaks necessarily 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.490
 maybe has the little mini dragor so 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.349
 good well it's really not so complicated 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.090
 damon level 9 11 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.560
 remains to see a little bit the boss I 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.390
 guess I do not know how long 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.739
 lasts its missions this is really the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.670
 very first then there I do not know must 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.360
 maybe they go into the cern 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.799
 have ranked in the circle I suppose to 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.849
 here he appeared so there I think he 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.709
 it's up to me to make a little 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.910
 hen to the bow so the time is gone 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.500
 which he took all the fat and even 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.620
 with big pounds of which he understood nothing 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.329
 legault bout you to spot and mine 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.629
 and his associates before moving on to 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.400
 giant green where you will not fizzle 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.629
 like that it's done ah I love this visual 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.980
 arrows here it seems that 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.139
 absorb natural energy that's 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.599
 beautiful for me it's really 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:42.030
 really not complicate a two 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.440
 first group missions then by 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.880
 against here it is a little bit 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.010
 short video format that I you 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.530
 proposed that is to say that unlike 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.970
 to other mmorpg final fantasy x 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.419
 especially square enix have imposed a 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.769
 date very very long even up 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.239
 the latest open beta and others we do not 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.650
 could not broadcast anything from the game so 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.540
 unlike other mmorpg or 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.220
 usually with the beta one is a 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.319
 little bit of the game which allows me 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.419
 to make a video in quotation marks 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.829
 global to explain you the whole game 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.139
 to explain you different 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.709
 faceted sap was fantasy final frame 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.389
 xiv 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.280
 I reserved myself a little bit 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:16.230
 the surprise because I participated 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.060
 only at one beta for 4-5 hours 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.849
 I really liked it I went up to level 5 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.510
 6 that's all there is the noble mission 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.400
 completed 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.380
 good mission accomplished it was 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.239
 really really simple but so of the 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.190
 shot in final fantasy xiv I'm going 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.870
 approach videos a little bit more where 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.160
 I will advance in the game and I will 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.629
 discover the facets and I wanted 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.430
 will discover through my videos 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.169
 here in a fairly short format like 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.269
 that one then what a demonstration 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.440
 here is your compensation with a 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.500
 little extra to encourage you 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.880
 income to lend me a hand 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.250
 bonus for the first time that I the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.900
 do bonus because no warrant was ko 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.250
 so yeah that makes me win in the end 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.660
 as much xp as a quest I close 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.700
 my level so I will not complain 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.020
 if not a small facet that I can 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.160
 to show you already is that we can mix 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.260
 the rise of classes you see the 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.690
 talents as a quarter at home I can 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.600
 choose three pugilist talents for 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.100
 the moment because I'm level 19 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.680
 so gm mike hours so that allows for 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.030
 do an iron to this nerve actually on the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.850
 target only I must have succeeded 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.780
 a dodge I can take the rise of 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.430
 other classes for now I just 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.110
 a pugilist level 12 may you can 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.579
 fit all classes and neck 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.959
 mix some spells you can not 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.030
 access all class spells 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.230
 but it can give some small 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.720
 nice stuff anyway good I'm going to them 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.430
 to say anyway a little I have there because 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.800
 that it's french gg to you me 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.450
 are back for a second mission then 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.360
 always level says this mission there 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.200
 it's the one that follows I do not know what 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.760
 I will have my mission after 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.560
 maybe it will be at least of the most 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.540
 high level 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.400
 so that's what we have to do then 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.320
 they will tell us I think when 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.640
 bachmann suffered damage he invokes 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.870
 to bring to fight with him the 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.490
 combatants in charge of the defense of 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.169
 the team must strive to attract 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.700
 limited of all opponents on 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.950
 them to protect their mate yes good 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.240
 well it can be not bad I think 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.400
 those who must attract enmity 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.640
 sealed as one so let's leave 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.550
 make 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.990
 is that the hypogeum of tam 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.090
 tara it's his name it's not that it's 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.229
 by a dungeon anyway it's just 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.729
 a mission to the quay armand that's it 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.290
 Tam Tara projects I do not know if 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.520
 you can tell yourself in the 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.690
 comments if that's really it 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.000
 tartaras projects I thought star 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.040
 keep to stretch the first dungeon 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.080
 that I have to do it is his task a 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.940
 so i know i do not know at all if 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.250
 this is the case for everyone because 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.930
 that in fact my missions led me to 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.200
 city ​​in town and so I got to 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.970
 sallaumines that and I have the dungeon of 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.530
 to focus on doing and maybe 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.110
 that actually if you start to 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.729
 binza brienza that will take you to the 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.589
 other cities with 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.909
 we will tell other stories and suddenly 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.620
 you are not going to have the same first 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.969
 dungeon than me it's true that the story 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.110
 is still pretty changeable because 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:50.629
 that we can wander a little bit in 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.999
 the world once we attack it's a 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:55.249
 little bit to all this tells you can 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:57.110
 enough to wander what there is no 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:58.490
 of really predefined route one can 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.099
 pick up quests right on the left at 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.389
 plon we can change class and at 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.589
 Ticino, by the way, is not bad 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.719
 mix of classes I think there will be 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:08.809
 a dedicated short video entirely 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.979
 just by lot I wait to go up 

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:13.759
 my level 30 archers 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.559
 and therefore pugilist level 15 to be able to 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.990
 go into bard job like that I 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:19.189
 could you explain how 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.569
 is going to be archers how is it going 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:21.949
 pugilists how does it go from 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.050
 make a mix of the two helped beard 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.819
 how is it going to mix spells 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.800
 to get December pugilists playing 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.439
 to get spells darche and in 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.939
 playing pugilist etc 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:34.069
 we really got really easy there on 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.899
 the pve stuff a little my leg he has 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:37.759
 and then it'll be done soon you're here 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:39.529
 short video formats I think the 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.180
 first the next forgiveness will be 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.919
 really on the first dungeon that I 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.779
 have to do so it will be a good level 20 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.580
 but it will be really different 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:47.689
 thing I think it will be a real 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.339
 dungeon commands is used to them 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:51.110
 PvE know about mmorpg 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:52.580
