00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you can come in and take a look at the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.190 
you can come in and take a look at the
clamps<00:00:41.149> how<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.329> clamp<00:00:42.629> together<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.960> room

is<00:00:46.440> set<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.829> place<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:48.149> what<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.690> once

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
is set in place and then what we do once

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.010 
is set in place and then what we do once
the<00:00:49.079> room<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.500> set<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.670> come<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the room is set then we come in and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.760 
the room is set then we come in and
we'll<00:00:52.199> set<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.590> frame<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.480> then<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
we'll set the frame and then we put the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610 
we'll set the frame and then we put the
door<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> door<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> last<00:00:58.260> thing

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
door on so the door is the last thing

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.530 
door on so the door is the last thing
that's<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.949> simple

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.350 

this<00:01:02.540> here<00:01:02.930> is<00:01:03.410> an<00:01:03.680> inside<00:01:04.070> release<00:01:04.280> handle<00:01:04.850> so

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
this here is an inside release handle so

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.560 
this here is an inside release handle so
you<00:01:05.449> can<00:01:05.810> use<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.440> room<00:01:06.680> say<00:01:07.610> as<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:07.820> panic<00:01:08.330> room

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
you can use the room say as a panic room

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.980 
you can use the room say as a panic room
so<00:01:09.170> if<00:01:09.650> you've<00:01:10.340> got<00:01:10.580> someone<00:01:10.940> breaking<00:01:11.870> and

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
so if you've got someone breaking and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.420 
so if you've got someone breaking and
entering<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:12.590> can<00:01:12.740> come<00:01:12.950> in<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.250> lock

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
entering you can come in and lock

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.760 
entering you can come in and lock
yourself<00:01:13.850> in<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.330> then<00:01:14.480> you<00:01:15.410> can<00:01:15.560> let

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
yourself in and then you can let

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.300 
yourself in and then you can let
yourself<00:01:15.890> out<00:01:17.260> it<00:01:18.260> can<00:01:18.410> also<00:01:18.560> be<00:01:18.860> used<00:01:19.070> as<00:01:19.250> a

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
yourself out it can also be used as a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
yourself out it can also be used as a
storm<00:01:19.700> shelter

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
storm shelter

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.870 
storm shelter

hurricane there wind tested up to 250
miles<00:01:29.479> an<00:01:29.720> hour<00:01:29.870> so<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.830> can<00:01:31.010> be<00:01:31.130> used<00:01:31.430> as<00:01:31.790> a

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820

came through storm shelter and default

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.960 
came through storm shelter and default
it's<00:01:35.450> kind<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.020> three-in-one<00:01:36.790> and<00:01:37.790> you
