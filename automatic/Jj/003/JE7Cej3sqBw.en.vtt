hostile Oh No so how does this hostile
animal<00:00:47.820> trick<00:00:48.090> work<00:00:48.329> well<00:00:49.140> there<00:00:49.260> are<00:00:49.320> three

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
animal trick work well there are three

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.180 
animal trick work well there are three
steps<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
steps to it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.610 
steps to it
the<00:00:50.399> first<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.910> speed<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:52.170> need<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> increase

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the first is speed you need to increase

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
the first is speed you need to increase
the<00:00:52.739> animal<00:00:53.190> speed<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.090> its<00:00:54.239> movements

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the animal speed so that its movements

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.049 
the animal speed so that its movements
more<00:00:54.809> clunky<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> much<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.399> likely<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> run

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
more clunky and much more likely to run

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.020 
more clunky and much more likely to run
into<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> hostile<00:00:58.320> mob<00:00:58.469> would<00:00:59.030> so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
into you as a hostile mob would so

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.529 
into you as a hostile mob would so
secondly<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:02.300> proximity<00:01:03.300> sticks

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
secondly you need proximity sticks

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
secondly you need proximity sticks
basically<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:04.920> those<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.369> are<00:01:05.549> just

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
basically and what those are are just

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.500 
basically and what those are are just
items<00:01:06.570> stacked<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.130> mop<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.180> instance

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
items stacked on the mop for instance

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.770 
items stacked on the mop for instance
