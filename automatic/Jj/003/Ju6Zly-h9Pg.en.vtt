00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:22.500
 dodge car heads 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.289
 diesel same went to the chrysler 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.550
 mean used on this engine 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.650
 1 head for each cylinder of course 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.550
 first here's how on kamaz for example 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.650
 At first I was good to this idea 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.900
 there is if something happened to one 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.300
 head does not necessarily disassemble 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.590
 completely engine but i personally don't 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.090
 worked with this motor 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.270
 but the man who brought me these 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.200
 Head ориorik big thanks to him for that 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.390
 not a video review, he said that at least 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.380
 here and 4 heads were used but 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.590
 head gasket common 1 i.e. 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.969
 You can not both remove and one head and then 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.860
 put in place that is laying 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.600
 one total must be changed anyway 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.930
 gasket and to change the gasket 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:15.659
 need to shoot all the other heads well then 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:19.210
 there are faces where logic is not the point 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.850
 one of the design features here 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.400
 these here are the drive mechanism heads 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.030
 valves here camshaft is at the bottom 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.650
 in the block and the drive goes with rods but toni 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.530
 wells here and here stand and advice 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.780
 the case through the yoke goes drive on 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.909
 valve but here it is by the way 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.790
 used such technology she we do not 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.420
 know how pine used to be on most 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.060
 American cars in 8 of them 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.990
 Motors used such here 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.560
 technology 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.220
 that is, the pin is screwed in here and on 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.220
 this hairpin 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.390
 put the cows base me unfortunately 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.030
 not to show what's here 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.750
 it is here that the construction here 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.650
 kind of well that is the principle of such 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.670
 what here or studs well here they are here here 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.959
 were standing 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:29.950
 the idea is the drive mechanism so but 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:33.489
 the fact is that the effort that 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.340
 evolving that is to overcome 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:40.790
 spring on Jett yourself squeeze and so on 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.660
 that is very large and often these 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:49.510
 studs here for example we have them 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.510
 break have to and finance 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.440
 it is of course a construction in itself 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.560
 cheap, that is, well, what is easier to take 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.630
 drilled a hole 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:08.510
 stud drove hung a yoke and all 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.080
 but nevertheless it does not hold much 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.650
 more aluminum housing 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.250
 the rest of the head is basically done 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.500
 very simple no unusual things 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.299
 no I don't know what leave is my channel here 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.640
 developed it has a rectangular shape 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.350
 which in itself is not very good but for 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.590
 saving space that is they are forced 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.750
 rectangular channels apply but the very 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.030
 saddle internally there to clean the dirt 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.799
 as far as there should be 35 millimeters 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:46.130
 the inner diameter of the channel itself is branded 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:49.100
 barbell we have here about 35 here 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.190
 37 that is the channel developed that is plus 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.320
 rectangular just as required 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.820
 to have a rectangular canal at 30 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.870
 percent had a transverse area 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.600
 section more than round than round 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.910
 the channel that is and to do here is respected 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.390
 the channel basically is that is tide 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.260
 under the guides but it does not render 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.549
 such a significant detrimental effect 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.950
 release of course here is a little bit more 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.169
 crushed but nonetheless too 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.019
 not bad, that is, I want to notice the channel 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:25.039
 has especially at the end he is very good 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.000
 it is visible that it has the form with expansion 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.820
 that is, the channel itself 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.300
 he is not very big at first and he comes out 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.009
 at 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.900
 and here it is 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.139
 that he expands that is this here 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.499
 the wall has an exit here that is 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:43.080
 top one that is it expands that 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:47.740
 required for a good exhaust channel 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.399
 from the cylinder well as usual 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:54.279
 diesel valve head set in 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:05:00.219
 basically flush with the surface they 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:05:02.529
 I put myself a valve here that is not 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:05.889
 he has a protrusion well that is a little bit 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:09.479
 about sazhen there as well as on all other 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:17.439
 diesel is also used here 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:22.559
 for camera here it is whirling in general 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:25.120
 design of diesels used to allow 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:28.289
 boost them their speed 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.909
 characteristics due to use 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.300
 prechamber general here are all designs 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:36.520
 of this type are called for chamber 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.520
 from English if you score in 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.080
 the search engine for camera is crazy about camera 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.620
 translated from English and under it 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.959
 description of all here such here 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.209
 diesel engine layouts 

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:49.779
 the only difference is for 

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:51.490
 camera 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:56.349
 classic which was used 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.949
 earlier she had just 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.990
 that is, roughly speaking there was a channel and which 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.039
 ended with a camera there was a nozzle 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.779
 pour in fuel 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.089
 same is used here 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:11.289
 construction for camera but the difference is 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:13.990
 that it is also called classification 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:17.469
 just swirl cam or swirl 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.029
 camera, in principle, one and the same well, 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.789
 not exactly the same but 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:24.159
 similar things and the difference is essentially 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.289
 the only thing is that the stream here 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:29.259
 already somehow showed one of the previous 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:32.289
 video faxed to agency heads then 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:35.169
 there is a channel located this way 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.689
 there is inside it roughly has a shape 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:40.060
 spherical and channel in this way 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.689
 located so that the air that enters 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.169
 in this for camera 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:46.879
 to make it immediately automatically 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.729
 twisted because in ordinary headlights 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:53.360
 cameras standing there in the middle sometimes 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:57.309
 there is such a divider to break 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.119
 and jet from the nozzle and improve 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:00.979
 blending is also a little bit they 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:02.899
 the volume is different in principle 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:05.110
 have this whole thing classified as 

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:07.969
 for camera pre camera 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.679
 the only thing here is a plus in this 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.329
 designs but it's pure here in 

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.219
 making these heads can 

00:07:11.329 --> 00:07:15.499
 applied on engines with different 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:18.349
 number of cylinders ie conveyor 

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:20.209
 makes one and tighter head and then when 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:22.339
 the assembly is already typed how many heads 

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:25.729
 need so much and put it here perhaps 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:28.279
 the most interesting or positive 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:32.899
 but in principle and again coming back 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:35.259
 total 1 pads is rather a minus than 

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:35.259
 a plus
