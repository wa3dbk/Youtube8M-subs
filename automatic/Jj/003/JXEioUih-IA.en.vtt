00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 ami of craft on the mwc in barcelona 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.910
 I am now on stood by dell here 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.639
 good reason we look at the dell 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:15.630
 Thousands of thousands a very, very beautiful 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:18.000
 tablet so i already told the dell venue 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
 Eight 7000 has only long name for me 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.660
 it is very very beautiful very thin 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 6.1 millimeter sony has just that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.039
 xperia z4 tablet also with 0 6 0 1 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.779
 mm so one of the slimmest 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.789
 Tablets on the market and you can see that too 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.740
 already very nice from behind 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.239
 Processing also has certain 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.920
 curiosities for example on the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.930
 front are stereo speakers the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.329
 but are attached down here and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.800
 just like the front camera is down here 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.149
 in the corner that is unusual 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.320
 with the front camera I can 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.910
 actually imagine that too 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.960
 problems with video calling for 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.450
 At least you have to change your mind 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.350
 handle the device especially if 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.879
 the whole then in the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.140
 landscape mode sap you have the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.449
 possibility the camera either here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.860
 upstairs or down here and that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.539
 the speaker is then anyway 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 only on one side so I would say 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.489
 Actually, the dell venue is eight 7,000 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.430
 intended for portrait use 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.900
 now cover of this design feature 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.420
 away or look again 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.130
 very short, the beautiful back to the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.439
 Metal really feels great too 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.150
 noble are just very hard edges here 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.890
 So little playful little disturbed 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.100
 squirted but just like that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.869
 piece of metal without big gimmicks and 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.869
 down here you see we have it like that 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.759
 a 2 so afford the same with glass 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.490
 or plexiglas are covered here 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.560
 underneath is the main camera that's one 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 8 megapixel camera and here are two 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.079
 Additional cameras that meet one 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.579
 certain purpose 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.619
 Also, I'll be right back 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.290
 namely a relatively cool feature what 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.670
 the cameras the dell venue eight 7000 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.470
 may be very short if the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.470
 remaining dimension still interested 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.409
 So here we have 21 6 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.630
 centimeters in width are 12 4 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.549
 cm in thickness I said already 61 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.090
 millimeter and all the feed to one 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.920
 weight due to the metal case of 305 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.990
 gram the display that you see too 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.100
 already that is an 8.4 inch display that 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.049
 is a size that only really 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.820
 samsung with its galaxy tab it serves 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.350
 and there we have a resolution of this 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.810
 also like the galaxy tab there are the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.030
 1600 times 2560 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.099
 picture points otherwise running there currently 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.810
 yet android 442 kit hit upgrade 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.730
 on lollipop is but should be announced 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.380
 then come and then there is natural 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.209
 is a company that works closely with intel 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.950
 That's why working together is clear 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.140
 Here you can see it quite out of focus or completely 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.950
 very weak there is an intel processor 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.920
 inside the Internet z 35 80 4 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.450
 kapoor numeral with 2.3 gigahertz i have 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.980
 not played on it here but me 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.780
 I already have videos in the net 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.160
 seen where this is played is 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.480
 that would be very powerful 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.470
 of course check if the device then 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.090
 times to test I get am a 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.470
 passionate gamer 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.640
 there'll already find out if that thing 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.190
 powerful enough is two gigabytes 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.930
 ram we still have a 16 gb internal 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.930
 memory and here at the side I had 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.580
 Seen there is a micro SD card slot 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.910
 with which the whole then expand 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.400
 leaves 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.620
 In any case, 128 gigabytes I but 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.200
 just read that there are cards with 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.220
 up to 512 gigabytes go in and out 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.299
 Now I wanted to do something for you 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.670
 tell the camera 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.319
 and I have to go back to her earlier 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.510
 the autologue was on with it 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.440
 I do not always get upset 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.670
 the presentation 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.519
 Now I'm going to the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.420
 Landscape mode makes that way and away 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.650
 then we have here in the camera now 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.329
 are probably not served 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.130
 before I hired me stupid now 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.510
 I explain to you simply and that is 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.769
 this camera by the two addition 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.530
 Cameras I'll put you on the back 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.180
 really could have shown depth 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.100
 to recognize and measure that is 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.590
 you can shoot a photo with it and 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.150
 can then afterwards the finished picture 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.890
 We draw lines and then draw 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.870
 tell the app the gallery 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.790
 in fact how wide back there now 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.620
 For example, this red line is up 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.519
 he crosses the pink line and that is 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.200
 very handy for example 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.519
 his room is photographed and 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.079
 try how somehow fit one 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 table and how much distance is left 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.260
 So there are quite interesting 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.670
 application scenarios and that became me 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.269
 just demonstrated that they actually 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.530
 also relatively precise and accurate from the 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.810
 Battery still very briefly 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.910
 Now do not let me lie, I believe 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.720
 it was 5900 milliamps up 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.130
 every case over 5000 that should be enough 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.200
 should be a real cross-country skiing 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.569
 the dell venue and it is beautiful 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.190
 as I said with the q2 curiosities that 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.530
 the stereo speaker down here 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.630
 one-sided in landscape format 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.550
 and that the front camera also yes 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.710
 also at an unusual place 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.240
 at least once, that said 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.030
 device comes these days in Germany 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.080
 in the trade and then goes off I know 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.910
 not if there is another version 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.160
 So the base version is supposed to be around 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.960
 the 350 euro cost we will be the device 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.580
 Of course, detailed review as soon as it 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.470
 then we really arrived and 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.590
 then tell you if that is in competition with 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.740
 for example to galaxy tab it 8.4 or to 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.419
 Nexus 7 or the game tablet is the 7th 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.940
 duty or shall we say the compact 8 inch 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.350
 7 2 8 inch tablets which are very very 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.610
 I'm popular to the body running the 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.780
