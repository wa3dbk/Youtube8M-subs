so you can go from this look let me just
turn<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.840> little<00:02:09.930> bit<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:10.470> get<00:02:10.650> a

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
turn that up a little bit so I can get a

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.700 
turn that up a little bit so I can get a
better<00:02:10.860> look<00:02:11.160> good<00:02:11.460> here<00:02:11.700> pullback<00:02:12.740> fire<00:02:15.710> and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
better look good here pullback fire and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.660 
better look good here pullback fire and
then<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.730> looks<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.360> it<00:02:18.540> just<00:02:18.570> slides<00:02:18.990> over

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
then this looks like it just slides over

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.290 
then this looks like it just slides over
there<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.030> locks<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.640> which<00:02:23.820> look<00:02:24.060> do<00:02:24.180> you

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
there and locks in so which look do you

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.700 
there and locks in so which look do you
like<00:02:24.360> better<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.810> think<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.380> without

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
like better I think I like it without

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.740 
like better I think I like it without
that<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.130> there<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.600> let's<00:02:27.600> just<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:29.750> dart

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that on there but let's just see dart

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.730 
that on there but let's just see dart
storage<00:02:31.910> yeah<00:02:32.910> yep<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.720> slides<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.290> straight

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
storage yeah yep it slides in straight

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.100 
storage yeah yep it slides in straight
so<00:02:35.040> tip<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.120> front<00:02:36.420> just<00:02:36.660> double-checking

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
so tip in front just double-checking

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.590 
so tip in front just double-checking
that's<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:39.830> that's<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.010> gun<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:42.300> let's<00:02:42.450> see
