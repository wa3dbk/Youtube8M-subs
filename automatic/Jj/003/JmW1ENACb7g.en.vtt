00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.850
 Hello dear apple-fan users today we want to betray a far 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.150
 and secondly, followers will be the Kate 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.750
 from Konami to viruses or an old building is not through now directly into play 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.120
 to find it costs a Euro 51 and can be installed on both devices 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.929
 So a uniVersa 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.129
 this value still continues and we play here these little researchers in the 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:24.169
 Previous year 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.179
 and we have to jump through the levels and that works like you do 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.249
 looks with a finger in the appropriate direction 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 then the little frog jumps with it for example now we get 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.750
 even change a new info here camera angle 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.290
 if we push up here in the upper area 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.220
 which should not continue like this 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.830
 seems to work 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.040
 But you can understand it too, you can follow every angle 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.510
 right and left-handed people 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.730
 maybe to see if you're anything else 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.770
 I have fallen down meanwhile 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.900
 Let's see if I can get him up 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 No, all right, he is old, even though he is 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 no longer alive and who will be doubled again 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.830
 where is it at the beginning was here at this what of the world 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.120
 Furthermore, you can use the small frog with the right one 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.410
 click on the right half of the screen to drive the tongue out for example 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.150
 now come to these little flies 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.500
 Robert has me then come back soon to jump over 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.330
 but that is not so tragically ironic now and I know something about it 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.480
 show the forests 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.140
 and then you can get up here now that was close to each other only 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.550
 a long press with color buckets on it and then forward then 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.860
 Origin of the Cretaceous 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.260
 two teachers year 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.640
 Zelaya is holding another one percent 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.920
 Ulf Röller will be a small help "If you mourn like this only if you 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.260
 did not mix anymore or rather continue to play 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.580
 and again it went on the expert now we can, for example, with the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.040
 Right stick is even percent will fail for the league in the summer 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.079
 you can use it around 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.579
 the performance is filled up Dennis the services here then have first games 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.809
 from 4 both Conrad Rautenbach hike 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:22.539
 our jury, he avoids contact with the animals or mushrooms what it all here 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:27.399
 there is here to small between Laval but it can be stored and then 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.739
 Clowns addition are conquered here because not so convenient there 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.199
 Denon now percent follows us the level in itself 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.589
 and we should now my dear fast 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.619
 either come to an end 

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:46.349
 or a park into it but dedicated Seßler done 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.039
 get such a small overview 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.499
 of course you could then move on to the next level 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.119
 the man had no criminal record 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.119
 and Thomas is now the minister next 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.789
 of course that sounds very pale, of course, you just have to go with the researcher 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:06.540
 checked there are a few more times 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.029
 For example, opponents now have to jump in 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:11.759
 if we are now 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.769
 Here before this was block of flats we can stand here with one click 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.489
 jumping a bit higher, however, fears back and forth 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.930
 Harting around here they are Volta, only this fly is a bit higher 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.640
 but why 4 degrees something 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.009
 unable to grab them once 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:36.009
 nevertheless, just to the evening more 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.689
 okay, it works too 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.879
 Petra Meyer the snail in the background of this the Chi Minh details to the world 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.879
 Yesterday probably already stuck in the world again 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.719
 for us years 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.719
 they should work so well 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:59.219
 Warhol also does not have to be so so you can see bad July fell to me 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.529
 important 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.759
 then let's just leave it that does not seem to have tasted right now 

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.759
 and when to go a bit further here 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.420
 Pierre Wome still completely without extension 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.860
 Arthur Abraham r and Luis Salom was on Wednesday night 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.079
 Philipp Werner members of this workshop Lucas Barrios in the Hexagon 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.120
 canceled 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.610
 and they are now 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.479
 Probably already from the construction won now also normal I fly 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.500
 collected with the big jump and I found it again and again like that 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.039
 pull through 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.360
 In the year the examiners and what happens nothing now begins to Roman 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.650
 can prove 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.190
 and then it's almost over at noon on 4 what was something 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.539
 Whatever you think you are caught 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.279
 yes Ahlen - Bochum 2 that's that percentage of longer jumpers on it 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.620
 pushes and on the day you feel a little further 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.660
 yes as I said we do not want to show you quite so much now there is 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.479
 not so many 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.059
 the game will cost 9 50 cents, the controls will maybe 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.259
 as soon as the sea becomes the company "only I know a little bit 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.539
 but I'm still a few more pictures to come on the case with the thing 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.219
 fifty of 50 participated 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:15.770
 who likes such games 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.910
 has now the first impression is then of course to do so 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.550
 decide if process should be bought or not
