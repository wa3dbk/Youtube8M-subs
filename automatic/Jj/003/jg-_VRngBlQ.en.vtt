00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.290
 the black chroma 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.570
 the black magicians to me mine do not know what 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.040
 name to put him but he was handsome 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.690
 I can assure you that, like mine, 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.690
 yes sure yes 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.660
 we have to explain this because we have 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.340
 finished the cars separately 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.570
 and we have both practically done them 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.790
 same to find out the same is not that 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.890
 the car full of dirt and yours mine 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.350

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.680
 it did not matter, but it is the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.270
 kid denies wheels 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.520
 and if I want some of SUVs to 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.350
 behind and this is around here which I believe 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.880
 that almost better is not worth worth worth 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.079
 it is right 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.030
 vale is worth land zone 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.030
 and he also gave me but yes 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.729
 They both do not let me and you know how to be bad 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.729
 people 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.750
 and how it explodes too yes yes it comes 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.750
 exploits that neither exploited if attention 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.159
 God is wrong what he does is cover 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.159
 politicians 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.170
 of advertising 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.430
 the yellow ones the yellow ones 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.080
 normal 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.080
 the spare I see them yellow 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.840
 I do not see you guy who has bounced boy yes 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.960

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.960
 any 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:10.160
 Take a lad to fuck the police 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.459

 backwards if a duck egg also 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.530
 He has been a man 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.770
 even more for the police who want more 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.770
 flow 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:39.210
 son of a bitch, I give it back to you 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.310
 you know and it also kills the whole principle and 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.930
 by being grateful then yes 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.820
 he has only returned him and now he has 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.760
 come back again there's a couple over here 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.659

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.659
 as soy 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.120

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.560

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.790
 stratus is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.240
 I do not know but the goal is out and not 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 could have arrived 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.290
 sometimes we will analyze the situation 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.610
 It's worth, it's not worth, here's an arrow 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.380
 go down here 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.380
 but here you can not go 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.540
 chosen I there are Molotov cocktails sometimes 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.439
 here 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:30.170
 God I try that the arrow indicates here 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:33.090
 but that is nothing is not even here 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.209
 I 'm sure we 're here afternoons 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.209
 Thank you 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.890
 I did not do anything sure to get worse 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.840
 over here it's because it 's around here 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.150
 over here son of a bitch who was 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.430
 facing 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.430
 fuck you please 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.040
 here 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.849
 well it's over here 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.849
 and goes underneath motherfucker 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.730
 the lights would pass in the post of 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.730
 lemonade 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:38.010
 if it happens but you have put a wheel in 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:38.010
 normal that does not happen to you seriously 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.420
 around here but down the road 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.080
 do not see to your left 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:50.610
 out there but let me turn 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.500
 does not enter uncle with everything 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:59.729
 come on let's see if any 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.550
 I swear to you nothing for nothing you do not believe 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.710
 engraving is to see if I have the goal here 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.950
 and from the catch 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.590
 I macho, I think we 're going to do this 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.590
 debate already getting off the car 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:18.300
 there has to be a solution I shit on 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.940
 everything is serious there has to be something of 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.830
 there must be something else against them 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.260
 Indestructible sticks of these do not think 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.990
 it's how you want dessert 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.820
 a guy 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:34.260
 Now I can not give back to recharge 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.150
 my ass aunts 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.640
 and it continues to exist is that it is like 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.670
 played that that goes around here does not happen in the 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.670
 lifetime 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.259
 for whom 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:51.020
 the police the police I no longer have 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.020
 police me but I stratus look at it 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.660
 to see if I fit something is that it puts 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.710
 it's over here 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.820
 a poster 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.260
 there has to be something that you are looking for and 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.100
 you can go through or something 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.380
 very safe now 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.600
 but there the arrow indicates that there 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.920
 it is clear 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.570
 around here nothing 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.080
 maybe it was that it was with superior there 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.080
 to go under 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.800
 ya the kid balls 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.850
 can not either below it so 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.110
 the police do not pass with that shit of 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:35.490
 cars and she because I do not know what she has to 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.979
 have a solution 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.340
 yes solution and insurance through police 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:43.319
 standing grace 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.610
 I wanted to kill him whether the 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:49.970
 car not because I wanted to kill police to 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.970
 tell me less 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.889
 and we are going to win 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:08.769
 seriously misfortune had reappeared 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:11.349
 out uncle but no car 

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.699
 when killing me that if they wanted to kill me severe 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:14.319
 repression without car without unless 

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:17.559
 We do not get the car light I taste it 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:19.989
 it seems without a car this golden rule girl 

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:25.079
 and no good career sense between 

00:07:19.989 --> 00:07:25.079
 quotes and good if something weird
