00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.900
 back in Marseille did we learn Sunday 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.989
 before the crisis it is useless because well played and I had to apply 2010 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.120
 but if the patient stretcher it's hard to know if their involvement 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 on stage 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.910
 in any case we find ourselves wanting to discover this art 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.590
 it's also the sheikh district that's all 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.590
 it's very knowledgeable we have very few resources 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.040
 a charles chief 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.030
 about forty American investigators who leave I think that 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.300
 everyone is waiting with our not everyone 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.500
 baseball is not everyone who is very much at heart what he told you 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.180
 so why ask for it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.220
 is it because you have human rights 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.900
 of what we are and the unveiling of what was the purpose of disturbing this 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.860
 which is the parcelling of hunters 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.070
 characters 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.610
 in fact it's not a surprise it's not necessarily the ones we have 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.680
 want to show 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.610
 but that's all that refers to this commitment torpedoed by 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.660
 my keyboard 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.710
 as long as it's the way to be stopped the characters we wanted 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.370
 apparently a character of course 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.410
 she points to imagine it 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.540
 the transfer of shares of something much closer 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.270
 rld 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.270
 it hurts but it becomes difficult 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.600
 self-discovery 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.200
 we did not know it was a little ground the parents work from 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.780
 nice practical way 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.250
 a little money we discover everything we are at the beginning of a broken window 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.280
 but happy to have it 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.510
 acceptance of who you know 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.620
 no doubt 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.150
 Michel Cliche 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.409
 he develops 7 axes october 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.619
 everybody is ready 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.519
 we'll have everyone ready to accept it 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.519
 keep going 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.019
 believe that it is sure that anyone 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.329
 because 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.729
 nicolas delame 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.509
 600 meters 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.969
 all is said 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.969
 to govern 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.269
 something that is planned 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.989
 belfort of the database 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.349
 to note that he assigns himself 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.679
 market 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.559
 other audience and like what happened 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.559
 because some managers 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.159
 Why
