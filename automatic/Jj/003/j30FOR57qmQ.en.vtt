00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 earth dear friends today monday 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.600
 that means it's time to review 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.290
 constructor and today we have a constructor 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.920
 Companies BRIC series of combat zones Artem 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.360
 810 and this is our fighter such a set 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.480
 cost us in the store 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.990
 300 rubles somewhere so it is up to him for 300 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.930
 I think I bought a box of brik especially not 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.750
 meaning consider principle she is very 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.849
 simple instruction is the same 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.740
 simple so immediately go to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.790
 most set cheek look what he like 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.510
 presents 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.510
 drove 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.540
 and 1 built is something like a lookout 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.420
 the tower will be carried out from the team here 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.570
 here will be the commander he will 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.630
 give some commands to the radio and how 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.780
 everything is under control here 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.210
 There is a very interesting video camera 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.250
 detail to show it later 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.840
 and here also a barrel with some kind of fuel 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.119
 or something else worth it and here it is 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.470
 This, too, detalyushka Such a building in 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.000
 Overall such a small design but 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.890
 done very cool how can you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.710
 change this such a straight ladder all right 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.020
 detailed this i like you could 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.899
 notice i didn't put the racket here 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.090
 well because they do not fit well and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.310
 unhooked so I just removed them 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.850
 See what an interesting detail is two at once. 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.420
 the details 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:03.240
 it is the camera itself and such 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.310
 I donâ€™t even know the mechanism because 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.729
 he is cool to move like that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.400
 was not yet there is interesting and there 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.890
 lived such a cassette there is a cassette detail 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.040
 right here, right here, everything 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.560
 Circuits collected very cool from this 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.330
 recruited me straight brik pleased this 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.390
 times and then we are already very 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.220
 fighter he looks very cool in 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.050
 even there are no such details 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.970
 superfluous basically everything is in place 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.090
 only me here is the nose is not very 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.550
 like but in principle, in principle, what to 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.500
 it will find fault so you know 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.930
 a little striking but in principle 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.040
 will go and so it looks very cool you 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.410
 can watch it 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.239
 that is, he has a printed item here 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.060
 this, too, that's what brik love for 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.989
 they do not regret how he know prints he 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.060
 everywhere prints 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.239
 here, too, the printed parts are 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.300
 cool here between racquets 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:01.470
 here and the nose 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.239
 falls off yes there are some here 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.260
 cons it for example here is the bow 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.690
 just racquets boiled a couple of times 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.090
 fell off to us a couple of times only and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.849
 just up their badly hitched 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.720
 so basically everything is done here 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.319
 still have a function in this fighter is 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.510
 actually such a mechanism 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.420
 According to the theory, we should move when 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.360
 fighter like this should spin the screw 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.810
 and because there are such gears 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.510
 you see 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.450
 and all is well connected 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.629
 wheels are covered with windows 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.260
 but black is quite so bad done 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.940
 that periodically something clings and 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:52.260
 look now i will demonstrate 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:55.140
 how could you see the propeller 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.120
 I unhooked, that is, everything is something like this 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.220
 very cool done for me 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.230
 I liked this set of duck this is probably 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.360
 that there is nothing superfluous 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.940
 of course I would like some more 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.890
 detailed cockpit that is 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.989
 He will not fly with open cockpit 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.209
 like that 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.819
 the mechanism worked fine but in principle 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.639
 I'm used to the brig that is always some 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.979
 the mechanism they fail 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.229
 but nevertheless I would like to 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.770
 really so that everything spins well 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.560
 okay the mini figures are cool here in 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.349
 principle built any cool there 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.870
 even the parts that I needed it 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.389
 for example, this is how I showed you 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.340
 already to the grid video camera and this one 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.620
 The detail on which it all moves is 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.620
 very cool details they didn't have and 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.479
 In principle, I will not be useful but on 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.460
 today it's not let's put the likes 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.530
 because when a lot of likes are very 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.360
 cool subscribe to join the channel 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.099
 in the group you can look at me on 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.130
 second channel there are also a lot of different videos 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.750
 and earthly life and perhaps yes perhaps this 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.789
 all with you was andrew you watched the review 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.940
 constructor bye and see you next 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.940
 Monday 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.590
 but
