those waves of here without going into

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.990 
those waves of here without going into
some<00:00:36.410> things<00:00:36.620> which<00:00:36.860> we<00:00:37.039> believe<00:00:37.280> that<00:00:37.520> i<00:00:37.730> can

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
some things which we believe that i can

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.279 
some things which we believe that i can
like<00:00:38.239> competitive<00:00:38.899> secrets<00:00:39.649> i<00:00:39.859> think<00:00:41.260> some<00:00:42.260> of

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
like competitive secrets i think some of

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.080 
like competitive secrets i think some of
the<00:00:42.469> examples<00:00:42.710> that<00:00:42.980> you<00:00:43.070> use<00:00:43.370> i<00:00:43.579> mean<00:00:43.730> like

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
the examples that you use i mean like

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.970 
the examples that you use i mean like
like<00:00:44.390> this<00:00:44.629> hardware<00:00:45.140> expertise<00:00:45.739> which

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
like this hardware expertise which

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.490 
like this hardware expertise which
hardware<00:00:46.370> expertise<00:00:46.789> goes<00:00:47.059> exactly<00:00:47.289> like<00:00:48.289> the

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
hardware expertise goes exactly like the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.229 
hardware expertise goes exactly like the
things<00:00:48.739> that<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:49.039> talked<00:00:49.280> about<00:00:49.370> we

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
things that you talked about we

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.790 
things that you talked about we
absolutely<00:00:50.480> are<00:00:50.780> in<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.079> position<00:00:51.170> where<00:00:51.500> we

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
absolutely are in a position where we

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.470 
absolutely are in a position where we
believe<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.370> can<00:00:52.489> drive<00:00:52.929> the<00:00:55.480> Windows

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
believe that we can drive the Windows

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.689 
believe that we can drive the Windows
Phone<00:00:56.780> environment<00:00:57.410> much<00:00:57.710> better<00:00:58.460> than

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
Phone environment much better than

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.549 
Phone environment much better than
anybody<00:00:59.030> has<00:00:59.359> done<00:00:59.390> it<00:00:59.660> so<00:00:59.839> far<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:00.350> think

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
anybody has done it so far and I think

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.110 
anybody has done it so far and I think
we<00:01:00.679> can<00:01:00.829> take<00:01:01.039> it<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.339> a<00:01:01.370> moment<00:01:01.760> I<00:01:01.850> think

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
we can take it to a moment I think

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.639 
we can take it to a moment I think
that's<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.329> exactly<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.809> point<00:01:03.019> I<00:01:03.260> tried<00:01:03.500> to

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
that's the exactly the point I tried to

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.770 
that's the exactly the point I tried to
make<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:03.829> gonna<00:01:04.220> put<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.460> process<00:01:05.000> we<00:01:05.630> have<00:01:05.750> a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
make a gonna put a process we have a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.660 
make a gonna put a process we have a
whole<00:01:05.990> host<00:01:06.200> of<00:01:06.380> expertise<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:07.100> how<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.340> make<00:01:07.640> a

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
whole host of expertise on how to make a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.930 
whole host of expertise on how to make a
phone<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.800> we<00:01:09.800> can<00:01:09.980> bring<00:01:10.160> that<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.640> and

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
phone and we can bring that to and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.140 
phone and we can bring that to and
combine<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:11.840> with<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.200> world-class<00:01:13.150> operating

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
combine it with a world-class operating

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.220 
combine it with a world-class operating
system<00:01:14.480> environment

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
system environment

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.110 
system environment
we'll<00:01:15.530> drive<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.340> operating<00:01:16.790> system

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
we'll drive the operating system

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.000 
we'll drive the operating system
environment<00:01:17.600> further<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.290> operating<00:01:18.590> system

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
environment further the operating system

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.740 
environment further the operating system
will<00:01:19.190> kind<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.580> give<00:01:19.760> us<00:01:19.910> some<00:01:20.420> things<00:01:20.600> to

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
will kind of give us some things to

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.990 
will kind of give us some things to
think<00:01:20.780> about<00:01:21.080> how<00:01:21.470> do<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:21.680> do<00:01:21.830> things<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.850> it

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
think about how do we do things and it

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.850 
think about how do we do things and it
really<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.480> coal<00:01:23.720> design<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.650> whole

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
really is a coal design of the whole

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.380 
really is a coal design of the whole
thing<00:01:25.100> because<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:25.490> from<00:01:26.060> an<00:01:26.210> end-user

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
thing because it's from an end-user

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.570 
thing because it's from an end-user
perspective<00:01:26.750> what<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:27.800> buy<00:01:27.980> is<00:01:28.040> actually<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
perspective what you buy is actually the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.760 
perspective what you buy is actually the
whole<00:01:28.730> package<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.750> not<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.020> bits<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.440> pieces

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
whole package it's not a bits and pieces

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.380 
whole package it's not a bits and pieces
it's<00:01:30.920> actually<00:01:31.220> how<00:01:31.340> is<00:01:31.520> actually<00:01:31.850> integrated

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
it's actually how is actually integrated

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.320 
it's actually how is actually integrated
it<00:01:32.480> kind<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.750> how<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:32.990> whole<00:01:33.380> package<00:01:33.880> but<00:01:34.880> and

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
it kind of how the whole package but and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.810 
it kind of how the whole package but and
if<00:01:35.660> code<00:01:35.900> of<00:01:36.080> nokia<00:01:36.470> code<00:01:36.860> becomes<00:01:37.400> part<00:01:37.700> of

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
if code of nokia code becomes part of

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.660 
if code of nokia code becomes part of
Windows<00:01:38.180> Phone<00:01:38.780> or<00:01:39.080> operating<00:01:40.040> system<00:01:40.430> and

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
Windows Phone or operating system and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.780 
Windows Phone or operating system and
it's<00:01:41.510> available<00:01:41.660> to<00:01:42.050> everyone<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.160> basically

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
it's available to everyone so basically

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.970 
it's available to everyone so basically

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
your competitors getting getting the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.500 
your competitors getting getting the
code<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.400> you<00:01:46.520> have<00:01:46.670> developed<00:01:46.850> are<00:01:47.270> getting

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
code that you have developed are getting

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.630 
code that you have developed are getting
for<00:01:47.690> free<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.530> how<00:01:48.680> do<00:01:48.740> will<00:01:49.160> you<00:01:49.310> recoup<00:01:49.610> that

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
for free so how do will you recoup that

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.690 
for free so how do will you recoup that
investment<00:01:50.350> let's<00:01:51.350> also<00:01:51.590> coordinate<00:01:52.310> here

investment let's also coordinate here
couple<00:01:53.090> things<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:53.960> first<00:01:54.230> of<00:01:54.380> all<00:01:54.610> we<00:01:55.610> have

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
couple things so first of all we have

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.990 
couple things so first of all we have
created<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.570> mutual<00:01:56.900> dependency<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.530> my<00:01:58.000> values

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
created a mutual dependency on my values

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.250

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
the two companies now I think owning a

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.059 
the two companies now I think owning a
question<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.129> think<00:02:24.160> which<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.550> very<00:02:24.760> good

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
question I think which is very good

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.670 
question I think which is very good
it's<00:02:26.879> important<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.930> we<00:02:28.370> understand<00:02:29.370> that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
it's important that we understand that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.589 
it's important that we understand that
its<00:02:31.680> first<00:02:32.249> order<00:02:32.579> thing<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.939> to<00:02:33.090> drive<00:02:33.299> the

its first order thing is to drive the

its first order thing is to drive the
whole<00:02:33.749> ecosystem<00:02:34.620> force<00:02:34.889> will<00:02:35.219> be

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:35.249 
whole ecosystem force will be

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:37.489 
whole ecosystem force will be
competitive<00:02:36.060> piece<00:02:36.389> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.659> Android<00:02:37.049> be

whole<00:02:39.689> apple<00:02:39.810> environment<00:02:40.499> I<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:41.400> that's

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
whole apple environment I think that's

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.459 
whole apple environment I think that's
the<00:02:41.609> first<00:02:41.819> order<00:02:42.090> thing<00:02:42.329> then<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.200> second

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469 
the first order thing then the second

the first order thing then the second
order<00:02:43.620> thing<00:02:43.859> is<00:02:43.980> how<00:02:44.519> do<00:02:44.579> we<00:02:44.700> compete<00:02:45.150> within

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
order thing is how do we compete within

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.959 
order thing is how do we compete within
the<00:02:45.810> Windows<00:02:46.139> Phone<00:02:46.409> environment<00:02:47.069> we<00:02:47.609> believe

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:47.969 
the Windows Phone environment we believe

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.470 
the Windows Phone environment we believe
that<00:02:48.239> we<00:02:48.569> have<00:02:48.870> all<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.769> necessary<00:02:50.189> tools<00:02:50.760> in

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that we have all the necessary tools in

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.509 
that we have all the necessary tools in
any<00:02:51.780> place<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.079> compete<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.739> differentiate

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
any place to compete and differentiate

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.199 
any place to compete and differentiate
as<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.540> kind<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.409> so<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.159> we<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:56.909> be<00:02:57.030> very

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
as a kind of so that we can be very

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.209 
as a kind of so that we can be very
competitive<00:02:57.599> competitive<00:02:58.469> in<00:02:59.099> that

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
competitive competitive in that

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:02.539 
competitive competitive in that
environment<00:02:59.750> we<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:01.379> on<00:03:01.469> the<00:03:01.560> core<00:03:01.799> have<00:03:02.400> to

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
environment we think on the core have to

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.610 
environment we think on the core have to
be<00:03:02.669> careful<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.239> how<00:03:03.419> to<00:03:03.480> use<00:03:03.780> those<00:03:04.079> tools<00:03:04.409> so

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
be careful in how to use those tools so

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.399 
be careful in how to use those tools so
that<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:04.919> don't<00:03:05.099> fragment<00:03:05.579> things<00:03:06.199> again<00:03:07.199> from

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
that we don't fragment things again from

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.379 
that we don't fragment things again from
a<00:03:07.500> developer<00:03:07.980> perspective<00:03:08.159> it's<00:03:08.730> extremely

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
a developer perspective it's extremely

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.110 
a developer perspective it's extremely
important<00:03:09.989> but<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.799> single<00:03:11.669> environment

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
important but it's a single environment

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.890 
important but it's a single environment
single<00:03:12.949> ecosystem<00:03:13.949> well<00:03:14.129> enough

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
single ecosystem well enough

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.270 
single ecosystem well enough
we<00:03:15.900> carry<00:03:16.200> quite<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.710> bit<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:16.950> responsibility

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
we carry quite a bit of responsibility

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.370 
we carry quite a bit of responsibility
that<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:17.970> don't<00:03:18.240> differentiate<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:18.990> places

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that we don't differentiate in places

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.750 
that we don't differentiate in places
where<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.650> doesn't<00:03:19.950> make<00:03:20.040> sense<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.370> different

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
where it doesn't make sense to different

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.720 
where it doesn't make sense to different
 so<00:03:21.930> basically<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:23.160> say<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.550> there

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
 so basically you you say that there

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.730 
 so basically you you say that there
won't<00:03:23.880> be<00:03:24.120> any<00:03:24.330> proprietary<00:03:24.720> nakia<00:03:25.500> code

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
won't be any proprietary nakia code

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.260 
won't be any proprietary nakia code
inside<00:03:26.160> Windows<00:03:26.550> OS<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:27.030> will<00:03:27.180> be<00:03:27.390> i<00:03:28.280> mean<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
inside Windows OS it will be i mean the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.790 
inside Windows OS it will be i mean the
code<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.480> will<00:03:30.750> work<00:03:30.900> on<00:03:31.020> your<00:03:31.080> Nokia<00:03:31.560> phones

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
code that will work on your Nokia phones

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.740 
code that will work on your Nokia phones
but<00:03:31.950> not<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.280> any<00:03:32.640> other<00:03:32.730> windows<00:03:33.240> phone<00:03:33.450> 7

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
but not on any other windows phone 7

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.960 
but not on any other windows phone 7
whatever<00:03:34.620> yeah<00:03:35.070> what<00:03:35.250> I'm<00:03:35.340> saying<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.820> that

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
whatever yeah what I'm saying is that

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.170 
whatever yeah what I'm saying is that
which<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.209> very<00:03:36.720> important<00:03:37.350> to<00:03:38.120> ensure<00:03:39.120> that

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
which is very important to ensure that

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.750 
which is very important to ensure that
the<00:03:40.070> whole<00:03:41.070> Windows<00:03:41.520> Phone<00:03:41.820> equally<00:03:42.330> Egypt

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
the whole Windows Phone equally Egypt

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.060 
the whole Windows Phone equally Egypt
ecosystem<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.830> homogeneous<00:03:46.830> for

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
ecosystem is this a homogeneous for

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.150 
ecosystem is this a homogeneous for
developers<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:47.940> not<00:03:48.060> fragmented<00:03:48.720> and

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
developers so it's not fragmented and

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
developers so it's not fragmented and
it's<00:03:50.160> not<00:03:50.340> allow<00:03:50.640> interest<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.270> fragment<00:03:51.780> that

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
it's not allow interest to fragment that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.190 
it's not allow interest to fragment that
even<00:03:52.410> if<00:03:52.530> we<00:03:52.739> could<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.959> think<00:03:54.959> there's<00:03:55.110> a

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
even if we could I think there's a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.170 
even if we could I think there's a
plenty<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.709> places<00:03:55.950> plenty<00:03:56.820> of<00:03:56.910> things<00:03:57.060> that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
plenty of places plenty of things that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.300 
plenty of places plenty of things that
we<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.170> top<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.620> without

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
we can do to on top of it without

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.370 
we can do to on top of it without
fragmenting<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.150> environment<00:04:00.780> where<00:04:00.959> we<00:04:01.110> can

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
fragmenting the environment where we can

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.440 
fragmenting the environment where we can
differentiate<00:04:01.830> any<00:04:02.489> possible<00:04:02.940> examples

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
differentiate any possible examples

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.130 
differentiate any possible examples
right<00:04:03.750> now<00:04:03.959> mr.<00:04:04.470> Lee<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:05.370> too<00:04:05.850> early<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:07.110> too

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
right now mr. Lee it's too early and too

investment to make it relevant for the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.300 
investment to make it relevant for the
visions<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:04.730> the<00:05:06.410> problem<00:05:07.410> of<00:05:07.650> a<00:05:07.710> maps<00:05:08.040> and

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
visions so the problem of a maps and

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.790 
visions so the problem of a maps and
navigation<00:05:09.260> location-based<00:05:10.260> service<00:05:10.650> is

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
navigation location-based service is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.710 
navigation location-based service is
actually<00:05:11.190> where<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.610> keep<00:05:12.090> out<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.480> poly

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
actually where I keep out of poly

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.410 
actually where I keep out of poly
