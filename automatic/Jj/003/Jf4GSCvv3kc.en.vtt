go and what he needed to do when you
talk<00:01:36.509> coming<00:01:36.869> into<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.229> building<00:01:37.650> where

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
talk coming into this building where

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.520 
talk coming into this building where
they<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.369> lose<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.170> seven

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
they just don't lose and you have seven

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
they just don't lose and you have seven
turnovers<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.640> five<00:01:41.850> freshmen<00:01:42.270> out

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
turnovers and we have five freshmen out

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
turnovers and we have five freshmen out
there<00:01:42.540> most<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.960> game<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.189> had

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
there most of the game I think we had

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.420 
there most of the game I think we had
five<00:01:44.460> freshmen<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.149> most<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> game

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
five freshmen out there most of the game

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.370 
five freshmen out there most of the game
and<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.909> were<00:01:48.030> times<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.689> look<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.229> had

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and there were times we look like we had

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.580 
and there were times we look like we had

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.080 
bouncing it either make a player get rid
of<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.560> when<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:22.890> did<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.160> look<00:02:23.520> good<00:02:23.700> and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
of it and when we did we look good and

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.570 
of it and when we did we look good and
when<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:24.660> didn't<00:02:24.990> we<00:02:25.140> look<00:02:25.320> bad<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.070> it's<00:02:26.310> just

when we didn't we look bad and it's just
it's<00:02:26.790> hard<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.209> their<00:02:27.540> whole<00:02:27.690> careers

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
it's hard because their whole careers

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.949 
it's hard because their whole careers
they<00:02:28.800> got<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> ball<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:30.120> explored<00:02:30.720> whether

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
they got the ball they explored whether

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.590 
they got the ball they explored whether
they<00:02:31.200> could<00:02:31.260> score<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.550> again<00:02:33.090> they<00:02:33.239> do<00:02:33.300> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
they could score and again they do it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.110 
they could score and again they do it
and<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:34.500> more<00:02:34.530> time<00:02:34.950> then<00:02:35.489> they<00:02:35.640> passed<00:02:35.880> it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
and one more time then they passed it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.180
