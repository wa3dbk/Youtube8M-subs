00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.039
 It is Saturday, 14 March 2015 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.220
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.869
 new edition of engelsburg news and 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 as always it starts with the data of 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.930
 day sunrise was around 6 47 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.059
 sunset will be about 18 32 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.340
 the day started with the twilight at 6 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.230
 Clock 14 and ends with the use of 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.449
 darkness at 19.06 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.510
 and even today we are still in the 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.610
 star sign of the fish and the same 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.559
 on to the moon which is located in 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.250
 ibex of the ibex is in 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.320
 his waning phase and to 42 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.460
 illuminated fashion sunrise tree two 31 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:01.840
 and sunset at 11 34 and with a 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.119
 Distance from 377 1993 kilometers to 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.110
 Earth has come to us again 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.110
 piece approximated 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.289
 Activity is kept on the sun 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.820
 the round still in the moderate range 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.399
 basis radiation lies further in the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.640
 middle b class through showed up in 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:25.660
 the last 24 hours only one m 1.2 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.179
 flair of course from active region 22 97 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.099
 as already mentioned yesterday in us 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:34.470
 the area facing is the activity 

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.470
 not as high as before and after 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.490
 and once again the magneto gram could 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.830
 register an increase 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.890
 now there are five active regions of 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.110
 which one approach 3 beta and 22 97 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.360
 continue beta gamma delta in triplicate 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.170
 is configured and now for ours 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.090
 new audience 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.460
 Here we have a rough formula 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.130
 which assign the classifications 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.800
 Peter configuration usually lead to tough 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.440
 flair beta gamma double configuration 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.570
 have recommended potential beta gamma 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.450
 Delta triple configuration are the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.340
 most unstable and have extra potential 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.280
 but that's just a rough fist formula 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.610
 for easy understanding that's it 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.470
 active region 22 97 the with their beta 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.570
 gamma delta configuration the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.209
 the probability is high 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:32.550
 still at 70 percent in the m and 20 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:34.680
 in the iks class remains as set similar 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.840
 Spiral should be the expected one yesterday 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.670
 km h and reach a g1 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.459
 generate geomagnetic storm 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.140
 it follows in the interval of one day then 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.239
 a much weaker coronal one 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.290
 mass ejection but also 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.290
 should make noticeable 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.110
 Let us now consider the real one 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.270
 parameter also shows a small 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.180
 coronal mass ejection but only if 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.130
 one looks closely 1 km h is denser 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.620
 as a radiation and therefore not 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.110
 quite as hot as the radiation so this 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.349
 he already had us the first km h 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.610
 slightly striped with the outermost edge 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.230
 otherwise the sunwind values 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.230
 almost at normal level 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.160
 the geo magnetic field of the earth 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.040
 reacted with kp 3 and has today 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.140
 early settled at p12 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.239
 this is not a warning now 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.250
 so the strong km h can still come 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.700
 it jump on geomagnetic storm 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.000
 go 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.970
 but so far everything is okay oh yes the m 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.860
 1.2 flair produced a r1 radio 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.480
 blackout so a disturbance in 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.430
 high frequency radio and at the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.430
 Low frequency navigation signals 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.770
 today, no asteroids cross ours 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.480
 train around the sun 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.850
 but tomorrow it's just five of 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.660
 one comes quite close to it 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.060
 tomorrow more 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.770
 there was not much going on with the meteors either 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.810
 the nasa counted just six 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.810
 fireballs on the topic of the usa 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.690
 from the sun now to the earth 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.020
 the seismic activity in the western pacific 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.870
 heroine level with 67 between 4.7 and 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.300
 4.9 and a slightly easier 4.4 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.070
 quake in the usa shows us 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.260
 similar picture as in the last days 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.260
 only there are more quakes today 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.630
 the area from nevada to utah 2.2 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.790
 quake is 36 kilometers deep 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.420
 interesting because it was in the area of 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.190
 area 52 southwest of everything in 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.070
 Central America shook it beside the 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.280
 usual four quakes in the Caribbean up to 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.550
 3.1 once from Nicaragua with 4.7 and 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.950
 once in north columbia with 4.5 where it 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.980
 already on tuesday with magnitude 6.2 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.370
 Wove further south to south many 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.260
 puerto asis ness lived with 5.0 and 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.140
 even more southern at cap horn it came to 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.850
 an expansion quake with 4.7 in the 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.830
 usual ten kilometers deep 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.960
 in europe, the increased holds 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.420
 Seismic level with a focus 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.670
 in the east and west of istanbul 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.430
 particular abnormalities show up 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.680
 no apart from the vesuvius in italy 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.110
 the activity since last autumn 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.570
 grew almost daily it comes to a 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.880
 Small microbes in the crater area 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.680
 suggest a growth of lava tons 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.660
 especially since most quake within 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680
 one kilometer below the surface 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.510
 occur 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.340
 further west into the nursing home 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.280
 Fields one of the three European 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.380
 super volcanoes it is quiet but also 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.110
 there was 15 since the beginning of march 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.600
 microbes most at a depth around 1 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.550
 miles to the end, I still have all 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.620
 expansion quakes in the south 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.080
 Middle Atlantic back also with 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.480
 4.7 in the typical ten kilometers 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.480
 deep was the ocean floor 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.950
 cyclone stage 5 m has heavy on vanuatu 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.290
 raged 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.780
 with speeds over 300 km / h 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.730
 swept perm over the island group that 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.910
 there un office speaks of at least 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.740
 40 dead to many smaller islands 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.330
 there is still no contact what the 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.320
 assessment of the victims and damage 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.320
 makes difficult 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.110
 When europe weather has become too yesterday 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.210
 only a little changed that shows also the 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.520
 look at the weather warnings in europe 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.590
 while in greece still in the west 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.810
 the aegean storm is raging in the 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.970
 other regions of Europe relatively quiet 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.950
 in austria and switzerland is everything 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.510
 in the green area for germany warns 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.480
 the german weather service in the north and 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.880
 east of the country from wind gusts around 55 km / h 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.310
 light snowfall or sleet 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.350
 Smooth roads in Thuringia and Saxony 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:57.280
 still fog comes with sight under 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:58.930
 150 meters added so much for today 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.810
 I wish you a nice one 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.910
 saturday and a relaxing weekend 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.950
 keep your eyes open and your head high 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.670
 because this is the only way to be sure 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.670
 keep a look
