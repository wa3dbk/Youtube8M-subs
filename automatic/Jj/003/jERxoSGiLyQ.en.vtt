00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 with the support of the public it is eating hi with 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.730
 you Sokolovsky and today I will tell 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.649
 you about the 7 most bloodthirsty characters from 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.150
 bibles but first of all I would like 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.980
 tell about what I want to combine 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.259
 all your scientific popular video in one 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.969
 format call it sandwich by the way 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.160
 recently some repulsed to the whole head 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.320
 people wrote to me that they say I take all my 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 Wikipedia Facts I Just Read 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.869
 but this is not true I am by no means 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.289
 steal from wikipedia i do it with others 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.970
 sites 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 But seriously, the scientific facts are they 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.109
 everywhere they are the same 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.759
 they are not coming up with a video blogger from u 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.890
 tuba somehow move on to the topic 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.780
 today's video is not a secret that the bible 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.670
 is a product originally created 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.620
 by the labor of quite ancient peoples 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.960
 primitive and bloodthirsty morals 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.640
 it already later over the years she recorded 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 replenishing less humane 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.079
 postulates however in this ancient 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.390
 fairy tales and parables full of characters 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.969
 numbered saints but being 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 with murderers or crazy 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.410
 get to know them better and resay was 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.570
 a prophet who lived in the ninth century before our 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.219
 era but he performed several miracles 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.559
 for example, returned water or hyunu and 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.360
 resurrected the son of one woman but there is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.880
 one miracle that stands out 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.520
 once children laughed at hay or 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.560
 for which the prophet cursed them and called them 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.509
 on her head the death bark on call 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.189
 2 bears came running and plundered children 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.500
 into pieces that is the righteous prophet 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.180
 brutally killed 42 children simply because 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.130
 that mocked Elisha now! 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.229
 revered as holy i believe that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.490
 unfairly according to the traditions of the church he 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.530
 had these kids first 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.869
 rape king david is probably one of 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.729
 for the right people in the entire Bible and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.400
 if we assume that once he 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.290
 At the request of his wife he killed and then he saved in 200 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.790
 men cruelty often comes with 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.950
 righteousness hand in hand exactly 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.810
 the righteous man begins the slaughter of the Davids army 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.970
 invaded the neighboring lands and destroyed 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.799
 all men and women captured cities 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.600
 The reason for such is indicated in the Bible . 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.490
 the act is known only that it was 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.229
 old inhabitants of the earth apparently david 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.149
 destroyed the indigenous population to the word 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.490
 Goliath was the poor man has cut off his 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.049
 head and carried her around the whole camp 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.119
 samson was bestowed with god 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.990
 superhuman strength with which he 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.210
 should have been victorious before earthlings 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.009
 and he defeated all enemies but then something 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.229
 went wrong and he just started killing 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.000
 everybody he bet with 30 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.200
 men that none of them can 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.239
 solve his riddle 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.790
 if someone succeeds, he will give 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.709
 im 30 silk shirts rivals tricked 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.420
 forced samson's wife to tell them the answer 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.849
 but a warrior to evade payment 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.430
 debt killed 30 other people took them off 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.319
 clothes and gave it to his opponents or 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.269
 I'm a saint who was a prophet before and 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.269
 the forest and until God brought him to heaven 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.140
 when or i was the prophet of israel many 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.630
 people worshiped 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.390
 to the pagan god vaal then he first 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.260
 gathered the 450 prophets of vaal and caused them 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.049
 pray to the altar 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.180
 so that their god would ignite him naturally 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.920
 nothing happened then or I would kill to 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.680
 laid on the altar and prayed to god 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.080
 almost instantly blazing fires of the prophets 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.420
 believed but he still took their screams 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.970
 and one by one all executed but somehow 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.310
 when the willows tried to capture the warriors he 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.260
 summoned from heaven the fire that incinerated them 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.019
 so he killed them and then another 100 people 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.150
 who came to the mark in general he is so 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.970
 zealously killed the Israelites Jews what 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.359
 surely Hitler would be proud of him 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.739
 commercial break 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.150
 if you want to be aware of everything 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.500

 the description there you will find quite a 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.109
 objective opinion of the film critic jesus 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.000
 the legendary legend is a man who 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.190
 destroyed the walls of jericho with 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.109
 hard eyes but as soon as the walls fell 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.930
 army of jesus navina entered the city and 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.910
 killed all the men women and children and this 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.730
 not the only case of the city ​​of showers 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.859
 office needle he chevron and da wird also 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.780
 not every inhabitant was destroyed 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.560
 his death on the tip of the army mites 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.870
 jesus nawin 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.819
 Moses is known for taking the Jews from 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.530
 Egypt but you remember the whole story about 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.700
 Ten Plagues about the fact that in 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.370
 the water and the sea parted 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.959
 and then God gave ten to Moses 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.389
 commandments among which was the commandment 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.030
 do not kill after a victorious battle against 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.250
 Midianite Moses gave the order to kill 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.500
 all male babies and all 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.910
 women who know her husband on the bed of the essence 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.950
 all little girls in cities 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.019
 Midianites were raped by order 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.220
 the saint he once killed people 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.900
 pouring molten 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.400
 gold to their throats just for what they 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.140
 worshiped the golden calf 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.700
 well, just god doesn't like competition for 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.180
 our money so it was obvious 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.740
 step 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.630
 antitrust policy then not yet 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.520
 it was well and finally god is the most 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.230
 bloodthirsty character of the Bible is not enough 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.420
 and a huge book to describe all 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.459
 killing which he committed god 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.440
 destroyed the city entirely like soda and 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.360
 Omar for example once he sawed 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.000
 all of humanity leaving only 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.740
 one family so that she then 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.710
 breeding in incest 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.320
 restored the population he burned harlots 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.150
 and could easily kill 70 thousand people at once 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.460
 once he killed a man just for 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.830
 that he spilled his seed a woman 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.210
 the earth seems to God need not only 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.100
 your money but also so now you 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.020
 understand that Satan compared to 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.670
 god there is still a niche from my point of view 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.080
 bible is strong outdated 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.120
 moral code that isn’t suitable 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.290
 that for the steppe peoples but not for 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.090
 modern society 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.740
 that's why we now have secular 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.050
 state with much more flexible and 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.550
 rules than the dogmas of the church any 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.710
 laws in defense of religion seems to me 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.060
 something stupid however with artistic 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.580
 biblical perspective pretty 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.169
 not a bad book and if not archaic 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.110
 writing style I would read it with such 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.940
 same hunting and as the game of thrones and if 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.640
 would have made the series very much 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.350
 not bad with incest murders and other 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.669
 fun do not forget to subscribe to my 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.500
 channel if still not done because 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.040
 that there will still be videos of that 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.750
 same series 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.830
 share video with friends and more 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.570
 subscribe to my group in contact 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.820

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.110
 finally got 20,000 with you was 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.380
 Sokolovsky all bye 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.210
 and this is signat subscribers at the end of the release 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.250
 two days i will tell you about seven rich 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.380
 thinking precisely because of them the possibility 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.990
 the existence of the catalog and religion of lotteries 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.120
 and easier in idiocy drove effect 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.990
 barnum is quite simple with her than 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.990
 more vague
