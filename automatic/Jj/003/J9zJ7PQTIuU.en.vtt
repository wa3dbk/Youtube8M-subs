00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.910 
face is put on and it's a new mouth
shape<00:00:29.970> that's<00:00:30.840> how<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> most<00:00:31.650> out<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
shape that's how you get the most out of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880 
shape that's how you get the most out of
your<00:00:32.219> characters<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.149> 24<00:00:33.930> mouth<00:00:34.200> shapes<00:00:34.649> will

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
your characters so 24 mouth shapes will

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.600 
your characters so 24 mouth shapes will
make<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.940> second<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.399> vocabulary<00:00:38.399> or

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
make up a second of vocabulary or

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.799 
make up a second of vocabulary or
emotion<00:00:39.420> actually<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.690> one

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
emotion actually and what you know one

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.750 
emotion actually and what you know one
of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> big<00:00:46.079> things<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:46.350> taking<00:00:47.340> something

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
of the big things about taking something

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.069 
of the big things about taking something
out<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.059> putting<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> different<00:00:48.390> object<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
out and putting a different object in is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
out and putting a different object in is
how<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> registers<00:00:49.920> how<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
how it registers how it's going to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.310 
how it registers how it's going to
appear<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> last<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:51.960> because<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
appear like the last one because if you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.260 
appear like the last one because if you
think<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.710> having<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> different<00:00:54.059> face

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
think about having a different face

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.860 
think about having a different face
upwards<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.320> 12<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.129> 24<00:00:56.699> times<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.149> second<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
upwards of 12 to 24 times a second the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.569 
upwards of 12 to 24 times a second the
color<00:00:58.109> has<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.559> exactly<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.219> same<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
color has to be exactly the same the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.209 
color has to be exactly the same the
shape<00:00:59.789> has<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.449> exactly<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> same<00:01:01.219> they

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
shape has to be exactly the same they

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.920 
shape has to be exactly the same they
have<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> work<00:01:02.789> perfectly<00:01:03.570> yeah<00:01:05.689> these<00:01:06.689> faces

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
have to work perfectly yeah these faces

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.130 
have to work perfectly yeah these faces
are<00:01:07.290> done<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.520> powder<00:01:09.240> printer<00:01:09.810> it'll

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
are done with a powder printer it'll

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.450 
are done with a powder printer it'll
just<00:01:10.170> lays<00:01:10.500> down<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> really<00:01:11.070> thin<00:01:11.280> layer

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
just lays down a really thin layer

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.039 
just lays down a really thin layer
powder<00:01:11.790> until<00:01:12.090> eventually<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
powder until eventually you have a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.719 
powder until eventually you have a
three-dimensional<00:01:13.470> object<00:01:13.860> something<00:01:14.520> like

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
three-dimensional object something like

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.670 
three-dimensional object something like
this<00:01:14.880> yeah<00:01:15.210> something<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this yeah something like this and you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
this yeah something like this and you
take<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.100> face<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> dip<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> into<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
take that face and you dip it into a
