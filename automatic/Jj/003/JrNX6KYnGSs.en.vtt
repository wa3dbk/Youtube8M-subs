what<00:00:20.840> what<00:00:21.470> I<00:00:21.680> do<00:00:21.740> when<00:00:22.340> I<00:00:22.369> do<00:00:22.580> this<00:00:23.060> checking

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
what what I do when I do this checking

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.269 
what what I do when I do this checking
and<00:00:23.720> I<00:00:24.439> opened<00:00:24.980> this<00:00:25.160> car's<00:00:25.849> bonnet<00:00:26.779> and<00:00:27.590> I

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
and I opened this car's bonnet and I

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.240 
and I opened this car's bonnet and I
check<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:29.060> where<00:00:29.330> is<00:00:29.480> this<00:00:29.740> coolant<00:00:30.740> present

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
check that where is this coolant present

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.049 
check that where is this coolant present
arc<00:00:31.580> and<00:00:31.910> it's<00:00:32.150> just<00:00:32.870> in<00:00:33.080> here<00:00:33.379> I<00:00:33.760> will<00:00:34.760> solve

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
arc and it's just in here I will solve

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.420 
arc and it's just in here I will solve
it<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:35.540> it's<00:00:36.379> it's<00:00:36.860> in<00:00:37.100> here<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:37.780> in<00:00:39.010> here

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
it and it's it's in here and in here

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.469 
it and it's it's in here and in here
I<00:00:41.080> need<00:00:42.080> to<00:00:42.260> add<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.710> tag<00:00:43.040> to<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:43.820> because<00:00:44.239> now

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:44.479 
I need to add this tag to it because now

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:50.710 
I need to add this tag to it because now
when<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:46.089> walk<00:00:47.089> this<00:00:48.100> coolant<00:00:49.100> put<00:00:49.720> those

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
when we walk this coolant put those

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.000 
when we walk this coolant put those
meaning<00:00:51.589> and<00:00:51.920> lock<00:00:52.190> settings<00:00:53.199> what<00:00:54.199> are<00:00:54.530> in

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
meaning and lock settings what are in

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.420 
meaning and lock settings what are in
here<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:56.330> solves<00:00:56.720> that<00:00:56.900> this<00:00:57.530> level<00:00:57.979> in<00:00:58.190> here

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
here it solves that this level in here

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.590 
here it solves that this level in here
is<00:00:58.640> Max<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.510> min<00:01:00.110> level<00:01:00.559> is<00:01:00.830> in<00:01:01.790> here<00:01:02.180> little

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
is Max and min level is in here little

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.740 
is Max and min level is in here little
bit<00:01:02.869> up<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:03.379> now<00:01:03.530> our<00:01:04.010> coolant<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:05.000> in<00:01:05.299> in<00:01:05.510> this

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
bit up and now our coolant is in in this

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.310 
bit up and now our coolant is in in this
mean<00:01:06.049> level<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:07.310> think<00:01:07.640> that<00:01:07.909> we<00:01:08.869> need<00:01:09.140> to

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
mean level and I think that we need to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.830 
mean level and I think that we need to
add<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.799> little<00:01:09.920> bit<00:01:10.130> cool<00:01:10.670> coolant<00:01:11.299> food<00:01:11.540> in

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
add a little bit cool coolant food in

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.060 
add a little bit cool coolant food in
there<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.460> what<00:01:13.460> we<00:01:13.700> do<00:01:13.970> not<00:01:14.240> next<00:01:14.840> first<00:01:15.740> that

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
there and what we do not next first that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.730 
there and what we do not next first that
is<00:01:16.430> to<00:01:16.850> open<00:01:17.409> this<00:01:18.409> hat<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.960> Paris<00:01:20.960> idea<00:01:21.469> that

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
is to open this hat and Paris idea that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.139 
is to open this hat and Paris idea that
that<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:22.640> can<00:01:23.000> open<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:23.930> cut<00:01:24.920> only<00:01:25.280> when

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
that you can open this cut only when

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:33.849 
that you can open this cut only when
this<00:01:26.359> motor<00:01:27.729> is<00:01:30.429> is<00:01:31.429> not<00:01:31.880> not<00:01:32.840> hook

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
this motor is is not not hook

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.749 
this motor is is not not hook
when<00:01:34.700> motor<00:01:34.969> is<00:01:35.359> should<00:01:36.320> shut<00:01:36.799> down<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.460> it's

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
when motor is should shut down and it's

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.800 
when motor is should shut down and it's
cold<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.219> it's<00:01:40.219> not<00:01:40.490> not<00:01:40.850> hot<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.570> can

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
cold and it's not not hot then you can

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.319 
cold and it's not not hot then you can
open<00:01:42.200> this<00:01:42.350> gap<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:43.280> look<00:01:43.460> this<00:01:43.700> capital

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
open this gap and we look this capital

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.779 
open this gap and we look this capital
bit<00:01:44.479> carefully<00:01:45.009> more<00:01:48.219> okay<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.249> here<00:01:49.549> was

this water in this tank okay and next I
open<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.880> cap<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.480> terrorists<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.170> need<00:03:18.709> to

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
open this cap and terrorists I need to

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.479 
open this cap and terrorists I need to
rotate<00:03:19.100> that<00:03:19.700> cap<00:03:20.030> in<00:03:20.330> many<00:03:20.570> terms<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:22.220> when

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
rotate that cap in many terms and when

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.560 
rotate that cap in many terms and when
it<00:03:22.760> finally<00:03:23.090> opens<00:03:24.640> there<00:03:25.640> is<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:26.470> cap<00:03:27.470> hat

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
it finally opens there is this cap hat

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.900 
it finally opens there is this cap hat
and<00:03:29.570> it<00:03:29.720> opens<00:03:30.670> we<00:03:31.670> can<00:03:31.940> add<00:03:32.209> in<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:32.780> hole

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
and it opens we can add in this hole

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.870 
and it opens we can add in this hole
what<00:03:34.910> is<00:03:35.180> there<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:37.090> put<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.590> insert<00:03:39.590> there<00:03:39.890> like

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
what is there I put I insert there like

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.300 
what is there I put I insert there like
a<00:03:41.180> little<00:03:41.510> bit<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:41.989> we<00:03:42.230> present<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:44.110> coolant

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
a little bit if we present that coolant

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
a little bit if we present that coolant
first<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:48.560> scale<00:03:49.190> that<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:50.200> tell<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.470> odd

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
first this this scale that I tell is odd

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.900 
first this this scale that I tell is odd
hot<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:53.750> here<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.410> add<00:03:55.390> 24<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.830> 20<00:03:57.830> I<00:03:58.040> add

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
hot in here and I add 24 to 20 I add

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.860 
hot in here and I add 24 to 20 I add
this<00:03:59.739> this<00:04:00.739> distance<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:01.610> then<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.420> add<00:04:02.570> same

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
this this distance and then I add same

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.440 
this this distance and then I add same
amount<00:04:03.260> in<00:04:03.440> water<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.840> in<00:04:06.110> here<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:08.269> this

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
amount in water is that in here and this

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.160 
amount in water is that in here and this
position<00:04:09.019> is<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.230> put<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.680> typical

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.430 

that<00:04:14.170> into<00:04:14.680> our<00:04:15.010> coolant<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:18.370> now<00:04:18.520> I<00:04:18.550> I<00:04:19.170> have<00:04:20.170> a

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
that into our coolant and now I I have a

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.340 
that into our coolant and now I I have a
date<00:04:20.890> this<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:22.060> empty<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.230> then<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.720> had<00:04:25.720> same

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
date this to empty and then I had same

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.300 
date this to empty and then I had same
amount<00:04:26.860> this<00:04:27.760> water<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:30.990> this<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.250> this<00:04:33.250> is

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
amount this water and this is this is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.100 
amount this water and this is this is
now<00:04:33.730> this<00:04:34.740> 50%<00:04:35.740> mix<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.400> wrap<00:04:36.550> until<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.810> check

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
now this 50% mix to wrap until I check

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.070 
now this 50% mix to wrap until I check
that<00:04:38.320> where<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:39.370> this<00:04:39.550> my<00:04:40.650> my<00:04:41.650> coolant<00:04:42.640> level

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
that where is this my my coolant level

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.710 
that where is this my my coolant level
and<00:04:44.080> now<00:04:44.290> it's<00:04:44.560> almost<00:04:45.130> in<00:04:45.430> this<00:04:45.700> marks<00:04:46.390> level

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
and now it's almost in this marks level
