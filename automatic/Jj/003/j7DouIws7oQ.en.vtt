the only ones who can use it on those
platforms<00:01:08.330> at<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:08.720> moment<00:01:09.110> because<00:01:09.530> we<00:01:09.710> have

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
platforms at the moment because we have

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.310 
platforms at the moment because we have
unranked<00:01:10.700> servers<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.390> use<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:12.110> course

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
unranked servers to use and of course

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.080 
unranked servers to use and of course
every<00:01:12.890> weapon<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.310> unlocked<00:01:13.700> on<00:01:13.880> those

every weapon is unlocked on those

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.210 
every weapon is unlocked on those
because<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.140> points<00:01:15.470> that<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.740> get<00:01:15.979> when

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
because the points that you get when

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.950 
because the points that you get when
using<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.700> weapons<00:01:17.030> don't<00:01:17.270> actually<00:01:17.509> add<00:01:17.930> up

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
using the weapons don't actually add up

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.560 
using the weapons don't actually add up
to<00:01:18.289> your<00:01:18.409> final<00:01:18.619> score<00:01:19.119> so<00:01:20.119> I've<00:01:20.270> been<00:01:20.360> playing

boffins at Cynthia comm haven't worked

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.539 
boffins at Cynthia comm haven't worked
it<00:01:53.479> all<00:01:53.570> out<00:01:53.630> yet<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.950> lot<00:01:55.219> of<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.369> things

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
it all out yet so a lot of the things

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.099 
it all out yet so a lot of the things
I'm<00:01:55.700> going<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:55.850> be<00:01:55.909> saying<00:01:56.210> are<00:01:56.479> going<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.020> be

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
I'm going to be saying are going to be

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.959 
I'm going to be saying are going to be
guesstimation<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.219> I<00:01:58.340> think<00:01:58.670> I've<00:01:58.789> got<00:01:58.939> a

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
guesstimation but I think I've got a

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.120 
guesstimation but I think I've got a
good<00:01:59.240> idea<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.810> where<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.170> weapon<00:02:00.590> sits<00:02:00.890> in

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
good idea of where this weapon sits in

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.859 
good idea of where this weapon sits in
comparison<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.850> other<00:02:02.030> sniper<00:02:02.390> rifles

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
comparison to the other sniper rifles

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.499 
comparison to the other sniper rifles
that<00:02:02.960> we<00:02:03.079> have<00:02:03.259> available<00:02:03.710> now<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.329> first<00:02:05.329> of

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
that we have available now so first of

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.149 
that we have available now so first of
all<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.840> will<00:02:06.200> say<00:02:06.439> that<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.710> gol<00:02:06.859> sniper

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
all I will say that the gol sniper

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.160 
all I will say that the gol sniper
Magnum<00:02:07.549> feels<00:02:07.759> very<00:02:07.939> light<00:02:08.240> it's<00:02:08.539> not<00:02:08.929> one<00:02:09.140> of

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
Magnum feels very light it's not one of

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.590 
Magnum feels very light it's not one of
those<00:02:09.319> heavy<00:02:09.619> hitting<00:02:09.950> sniper<00:02:10.369> rifles<00:02:10.970> like

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
those heavy hitting sniper rifles like

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.190 
those heavy hitting sniper rifles like
the<00:02:11.870> SRR<00:02:12.290> 61<00:02:13.040> or<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.400> m98b<00:02:14.030> but<00:02:14.840> at<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:14.990> same

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
the SRR 61 or the m98b but at the same

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.470 
the SRR 61 or the m98b but at the same
time<00:02:15.500> it's<00:02:15.860> not<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.520> scout<00:02:16.940> elite<00:02:17.240> or<00:02:17.390> an

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
time it's not like a scout elite or an

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.300 
time it's not like a scout elite or an
m40a5<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.530> think<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.800> sits<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.280> middle

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
m40a5 I think it sits in the middle

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.910 
m40a5 I think it sits in the middle
there<00:02:19.730> with<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.420> jng<00:02:20.930> 90<00:02:21.410> just<00:02:21.650> hovering

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
there with the jng 90 just hovering

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800 
there with the jng 90 just hovering
around<00:02:22.130> being<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.820> middle-of-the-road<00:02:23.300> sniper

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
around being a middle-of-the-road sniper

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.320 
around being a middle-of-the-road sniper
rifle<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.340> first<00:02:25.550> thing<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.820> noticed<00:02:26.180> with

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
rifle so the first thing I noticed with

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.370 
rifle so the first thing I noticed with
the<00:02:26.450> gold<00:02:26.660> snow

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
the gold snow

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.290 
the gold snow
here's<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.860> it<00:02:27.950> has<00:02:28.160> average<00:02:28.760> bullet<00:02:29.090> drop

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
here's that it has average bullet drop

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.030 
here's that it has average bullet drop
it's<00:02:29.540> not<00:02:29.810> one<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.020> those<00:02:30.140> mega<00:02:30.440> weapons<00:02:30.890> that

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
it's not one of those mega weapons that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.860 
it's not one of those mega weapons that
seems<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.430> defy<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.760> laws<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.120> physics<00:02:32.450> and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
seems to defy the laws of physics and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.840 
seems to defy the laws of physics and
has<00:02:33.500> less<00:02:33.800> bullet<00:02:34.100> drop<00:02:34.310> than<00:02:34.490> most<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.790> the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
has less bullet drop than most of the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.610 
has less bullet drop than most of the
other<00:02:35.030> weapons<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.600> game<00:02:35.630> one<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.500> those

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
other weapons in the game one of those

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.620 
other weapons in the game one of those
being<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.010> SRR<00:02:37.340> 61<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.180> one<00:02:38.360> has<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
being the SRR 61 this one has the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.170 
being the SRR 61 this one has the
standard<00:02:39.140> bullet<00:02:39.380> drop<00:02:39.680> at<00:02:39.860> 9.81<00:02:40.700> meters<00:02:41.030> per

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
standard bullet drop at 9.81 meters per

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.910 
standard bullet drop at 9.81 meters per
second<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:42.200> you're<00:02:42.350> looking<00:02:42.440> at<00:02:42.650> anything

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
second so you're looking at anything

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.220 
second so you're looking at anything
over<00:02:43.310> sort<00:02:43.460> of<00:02:43.520> 150<00:02:44.270> meters<00:02:44.420> really<00:02:44.900> having<00:02:45.110> to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
over sort of 150 meters really having to

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.200 
over sort of 150 meters really having to
start<00:02:45.470> calculating<00:02:45.710> for<00:02:46.640> how<00:02:46.760> far<00:02:47.030> that

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
start calculating for how far that

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.730 
start calculating for how far that
bullet<00:02:47.510> is<00:02:47.630> going<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.990> drop<00:02:48.170> for<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.590> get

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
bullet is going to drop for you to get

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.860 
bullet is going to drop for you to get
that<00:02:48.860> headshot<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.550> second<00:02:50.540> thing<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.750> I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
that headshot the second thing that I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.230 
that headshot the second thing that I
noticed<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.740> that<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.070> actually<00:02:52.370> really<00:02:53.030> liked

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
noticed and that I actually really liked

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.690 
noticed and that I actually really liked
about<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.660> Gold<00:02:53.870> sniper<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.400> got<00:02:55.670> a

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
about the Gold sniper is that it's got a

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.430 
about the Gold sniper is that it's got a
really<00:02:55.820> high<00:02:56.270> rate<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.540> fire<00:02:56.750> release<00:02:56.990> I<00:02:57.170> feel

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
really high rate of fire release I feel

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.590 
really high rate of fire release I feel
that<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.770> does<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.250> don't<00:02:58.490> think<00:02:58.850> it's<00:02:59.030> quite<00:02:59.390> on

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
that it does I don't think it's quite on

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.750 
that it does I don't think it's quite on
par<00:02:59.840> with<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.170> m40a5<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.340> scout<00:03:01.610> elite

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
par with the m40a5 and the scout elite

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.820 
par with the m40a5 and the scout elite
probably<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> little<00:03:02.900> bit<00:03:03.110> lower<00:03:03.290> than<00:03:03.440> that<00:03:03.680> as

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
probably a little bit lower than that as

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.490 
probably a little bit lower than that as
I<00:03:03.860> said<00:03:04.130> very<00:03:04.580> similar<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.390> jng<00:03:05.900> 90<00:03:06.380> in

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
I said very similar to the jng 90 in

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.890 
I said very similar to the jng 90 in
many<00:03:06.710> aspects<00:03:07.220> but<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.730> liked<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.450> way<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.870> I

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
many aspects but I liked the way that I

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.510 
many aspects but I liked the way that I
could<00:03:09.140> rattle<00:03:09.320> off<00:03:09.470> one<00:03:09.680> bullet<00:03:09.920> if<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:10.220> didn't

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
could rattle off one bullet if I didn't

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.250 
could rattle off one bullet if I didn't
hit<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.210> can<00:03:11.570> get<00:03:11.690> another<00:03:11.900> one<00:03:12.020> off

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
hit that one I can get another one off

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.980 
hit that one I can get another one off
very<00:03:12.560> quickly<00:03:12.890> with<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> straight<00:03:13.490> pulp<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.000> in

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
very quickly with a straight pulp and in

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.720 
very quickly with a straight pulp and in
terms<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.380> those<00:03:15.500> shots<00:03:15.770> actually<00:03:16.370> hits<00:03:16.550> in

terms of those shots actually hits in
players<00:03:17.000> it's<00:03:17.540> pretty<00:03:17.930> standard<00:03:18.230> you're

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
players it's pretty standard you're

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.440 
players it's pretty standard you're
looking<00:03:18.890> at<00:03:19.010> two<00:03:19.190> shots<00:03:19.490> at<00:03:19.670> any<00:03:19.820> range<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.330> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
it's come through that way because there

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.750 
it's come through that way because there
aren't<00:03:51.140> many<00:03:51.200> sniper<00:03:51.590> rifles<00:03:52.100> in<00:03:52.280> battlefield

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.270 
battlefield 4 so they had to make a
conscious<00:03:56.750> decision<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.410> bring<00:03:57.709> some<00:03:58.040> sort<00:03:58.250> of

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
grateful they brought the Gulf sniper

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.330 
grateful they brought the Gulf sniper

moment and I've been really enjoying
using<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.900> because<00:04:08.989> it's<00:04:09.230> really<00:04:09.380> good<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.709> use

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
using it because it's really good to use

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.110 
using it because it's really good to use
a<00:04:09.890> weapon<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:10.459> haven't<00:04:10.730> used<00:04:10.850> for<00:04:11.090> a

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
a weapon that you haven't used for a

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.390 
a weapon that you haven't used for a
long<00:04:11.300> time<00:04:11.570> but<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.260> can't<00:04:12.590> help<00:04:12.739> but<00:04:12.920> feel<00:04:13.190> it's

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
long time but I can't help but feel it's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.370 
long time but I can't help but feel it's
lost<00:04:13.640> some<00:04:13.820> of<00:04:13.850> its<00:04:14.030> wow<00:04:14.300> factor<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:14.930> was<00:04:15.230> in

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
lost some of its wow factor that was in

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.380 
lost some of its wow factor that was in
bad<00:04:15.590> company<00:04:16.070> 2<00:04:16.250> when<00:04:16.489> we<00:04:16.580> were<00:04:16.700> using<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.150> then

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
bad company 2 when we were using it then

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.470 
bad company 2 when we were using it then
in<00:04:17.919> battlefield<00:04:18.919> 4<00:04:18.980> there<00:04:19.730> are<00:04:19.910> many<00:04:20.209> more

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
in battlefield 4 there are many more

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.270 
in battlefield 4 there are many more
sniper<00:04:20.810> rifles<00:04:21.350> than<00:04:21.500> there<00:04:21.650> were<00:04:21.799> in<00:04:22.010> Bad

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
sniper rifles than there were in Bad

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.060 
sniper rifles than there were in Bad
Company<00:04:22.580> 2<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.240> therefore<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.650> makes<00:04:24.830> it<00:04:24.950> much

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
Company 2 and therefore it makes it much

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.950 
Company 2 and therefore it makes it much
harder<00:04:25.280> for<00:04:25.520> dice<00:04:25.790> to<00:04:25.970> differentiate<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.660> gun

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
harder for dice to differentiate a gun

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.300 
harder for dice to differentiate a gun
against<00:04:27.410> all<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.740> others<00:04:28.040> that<00:04:28.190> are

against all the others that are

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.909 
against all the others that are
available<00:04:28.520> for<00:04:28.910> us<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.060> use<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.750> in<00:04:30.530> bringing

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
available for us to use and in bringing

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.460 
available for us to use and in bringing
that<00:04:31.100> gun<00:04:31.310> back<00:04:31.580> into<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> group<00:04:32.570> of<00:04:32.780> let's<00:04:33.290> say

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
that gun back into a group of let's say

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.260 
that gun back into a group of let's say
10<00:04:33.500> sniper<00:04:34.220> rifles<00:04:34.790> that<00:04:34.880> we<00:04:34.970> can<00:04:35.120> already

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
10 sniper rifles that we can already

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.300 
10 sniper rifles that we can already
choose<00:04:35.630> from<00:04:35.900> it's<00:04:36.590> much<00:04:36.890> harder<00:04:37.130> to

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
choose from it's much harder to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.610 
choose from it's much harder to
differentiate<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.270> goal<00:04:38.510> from<00:04:39.200> all<00:04:39.410> the

ready there and in doing that it doesn't

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.039 
ready there and in doing that it doesn't
quite<00:04:43.189> feel<00:04:43.429> as<00:04:43.639> amazing<00:04:44.329> as<00:04:44.449> it<00:04:44.479> did<00:04:44.749> in<00:04:44.899> Bad

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
assault to actually be released so I can

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.929 
assault to actually be released so I can
use<00:04:53.779> this<00:04:53.959> weapon<00:04:54.439> and<00:04:54.649> start<00:04:55.189> ranking<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:55.759> up

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:55.939 
use this weapon and start ranking it up

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.789 
use this weapon and start ranking it up
and<00:04:56.149> unlocking<00:04:56.449> all<00:04:56.719> the<00:04:56.989> scopes<00:04:57.319> for<00:04:57.619> it

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:57.799 
and unlocking all the scopes for it

00:04:57.799 --> 00:04:59.499 
and unlocking all the scopes for it
because<00:04:58.189> at<00:04:58.339> the<00:04:58.429> moment<00:04:58.459> on<00:04:58.999> the<00:04:59.149> various

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
because at the moment on the various

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:00.969 
because at the moment on the various
servers<00:04:59.869> they<00:04:59.989> only<00:05:00.139> let<00:05:00.349> you<00:05:00.469> use<00:05:00.679> certain

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
servers they only let you use certain

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.339 
servers they only let you use certain
things<00:05:01.129> so<00:05:01.759> I'm<00:05:01.999> pretty<00:05:02.629> much<00:05:02.779> tied<00:05:03.079> to<00:05:03.110> the

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
things so I'm pretty much tied to the

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:04.600 
things so I'm pretty much tied to the
eight-time<00:05:03.679> scope<00:05:04.039> I<00:05:04.189> would<00:05:04.309> have<00:05:04.399> liked<00:05:04.579> to

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
eight-time scope I would have liked to

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.249 
eight-time scope I would have liked to
have<00:05:04.819> tried<00:05:05.029> it<00:05:05.209> with<00:05:05.329> an<00:05:05.419> ACOG<00:05:05.779> to<00:05:05.959> see<00:05:06.110> what

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
have tried it with an ACOG to see what

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:07.779 
have tried it with an ACOG to see what
that<00:05:06.439> would<00:05:06.619> have<00:05:06.649> done<00:05:06.769> I've<00:05:07.369> used<00:05:07.639> it<00:05:07.759> with

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
that would have done I've used it with

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.819
