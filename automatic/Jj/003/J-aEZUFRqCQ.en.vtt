this tree things caught another tree and

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.929 
this tree things caught another tree and
now<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.330> see<00:00:18.630> John<00:00:18.990> one<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.100> our<00:00:20.250> less<00:00:20.760> of

now you see John one of our less of

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.700 
now you see John one of our less of
students<00:00:21.330> dad's<00:00:21.570> come<00:00:21.990> into<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> picture<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
students dad's come into the picture to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.220 
students dad's come into the picture to
come<00:00:23.010> help<00:00:23.220> me<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.269> he<00:00:24.330> actually<00:00:24.660> grabs<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
come help me and he actually grabs the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
come help me and he actually grabs the
chain<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.619> helps<00:00:25.800> me<00:00:25.890> back<00:00:26.099> up<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.550> move<00:00:26.939> over

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
chain it helps me back up and move over

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.939 
chain it helps me back up and move over
to<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.390> different<00:00:27.750> position<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.740> can

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
to a different position so that we can

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
to a different position so that we can
yank<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.760> thing<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> little<00:00:30.330> bit<00:00:30.480> more<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
yank this thing out a little bit more it

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.930 
yank this thing out a little bit more it
starts<00:00:31.080> coming<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.520> still<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.880> good

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
starts coming but it's still not good

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
starts coming but it's still not good
enough<00:00:33.180> because<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:33.960> keep<00:00:34.079> yanking<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
enough because I just keep yanking on it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.010 
enough because I just keep yanking on it
then<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.370> doesn't<00:00:35.579> move<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.450> guess

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
then it doesn't move at all so I guess

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080 
then it doesn't move at all so I guess
at<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.320> point<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:41.190> time<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> cook<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
at this point it's time to cook it the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.369 
at this point it's time to cook it the
track<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> front<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:42.899> motor<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.260> there

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
track to the front and motor in there

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
track to the front and motor in there
and<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.890> pick<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.280> thousands

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and see if I can pick up this thousands

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
and see if I can pick up this thousands
of<00:00:45.180> boundary<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.620> try<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.010> start<00:00:47.160> lifting<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
of boundary and try and start lifting it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.910 
of boundary and try and start lifting it
up<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.940> moving<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> around<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:49.110> this

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
up and moving it around but this

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100 
up and moving it around but this
obviously<00:00:50.370> went<00:00:50.579> nowhere<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.660> thing's<00:00:51.809> way

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
obviously went nowhere the thing's way

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.260 
obviously went nowhere the thing's way
too<00:00:52.140> heavy<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.770> moved<00:00:52.980> around<00:00:53.149> just<00:00:54.149> in

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
too heavy to be moved around just in

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.790 
too heavy to be moved around just in
case<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.600> thing<00:00:54.840> falls<00:00:55.110> let<00:00:55.289> me<00:00:55.379> go<00:00:55.500> move<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
case that thing falls let me go move the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
case that thing falls let me go move the
fence<00:00:56.010> rail<00:00:56.250> though<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.390> not<00:00:57.510> gonna

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
fence rail though so that I'm not gonna

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.990 
fence rail though so that I'm not gonna
take<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.440> piece<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:02.609> honestly

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
take out that one piece and honestly

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
take out that one piece and honestly
we're<00:01:03.359> better<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.930> point<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.530> do<00:01:04.650> them<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
we're better at this point to do them to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.789 
we're better at this point to do them to
cook<00:01:05.850> out<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> chainsaw<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.659> saw<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.619> through

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
the sucker and you know I mean this is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.539 
the sucker and you know I mean this is
one<00:01:11.640> good<00:01:11.850> idea<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.450> another<00:01:12.720> where<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.920> got

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
one good idea to another where I got

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
one good idea to another where I got
most<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.909> way<00:01:15.000> through<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> sod

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
most of the way through it and the sod

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.539 
most of the way through it and the sod
go<00:01:16.409> cut<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> other<00:01:17.189> side

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
go cut a little bit on the other side

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.660 
go cut a little bit on the other side
and<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:19.110> sounds<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.500> dentist<00:01:19.950> drill<00:01:20.220> when

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and it sounds like a dentist drill when

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.880 
and it sounds like a dentist drill when
you<00:01:20.759> hear<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> background<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:22.680> any<00:01:22.830> rate

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you hear the background but at any rate

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.010 
you hear the background but at any rate
I<00:01:23.369> cut<00:01:23.820> through<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.869> know

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.830 

so<00:03:15.160> as<00:03:15.310> thickheaded<00:03:15.550> as<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:16.060> am<00:03:16.240> I<00:03:16.390> figure<00:03:16.690> with

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
so as thickheaded as I am I figure with

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.140 
so as thickheaded as I am I figure with
enough<00:03:17.200> pulling<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.710> this<00:03:17.860> thing<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.400> will<00:03:18.850> end

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
enough pulling on this thing I will end

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.030 
enough pulling on this thing I will end
a<00:03:19.210> little<00:03:19.330> more<00:03:19.480> throttle<00:03:19.840> I'll<00:03:20.650> eventually

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
a little more throttle I'll eventually

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.630 
a little more throttle I'll eventually
break<00:03:21.610> it<00:03:21.760> off<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.740> you<00:03:23.740> know<00:03:23.860> you<00:03:24.250> pull<00:03:24.520> on

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
break it off and you know you pull on

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.190 
break it off and you know you pull on
something<00:03:25.060> enough<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.780> you'll<00:03:26.020> eventually

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
something enough and you'll eventually

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:40.170 
something enough and you'll eventually
get<00:03:26.620> it

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.929 

well<00:03:41.180> now<00:03:41.360> that<00:03:41.420> that's<00:03:41.659> done<00:03:41.810> it's<00:03:42.260> time<00:03:42.500> to

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:42.939 
well now that that's done it's time to

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.250 
well now that that's done it's time to
reposition<00:03:43.939> the<00:03:44.299> chain<00:03:44.599> with<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:44.959> tractor

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
reposition the chain with the tractor

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.740 
reposition the chain with the tractor

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
and see what more we can accomplish and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.080 
and see what more we can accomplish and
once<00:03:47.900> again<00:03:48.110> John<00:03:48.319> helps<00:03:48.709> me<00:03:48.860> out<00:03:48.890> we<00:03:49.640> decided

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
once again John helps me out we decided

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.089 
once again John helps me out we decided
that<00:03:50.120> maybe<00:03:50.629> wrapping<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.439> a<00:03:51.560> little<00:03:51.769> higher

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
that maybe wrapping it a little higher

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.179 
that maybe wrapping it a little higher
would<00:03:52.700> give<00:03:52.879> us<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.150> little<00:03:53.239> bit<00:03:53.420> more<00:03:53.599> lift

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:54.189 
would give us a little bit more lift

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:56.559 
would give us a little bit more lift
going<00:03:55.189> but<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.730> know<00:03:55.819> at<00:03:55.909> this<00:03:56.060> point<00:03:56.329> the

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
and that we did yank it a little bit

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.920 
and that we did yank it a little bit
more<00:04:18.829> but<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.430> mean<00:04:20.000> it's<00:04:20.120> pretty<00:04:20.299> clear<00:04:20.570> that

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
more but I mean it's pretty clear that

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.170 
more but I mean it's pretty clear that
this<00:04:21.229> thing<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.620> stuck<00:04:22.010> in<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.729> other<00:04:22.880> trailer

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
does a branch it's stuck and I thought

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.090 
does a branch it's stuck and I thought
with<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:26.840> other<00:04:27.050> tree<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.500> he's<00:04:27.590> just<00:04:27.919> not

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100

pulling this really safe felt good so
I'm<00:05:37.310> gonna<00:05:37.430> try<00:05:37.670> it<00:05:37.730> from<00:05:37.940> a<00:05:38.000> different

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
I'm gonna try it from a different

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.490 
I'm gonna try it from a different
direction

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
direction

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.110 
direction
we're<00:05:39.650> gonna<00:05:39.740> get<00:05:40.160> up<00:05:40.340> there

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
we're gonna get up there

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.810 
we're gonna get up there
we're<00:05:42.540> falling<00:05:42.840> in<00:05:43.110> our<00:05:43.229> placement<00:05:43.919> once

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
we're falling in our placement once

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.460 
we're falling in our placement once
again<00:05:45.260> nodites

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
again nodites

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:54.010 
again nodites
on<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:47.010> polo

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.630 

so<00:05:55.020> at<00:05:55.290> this<00:05:55.410> point<00:05:55.650> it<00:05:55.800> just<00:05:55.830> seems<00:05:56.160> relevant

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
so at this point it just seems relevant

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.130 
so at this point it just seems relevant
to<00:05:56.730> me<00:05:56.880> that<00:05:57.060> it<00:05:57.150> would<00:05:57.240> just<00:05:57.420> make<00:05:57.570> good<00:05:57.840> sense

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
to me that it would just make good sense

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.140 
to me that it would just make good sense
and<00:05:58.710> go<00:05:58.890> and<00:05:59.190> shorten<00:05:59.580> up<00:05:59.640> the<00:05:59.700> chain<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.030> little

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
and go and shorten up the chain a little

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.960 
and go and shorten up the chain a little
bit<00:06:00.540> and<00:06:00.900> really<00:06:01.650> try<00:06:01.860> yanking<00:06:02.370> at<00:06:02.520> it<00:06:02.670> from<00:06:02.880> a

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
bit and really try yanking at it from a

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.390 
bit and really try yanking at it from a
little<00:06:03.180> bit<00:06:03.330> closer<00:06:03.570> and<00:06:04.080> still<00:06:04.890> all<00:06:05.040> those<00:06:05.190> my

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
little bit closer and still all those my

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.890 
little bit closer and still all those my
shooters<00:06:05.790> pull<00:06:06.030> under<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.300> background<00:06:06.720> or

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
shooters pull under the background or

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.380 
shooters pull under the background or
the<00:06:06.960> people<00:06:07.260> watching<00:06:07.640> so<00:06:08.640> I<00:06:08.670> managed<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.090> port

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
the people watching so I managed to port

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.420 
the people watching so I managed to port
that<00:06:09.510> you<00:06:09.570> can<00:06:09.840> see<00:06:10.140> with<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:10.830> suckers<00:06:11.190> just

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
that you can see with the suckers just

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.040 
that you can see with the suckers just
hang<00:06:11.730> in<00:06:11.880> there<00:06:11.910> off<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.270> ground<00:06:12.690> you<00:06:12.870> can<00:06:13.020> see

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
hang in there off the ground you can see

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.260 
hang in there off the ground you can see
where<00:06:13.320> it's<00:06:13.410> holding<00:06:13.800> on<00:06:13.950> the<00:06:14.070> other<00:06:14.190> tree<00:06:14.520> and

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
where it's holding on the other tree and

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.600 
where it's holding on the other tree and
yet<00:06:15.660> we<00:06:15.780> got<00:06:15.870> nothing<00:06:16.290> so<00:06:16.530> in<00:06:17.250> all<00:06:17.430> honesty

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
yet we got nothing so in all honesty

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.090 
yet we got nothing so in all honesty
there<00:06:18.360> just<00:06:18.720> was<00:06:18.870> enough<00:06:19.140> firepower<00:06:19.440> to<00:06:19.800> pull

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
there just was enough firepower to pull

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.070 
there just was enough firepower to pull
this<00:06:20.250> thing<00:06:20.460> down<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:21.510> make<00:06:21.660> it<00:06:21.690> come<00:06:21.870> all<00:06:21.990> the

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
this thing down and make it come all the

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:31.190 
this thing down and make it come all the
way<00:06:22.110> down<00:06:22.170> to<00:06:22.440> the<00:06:22.530> ground

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:39.260 

I<00:06:36.860> miss<00:06:37.860> my<00:06:38.040> friends<00:06:38.460> is<00:06:38.700> where<00:06:38.940> you<00:06:39.090> can

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
I miss my friends is where you can

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.040 
I miss my friends is where you can
conserve<00:06:39.660> defeat<00:06:40.110> so<00:06:41.070> after<00:06:41.550> much<00:06:41.940> talking<00:06:42.480> we

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
conserve defeat so after much talking we

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.140 
conserve defeat so after much talking we
ultimately<00:06:43.500> decide<00:06:44.250> that<00:06:44.490> we<00:06:44.670> need<00:06:44.700> more

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
ultimately decide that we need more

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.130 
ultimately decide that we need more
firepower<00:06:46.080> to<00:06:46.710> get<00:06:46.860> it<00:06:46.980> off
