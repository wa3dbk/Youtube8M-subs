00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.570
 dollars the construction started to 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.180
 early 2006 and it was February 20 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.410
 happened when this one of the most 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.100
 ambitious of the current administration

 charge the management of the system 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.470
 airport digit account that the new 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.199
 airport is one of the most modern 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.199
 of the world and we are measuring for example 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:03.610
 comparative to see with which they were 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.530
 typical time the average time that 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.800
 a passenger lasted in the process of 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.159
 security of departure or arrival to the country 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.260
 for old support and I can tell you with 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.110
 all certainty that the security that is 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.780
 is offering in this airport has 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.690
 improved in an important way that 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.550
 process time 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.800

 more than 8,000 flights departures and arrivals 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.350
 of more than 600,000 passengers I think that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.240
 the team is super focused on a 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.640
 alone coast and that's customer service 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.040
 then we are communicating and 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.190
 coordinating a lot with the airlines with 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.570
 the passengers focused on improving all 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.940
 the services we offer to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.180
 airport so that people understand 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.030
 the times let's say real transport 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.680
 between removed and new now port that are 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.810
 much less than expected when 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.540
 They arrive where then locate how 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.750
 the parking of vehicles works 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.510
 as I arrived at the check-in area to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.910
 prepare to leave with many years 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.160
 the traveler from Quito the traveler 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.860
 I met Quito International 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.720
 used to the old for the new 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.520
 airport is built with techniques 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.530
 and seismic resistant materials 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.360
 meeting the quality standard and 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.960
 comfort of other airports 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.820

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.800
 the terminal receives the passengers 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.880
 national and international 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.440
 ground floor 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.180
 there are also the new ones 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.430
 bands that deliver the suitcases 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.270
 Its size is bigger and the space 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.980
 where they are located is greater 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.380

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.190
 who travel in and out of the country 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.530
 they find new counter are 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.720
 multifunctional is to say that a 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.250
 passenger in case of emergency can 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.820
 check in at any of them 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.530
 no need to wait a single row 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.780
 each floor has several rooms 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.210
 wait all with spaces and places to 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.130
 eat and the duty free that they offer new 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.960
 products is administered by a 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.940
 Panamanian company that has several 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.160
 premises in different airports of the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.080
 world this space like other 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.520
 Airport areas were designed 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.650
 to expand its infrastructure and 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.170
 operational capacity according to 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.730
 increase of passengers and cargo that 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.010
 space under construction will be the area 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.450
 corporate will connect the offices of 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.340
 the top executives of the new 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.500
 airport of the place will count 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.820
 also with a food court and several 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.680
 business premises 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.290
 said work would be inaugurated in 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.670
 approximately two months one of the 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.890
 structures striking 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.350
 of the new airport is its tower 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.570
 control 41 meters high 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.130
 considered by construction experts 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.390
 as one of the highest in 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.610
 Latin America 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.920
 that is to say of the track because it has four 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.140
 one thousand one hundred meters long almost one thousand meters 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.340
 more than the previous this feature 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.230
 next to the location of the new 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.480
 airport allow the planes 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.240
 take off and go straight to new york 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.490
 Miami and other European countries without 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.590
 need to climb eleven percent of 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.840
 airport charges will be for the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.820
 municipality the broad team points out that if 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.080
 well in some rates went up 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.510
 justify because of the infrastructure 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.430
 modern that the new terminal has 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.160
 hopes that this year the Marshal Sucre 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.340
 registered a movement of 5 million 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.340
