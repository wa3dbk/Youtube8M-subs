00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
two away from school and could be walked

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.630 
two away from school and could be walked
to<00:01:38.819> school<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.450> point<00:01:39.780> as<00:01:39.899> well<00:01:40.579> one<00:01:41.579> of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
to school from that point as well one of

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.099 
to school from that point as well one of
the<00:01:41.729> most<00:01:41.909> important<00:01:42.390> things<00:01:42.509> about<00:01:42.659> kids

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
the most important things about kids

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:44.899 
the most important things about kids
walking<00:01:43.319> to<00:01:43.530> schools<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.219> think<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.729> get

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
walking to schools I think they get

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.630 
walking to schools I think they get
physically<00:01:45.479> more<00:01:46.020> fit<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.159> excited<00:01:47.609> about

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
physically more fit and excited about

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.639 
physically more fit and excited about
coming<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.149> school<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.569> I<00:01:48.929> think<00:01:48.990> when<00:01:49.500> you're

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
coming to school and I think when you're

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160 
coming to school and I think when you're
physically<00:01:50.250> active<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:51.390> more<00:01:51.599> attentive

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
physically active you're more attentive

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.929 
physically active you're more attentive
