00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.130
 there is a multitude of 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.620
 care called said conditioners that is 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.690
 what is one of the conditioners it is 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 simply a care that we will apply 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.410
 on the hair after shampooing and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.690
 which is supposed to penetrate 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.720
 depth the hair fiber perfume of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.119
 restore it unfortunately for us 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.320
 consumers some care stamped 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.090
 of the collector when they speak 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.619
 really then it's better 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.210
 make yourself at home so 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.240
 to be sure of what you bring as 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.489
 benefits as benefits to our hair 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.079
 so here is a method to transform 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.700
 his favorite conditioning andy 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.480
 conditioned very simply at home 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.610
 choose your dealer 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.230
 favorite but such in a bowl 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.870
 the quantity needed according to the length 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.340
 left can be added if a dose hui 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.510
 I chose if coconut oil and 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.980
 olive oil just because this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.870
 are the only two cities that have 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.090
 sufficiently film molecules to comb 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.010
 the hair fiber 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.239
 I added to my mixture a little bit of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.340
 hydrolytic proteins and you 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.690
 just because my hair was coming out 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.949
 of a long and boring reader and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.309
 therefore needed this input in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.309
 protein 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.909
 your conditioner and therefore practiced 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.010
 on hair that was created in the blue 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.170
 I wash it and allow it 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.830
 has no barrier between the hair and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.830
 the sport 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.640
 Paris 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.880
 ah ah 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.879
 once you finish applying that 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.610
 110 conditioners on his hair 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.790
 whole one can therefore apply a film 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.790
 plastic 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.210
 if you go under the warm helmet 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.190
 leave the next ten hours 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.510
 thirty minutes no more if 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.310
 you do not have heat sources 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.200
 outside allow to pose the mask a 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.760
 hour or a little bit more and then 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.740
 one is here and so enjoy your 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.300
 choice it is recommended therefore to achieve 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.310
 one of the conditioning at least one 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.170
 times a month to allow 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.440
 restore the fiber deeply 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.440
 capillary
