00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the course of working with these let me

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
the course of working with these let me
show<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:46.860> AT&amp;T<00:01:47.490> when<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> actually<00:01:47.820> dropped

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
show you my AT&amp;T when I actually dropped

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.880 
show you my AT&amp;T when I actually dropped
this<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.630> did<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.110> case<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
this one did not have a case on it and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.740 
this one did not have a case on it and
dropped<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> volume<00:01:51.509> rocker

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
dropped it right at the volume rocker

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.719 
dropped it right at the volume rocker
area<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.399> dented

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
area and you can see that it's dented

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.100 
area and you can see that it's dented
right<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> problem<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.049> one

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
right there with a problem with this one

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.959 
right there with a problem with this one
now<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> can't<00:01:55.799> turn<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> volume<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:56.850> down

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
now I can't turn the volume up or down

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.959 
now I can't turn the volume up or down
on<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:58.049> device<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:59.130> one<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.460> probably

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
on this device now this one is probably

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
on this device now this one is probably
one<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> older<00:02:00.570> ones<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> units
