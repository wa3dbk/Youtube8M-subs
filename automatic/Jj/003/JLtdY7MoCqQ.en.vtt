further<00:00:30.179> ado<00:00:30.449> let's<00:00:30.720> begin<00:00:30.810> ok<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.040> usual

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.430 

so<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.059> fuss<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> two<00:00:36.780> shots<00:00:37.050> landed<00:00:37.260> on

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so the fuss of two shots landed on

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.319 
so the fuss of two shots landed on
target<00:00:37.890> next<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.670> slightly<00:00:38.969> above<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
target next two are slightly above the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.990 
target next two are slightly above the
rest<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.260> lineup<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.010> obviously<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
rest of this lineup so obviously to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.840 
rest of this lineup so obviously to
control<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
control it

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.690 
control it
just<00:00:45.469> let<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> first<00:00:46.770> two<00:00:46.950> shots<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.460> solve

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
just let the first two shots to solve

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.520 
just let the first two shots to solve
fire<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.660> pull<00:00:49.079> down<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> little

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
fire and then just pull down a little

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
fire and then just pull down a little
bit<00:00:49.789> just<00:00:50.789> pulled<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.629> then

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
bit just pulled up a little bit and then

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.299 
bit just pulled up a little bit and then
don't<00:00:52.079> keep<00:00:52.320> pulling<00:00:52.620> down<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.579> fire<00:00:54.360> balloon

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
don't keep pulling down a fire balloon

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
don't keep pulling down a fire balloon
okay<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.370> question<00:00:56.699> fire<00:00:56.969> advantages<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
okay so question fire advantages and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.040 
okay so question fire advantages and
disadvantages<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.430> gun<00:00:59.670> has<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.180> ridiculously

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
disadvantages the gun has a ridiculously

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.100 
disadvantages the gun has a ridiculously
high<00:01:01.410> mine<00:01:01.680> size<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.300> is<00:01:03.300> an<00:01:03.660> insta-kill

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
high mine size which is an insta-kill

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
high mine size which is an insta-kill
against<00:01:08.869> great<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.280> compared<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> its<00:01:11.580> fire

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
against great and compared to its fire

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.280 
against great and compared to its fire
rate<00:01:12.299> damage<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.049> also<00:01:13.320> very<00:01:13.560> good<00:01:15.290> spray<00:01:18.290> scum

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
rate damage is also very good spray scum

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.780 
rate damage is also very good spray scum
doesn<00:01:19.470> t<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> lot<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.009> disadvantages<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
doesn t have a lot of disadvantages a

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.719 
doesn t have a lot of disadvantages a
really<00:01:21.330> good<00:01:21.509> ass<00:01:21.689> off<00:01:21.900> all-rounder<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.860> it's

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
really good ass off all-rounder but it's

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
really good ass off all-rounder but it's
inaccurate<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.509> longer<00:01:24.810> ranges<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.439> show

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
inaccurate at longer ranges if I show

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.060 
inaccurate at longer ranges if I show
you<00:01:25.650> yourself<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.259> can't<00:01:31.710> sort

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
you yourself here you know it can't sort

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.069 
you yourself here you know it can't sort
of<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.280> around<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.970> little<00:01:33.119> bit<00:01:33.329> which<00:01:33.479> can<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of go around a little bit which can so

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.280 
of go around a little bit which can so
suck<00:01:34.850> also<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.030> got<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.390> poor<00:01:36.780> effective

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
suck also it's got a poor effective

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.710 
suck also it's got a poor effective
range<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.310> sort<00:01:38.549> means<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.420> longer

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
range so that sort means that at longer

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.719 
range so that sort means that at longer
ranges<00:01:40.170> find<00:01:40.740> yourself<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.220> even<00:01:41.250> being<00:01:41.579> able

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
ranges find yourself not even being able

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.789 
ranges find yourself not even being able
to<00:01:41.909> kill<00:01:42.210> an<00:01:42.299> enemy<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:42.799> a<00:01:43.799> headshot

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.800 

okay<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.909> we're<00:01:48.000> gonna<00:01:48.090> be<00:01:48.270> moving<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.570> how

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
okay so now we're gonna be moving on how

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.770 
okay so now we're gonna be moving on how
to<00:01:48.869> use<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.189> five-seven<00:01:51.090> Wow

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to use the five-seven Wow

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.280 
to use the five-seven Wow
the<00:01:52.290> first<00:01:52.560> main<00:01:52.799> thing<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.340> greatest

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.080 

it<00:01:57.290> does<00:01:57.500> not<00:01:57.740> lose<00:01:57.980> a<00:01:58.250> lot<00:01:58.460> of<00:01:58.490> accuracy<00:01:58.910> at

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
it does not lose a lot of accuracy at

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.480 
it does not lose a lot of accuracy at
short<00:01:59.540> distances<00:02:00.050> which<00:02:00.560> is<00:02:00.860> really

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
short distances which is really

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.890 
short distances which is really
reassuring<00:02:01.910> especially<00:02:02.510> if<00:02:02.600> you're<00:02:02.720> on<00:02:02.750> a
