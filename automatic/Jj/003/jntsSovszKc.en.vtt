00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
I'm just the right amount of hungry to

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.810 
I'm just the right amount of hungry to
be<00:04:14.600> able<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.930> put<00:04:15.080> in<00:04:15.170> that<00:04:15.260> second<00:04:15.769> set<00:04:16.040> but<00:04:16.760> I

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
be able to put in that second set but I

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.190 
be able to put in that second set but I
should<00:04:17.000> also<00:04:17.060> point<00:04:17.330> out<00:04:17.510> that<00:04:17.630> that<00:04:17.780> pork

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
should also point out that that pork

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.530 
should also point out that that pork
inside<00:04:18.560> has<00:04:19.280> almost<00:04:19.519> disintegrate<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.269> just

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
inside has almost disintegrate and just

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.420 
inside has almost disintegrate and just
become<00:04:20.840> one<00:04:21.080> with<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.410> soup<00:04:21.650> although

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
become one with the soup although

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.400 
become one with the soup although
overall<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:23.360> may<00:04:23.750> want<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:23.960> give<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.260> edge<00:04:24.380> a

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
overall I may want to give the edge a

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.770 
overall I may want to give the edge a
little<00:04:24.740> bit<00:04:24.979> more<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.490> Hakata<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.180> Fukuoka's

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
little bit more to Hakata and Fukuoka's

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.200 
little bit more to Hakata and Fukuoka's
noodles<00:04:27.200> but<00:04:28.040> overall<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.640> flavor<00:04:28.910> of<00:04:29.030> the

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
noodles but overall the flavor of the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.190 
noodles but overall the flavor of the
soup<00:04:29.390> which<00:04:29.600> is<00:04:29.750> probably<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.050> most

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
soup which is probably the most

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.469 
soup which is probably the most
important<00:04:30.740> thing<00:04:30.770> here<00:04:31.130> there's<00:04:31.820> no<00:04:32.120> way<00:04:32.300> that

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
important thing here there's no way that

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.620 
important thing here there's no way that
Kagoshima<00:04:33.110> doesn't<00:04:33.500> come<00:04:33.650> out<00:04:33.740> on<00:04:33.800> top<00:04:34.630> and

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
Kagoshima doesn't come out on top and

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.060 
Kagoshima doesn't come out on top and
with<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.930> second<00:04:36.350> set<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.530> noodles<00:04:36.860> out<00:04:36.950> of

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
with the second set of noodles out of

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.310 
with the second set of noodles out of
the<00:04:37.130> way<00:04:37.780> it's<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.320> best<00:04:39.530> parts<00:04:41.320> just

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
the way it's on to the best parts just

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.659 
the way it's on to the best parts just
eating<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:42.979> Kagoshima<00:04:43.700> pork<00:04:44.390> and<00:04:45.669> overall

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
eating this Kagoshima pork and overall

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.880 
eating this Kagoshima pork and overall
it's<00:04:46.910> just<00:04:46.970> so<00:04:47.330> rich<00:04:47.600> that<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.290> almost<00:04:48.530> can't

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
it's just so rich that you almost can't

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.700 
it's just so rich that you almost can't
finish<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.340> soup<00:04:49.520> but<00:04:49.880> then<00:04:50.000> again<00:04:50.240> not<00:04:50.450> to<00:04:50.780> is

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
finish the soup but then again not to is

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.920 
finish the soup but then again not to is
such<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.220> shame

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.200 

and<00:04:55.650> even<00:04:55.979> Luffy<00:04:57.169> can't<00:04:58.169> go<00:04:58.410> back<00:04:58.650> for<00:04:58.949> thirds
