 business we talk about a school 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.270
 particular the school that is instilled 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.270
 principles values ​​to children when 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.490
 this actually looks at us in education 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 I have been working practically a little 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.080
 more than 20 years and seeing then the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.670
 needs the need to be able 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.439
 this provide a quality education 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.990
 seeing the area also that is pretty 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.119
 wide there is a great need for education 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.799
 and a quality education trying 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.590
 always inculcate the values ​​about 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.750
 everything that are being lost today 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.250
 I give a little you can not count they left 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.080
 a small local we have seen now that 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.490
 they have tremendous facade that have grown 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.440
 already for eight years they have 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.700
 working in juan de lurigancho together 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.170
 the methodology that you come 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.399
 providing for parents 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.229
 that are surely the program 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.790
 in their homes they know how solana works 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.540
 of the poplars 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.490
 we work with a mixed system 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.320
 combined not only the part 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.440
 academic that obviously has a value 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.260
 and very important but more than all the 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.330
 formative part the values of something that 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.670
 suddenly the father of family for the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.440
 different way that today is 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.270
 have to work that out I think that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.220
 dad and mom are not then the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.620
 schools we are in charge of providing 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 the values ​​of guiding students 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.490
 both in the three levels that are 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.440
 basically initial primary and 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.810
 secondary and that is the fundamental stage 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.910
 to be able to form this personality 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.290
 of human beings once again daily 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.240
 that we have also seen in the part 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.760
 inside the school there are games 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.459
 didactic for the children of initial there are 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.709
 also the computer classroom for 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.940
 children of elementary school is tucked 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.050
 everything that is internet I imagine that the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.490
 school everything that is internet and 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.800
 I imagine that the school can be with 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.790
 all the latest technology 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.520
 effectively nowadays every time 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.920
 It makes it necessary 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.540
 technology and I think it's a tool 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.340
 that all schools have to 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.570
 try to get involved with them 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.270
 we also have to prepare our 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.770
 staff so they can provide a 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.990
 better job do a better job with 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.640
 the previous students I would like to know 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.650
 how would we do to be able to coordinate 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.910
 with you and be able to resell visit a lot 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.530
 people who are watching the program and 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.570
 can you visit you really want to know 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.940

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.570

 here at the intersection of the avenues 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.220
 santa rosa and republic of poland in the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.640
 poplar organization I think he is 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.960
 very easy to get here we are at 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.790
 the height of the banderole stop in the 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.020
 vice avenue and good waiting for them 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.300
 all people who can approach 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.550
 can attend them with pleasure and 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.400
 try after they integrate to the 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.620
 Solanense family would give a message to 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.730
 many enterprising people like you 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.950
 people who live in san juan de lurigancho 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.570
 remove that goes ahead so that it 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.580
 Dedicate to do what you want now 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.070
 because a lot of people put their business like this 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.750
 be a school or a restaurant but 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.850
 directed to your business we talk about the 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.540
 educational system what that message to 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.799
 Many people 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.209
 who only put a small 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.760
 business now a small small school 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.439
 garden tell us effectively tell them 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.450
 that everything is possible that there is no 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.150
 nothing in the impossible life that everything 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.129
 we can realize the dreams the more 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.049
 high are our goals of each 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.780
 person, so it is, we can 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.669
 do then tell them not to 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.340
 be afraid that one has to 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.460
 do it that what you know what you know and 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.930
 treat in this case then of education of 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.759
 work thinking about the benefit of the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.160
 young people thinking about the start of our 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.870
 country I think that this work is not is not 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.120
 as suddenly another type of business if 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.830
 it is not a social task in which 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.080
 we have to deal with both everyday 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.490
 young people with children and especially 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.919
 with parents also try 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.169
 to educate our parents and 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.500
 that san juan de lurigancho be a pole 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.840
 of development a district that every time 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.849
 have looked with another with others 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.770
 eyes unfortunately our district what 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.330
 they see as something negative for the 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.820
 different negative things that happen 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.320
 here but I think that also as there 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.419
 negative things there are many things 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.040
 positive there are many entrepreneurs a lot 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.560
 enterprising people like 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.810
 you say it in your program that comes out 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.980
 go ahead and that is the message for all 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.480
 our children for all of our 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.250
 young people that they have to try to 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.050
 get ahead that you do not have to wait for 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.190
 suddenly someone will hire us but 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.950
 we have the tools ourselves 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.110
 to be able to get ahead in life and 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.540
 succeed both in the educational part 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.770
 with the economic part also and also 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.510
 we have seen that the school has grown 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.490
 now they have their use now let's see the 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.230
 bus route will not be accompanied by 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.420
 clear assumption that it is indeed a 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.420
 more service that we provide to our 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.530
 students always thinking about taking out 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.390
 forward to our children our 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.130
 young people of the district and that they are therefore 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.170
 good people in the future to the 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.970
 people that can govern us more 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.380
 forward apart a security also 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.670
 bring it and take it home from the 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.090
 most important parents want a 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.090
 security 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.229
 do not 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.020
 this is the mobility that we have 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.969
 here at the sorana college of the poplars 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.389
 and is for exclusive use for our 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.389
 children and young people 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:07.460
 we use visits for our visits 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.890
 of study to be able to participate in 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.560
 some events that there are regarding the 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.030
 part of dance that is one of the one of 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.580
 our flags here in our 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.470
 educational center we always 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.390
 we take the folk part not 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.690
 reassessing a little in our wealth 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.070
 that we have the rich cultural legacy 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.990
 that we have as Peruvians 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.450
 then they are important things in which 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.300
 We also make our students 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:36.629
 involve and have a training 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:41.159
 general, a formation rich in values ​​in 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:42.330
 culture a person who at his age makes 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:44.460
 the things he does here in our 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.470
 school is going to be a happy adult 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.030
 we try to instill 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.940
 that what our students know 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.669
 oratory can recite can make 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.379
 Suddenly out there the dance can meet 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.120
 music then are things that go to 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:59.520
 adorn the human being and I thank you 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.050

 computing the videogame classrooms and 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.550
 native are the children surely there 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.050
