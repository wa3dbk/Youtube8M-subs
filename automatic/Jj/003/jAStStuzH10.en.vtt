00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.299
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.070
 a new video from microsoft inside and in 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:09.820
 this time we are going to do what is the 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.369
 unboxing of nokia lumia 735 that we 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.799
 came the other day the only thing that just 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.990
 I had to go on a trip so let's see 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.240
 what it is in the box as unboxing and 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.630
 you know how it is for press is a bit 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.400
 more brief but good so you do a 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.199
 idea of ​​the dimensions you can see it 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.789
 little bit in general and later on 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.749
 we will bring what is the complete review 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.700
 of the 735 the review of the 830 is dotted 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:37.620
 to leave so stay tuned to 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.620
 channel because many new things await you 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.520
 here we have the nokia lumia the 735 as 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 we see the design the box is similar to 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.130
 from other of the last windows with 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.630
 we have been analyzing how they can be 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.360
 730 thousand eight hundred thirty or the 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.210
 nine hundred and thirty the box is one 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.720
 finer and good design details like the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.630
 that the 735 appears there are marked and others 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.120
 that make it quite interesting for 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 part of microsoft let's see 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.530
 there we have here ends 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.710
 apart in the box comes the charger 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.290
 and nothing else as I have already told you this 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.030
 it's a press kit let's say then 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.130
 because headphones do not come for reasons 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.710
 obvious 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.710
 that's why it comes a little more justito 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.710
 here we have the terminal and now what 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.630
 let's do is turn it on and when 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.740
 have turned on then we go back 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.789
 well here we can see the nokia lumia 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:02.159
 735 that has some mentions of 134 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:07.179
 with 7 millimeters high by 60 and 85 of 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.729
 width and only 89 millimeters thick 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.510
 which makes a design that is very very 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.030
 attractive the terminal has 4 with 7 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.430
 inches screen with hd resolution 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.769
 that is 720 points which is 1280 x 720 the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 processor as you know is a quad 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.780
 core of qualcomm or a which with 400 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.760
 and has a 2 thousand 220 battery 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.080
 milliamps in this case apart the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.470
 advantage of this terminal versus others 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.450
 is the front camera there present of 5 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.420
 megapixels special to do those the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.930
 crystal mode and the rear camera that 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.660
 has card 6 technology also from 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.900
 6 with 7 megapixels in this case is 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.680
 exactly the same resolution as 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.150
 has the lumia 720 although we assume that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.130
 it will have improved anyway we will 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.739
 a series of tests so that we can 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.030
 check if you really have that 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.819
 extra capacity or not 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.900
 the video has been increased its resolution 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:18.790
 in front of the 720 and now supports video in 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:22.510
 full hd besides it has the led flash and 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.480
 is a terminal with 4g technology by 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.400
 On the other hand, what you see here, so 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.350
 or how is this orange I do not know if it 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.870
 prefer it well in the video but it's very 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:37.209
 songs or includes what the load is for 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.519
 industry the load that with standard cui 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.000
 and it offers us some features 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.590
 optimal for that functionality and apart 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.300
 if we want to change color the 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.130
 possibility to change the housing 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.420
 that changes everything to us as we are going to see 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.480
 now 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.580
 otherwise you will already be seeing if I am 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.830
 capable of the specifications next 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.239
 of the terminal so you do not get lost 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.239
 no detail about it 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.040
 here you can see the screen at its maximum 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.930
 apogee 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.340
 as you see offers a few levels of 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.140
 very good luminosity that in a 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.760
 principle seem dull but it works 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.729
 very well I still have not had the chance 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.500
 to prove it I will have days to spare 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.780
 to be able to try it even in some 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.240
 Cillo trip out there that is own is not 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.100
 that have helped me or anything and good 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.800
 here you see that in general it always goes 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.259
 to say until we think there to 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.509
 tell us that the navigation menus 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.490
 they are always available always and 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.100
 when we slide from here down like 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.590
 you can see it is very simple 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.340
 so that we can hide the o 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.560
 show them with the same gesture 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.050
 so that we always have the maximum 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.120
 of screen that we want available 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.310
 as you can see it comes with the 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.599
 Folders ie it comes with lumia denim 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.599
 how are we going to see next 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.420
 and on the other hand what he does 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.550
 lack is the 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.670
 the button on the camera that should go there 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.730
 for me he is the oldest but that would take him 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.580
 this terminal I love the format of 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.120
 Full shell plus it gets a lot 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.570
 easier than the 830 to see if I am 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.000
 able if it gets out much easier than the 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.900
 of 830 and it allows us to have a terminal 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.440
 new completely just by taking away the 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.160
 housing as you see covers us all 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.860
 lateral 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.380
 and we would leave only the screen pending 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.870
 if we put a protector on it, we'll have 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.080
 a new terminal here you can see the 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.850
 side what is the casing as you have 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.380
 seen with and as a segment with the 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.240
 quick technology so that we can 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.380
 charge wirelessly without 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.380
 need for no cable 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.560
 and well let's go leaving what is 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.540
 this unboxing around here is simply 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.940
 to show you the capabilities 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.680
 the terminal and later and you 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.750
 we will show what is in detail the 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.240
 operation of it with all 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.640
 features that it offers us already 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.440
 I say that you are going to like a lot and 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.630
 although it does not have the camera button itself 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.310
 which is very comfortable to slide and get 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.310
 the camera with a quick link 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.640
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.320
 see you in the next video of 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.320
