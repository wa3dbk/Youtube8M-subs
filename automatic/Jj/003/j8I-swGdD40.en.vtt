something<00:02:03.500> SuperDuper<00:02:04.500> hot<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.340> might<00:02:05.490> want

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
something SuperDuper hot you might want

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
something SuperDuper hot you might want
to<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.180> parents<00:02:06.420> permission<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:07.229> have<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to get your parents permission or have a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.740 
to get your parents permission or have a
parent<00:02:08.039> do<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.489> for<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.229> safety

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.120 

then<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.930> should<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.170> six<00:02:16.470> pieces<00:02:16.710> that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
then you should have six pieces that

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.910 
then you should have six pieces that
look<00:02:17.220> like<00:02:17.280> this<00:02:17.460> now<00:02:18.390> come<00:02:18.780> softly<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.650> I'm

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
look like this now come softly so I'm

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.950 
look like this now come softly so I'm
actually<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.580> going<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.940> be<00:02:21.060> gluing<00:02:21.330> on<00:02:21.660> top

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
actually just going to be gluing on top

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
actually just going to be gluing on top
of<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:23.090> piece<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.420> paper<00:02:25.200> actually<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:25.950> a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
of this piece of paper actually it's a

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.670 
of this piece of paper actually it's a
sketchbook<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:27.210> because<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.990> don't<00:02:28.320> want<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
sketchbook just because I don't want to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.890 
sketchbook just because I don't want to
mess<00:02:28.920> up<00:02:29.100> our<00:02:29.250> table<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:30.450> you're<00:02:30.660> going<00:02:30.840> to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
mess up our table so you're going to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.420 
mess up our table so you're going to
want<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.290> glue<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.010> formation

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
want to glue it in this formation

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.190 
want to glue it in this formation
because<00:02:32.970> white<00:02:33.240> is<00:02:33.270> going<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.630> be<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> center

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
because white is going to be the center

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.130 
because white is going to be the center
and<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> real<00:02:35.580> Rubik's<00:02:35.940> Cube<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.990> how

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and on a real Rubik's Cube this is how

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.490 
and on a real Rubik's Cube this is how
the<00:02:37.200> sides<00:02:37.590> would<00:02:38.160> line<00:02:38.400> up<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.630> know<00:02:40.290> this

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
the sides would line up so I know this

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.580 
the sides would line up so I know this
is<00:02:40.560> probably<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.550> confusing<00:02:42.240> but<00:02:42.600> you're

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
is probably really confusing but you're

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.350 
is probably really confusing but you're
gonna<00:02:43.710> end<00:02:43.800> up<00:02:43.980> gluing<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:44.610> green<00:02:44.850> one<00:02:45.030> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
gonna end up gluing this green one to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.130 
gonna end up gluing this green one to
those<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.770> one<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:48.140> I'll

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
those to that one in that one and I'll

00:02:49.140 --> 00:03:21.480 
those to that one in that one and I'll
just<00:02:49.440> show<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.040> guys<00:02:50.250> how<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.000> works

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.510 

and<00:03:21.580> you're<00:03:22.360> done
