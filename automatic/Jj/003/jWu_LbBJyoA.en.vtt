00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hi everyone, I'm a max chef and today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.570
 we are here with a special guest from david 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.750
 hello to tt and make a recipe based recipe 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.020
 therefore the mayonnaise is very simple 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.439
 we need a nice whip this recipe 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 a small bowl two eggs we will use 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.330
 absolutely the yolks and we use the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.340
 large eggs pour seed oil and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 of the hundred but that's enough 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.100
 really a few tablespoons then here 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.649
 here the first thing we do we go to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.649
 split the yolk from the album e 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:05.460
 now let's put a pinch of salt and a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:09.540
 nice spoon of vinegar as well 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.570
 abundant because so much vinegar has arrived 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.310
 then emulsify the sauce you that 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.900
 let's start with the whip 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.500
 let's go slightly to frustrate then 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.170
 let a relative help you to pay 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.510
 the oil slowly inside the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.510
 bowl whisk vigorously 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.720
 here you see that it starts plainly 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.150
 to thicken because evolution 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:50.260
 just this about the man the body 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.680
 all the oil is fine and this does it 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.240
 only when we have beautiful ones of a 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.040
 water base in this case we have 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.400
 put the emphasis that you will also help to 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:06.720
 give public acidity just look 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.720
 some nice help this year 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.920
 here then when it subscribes from the first 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:25.270
 part you can also found a little bit 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:26.920
 more with the oil novikov part it is 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.230
 started the is beautiful in the procura plan 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.890
 clear then we will add a little bit of 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.890
 water and will return to being beautiful mobile 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.080
 it's not important if you pull away 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.330
 or on the other you can pull as you wish 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.190
 the important thing is that you keep turning 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.890
 ok this point since it has become 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:56.850
 of the dense we can put a 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:00.850
 collective of water the play of water 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.340
 of sea that softens and then 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.440
 we still continue to put more oil 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:12.030
 you see that you also change the color is 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.030
 how water is really fundamental 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.890
 here's one thing to tell david is 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.290
 true that a yolk could emulsify 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.260
 very well around twenty 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.090
 of pounds of oil right then but us 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.490
 we put 2 just to give a 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.600
 little more flavor to our 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:39.200
 mayonnaise otherwise only oil fed up 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.170
 may true is that once you have 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.270
 added the desired quantity we pass 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.320
 a little bit to fix this mayonnaise 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:51.830
 you also tasted the first thing 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.650
 you will feel it is a little bit the only true one for 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:59.450
 correct this point so let's say 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:04.670
 still dark with vinegar and we're done 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.830
 also and become soft then too 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.510
 there depends what you have to do there 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.580
 put it in a ball that's fine 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.680
 even more consistent if instead 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.630
 then put vitel tonnÃ© for example must 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.510
 be softer elected made the 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.310
 our mayonnaise is ready 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.400
