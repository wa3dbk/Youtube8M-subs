a<00:02:06.270> real<00:02:06.600> long<00:02:06.899> time<00:02:07.140> well<00:02:07.680> operate<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> long

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
a real long time well operate a long

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.960 
a real long time well operate a long
time<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> fix<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.790> add

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
time just to fix it all you can add

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
time just to fix it all you can add
enchants<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:12.900> after

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
enchants but after

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.490 
enchants but after
it's<00:02:14.159> gonna<00:02:14.400> renew<00:02:15.299> itself<00:02:15.659> and<00:02:15.989> lose<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
it's gonna renew itself and lose the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.410 
it's gonna renew itself and lose the
enchantment<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.159> if<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.849> want<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.090> do<00:02:18.209> that<00:02:18.390> go

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
enchantment so if you want to do that go

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.119 
enchantment so if you want to do that go
ahead<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:20.329> this<00:02:21.329> is<00:02:21.629> basically<00:02:22.109> the<00:02:22.650> best<00:02:22.799> way

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
ahead so this is basically the best way

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.000 
ahead so this is basically the best way
to<00:02:23.189> have<00:02:23.609> a<00:02:23.900> really<00:02:24.900> good<00:02:25.049> pic<00:02:25.260> acts<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.680> like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
to have a really good pic acts just like

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.729 
to have a really good pic acts just like
a<00:02:26.129> diamond<00:02:26.370> pickaxe<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.030> by<00:02:27.989> using<00:02:28.200> relics

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
a diamond pickaxe and by using relics

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.780 
a diamond pickaxe and by using relics
crap<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:30.480> renew<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.079> so<00:02:31.409> that's<00:02:32.310> one<00:02:32.579> way<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
crap just renew it so that's one way to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.660 
crap just renew it so that's one way to
save<00:02:33.150> up<00:02:33.329> diamonds<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.010> another<00:02:35.010> thing<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.639> I

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
save up diamonds so another thing that I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.059 
save up diamonds so another thing that I
wanted<00:02:35.939> to<00:02:36.000> sell<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.810> how<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.650> find

wanted to sell you that how to find

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.250 
wanted to sell you that how to find
these<00:02:38.370> beautiful<00:02:38.969> fossils<00:02:39.450> blocks<00:02:39.719> they're

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
these beautiful fossils blocks they're

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.800 
these beautiful fossils blocks they're
randomly<00:02:40.799> generated<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.519> over<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.969> map<00:02:42.209> all

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
randomly generated all over the map all

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.809 
randomly generated all over the map all
over<00:02:43.079> them<00:02:43.319> all<00:02:43.709> over<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:44.159> world<00:02:44.459> and

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
over them all over the world and

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.509 
over them all over the world and
sometimes<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:46.260> really<00:02:46.650> hard<00:02:46.799> to<00:02:47.129> see<00:02:47.340> them

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
sometimes it's really hard to see them

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.080 
sometimes it's really hard to see them
so<00:02:47.849> just<00:02:48.109> keep<00:02:49.109> a<00:02:49.290> good<00:02:49.560> lookout<00:02:49.799> off<00:02:50.790> them

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
so just keep a good lookout off them

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.569 
so just keep a good lookout off them
because<00:02:51.389> i<00:02:51.569> made<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.169> like<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.739> little<00:02:53.400> tunnel

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
because i made this like a little tunnel

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.110 
because i made this like a little tunnel
and<00:02:53.930> as<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.109> can<00:02:55.260> see<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.799> like<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:56.760> really

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and as you can see here like it's really

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.089 
and as you can see here like it's really
hard<00:02:57.419> to<00:02:57.540> spot<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.200> like<00:02:58.379> this<00:02:58.799> block

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
hard to spot it it's like this block

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.390 
hard to spot it it's like this block
right<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.489> it's<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.599> fossils<00:03:01.079> block<00:03:01.400> so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
right here it's the fossils block so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.270 
right here it's the fossils block so
let's<00:03:03.060> put<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.269> torch<00:03:03.569> here<00:03:03.900> where's<00:03:04.889> it<00:03:05.069> switch

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
let's put a torch here where's it switch

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.270 
let's put a torch here where's it switch
there<00:03:05.519> we<00:03:05.639> go<00:03:06.379> as<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:07.530> can<00:03:07.620> see<00:03:07.769> here<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.129> is

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
there we go as you can see here this is

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.159 
there we go as you can see here this is
the<00:03:08.310> fossil<00:03:08.819> ugh<00:03:08.969> it's<00:03:09.180> pretty<00:03:09.480> hard<00:03:09.719> to<00:03:09.810> see

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
the fossil ugh it's pretty hard to see

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.789 
the fossil ugh it's pretty hard to see
but<00:03:10.609> plus<00:03:11.609> uh<00:03:11.909> this<00:03:12.629> is<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> original<00:03:12.989> faucet

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
but plus uh this is the original faucet

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.629 
but plus uh this is the original faucet
block<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.189> didn't<00:03:14.459> like<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.000> place<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.659> there<00:03:15.810> so

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
block I didn't like I place it there so

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.699 
block I didn't like I place it there so
they're<00:03:17.639> all<00:03:17.940> over<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.389> map<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.900> just

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
they're all over the map if you just

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.979 
they're all over the map if you just
travel<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.310> little<00:03:20.400> bit<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.909> think<00:03:21.269> we<00:03:21.479> can<00:03:21.659> find

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989

travel a little bit I think we can find
one<00:03:22.229> more<00:03:22.290> like<00:03:22.970> gold<00:03:23.970> that's<00:03:24.329> pretty<00:03:24.569> cool<00:03:24.870> oh

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
know it doesn't matter of the level

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.200 
know it doesn't matter of the level
there<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:46.900> go<00:04:47.160> first<00:04:48.160> there's<00:04:48.370> more<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:49.030> them

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
there you go first there's more of them

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.410 
there you go first there's more of them
in<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:50.020> case<00:04:50.230> but<00:04:51.000> that's<00:04:52.000> probably<00:04:52.270> because

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
in the case but that's probably because

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.930 
in the case but that's probably because
there's<00:04:52.870> like<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.110> lot<00:04:53.350> of<00:04:53.380> holes<00:04:53.790> so<00:04:54.790> yeah<00:04:54.910> I

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
there's like a lot of holes so yeah I

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.610 
there's like a lot of holes so yeah I
think<00:04:55.000> that's<00:04:55.360> watching<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:55.810> was<00:04:55.960> a<00:04:56.110> plus<00:04:56.380> if

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620

think that's watching this was a plus if
