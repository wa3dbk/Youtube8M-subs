and<00:00:05.970> how<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.150> have<00:00:06.390> an<00:00:06.540> object<00:00:06.990> follow<00:00:07.259> that

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
and how to have an object follow that

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.370 
and how to have an object follow that
motion<00:00:07.859> path<00:00:08.480> i'm<00:00:09.480> going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.780> show<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.929> two

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
motion path i'm going to show you two

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.490 
motion path i'm going to show you two
little<00:00:10.620> things<00:00:11.000> first<00:00:12.000> how<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.420> make<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
little things first how to make the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.049 
little things first how to make the
object<00:00:13.830> follow<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.130> motion<00:00:14.460> path<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.880> then<00:00:14.969> how

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
object follow a motion path and then how

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.180 
object follow a motion path and then how
to<00:00:15.089> specify<00:00:15.450> which<00:00:16.350> way<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.590> object<00:00:17.100> is

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
to specify which way that object is

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.070 
to specify which way that object is
facing<00:00:17.699> while<00:00:17.910> following<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.480> motion<00:00:18.900> path

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
facing while following the motion path

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.929 
facing while following the motion path
it's<00:00:19.980> going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> help<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> lot<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it's going to help you a lot when it

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.390 
it's going to help you a lot when it
comes<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.330> animation<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.320> first<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.250> we're

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
comes to animation so first what we're

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.710 
comes to animation so first what we're
going<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.150> we're<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.660> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
going to do here is we're going to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.480 
going to do here is we're going to
create<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.640> curve<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:27.359> our<00:00:27.570> object<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> follow

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
create a curve for our object to follow

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.490 
create a curve for our object to follow
so<00:00:29.490> let's<00:00:29.670> go<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.990> create<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:31.410> you're

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
so let's go to create and then you're

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.709 
so let's go to create and then you're
going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> EP<00:00:32.700> curve<00:00:33.000> tool<00:00:33.239> that's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
going to go to the EP curve tool that's

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.750 
going to go to the EP curve tool that's
what<00:00:33.899> i<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.140> use<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:35.550> kind<00:00:35.730> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
what i like to use and it kind of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
what i like to use and it kind of
estimates<00:00:36.300> between<00:00:36.540> your<00:00:36.809> clicks<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
estimates between your clicks what the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.040 
estimates between your clicks what the
curve<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> look<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> can

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
curve is going to look like so you can

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.619 
curve is going to look like so you can
get<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> really<00:00:40.410> smooth<00:00:40.860> curve<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
get a really smooth curve and that

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.080 
get a really smooth curve and that
should<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.489> go<00:00:44.489> ahead<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.789> move<00:00:44.910> this

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
should do it go ahead and move this

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.779 
should do it go ahead and move this
curve<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:45.930> towards<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> middle

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
curve a little more towards the middle

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.880 
curve a little more towards the middle
alright<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:49.260> we're<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> create<00:00:49.770> an

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
alright so now we're going to create an

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.360 
alright so now we're going to create an
object<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.940> let's<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.920> sphere<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> we'll

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
object so let's do a sphere and we'll

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.970 
object so let's do a sphere and we'll
just<00:00:53.520> put<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.820> at<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.079> beginning<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.800> our

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
just put it at the beginning of our

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.029 
just put it at the beginning of our
curve<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.980> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
curve here and the way you do this is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.979 
curve here and the way you do this is
you<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.309> select<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.850> object<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.840> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you just select your object then you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.520 
you just select your object then you
select<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.879> curve<00:01:02.879> also<00:01:03.180> by<00:01:04.049> shift-clicking

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
select your curve also by shift-clicking

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
select your curve also by shift-clicking
that<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> go<00:01:06.570> make<00:01:07.229> sure

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
that and then you going to go make sure

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.320 
that and then you going to go make sure
your<00:01:07.439> animation<00:01:08.189> tab<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.549> selected<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.939> say

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
your animation tab is selected here say

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.260 
your animation tab is selected here say
animate<00:01:09.810> motion<00:01:10.530> paths<00:01:10.770> attached<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.970> motion

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
animate motion paths attached to motion

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.560 
animate motion paths attached to motion
paths<00:01:12.450> dialog<00:01:13.020> box<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:14.189> start<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.640> end<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
paths dialog box do start to end and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600 
paths dialog box do start to end and
we're<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> put<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> end<00:01:16.320> time<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.799> let's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
we're going to put the end time it let's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.870 
we're going to put the end time it let's
try<00:01:17.790> 300<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:20.150> have<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> follow<00:01:22.729> just<00:01:23.729> say

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
try 300 and have it follow just say

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.520 
try 300 and have it follow just say
follow<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:26.180> that<00:01:27.180> looks<00:01:27.360> good<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.439> say

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
follow and that looks good so just say

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770 
follow and that looks good so just say
apply<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.270> we're<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> put<00:01:30.509> this

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
apply and then we're going to put this

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
apply and then we're going to put this
at<00:01:30.990> 300<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.740> make<00:01:32.040> sure<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.369> time<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.880> there

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
at 300 to make sure your time is there

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.609 
at 300 to make sure your time is there
so<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> whole<00:01:33.840> animation<00:01:34.229> play

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
so you can see the whole animation play

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.520 
so you can see the whole animation play
through<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:36.000> hit<00:01:36.180> play<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.409> can

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
through and then hit play and as you can

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.640 
through and then hit play and as you can
see<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.950> object<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.490> moving<00:01:38.700> through<00:01:39.650> it's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
see the object is moving through it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.830 
see the object is moving through it's
moving<00:01:40.950> through<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.130> path<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.659> that's<00:01:42.659> great

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
moving through the path and that's great

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230 
moving through the path and that's great
and<00:01:43.170> everything<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:44.250> don't<00:01:44.939> know<00:01:45.000> anybody

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
and everything but I don't know anybody

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.609 
and everything but I don't know anybody
who's<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> animate<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.259> sphere

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
who's just going to animate a sphere

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.990 
who's just going to animate a sphere
going<00:01:46.860> along<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> path<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:47.790> we're<00:01:47.909> going

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
going along a path so what we're going

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.350 
going along a path so what we're going
to<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.479> actually<00:01:48.689> create<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.350> new<00:01:50.360> system

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to do is actually create a new system

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.030 
to do is actually create a new system
here<00:01:51.920> I'm<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.220> use<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> complex<00:01:55.040> object

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
here I'm going to use a complex object

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.030 
here I'm going to use a complex object
this<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.180> republic<00:01:58.170> fighter<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> little

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
this is a republic fighter it's a little

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.249 
this is a republic fighter it's a little
spaceship<00:01:59.430> by<00:01:59.610> designed<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.930> movie

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
spaceship by designed for a little movie

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.030 
spaceship by designed for a little movie
i'm<00:02:01.350> doing<00:02:01.880> i'm<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.119> use<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.829> for<00:02:04.829> our

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
i'm doing i'm going to use this for our

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
i'm doing i'm going to use this for our
path<00:02:05.340> um<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.390> let<00:02:06.630> me<00:02:06.659> get<00:02:07.200> this<00:02:08.000> shrunken<00:02:09.000> down

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
path um so let me get this shrunken down

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.380 
path um so let me get this shrunken down
a<00:02:09.239> little<00:02:09.450> bit

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
a little bit

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.760 
a little bit
and<00:02:11.040> I'll<00:02:12.040> move<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.370> off<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.670> side<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.000> now

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and I'll move it off to the side for now

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.730 
and I'll move it off to the side for now
and<00:02:15.810> let's<00:02:16.810> draw<00:02:17.620> our<00:02:18.480> curve<00:02:19.480> here<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.080> we'll

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
and let's draw our curve here so we'll

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.199 
and let's draw our curve here so we'll
have<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.040> start<00:02:21.370> here<00:02:22.140> kind<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.230> spin<00:02:23.560> around

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
have it start here kind of spin around

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.210 
have it start here kind of spin around
you<00:02:25.209> know<00:02:25.300> just<00:02:25.569> do<00:02:25.690> what<00:02:25.840> ships<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.350> just<00:02:26.650> kind

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
you know just do what ships do just kind

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.470 
you know just do what ships do just kind
of<00:02:27.280> fly<00:02:27.520> around<00:02:28.470> all<00:02:29.470> right<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.270> same

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
of fly around all right and do the same

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.240 
of fly around all right and do the same
thing<00:02:31.660> we<00:02:31.780> did<00:02:31.900> before<00:02:31.959> select<00:02:32.680> our<00:02:32.800> object

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
thing we did before select our object

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.860 
thing we did before select our object
shift<00:02:34.110> select<00:02:35.110> our<00:02:35.380> path<00:02:36.040> animate<00:02:36.870> motion

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
shift select our path animate motion

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.340 
shift select our path animate motion
path<00:02:38.080> attached<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.040> motion<00:02:39.310> path<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:40.319> what<00:02:41.319> I

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
path attached to motion path and what I

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.300 
path attached to motion path and what I
like<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.860> do<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.600> say<00:02:43.600> front<00:02:43.930> axis<00:02:44.410> X<00:02:44.650> this

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
like to do is say front axis X this

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.740 
like to do is say front axis X this
usually<00:02:45.520> works<00:02:45.730> depends<00:02:46.510> on<00:02:46.600> how<00:02:46.720> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
usually works depends on how you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.830 
usually works depends on how you
constructed<00:02:47.410> your<00:02:47.680> object<00:02:48.360> which<00:02:49.360> was<00:02:49.390> your<00:02:49.690> X

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
constructed your object which was your X

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.380 
constructed your object which was your X
and<00:02:50.140> y-axis<00:02:50.260> it<00:02:51.040> really<00:02:51.489> depends<00:02:51.820> on<00:02:52.000> how<00:02:52.180> its

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
and y-axis it really depends on how its

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.910 
and y-axis it really depends on how its
constructed<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.230> can<00:02:53.410> play<00:02:53.560> around<00:02:53.680> at

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
constructed so you can play around at

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.479 
constructed so you can play around at
these<00:02:54.040> later<00:02:54.340> if<00:02:54.580> it's<00:02:55.120> not<00:02:55.300> working<00:02:55.480> out<00:02:55.810> yet

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
these later if it's not working out yet

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.699 
these later if it's not working out yet
we'll<00:02:57.489> get<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:57.790> bridge<00:02:58.300> when<00:02:58.480> we<00:02:58.709> will

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
we'll get to that bridge when we will

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.850 
we'll get to that bridge when we will
cross<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.070> when<00:03:00.160> we<00:03:00.220> come<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:00.570> so<00:03:01.570> X<00:03:01.959> for<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
cross it when we come to it so X for the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.170 
cross it when we come to it so X for the
front<00:03:03.070> axis<00:03:03.459> Y<00:03:03.790> for<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.239> up<00:03:04.360> axis<00:03:04.840> follow<00:03:06.180> bank

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
front axis Y for the up axis follow bank

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.690 
front axis Y for the up axis follow bank
is<00:03:07.420> important<00:03:08.080> so<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.100> when<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.489> hit<00:03:09.640> a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
is important so that when you hit a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.479 
is important so that when you hit a
curve<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:11.350> ship<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.739> going<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:11.950> kind<00:03:12.130> of<00:03:12.220> tilt

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
curve the ship is going to kind of tilt

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.610 
curve the ship is going to kind of tilt
just<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.420> would<00:03:13.510> see<00:03:13.780> if<00:03:13.930> something<00:03:14.500> was

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
just like you would see if something was

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.740 
just like you would see if something was
actually<00:03:14.769> flying<00:03:15.190> down<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> path<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.970> we'll<00:03:16.600> do

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
actually flying down a path and we'll do

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.580 
actually flying down a path and we'll do
a<00:03:16.780> bank<00:03:17.079> scale<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.590> let's<00:03:18.160> do<00:03:18.400> two<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.590> we'll

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
a bank scale of let's do two and we'll

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.670 
a bank scale of let's do two and we'll
keep<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.519> bank<00:03:21.700> limit<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.120> 90<00:03:22.680> that

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
keep this the bank limit in 90 that

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.449 
keep this the bank limit in 90 that
works<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.579> we'll<00:03:24.820> hit<00:03:24.970> apply<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:26.459> that's

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
works so we'll hit apply and that's

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.810 
works so we'll hit apply and that's
great<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:28.180> looks<00:03:28.510> like<00:03:28.570> our<00:03:28.720> object<00:03:29.170> is

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
great it looks like our object is

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.100 
great it looks like our object is
following<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.940> path<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.390> everything<00:03:31.780> but

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
following the path and everything but

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.020 
following the path and everything but
it's<00:03:32.790> something's<00:03:33.790> wrong<00:03:33.880> look<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:36.820> going

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
it's something's wrong look it's going

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.080 
it's something's wrong look it's going
backwards<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:38.320> not<00:03:38.470> good<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.730> there's<00:03:40.030> a

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
backwards it's not good so there's a

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.890 
backwards it's not good so there's a
little<00:03:40.180> fix<00:03:40.480> for<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:41.850> it's<00:03:42.850> banking<00:03:43.360> you

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
little fix for this it's banking you

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.759 
little fix for this it's banking you
know<00:03:44.019> that's<00:03:44.260> great<00:03:44.500> we<00:03:45.040> want<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.400> do<00:03:45.579> that

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
know that's great we want it to do that

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.870 
know that's great we want it to do that
but<00:03:47.769> it<00:03:47.860> shouldn't<00:03:48.070> be<00:03:48.100> going<00:03:48.220> backwards<00:03:48.489> so

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
but it shouldn't be going backwards so

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.979 
but it shouldn't be going backwards so
what<00:03:49.030> we're<00:03:49.150> going<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.329> do<00:03:49.450> is<00:03:49.600> go<00:03:49.750> over<00:03:49.780> here

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
what we're going to do is go over here

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.680 
what we're going to do is go over here
and<00:03:50.049> select<00:03:50.530> motion<00:03:51.010> path<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.519> you're<00:03:52.420> going

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
and select motion path and you're going

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.259 
and select motion path and you're going
to<00:03:52.810> go<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.010> inverse<00:03:54.010> front<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.610> it's<00:03:55.120> going<00:03:55.209> to

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
to go to inverse front and it's going to

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.259 
to go to inverse front and it's going to
flip<00:03:55.600> your<00:03:55.630> object<00:03:56.110> for<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.730> now<00:03:57.730> let's<00:03:58.060> say

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
flip your object for you now let's say

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.380 
flip your object for you now let's say
that<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.540> built<00:03:58.780> something<00:03:59.200> and<00:04:00.360> when<00:04:01.360> you

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
that you built something and when you

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.819 
that you built something and when you
put<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:01.780> on<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.989> path<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.380> kind<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:02.590> looks<00:04:02.769> like

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
put it on the path it kind of looks like

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.449 
put it on the path it kind of looks like
this<00:04:03.160> it's<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.760> flying<00:04:04.239> along<00:04:04.660> your<00:04:04.840> path

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
this it's like flying along your path

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.910 
this it's like flying along your path
like<00:04:06.480> sideways<00:04:07.480> or<00:04:07.720> something<00:04:08.019> usually<00:04:08.799> the

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
like sideways or something usually the

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.819 
like sideways or something usually the
best<00:04:09.070> thing<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.340> do<00:04:09.579> is<00:04:09.790> have<00:04:10.090> front<00:04:10.420> axis<00:04:10.840> X<00:04:11.079> of

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
best thing to do is have front axis X of

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.340 
best thing to do is have front axis X of
X<00:04:12.130> is<00:04:12.340> y<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.790> if<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.660> doesn't<00:04:13.930> work<00:04:13.959> for<00:04:14.260> your

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
X is y and if it doesn't work for your

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.990 
X is y and if it doesn't work for your
object<00:04:14.739> just<00:04:14.920> play<00:04:15.160> around<00:04:15.280> with<00:04:15.519> these<00:04:15.640> until

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
object just play around with these until

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.460 
object just play around with these until
you<00:04:16.479> get<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.840> way<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:16.989> want<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.320> but

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
you get it the way you want it but

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.599 
you get it the way you want it but
that's<00:04:17.620> usually<00:04:18.070> how<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.250> get<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.580> to<00:04:18.700> work

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
that's usually how you get it to work

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.080 
that's usually how you get it to work
and<00:04:19.879> if<00:04:20.569> you<00:04:20.689> increase<00:04:21.019> your<00:04:21.169> bank<00:04:21.409> scale<00:04:21.769> here

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
and if you increase your bank scale here

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.760 
and if you increase your bank scale here
I'll<00:04:23.090> put<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.389> up<00:04:23.449> at<00:04:23.569> five<00:04:25.930> it<00:04:26.930> really<00:04:27.379> it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
I'll put it up at five it really it

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.439 
I'll put it up at five it really it
changes<00:04:28.759> how<00:04:28.909> much<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.330> will<00:04:29.419> tilt<00:04:31.300> when<00:04:32.300> it's

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
changes how much it will tilt when it's

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.839 
changes how much it will tilt when it's
going<00:04:32.659> through<00:04:32.960> these<00:04:33.110> curves<00:04:33.740> here<00:04:34.069> so

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
going through these curves here so

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.510 
going through these curves here so
that's<00:04:35.210> kind<00:04:35.509> of<00:04:35.539> important<00:04:36.080> but<00:04:36.800> um<00:04:37.009> yeah

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
that's kind of important but um yeah

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.399 
that's kind of important but um yeah
it's<00:04:37.699> not<00:04:37.879> very<00:04:38.030> fluid<00:04:38.539> animation<00:04:39.139> you<00:04:39.289> know

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
it's not very fluid animation you know

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.050 
it's not very fluid animation you know
I'm<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:40.219> kind<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.430> quickly<00:04:40.669> put<00:04:40.939> together

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
I'm just kind of quickly put together

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.820 
I'm just kind of quickly put together
but<00:04:41.449> that's<00:04:41.659> how<00:04:41.840> you<00:04:41.900> make<00:04:42.110> an<00:04:42.289> object<00:04:42.439> follow

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
but that's how you make an object follow

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.040 
but that's how you make an object follow
a<00:04:42.919> path<00:04:43.189> so<00:04:43.909> I<00:04:44.180> hope<00:04:44.449> you've<00:04:44.629> enjoyed<00:04:44.689> this

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
a path so I hope you've enjoyed this

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.320 
a path so I hope you've enjoyed this
tutorial<00:04:45.199> I<00:04:45.680> hope<00:04:45.949> it's<00:04:46.250> been<00:04:46.430> helpful<00:04:46.460> so

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
tutorial I hope it's been helpful so
