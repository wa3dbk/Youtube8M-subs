justice as I've done for the previous
two<00:01:19.380> years<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.400> could<00:01:20.549> actually<00:01:20.640> win<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
two years but I could actually win it

two years but I could actually win it
and<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:22.140> there<00:01:22.290> wasn't<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.740> anything<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and that there wasn't really anything to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.850 
and that there wasn't really anything to
stop<00:01:23.369> me<00:01:23.549> from<00:01:23.640> winning<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.350> wasn't<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
stop me from winning it and it wasn't so

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
stop me from winning it and it wasn't so
much<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.040> case<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> me<00:01:26.759> thinking<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.390> better

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
much a case of me thinking I was better

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.940 
much a case of me thinking I was better
than<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> class<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:28.380> playing<00:01:28.619> against

because I'd be Alex Higgins in the final
one<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> my<00:01:31.799> heroes<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.430> many<00:01:32.579> ways<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
one of my heroes in many ways and the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
one of my heroes in many ways and the
player<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.659> frightened<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> playing

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
player I was frightened of playing

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.789 
player I was frightened of playing
because<00:01:35.250> he's<00:01:35.549> genius<00:01:35.850> qualities<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:39.799> just

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
because he's genius qualities I just

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.539 
because he's genius qualities I just
sensed<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> was<00:01:42.780> perhaps<00:01:43.460> capable<00:01:44.460> of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
sensed that I was perhaps capable of

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
sensed that I was perhaps capable of
winning<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.689> perhaps<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.020> wasn't<00:01:46.140> relaxed

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
winning and perhaps I wasn't relaxed

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.950 
winning and perhaps I wasn't relaxed
enough<00:01:47.040> for<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.340> was<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> case<00:01:47.960> from

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
enough for that was the case from

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.960 
enough for that was the case from
