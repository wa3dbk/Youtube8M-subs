00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.640
 I remember the night and the lights of the sea of ​​beer 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.030
 the burnt sunset is so beautiful 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:25.349
 we bro with my soul in the pub rubbed about everything 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.340
 garbage and the bartender slyly watched 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.870
 on us until midnight was just 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.070
 I remember morning I met 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.750
 my eyes brooded my bro slept with me 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:48.359
 near his hand on my leg 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:59.550
 oh my gosh what a wild nonsense 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 because there is a ring on his hand 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.557
 and my finger in the same ring
