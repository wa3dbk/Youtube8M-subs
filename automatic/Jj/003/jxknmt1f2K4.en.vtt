and we're about a meter away from it it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.859 
and we're about a meter away from it it
was<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.049> most<00:01:58.350> amazing<00:01:59.280> moment<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.329> swear<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.330 
we had heaps of cocktails and I did your
vlog<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.200> think<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.649> be<00:02:07.770> way

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
vlog but I think it's going to be way

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
vlog but I think it's going to be way
too<00:02:08.369> much<00:02:08.940> footage<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.479> put<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.869> vlog<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.259> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
too much footage to put in one vlog so I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.080 
too much footage to put in one vlog so I
might<00:02:10.530> split<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
might split it up and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.940 
might split it up and
hopefully<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:12.870> interesting<00:02:13.230> enough<00:02:13.530> I'm
