00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:12.030
 the dog got what is thinking 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.070
 youtuber and here are here with the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.119
 partly the doctor and with the ankle 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.850
 a beautiful good morning point 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.890
 10 raffael of june plus i will now 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.150
 either ask or ask and you ask 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.109
 just answer with what he does 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:37.380
 studied coffee or energy 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:38.239
 Energy clear , I do not care if I do both 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.829
 invented 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.670
 I found him and what are you drinking ? 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.129
 Dear doctor, please 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.219
 I prefer drinking, I drink to everyone 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.420
 case then remember 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.420
 I always think doctors drink coffee 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.070
 definitely a lot 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.960
 why no coffee fan here is us 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.890
 So these cold energies of coffee 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 you have to shit 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.510
 but we do not do any of that 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.110
 surreptitious rockstar 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.790
 delicious link in the video description on 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.850
 dearest both actually one 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.170
 narrative cafÃ© I want time for myself 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.950
 It's more like a pleasure reminder 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.150
 One can take quickly new items 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.860
 lizard and then continue to cut that 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.810
 video or on the way to the water 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.920
 So drink in between max 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.530
 more or rather in the ligue star wars 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.960
 or lord of the rings star wars 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.060
 so 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.770
 Fantasy does not quite show my thing ok 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.390
 I can understand that people like that 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.710
 but do not you think the reason only 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.830
 So where is more science fiction too 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 general 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.250
 Generally not that way 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.570
 i did not find the star wars movies yet 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.500
 Bad you can look at it 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.770
 that is very difficult 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.399
 I'm from both equally long falls 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.450
 the same for a long time but that is 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.770
 that has been around for a long time 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.500
 it gives as long as and from the lord of 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.149
 filmed the first movie in 1978 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.340
 I'm already there I am too 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.829
 have always been fan 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.909
 So one and a half cartoon and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.019
 real movie hello I've got you win 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.819
 very difficult and very complete 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.530
 Nice that I am both good for you 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.209
 I think I would say if then 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.739
 but rather the rings of the landscape 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.120
 just so epic and star wars 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.890
 just the first time playing just yet 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.450
 relatively much in the spaceship and I think 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.450
 actually the outside shots none 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.930
 I have to confess honestly 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.190
 that was with that 's it said in the interview 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.360
 ring 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.739
 I've looked at that I find 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.799
 actually very cool but I am 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.269
 not a hardcore fan but everything 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.980
 enumerate but I can go to the movie 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.500
 Cook guests from a big bang theory and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.010
 how i met your mother with your mother 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.340
 big bang theory 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.319
 really shit I think part-time nerd 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.299
 which now the first two stagger the 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.769
 were really good and from the third 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.140
 season is like in any other 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.700
 time comes only for women and then 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.930
 it becomes a nerd factor only because of it 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.519
 that generates as much as possible 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.680
 namedropping incorporates as many as possible 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.370
 Brand names tell me that very well 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.489
 sound through 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.989
 So of course I look most like in 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.130
 they all saw that, so did I. 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.350
 watch 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.050
 because the authors are just great 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.480
 all wrote really well though 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.880
 big bang theory that in the movie night with 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.260
 new inventions continue to be so difficult 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.100
 both sold well so did the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.960
 one because I've seen follow 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.080
 so say the topic what is both 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.080
 Well 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.440
 last season a bit of theme almost 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.790
 thoroughly horny 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.709
 pity already over you can always 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.299
 still look on the internet or at 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.010
 sometimes a tv if you have one 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.000
 superhero would you like it for you 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.430
 keep or with that 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.640
 go public 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.020
 that's really more of a good question 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.410
 I think it all depends on what 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:01.920
 I could 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.920
 say you could fly away 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.160
 I do not think so 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.170
 go public because of the beautiful 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.430
 surprise effects is generated by 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.650
 one place to the other and 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.910
 nobody can explain themselves 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.900
 I would always do that for myself 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.280
 fear that the scientists 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.450
 should examine me receive 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.450
 why actually 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.940
 and of course very much by nature 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.660
 modestly serious question i think so 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.310
 was pretty much keeping i believe otherwise 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.479
 one can imagine oneself the one constantly 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.139
 no longer recognizing surrounds 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:45.230
 she also as the big youtube.com still the 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.090
 power on it 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.980
 long time I fly I think short 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.560
 but you have completely kept that ship 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.450
 Locked me up and the account 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.340
 what are you super powers so if I am 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.140
 could be invisible then again 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.730
 betrayed because of course is great 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.340
 you into everything it can to each 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:05.870
 concert eg you would prefer a dog 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.520
 and your friends and family christians 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.840
 that it is you or you would rather be one 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.160
 human would you be the human 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.150
 but should never be yours again 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.230
 girlfriend family see 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.750
 then I would rather at home 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.590
 that means without friends and family 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.590
 somehow live here too 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.210
 man is society here 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.070
 the canton does not own a society 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.300
 so it will probably live 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.909
 pretty soon implicitly or what ends 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.840
 the masses of your channel that you know 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.920
 that's not good 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.930
 boah 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.850
 then rather 100 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.850
 coal family friends does not work 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.080
 I'm really a human being 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.580
 So I think I wanted to go then 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.930
 but if people decide too 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.010
 Of course it's really hard who his family 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.200
 not to ask serious questions 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.190
 This is often not a question 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.190
 the thought out 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.129
 It must be a difficult question 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.879
 yes ok artworks lonely but me 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.189

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.590
 you have one can do yes but and 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.860
 Family at that time with or without them

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.920

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.350
