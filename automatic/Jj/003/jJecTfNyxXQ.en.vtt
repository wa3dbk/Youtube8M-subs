actually basically in effect have a

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.630 
actually basically in effect have a
delay<00:00:23.140> for<00:00:23.590> example

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
delay for example

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.990 
delay for example
into<00:00:25.210> a<00:00:25.240> Reaver<00:00:25.720> so<00:00:26.410> before<00:00:26.920> on<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.400> db2<00:00:27.849> you

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
into a Reaver so before on the db2 you

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.189 
into a Reaver so before on the db2 you
had<00:00:28.119> your<00:00:28.269> two<00:00:28.390> effects<00:00:28.660> engines<00:00:29.050> that<00:00:29.169> are

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
had your two effects engines that are

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.409 
had your two effects engines that are
assignable<00:00:29.939> made<00:00:30.939> a<00:00:30.970> bet<00:00:31.240> they're<00:00:31.390> like

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
assignable made a bet they're like

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.810 
assignable made a bet they're like
almost<00:00:31.750> independent<00:00:32.439> where's<00:00:33.309> now<00:00:33.520> we<00:00:33.579> can

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
almost independent where's now we can

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.030 
almost independent where's now we can
actually<00:00:33.910> say<00:00:34.270> okay<00:00:34.600> let's<00:00:35.440> introduce<00:00:35.710> a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
actually say okay let's introduce a

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.069 
actually say okay let's introduce a
delay<00:00:36.309> then<00:00:37.180> I<00:00:37.210> want<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.510> go<00:00:37.600> into<00:00:37.750> a<00:00:37.840> rush

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
delay then I want to go into a rush

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.410 
delay then I want to go into a rush
three<00:00:38.410> but<00:00:38.739> just<00:00:39.430> a<00:00:39.550> bit<00:00:39.790> more<00:00:40.030> intricate

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
three but just a bit more intricate

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.970 
three but just a bit more intricate
where<00:00:40.540> your<00:00:40.629> sound<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:41.199> what<00:00:41.589> a<00:00:41.620> break

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
where your sound and what a break

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.740 
where your sound and what a break
something<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.910> just<00:00:43.059> blows<00:00:43.330> a<00:00:43.390> bit

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
something it just blows a bit

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.160 
something it just blows a bit
differently<00:00:44.199> yes<00:00:44.739> yeah<00:00:45.100> yeah<00:00:45.449> so<00:00:46.449> that's<00:00:46.989> been

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
differently yes yeah yeah so that's been

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.229 
differently yes yeah yeah so that's been
added<00:00:47.320> which<00:00:47.620> is<00:00:47.769> quite<00:00:48.250> flipping<00:00:48.850> up<00:00:49.000> things

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
added which is quite flipping up things

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.790 
added which is quite flipping up things
and<00:00:49.420> even<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.839> really<00:00:50.230> not<00:00:50.440> let<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.650> know<00:00:50.739> a

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
and even to really not let you know a

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.649 
and even to really not let you know a
little<00:00:51.100> bit<00:00:51.309> away<00:00:51.400> from<00:00:51.489> those<00:00:51.909> two<00:00:52.180> it<00:00:52.540> gives

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
little bit away from those two it gives

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.750 
little bit away from those two it gives
you<00:00:52.809> so<00:00:53.019> much<00:00:53.170> scope<00:00:53.559> to<00:00:53.769> do<00:00:53.890> thats<00:00:54.339> more<00:00:54.519> with

edges<00:01:01.390> together<00:01:01.719> man<00:01:02.199> these<00:01:02.320> definitely<00:01:02.769> go

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
edges together man these definitely go

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.070 
edges together man these definitely go
down<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.550> main<00:01:03.760> feature<00:01:04.119> yeah<00:01:04.780> okay

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
down the main feature yeah okay

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.109 
down the main feature yeah okay
additionally<00:01:05.940> we've<00:01:06.940> added<00:01:07.470> other<00:01:08.470> options

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
additionally we've added other options

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.760 
additionally we've added other options
for<00:01:10.119> example<00:01:10.479> we've<00:01:10.600> got<00:01:10.630> spatial<00:01:11.200> crossover

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
for example we've got spatial crossover

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.980 
for example we've got spatial crossover
so<00:01:11.950> you<00:01:12.429> can<00:01:12.550> actually<00:01:12.700> mono<00:01:13.210> your<00:01:13.570> based<00:01:13.810> on

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
so you can actually mono your based on

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.650 
so you can actually mono your based on
your<00:01:14.200> bridge<00:01:15.009> yeah<00:01:15.280> yo<00:01:15.729> again<00:01:16.330> if<00:01:16.450> you're<00:01:16.570> in
