00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that right so if you were to take this a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
that right so if you were to take this a

good way to remember that is that if you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.000 
good way to remember that is that if you
say<00:02:58.459> that<00:02:58.730> okay<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.209> wheel<00:02:59.450> is<00:03:00.410> gonna<00:03:00.530> rotate

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
say that okay this wheel is gonna rotate

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.620 
say that okay this wheel is gonna rotate
in<00:03:01.099> this<00:03:01.220> direction<00:03:01.280> when<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.120> car<00:03:02.269> is<00:03:02.299> going

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
in this direction when the car is going

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.900 
in this direction when the car is going
forward<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.920> Rico<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.489> counterclockwise

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
forward it Rico in a counterclockwise

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.250 
forward it Rico in a counterclockwise
direction

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
direction

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.990 
direction
that's<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:07.099> way<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.310> hub's<00:03:07.519> lives<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.940> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
that's the way the hub's lives and the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.539 
that's the way the hub's lives and the
hubs<00:03:08.209> loosen<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.780> direction<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.200> rotation

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
hubs loosen in the direction of rotation

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.559 
hubs loosen in the direction of rotation
so<00:03:10.549> let's<00:03:10.760> go<00:03:10.880> ahead<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.120> take<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.480> one<00:03:11.690> off
