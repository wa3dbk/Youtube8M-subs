00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
of the unusual things about this skull

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.279 
of the unusual things about this skull
it's<00:00:49.710> unusual<00:00:50.370> physiology<00:00:51.210> begins<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
it's unusual physiology begins with the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.670 
it's unusual physiology begins with the
bone<00:00:52.530> itself<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.480> uniformly<00:00:54.480> half<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.440> thick

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
bone itself it's uniformly half as thick

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.130 
bone itself it's uniformly half as thick
as<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> normal<00:00:56.280> human<00:00:56.309> bone<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.899> weighs

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
as a normal human bone and it weighs

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.770 
as a normal human bone and it weighs
half<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.739> much<00:00:58.920> very<00:00:59.550> light<00:00:59.820> by<00:01:00.120> comparison

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
half as much very light by comparison

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.170 
half as much very light by comparison
and<00:01:00.960> yet<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.280> three<00:01:02.489> times<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:02.969> hard

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and yet it's two or three times as hard

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.630 
and yet it's two or three times as hard
it's<00:01:03.390> extremely<00:01:04.110> durable<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.369> some<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's extremely durable we think some of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's extremely durable we think some of
that<00:01:05.820> durability<00:01:06.270> comes<00:01:06.810> from<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:07.920> unusual

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
that durability comes from very unusual

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.730 
that durability comes from very unusual
fibers<00:01:09.060> woven<00:01:09.420> through<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.080> matrix<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.680> the

bone never seen in any other animal of
any<00:01:14.520> kind<00:01:14.820> there's<00:01:15.540> also<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.049> red<00:01:16.409> residue

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
any kind there's also a red residue

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.370 
any kind there's also a red residue
found<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.820> bone<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> cancellous

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
found in the bone in the cancellous

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.910 
found in the bone in the cancellous
holes<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.400> also<00:01:20.580> very<00:01:21.060> unlike<00:01:21.810> any<00:01:22.619> other

bone<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.939> known<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.380> those

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
bone that is known so you have those

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.890 
bone that is known so you have those
unusual<00:01:26.100> attributes<00:01:26.850> right<00:01:27.330> off<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> bat

trying to find out what it is and it all
comes<00:02:45.410> back<00:02:45.530> this<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.459> not<00:02:46.989> normal<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.170> is

comes back this is not normal this is

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.660 
comes back this is not normal this is
really<00:02:49.070> unusual<00:02:50.050> so<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.800> main<00:02:52.070> test<00:02:52.430> we've

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
really unusual so the main test we've

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.050 
really unusual so the main test we've
had<00:02:52.910> has<00:02:53.390> been<00:02:53.620> DNA<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.980> what<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.370> DNA<00:02:55.850> is

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
had has been DNA and what the DNA is

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.710 
had has been DNA and what the DNA is
told<00:02:56.360> us<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.840> remarkable<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:58.340> 203<00:02:58.790> we

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
told us is remarkable in 203 we

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.070 
told us is remarkable in 203 we
recovered<00:03:00.650> very<00:03:00.680> easily<00:03:01.269> its<00:03:02.269> mitochondrial

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
recovered very easily its mitochondrial

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.960 
recovered very easily its mitochondrial
DNA<00:03:03.230> which<00:03:03.590> told<00:03:03.920> us<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.250> its<00:03:04.430> mother<00:03:04.700> was

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
DNA which told us that its mother was

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.300 
DNA which told us that its mother was
human<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:05.690> in<00:03:05.810> six<00:03:06.110> full<00:03:06.440> attempts<00:03:06.920> we<00:03:07.070> could

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
human but in six full attempts we could

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.229 
human but in six full attempts we could
not<00:03:07.519> recover<00:03:08.030> its<00:03:08.720> nuclear<00:03:09.290> DNA<00:03:09.580> and<00:03:10.580> nuclear

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
not recover its nuclear DNA and nuclear

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.180 
not recover its nuclear DNA and nuclear
DNA<00:03:11.510> comes<00:03:12.019> from<00:03:12.260> your<00:03:12.470> mother<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:12.829> your

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
DNA comes from your mother and your

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.280 
DNA comes from your mother and your
father<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.329> told<00:03:14.720> us<00:03:14.900> right<00:03:15.140> away

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
father and so that told us right away

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.280 
father and so that told us right away
that<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.739> father<00:03:16.010> was<00:03:16.340> very<00:03:16.660> unusual<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.840> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
that the father was very unusual and the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.960 
that the father was very unusual and the
Starchild<00:03:18.769> itself<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.400> very<00:03:19.700> unusual<00:03:20.709> now

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
Starchild itself is very unusual now

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.759 
Starchild itself is very unusual now
during<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.239> course<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.900> year<00:03:23.959> 200

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
during the course of this year 200

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.720 
during the course of this year 200
tonight<00:03:25.190> we're<00:03:25.850> hoping<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:27.140> a<00:03:27.500> DNA<00:03:28.400> test

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
tonight we're hoping to have a DNA test

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.199 
tonight we're hoping to have a DNA test
done<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.750> will<00:03:29.959> recover<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.650> entire<00:03:30.860> genome

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
done that will recover the entire genome

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.110 
done that will recover the entire genome
of<00:03:32.209> this<00:03:32.390> remarkable<00:03:33.170> relic<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.920> when<00:03:34.549> we<00:03:34.850> get

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
of this remarkable relic and when we get

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.780 
of this remarkable relic and when we get
that<00:03:35.180> result<00:03:35.630> in<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.590> we<00:03:36.769> believe<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.610> we'll

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
that result in and we believe that we'll

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.390 
that result in and we believe that we'll
have<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.209> by<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.420> end<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.750> this<00:03:38.900> year<00:03:39.230> we<00:03:40.130> know

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
have it by the end of this year we know

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.970 
have it by the end of this year we know
that<00:03:40.760> this<00:03:40.970> skull<00:03:41.360> is<00:03:41.720> going<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.320> make<00:03:42.620> history

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
that this skull is going to make history

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.509 
that this skull is going to make history
