00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.270 

all<00:06:02.590> right<00:06:02.800> I<00:06:02.830> was<00:06:03.070> to<00:06:03.220> write<00:06:03.370> when<00:06:04.770> you<00:06:05.770> simply

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
all right I was to write when you simply

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.870 
all right I was to write when you simply
pull<00:06:06.550> a<00:06:06.580> lever<00:06:07.080> swim<00:06:08.080> forward<00:06:08.380> or<00:06:08.830> grab<00:06:09.729> the

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
pull a lever swim forward or grab the

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.070 
pull a lever swim forward or grab the
key<00:06:10.120> and<00:06:10.150> then<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:11.800> only<00:06:12.510> competition<00:06:13.510> is<00:06:13.840> to

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
key and then the only competition is to

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.940 
key and then the only competition is to
swim<00:06:14.650> up<00:06:14.860> fast<00:06:15.820> enough<00:06:16.030> again<00:06:16.479> but<00:06:16.690> Lera<00:06:17.530> is<00:06:17.740> a

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
swim up fast enough again but Lera is a

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.630 
swim up fast enough again but Lera is a
coolant<00:06:18.430> strong<00:06:18.940> swimmer<00:06:19.450> so<00:06:20.370> this<00:06:21.370> should<00:06:21.610> be

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
coolant strong swimmer so this should be

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.400 
coolant strong swimmer so this should be
no<00:06:21.850> problem<00:06:22.650> so<00:06:23.650> here<00:06:23.979> it<00:06:24.100> is<00:06:24.960> we<00:06:25.960> need<00:06:26.140> to<00:06:26.260> get
