I've<00:00:11.190> been<00:00:11.400> thinking<00:00:11.700> some<00:00:11.880> more<00:00:12.150> since<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I've been thinking some more since the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.390 
I've been thinking some more since the
last<00:00:12.870> time<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.230> sat<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.920> talking<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> myself

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
last time I sat here talking to myself

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.269 
last time I sat here talking to myself
about<00:00:15.089> gender<00:00:15.540> attitudes<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.320> health<00:00:16.560> because

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
about gender attitudes to health because

apart<00:00:17.520> from<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.699> man<00:00:18.000> flu<00:00:18.390> myth<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.020> got<00:00:19.170> me

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
apart from the man flu myth that got me

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.620 
apart from the man flu myth that got me
so<00:00:19.439> exercised<00:00:19.949> last<00:00:20.250> week<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.910> other<00:00:21.090> cliche

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
so exercised last week the other cliche

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.689 
so exercised last week the other cliche
is<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.020> men<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.710> far<00:00:22.890> more<00:00:22.920> reluctant<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.609> go

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
is that men are far more reluctant to go

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.820 
is that men are far more reluctant to go
to<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> doctor<00:00:24.359> than<00:00:24.510> women<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.560> one's

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to the doctor than women and that one's

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.380 
to the doctor than women and that one's
pretty<00:00:26.130> much<00:00:26.369> true<00:00:26.730> isn't<00:00:27.060> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
pretty much true isn't it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.910 
pretty much true isn't it
when<00:00:27.810> something<00:00:28.199> goes<00:00:28.320> wrong<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.769> our

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
when something goes wrong with our

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.580 
when something goes wrong with our
bodies<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.670> men<00:00:29.939> ignore<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.720> ignore<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.380> ignore

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
point where we've decided overnight that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.290 
point where we've decided overnight that
it's<00:00:35.219> almost<00:00:35.399> certainly<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> kill<00:00:36.120> us

of broad generalizations here like to
