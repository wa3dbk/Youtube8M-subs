00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
anyway with these with this case thing
we<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.060> these<00:01:48.350> really

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
we really like is as these really

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.859 
we really like is as these really
high-quality<00:01:49.560> magnets<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.630> secure<00:01:51.630> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
high-quality magnets that secure and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.300 
high-quality magnets that secure and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
give you those different viewing angles

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550 
give you those different viewing angles
they<00:01:53.759> stay<00:01:54.000> very<00:01:54.270> nice<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.869> secure<00:01:55.290> they're

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
they stay very nice and secure they're

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.959 
they stay very nice and secure they're
not<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.460> isn't<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> be

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
not going to be this isn't going to be

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.050 
not going to be this isn't going to be
falling<00:01:57.270> out<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.600> place<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.850> like

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
falling out of place and we really like

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.230 
falling out of place and we really like
that<00:02:00.380> as<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> keyboard<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:03.000> pretty

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.980 
that as for the keyboard it's pretty
easy<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.840> connect<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:05.119> just<00:02:06.119> kind<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.390> press

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
easy to connect to just kind of press

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.260

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
any of the buttons

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.699 
any of the buttons
that'll<00:02:10.270> wake<00:02:10.450> up<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.840> keyboard<00:02:11.050> by<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.530> way

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709

this keyboard has up to six months of
battery<00:02:14.800> life<00:02:15.190> before<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.760> need<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.030> recharge

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
battery life before you need to recharge

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.510 
battery life before you need to recharge
it<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.870> does<00:02:17.020> come<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.440> micro<00:02:17.890> USB<00:02:17.920> if

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
it but it does come with a micro USB if

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.030

you want to hook into that and recharge

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.890 
you want to hook into that and recharge
it<00:02:21.130> more<00:02:21.280> often<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:22.180> gonna<00:02:22.300> go<00:02:22.510> at<00:02:22.630> least

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
it more often but it's gonna go at least

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.320 
it more often but it's gonna go at least
six<00:02:23.380> months<00:02:23.590> that's<00:02:23.950> if<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.280> use<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.730> just

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
six months that's if you use it just

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.120 
six months that's if you use it just
over<00:02:25.630> two<00:02:25.810> hours<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.200> day<00:02:26.319> so<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.830> gives<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.100> a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
over two hours a day so it gives you a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.059 
over two hours a day so it gives you a
lot<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.459> battery<00:02:27.970> life<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:28.690> impressive<00:02:29.230> as

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
lot of battery life really impressive as

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.880 
lot of battery life really impressive as
far<00:02:30.310> as<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.670> goes

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
far as that goes

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.870
