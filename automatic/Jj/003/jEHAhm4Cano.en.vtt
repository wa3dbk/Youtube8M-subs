00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.790 

the<00:00:38.880> Suzuki<00:00:39.060> it<00:00:39.570> did<00:00:39.780> everything<00:00:40.020> well<00:00:40.410> but

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the Suzuki it did everything well but

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290

nothing<00:00:41.310> exceptional

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
nothing exceptional

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.900 
nothing exceptional
I<00:00:42.330> felt<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.770> GSXR<00:00:44.220> was<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.490> little<00:00:44.790> bit

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
I felt the the GSXR was a little bit

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.890 
I felt the the GSXR was a little bit
more<00:00:45.210> trim<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.800> maybe<00:00:47.360> not<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.750> date

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
more trim down and maybe not up to date

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.140 
more trim down and maybe not up to date
with<00:00:49.140> these<00:00:49.320> other<00:00:49.500> bikes<00:00:49.740> but<00:00:50.190> own<00:00:50.400> that<00:00:50.850> you

upgrades<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.870> guess<00:01:13.050> it's<00:01:13.229> they're<00:01:13.530> just

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
upgrades I guess it's they're just

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.490 
upgrades I guess it's they're just
they're<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.040> better<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.840> Suzuki<00:01:15.840> has<00:01:16.140> great

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
they're just better and Suzuki has great

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.350 
they're just better and Suzuki has great
engine<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.070> great<00:01:17.250> chassis<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.150> just

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
engine and a great chassis but I just

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120 
engine and a great chassis but I just
feel<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.990> behind<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> other<00:01:19.890> bikes

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
feel that it's behind the other bikes

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.670 
feel that it's behind the other bikes
now<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.640> clearly<00:01:21.090> beyond<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> other<00:01:21.660> bikes

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.870 

it's<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> bike<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> does<00:01:26.250> everything<00:01:26.670> pretty

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it's a bike that does everything pretty

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.350

bike I'm comfortable from side to side

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.270 
bike I'm comfortable from side to side
out<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.760> any<00:01:35.910> of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> bikes<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.600> today<00:01:37.280> that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
out of any of the bikes here today that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.650 
out of any of the bikes here today that
being<00:01:38.550> said<00:01:38.760> it's<00:01:39.000> still<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.570> of

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
being said it's still just kind of

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.240 
being said it's still just kind of
lacking<00:01:40.080> where<00:01:40.410> some<00:01:40.649> of<00:01:40.679> these<00:01:40.800> other<00:01:40.979> bikes

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
lacking where some of these other bikes

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.069 
lacking where some of these other bikes
are<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> standing<00:01:42.240> out

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.139 

the<00:01:46.530> Suzuki<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:47.130> does<00:01:47.310> everything<00:01:47.460> good<00:01:47.939> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the Suzuki just does everything good it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.550 
the Suzuki just does everything good it
doesn't<00:01:48.359> do<00:01:48.570> anything<00:01:48.810> wrong<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.530> think

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
doesn't do anything wrong and I think

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.929 
doesn't do anything wrong and I think
that<00:01:49.829> when<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.039> look<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.340> how<00:01:50.460> long<00:01:50.700> this

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that when you look at how long this

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.090 
that when you look at how long this
models<00:01:51.329> been<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.590> how<00:01:52.740> many<00:01:52.920> things

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
models been out and and how many things

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.469 
models been out and and how many things
it<00:01:53.219> does<00:01:53.369> good<00:01:53.609> I<00:01:53.640> think<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> addition<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
it does good I think the addition of a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.929 
it does good I think the addition of a
quick<00:01:54.689> shifter<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.140> nice<00:01:55.460> I'm<00:01:56.460> sure<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:56.909> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
quick shifter was nice I'm sure now that

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
quick shifter was nice I'm sure now that
they're<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.360> MotoGP<00:01:57.630> we're<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.350> see

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
they're in MotoGP we're going to see

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.319 
they're in MotoGP we're going to see
some<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.920> trickle-down<00:01:59.280> effect<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.149> I'm

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
some of that trickle-down effect and I'm

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.520 
some of that trickle-down effect and I'm
excited<00:02:00.630> about<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.079> they're<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.289> to<00:02:01.350> come

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530

machine but in light of some of the

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.760 
machine but in light of some of the
newer<00:02:19.000> models<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.660> showing<00:02:20.140> its<00:02:20.290> age<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
newer models it's showing its age in the

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.470 
newer models it's showing its age in the
engine<00:02:21.040> department<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:21.730> yeah<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.150> needs<00:02:22.300> a

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
engine department like yeah it needs a

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.600 
engine department like yeah it needs a
little<00:02:22.630> bit<00:02:22.870> more<00:02:22.930> power<00:02:23.320> yeah<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.370> could

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
little bit more power yeah it could

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.070 
little bit more power yeah it could
handle<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:25.060> little<00:02:25.210> bit<00:02:25.420> sharper

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
handle a little bit sharper

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.370 
handle a little bit sharper
I<00:02:26.520> think<00:02:27.520> if<00:02:27.670> Suzuki<00:02:28.210> kind<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.570> took<00:02:29.110> care<00:02:29.350> of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
I think if Suzuki kind of took care of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.410 
I think if Suzuki kind of took care of
