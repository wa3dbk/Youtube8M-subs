well<00:00:03.600> here's<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.870> swamp<00:00:04.200> cooler<00:00:04.549> that<00:00:05.549> was

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
well here's a swamp cooler that was

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.179 
well here's a swamp cooler that was
pulled<00:00:05.940> off<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.150> roof<00:00:06.680> and<00:00:07.680> there's<00:00:07.980> nothing

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
pulled off a roof and there's nothing

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.740 
pulled off a roof and there's nothing
wrong<00:00:08.280> with<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:08.580> sons<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.059> actually<00:00:09.300> stainless

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
wrong with it sons I actually stainless

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.560 
wrong with it sons I actually stainless
steel<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.639> only<00:00:11.760> thing<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.389> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
steel and the only thing is it's a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.740 
steel and the only thing is it's a
little<00:00:12.719> bit<00:00:12.809> dirty<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.800> can<00:00:13.950> see<00:00:14.509> got<00:00:15.509> some

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
little bit dirty you can see got some

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.739 
little bit dirty you can see got some
buildup<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.519> and<00:00:17.519> so<00:00:18.480> I'm<00:00:18.539> gonna<00:00:18.630> go

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:18.749 
buildup in it and so I'm gonna go

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.210 
buildup in it and so I'm gonna go
through<00:00:19.019> it<00:00:19.550> clean<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.669> up<00:00:20.819> and<00:00:21.060> test<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.079> all

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
through it clean it up and test it all

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.880 
through it clean it up and test it all
and<00:00:23.220> wire<00:00:23.429> it<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.729> do<00:00:24.509> a<00:00:24.539> little<00:00:24.779> series<00:00:25.229> on<00:00:25.439> how

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
and wire it up do a little series on how

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.819 
and wire it up do a little series on how
you<00:00:25.979> can<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.369> all<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.649> it's<00:00:28.649> pretty

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
you can do all this and it's pretty

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.249 
you can do all this and it's pretty
basic<00:00:29.210> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> point<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.779> some<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
basic going to point out some of the

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.880 
basic going to point out some of the
main<00:00:32.250> things<00:00:33.239> right<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.929> is<00:00:34.079> here's<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
main things right here is here's the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.200 
main things right here is here's the
float<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:37.230> controls<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.519> water<00:00:38.699> when<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
float that controls the water when the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.790 
float that controls the water when the
water<00:00:39.239> gets<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> high<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.789> uh

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
water gets so high then it uh

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.829 
water gets so high then it uh
when<00:00:43.800> water<00:00:44.010> gets<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.370> high<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.030> shuts<00:00:45.359> off<00:00:45.510> by

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 
when water gets so high it shuts off by

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.069 
when water gets so high it shuts off by
using<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> float<00:00:46.440> has<00:00:46.679> a<00:00:46.739> switch<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.309> here

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
using the float has a switch right here

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.610 
using the float has a switch right here
you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.410> there's<00:00:49.679> a<00:00:50.030> switch<00:00:52.969> there's<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
you can see there's a switch there's a

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.779 
you can see there's a switch there's a
switch<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.129> when<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> flow<00:00:56.609> gets

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
switch in there so when the flow gets

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.910 
switch in there so when the flow gets
high<00:00:56.999> enough<00:00:57.179> it<00:00:57.329> cuts<00:00:57.539> off<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> water<00:00:58.079> so

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
high enough it cuts off the water so

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
high enough it cuts off the water so
this<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.190> always<00:00:59.339> be<00:00:59.550> adjusted<00:00:59.870> put<00:01:00.870> your

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
this can always be adjusted put your

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.289 
this can always be adjusted put your
water<00:01:01.199> level<00:01:02.359> next<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.530> pump<00:01:04.769> and

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
water level next you have your pump and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.420 
water level next you have your pump and
your<00:01:06.299> pump<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.049> works<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.560> 120<00:01:08.100> volts

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
your pump you know works off 120 volts

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.749 
your pump you know works off 120 volts
and<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> does<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.220> pull<00:01:11.220> water<00:01:11.460> out

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
and all it does is just pull water out

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.330 
and all it does is just pull water out
of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> bottom<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.649> pull<00:01:13.649> it<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.040> line

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
of the bottom here pull it up this line

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.959 
of the bottom here pull it up this line
it<00:01:15.329> comes<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.719> to<00:01:15.899> this<00:01:15.990> fire<00:01:16.399> it<00:01:17.399> spreads<00:01:17.820> it

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
it comes up to this fire it spreads it

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:23.510 
it comes up to this fire it spreads it
out<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> sides<00:01:20.689> all<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.899> around<00:01:22.520> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
out to the sides all the way around and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.300 
out to the sides all the way around and
those<00:01:24.270> come<00:01:24.540> down<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.960> pads<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:26.100> pads

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
those come down to the pads the pads

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.690 
those come down to the pads the pads
right<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:26.700> I've<00:01:26.820> been<00:01:26.969> winterized<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:28.700> just

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
right now I've been winterized so just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.499 
right now I've been winterized so just
sitting<00:01:29.880> right<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.979> these<00:01:32.390> look<00:01:33.390> like

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
sitting right here these look like

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.940 
sitting right here these look like
they're<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.780> need<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> be<00:01:34.110> changed<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.680> but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
they're gonna need to be changed out but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.830 
they're gonna need to be changed out but
the<00:01:35.039> water<00:01:35.250> will<00:01:35.430> come<00:01:35.640> down<00:01:35.670> it'll<00:01:36.539> collect

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the water will come down it'll collect

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
the water will come down it'll collect
up<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.950> run<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:38.340> let<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.670> air<00:01:38.909> flow

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
up here to run down let the air flow

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.980 
up here to run down let the air flow
past<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:41.539> and<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:43.710> course<00:01:44.039> here's<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.520> motor

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.459 

going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> belt<00:01:49.469> to<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.460> fan<00:01:50.759> cage<00:01:51.469> and

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
going to the belt to the fan cage and

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:53.899 
going to the belt to the fan cage and
when<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> spins<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.189> pulls<00:01:53.369> air<00:01:53.579> into<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
when it spins it pulls air into the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.469 
when it spins it pulls air into the
house<00:01:54.060> past<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> cooler<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.859> the<00:01:56.479> past

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
house past the cooler that's the past

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.020 
house past the cooler that's the past
the<00:01:57.780> evaporator<00:01:58.439> pads<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:59.609> cools<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the evaporator pads which cools the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.899 
the evaporator pads which cools the
house<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:02.100> gonna<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.460> through<00:02:02.700> some

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
house so I'm gonna be going through some

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.709 
house so I'm gonna be going through some
basic<00:02:03.240> steps<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.960> how<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.859> good<00:02:05.329> how<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> get

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
basic steps on how you good how to get

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.330 
basic steps on how you good how to get
this<00:02:06.840> prepared<00:02:07.289> and<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> row<00:02:08.100> of<00:02:08.220> how

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
this prepared and get it on a row of how

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.440 
this prepared and get it on a row of how
to<00:02:08.400> wire<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.910> up

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
to wire it up

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.490 
to wire it up
and<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.259> forth<00:02:12.920> okay<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:13.980> I've<00:02:14.220> back<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.760> doubt

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
and so forth okay so I've back in doubt

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.990 
and so forth okay so I've back in doubt
and<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.800> cleaned<00:02:17.040> out<00:02:17.130> most<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.489> big<00:02:17.670> stuff<00:02:17.849> my

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and I cleaned out most of big stuff my

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.750 
and I cleaned out most of big stuff my
vacuum<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.540> acting<00:02:18.900> up<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:20.340> does<00:02:20.520> need<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
vacuum is acting up so it does need to
