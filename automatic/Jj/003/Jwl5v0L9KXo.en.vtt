00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.330
 Today I am widely Nanamir brother 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.000
 I bought medias wp 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:18.869
 It 's a similar deployment that you took with another android device a year ago 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.910
 From now on , I hope that I can play with this terminal a little and introduce how to use it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.130
 I think 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:31.660
 That's why I came in from this DoCoMo summer model this time 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:36.400
 I would like to introduce a guy called docomo palette ui 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:40.120
 I was accustomed to the normal ui of android and not a me until now 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:46.870
 It is such an ordinary feeling specifically weak 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.309
 You can actually go back to those who want to support the media 8 When you open the setting menu is in the lower left 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:55.360
 Open the menu 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:01:00.140
 Press the home screen switching button located in the Settings tab here at home Osu thing 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.909
 Therefore usually docomo's android ui's 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.600
 You can buy it, and the so- called android ui is like this screen 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.510
 Below 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 Phone is a menu browser 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.790
 so 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:23.670
 If you are a google galaxy or something like this you can change the button below 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.030
 In principle, I can not go back here. This arrangement is the standard of this android. 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.760
 It is part 1 where ui is not cool 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:38.200
 In that, installed apps are lined up in a row, so I want to start myself 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.770
 It is another drawback that it is difficult to know where the app is located 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.770
 Because 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.960
 It is said that the victory 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.470
 By say 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.340
 It is this docomo palette ui that can eliminate that I feel after 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.600
 I am 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.040
 So always use this app whenever you press the home button on this app 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.980
 Start this guy by saying 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.630
 And it has now come back to this screen this guy say whether they put something 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:08.989
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:14.150
 Toka media and the guy that was set up like I do is I, for example, it is possible to set the tab 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:19.790
 I have put a life log and say that the application of the contents of the classification of the ah is subtle 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.620
 I'm thinking of organizing it from now on, and it's about the future 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:28.260
 I thought I could not add tabs 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.940
 I can add it to the moon by myself, and I think that this is cool because it can be added with color 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.629
 The reason I have 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.310
 android I will put a lot of apps by all means 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.780
 I often miss that 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.810
 I think I do not know any good use 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.880
 Toka or was in addition, for example Galaxy 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:50.590
 For example, if it is ipad, up to 16 icons can be displayed in one screen of this menu. 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.040
 And do you to accept or but one of the separator to say Well so fits in neatly to 16 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.050
 Or 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.650
 This pretty love for me personally because the sort is also say quite troublesome and selfish 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.819
 is 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.200
 In place and another pond this 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:09.549
 You can replace or send out the application this minute 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.439
 This is probably the same as Galaxy or ipad iphone 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:20.060
 You can do it in one place where you can put the app in a line below 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:24.220
 Guy has become in such a way that they are displayed in here say goes here to use 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:28.150
 So this is up to three for docomo palette ui 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.050
 Probably it is Galaxy but probably 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:37.950
 I'm thinking of three galaxy tab but I think it was only three 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:41.880
 In the case of iphone or so, there are four or so, so let's squeeze three around that four 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.390
 I think the kana only get 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.760
 By the way, if you say so ipad can register about six, so the screen is large 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:52.019
 The width seems to be large indeed 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:56.040
 Well this docomo palette ui first I bought first 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:04:00.989
 Was released I thought Wow Utoshi how to use Wakan'ne 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.360
 However , what is wrong with this is that this 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:09.810
 It is tab organization of the menu screen 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:12.060
 Specifically, if you want to add to Let For example, this tab newly take a look at how to use the lower right corner of the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.210
 Let's press the menu button 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.750
 Group added search list display 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:23.380
 Can you see the group addition search list display 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:28.150
 Here Press the group added that comes out is that the main Settings app information 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:32.120
 Let's fall down and come out with please add the group name 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.150
 For example, 8 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.150
 bdae 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:43.249
 bda 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.020
 At the bottom and through okay to sell bought the 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:50.400
 This will add a tab called video 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:55.139
 Yes, this tab can be added to the moon by yourself 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.210
 You can sort it like this by long press on 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.440
 Please be gone and brought to their favorite position 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:06.560
 It is also this 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:13.040
 You can change the color and the tab Press and hold Apparently I This is in fine bone is difficult 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:17.720
 Press and hold and move up and down to move mode, so long press and press 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.470
 The name as long as it is well I'd a place of quite difficult bone that Tteyuu no 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.430
 Change 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.750
 I will delete something so 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.750
 You can change the color 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.689
 Let's change the color 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.639
 Like this 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:34.700
 I also pressed for a long time, for example, I got the media oops wrong 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.740
 Good 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:42.340
 If you want to add an excellent face to your home 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:46.660
 Application folder itself is doing this it is and press will continue to enter here 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.280
 I think it's pretty cool to have a shortcut here 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.600
 To Chinami 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:57.520
 Icon registered at home I want to register like now Now is good 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:02.200
 You can delete by holding down and holding down 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:05.689
 If it is a delete icon or application even if long press it as it is Ann 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:09.349
 It will come out after the installer, so it would be nice to use it 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:11.860
 By the way, personally, the place where this uninstall icon comes out is also a good place 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:16.930
 I think after 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.639
 Now add the favorite to tag yourself in this kind of feeling 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:24.729
 It went wrong husband 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:28.150
 I think it is a very good feature that you can add and edit your favorite children . 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:32.770
 If you have been using that android by all means 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:35.090
 Please try using While you might expect an Na pretty wood Sea not accustomed 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.380
 I thought it was worthwhile 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:44.930
 I think this is a function that should be inside of docomo unique 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:48.860
 Also for the first time this child's function in the form of being bought an android smartphone this time 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:53.540
 It is so cool that there are many times no one is a terminal 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.110
 In or who are thought to have or change in the future to Um other carriers had better not get used to this 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.590
 May 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:05.120
 Because of such it might be better to go in the way of normal android standard 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:05.120
 Because just Well convenient I personally thought that I wonder if not it nice that use it 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.990
 By the way, nowhere was the introduction of ui palette 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:19.790
 I think I did not expect at all in the way Bokkoredoko also Barre say 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:25.130
 So I was thinking of buying an f 01 f android terminal 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:30.490
 If you think about this, you should buy a terminal that has a ui palette everywhere. 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.490
 Than I think maybe to have a terminal of f their own ui 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:39.120
 Is better to buy a look at the Well of I mean if easy to use it from the try to touch once 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.960
 I think that is 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.960
 Where say
