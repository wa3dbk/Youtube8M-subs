00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.859
 so here it is not necessary to do because you 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.070
 look like a jerk when you do it 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:33.010
 never grow hair like u 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.720
 me because then you will think i 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.760
 such a rocker and all for thinking what you 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.480
 rocker in fact they are rocker and i 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.629
 I just too lazy to cut off their hair to 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.970
 i really just feel sorry for one more 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.460
 common mistake when you sit 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.329
 and play something spiritual 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.329
 eg 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.920
 can not sit stone face imagine 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.920
 which played exactly the same thing . 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.009
 well, what is more like I think that 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.170
 first so when playing guitar 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.750
 or on any other instrument you though 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.329
 would just for a start just 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.490
 try to be labeled there 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.270
 it looks much better than sitting with 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.860
 stone face and just fingering not 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.569
 one more aspect when you learn 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.909
 play despite the vulture you still 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.070
 use this advantage imagine 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.200
 if my whole vlog was like that 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.970
 I think you would be uninteresting to watch 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.410
 so when we already learned 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.600
 more or less play there in spite of the 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.619
 vulture you already use it and not 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.880
 look down no further shake your hand 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.880
 like an asshole for example 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.570
 you're not a cool guitar player you are only 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.850
 novice guitarist so don't shake 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.660
 by hand 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.030
 the guitarist is allowed to do it fresh 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.660
 because it is a stage reception and when 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.560
 you bought yourself a guitar for 2200 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.560
 and start shaking portray yourself 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.720
 cool it sees it cool fill 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.570
 hands before playing guitar 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.720
 must be clean itself must be 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.910
 clean and everything should be clean 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.850
 plectrum clean all you have is all 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.120
 wash this you will look like freaks 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.480
 with a dirty instrument the attitude will be 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.330
 poured all sorts of fat I do not know the mane 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.850
 will be a lot of fat too and in general 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.000
 everywhere roger fingerprints and you 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:03.570
 calculate and run to jail all forgot about 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.580
 this is my hands and everything and the guitar 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.980
 keep clean 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.230
 if you signed up for music school 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.780
 you do not think that you immediately became cool 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.930
 guitarist and can go out to the yard and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.830
 explain boys with pivasik how to play 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.190
 eg 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.230
 yard chords thieves if you 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.320
 enrolled in music school you 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.840
 nothingness and you do not know how so 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.880
 what not to show off even movements 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.810
 who lives in the next doorway what are you 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.760
 can play 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.810
 learn first and then only 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.250
 show off 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.090
 so at least save your name 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.700

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.100
