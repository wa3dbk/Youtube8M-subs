gonna going to give us a tough time and
you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.809> based<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.230> last<00:00:40.410> year<00:00:40.680> we've<00:00:41.129> got<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
you know based on last year we've got to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.819 
you know based on last year we've got to
try<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.629> minimize<00:00:43.110> their<00:00:43.440> chances

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
try and you know minimize their chances

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.799 
try and you know minimize their chances
and<00:00:44.040> grab<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> couple<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.420> can<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and grab a couple of we can and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.830 
and grab a couple of we can and
hopefully<00:00:46.070> make<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.309> less<00:00:47.430> exciting<00:00:47.969> second

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
hopefully make it a less exciting second

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.750 
hopefully make it a less exciting second
leg<00:00:48.989> than<00:00:49.140> always<00:00:49.350> rushing<00:00:49.739> last<00:00:50.460> year<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
leg than always rushing last year you

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
leg than always rushing last year you
guys<00:00:50.879> came<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:52.110> goal<00:00:52.289> advantage

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
guys came in with one goal advantage

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
guys came in with one goal advantage
this<00:00:52.949> year<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.430> guys<00:00:53.550> have<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.090> two-goal

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this year you guys have a two-goal

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
this year you guys have a two-goal
advantage<00:00:54.629> does<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.500> factor<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
advantage does that factor in at all to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.000 
advantage does that factor in at all to
how<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.910> guys<00:00:57.090> approached<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> match<00:00:57.780> no<00:00:58.739> no

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
how you guys approached the match no no

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.590 
how you guys approached the match no no
enough<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.879> think<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> mean<00:01:00.420> we're

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
enough I don't think so I mean we're

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.630 
enough I don't think so I mean we're
gonna<00:01:00.690> approach<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.949> similarly<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
gonna approach it I think similarly to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.899 
gonna approach it I think similarly to
the<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.480> did<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.750> Vancouver<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.909> no

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the way we did in Vancouver and no

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.359 
the way we did in Vancouver and no
trying<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.350> said<00:01:07.409> minimize<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.010> chances

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
trying as I said minimize the chances

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.690 
trying as I said minimize the chances
and<00:01:08.580> play<00:01:09.090> an<00:01:09.150> attacking<00:01:09.450> style<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
and play an attacking style and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.859 
and play an attacking style and
hopefully<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.420> keep<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:12.720> from

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
hopefully we can we can keep them from

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
hopefully we can we can keep them from
scoring<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.350> Nick<00:01:13.619> Nick<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.159> ourselves<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
scoring and Nick Nick one ourselves and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
scoring and Nick Nick one ourselves and
make<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> easy<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.479> ourselves<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.020> saw<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
make it easy on ourselves I saw the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.310 
make it easy on ourselves I saw the
performance<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> first<00:01:17.670> leg<00:01:18.140> how<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
performance for the first leg how do you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
performance for the first leg how do you
guys<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.650> into<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> second<00:01:20.280> leg<00:01:20.400> yeah<00:01:21.330> we<00:01:21.479> just

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
guys go into the second leg yeah we just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.499 
guys go into the second leg yeah we just
got<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> take<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.340> like<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.520> halftime<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
got to take it as like it's halftime and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.260 
got to take it as like it's halftime and
it's<00:01:25.110> pretty<00:01:25.680> much<00:01:25.799> 00<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
it's pretty much 00 you know if we go in

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.770 
it's pretty much 00 you know if we go in
there<00:01:27.450> thinking<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.680> got<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.830> good<00:01:29.040> lead

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
there thinking that we got a good lead

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.880 
there thinking that we got a good lead
it<00:01:30.780> could<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.020> problem<00:01:31.350> for<00:01:31.500> us<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.860> know

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it could be problem for us you know

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.550 
it could be problem for us you know
because<00:01:32.430> once<00:01:32.909> once<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.229> were<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> get<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
because once once if they were to get a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.030 
because once once if they were to get a
goal<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.770> us

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
goal on us

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.590 
goal on us
and<00:01:36.130> we're<00:01:36.310> not<00:01:36.460> we're<00:01:36.760> not<00:01:36.790> attacking<00:01:37.210> and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
and we're not we're not attacking and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.230 
and we're not we're not attacking and
playing<00:01:37.840> playing<00:01:38.320> our<00:01:38.500> style<00:01:38.800> then<00:01:39.120> we<00:01:40.120> could

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
playing playing our style then we could

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.440 
playing playing our style then we could
lose<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.480> lot<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.780> momentum<00:01:41.790> how<00:01:42.790> important<00:01:43.300> is

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
lose a lot of momentum how important is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.750 
lose a lot of momentum how important is
the<00:01:43.630> next<00:01:43.660> goal<00:01:44.050> oh<00:01:44.260> it's<00:01:45.040> huge<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.550> know<00:01:45.580> if

not<00:03:59.990> really<00:04:00.350> I'm<00:04:01.160> expecting<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.910> very<00:04:02.090> tough

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
not really I'm expecting a very tough

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.410 
not really I'm expecting a very tough
game<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:02.810> we<00:04:02.930> prepare<00:04:03.380> for<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.270> we<00:04:05.270> would

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
game and we prepare for that we would

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.240 
game and we prepare for that we would
have<00:04:05.660> done<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.290> pretty<00:04:06.650> much<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.010> same<00:04:07.190> way

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
have done it to pretty much the same way

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.130 
have done it to pretty much the same way
with<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.790> 1<00:04:08.540> goalie<00:04:08.960> tour<00:04:10.150> or<00:04:11.150> even<00:04:11.540> at<00:04:11.690> all<00:04:11.960> I

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
with a 1 goalie tour or even at all I

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.600 
with a 1 goalie tour or even at all I
think<00:04:12.380> we<00:04:12.470> would<00:04:12.590> have<00:04:12.650> started<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.250> game<00:04:13.400> in

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
think we would have started the game in

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.690 
think we would have started the game in
a<00:04:13.700> similar<00:04:14.000> way<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:15.230> but<00:04:15.770> having<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.400> two<00:04:16.549> goal

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
a similar way but but having a two goal

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.970 
a similar way but but having a two goal
lead<00:04:16.760> it's<00:04:17.180> great<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.720> know<00:04:17.780> it's<00:04:18.110> but<00:04:18.830> it's

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
lead it's great you know it's but it's

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.800 
lead it's great you know it's but it's
nothing<00:04:19.190> we<00:04:19.400> can<00:04:19.670> sleep<00:04:19.880> on<00:04:20.060> but<00:04:20.330> it's<00:04:20.480> good<00:04:20.690> to

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
nothing we can sleep on but it's good to

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.450 
nothing we can sleep on but it's good to
know<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:20.959> we<00:04:21.290> have<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:21.620> this<00:04:22.160> year<00:04:22.340> they're
