think<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:23.390> out<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> window<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:26.390> think<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
think is out the window I think is a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.670 
think is out the window I think is a
demon<00:01:28.460> he<00:01:29.460> probably<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.630> also<00:01:31.229> claiming

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
demon he probably it's also claiming

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.130 
demon he probably it's also claiming
that<00:01:31.920> zareff<00:01:32.430> created<00:01:33.090> Natsu<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.689> i<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:34.020> is

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that zareff created Natsu but i think is

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.390 
that zareff created Natsu but i think is
a<00:01:34.170> demon<00:01:34.799> he<00:01:35.520> probably<00:01:36.180> would<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.689> been

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
a demon he probably would have been

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.569 
a demon he probably would have been
adult<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.640> begin<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.950> i<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.280> that's

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
adult to begin with so i think that's

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.240 
adult to begin with so i think that's
kind<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.150> out<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> window<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.649> well<00:01:46.040> zeref<00:01:47.040> new
