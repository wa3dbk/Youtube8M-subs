the great thing I think about an

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.199 
the great thing I think about an
all-women's<00:02:31.800> trip<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.730> comfort

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
all-women's trip is just the comfort

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.120 
all-women's trip is just the comfort
level<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:33.989> there's<00:02:34.770> something

level that you have there's something

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.460

really<00:02:35.870> comforting<00:02:36.870> about<00:02:36.989> being<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.440> a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
really comforting about being with a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.350 
really comforting about being with a
group<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.860> women<00:02:38.069> it's<00:02:38.489> some<00:02:38.700> how<00:02:38.849> we<00:02:38.880> relate

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360
