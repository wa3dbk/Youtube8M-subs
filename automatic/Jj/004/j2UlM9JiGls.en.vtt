00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.620
 that plan 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.610
 to my way of seeing what distinguishes the clamor efe all those actors that are 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.349
 climb to a stage 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.299
 and they are with him public 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.319
 and show them something that is happening here 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.380
 an action that occurs at this moment on stage 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.329
 the province 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.630
 the rest 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.140
 I would say that 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.890
 the Ethiopian 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.680
 that is to say that a clear 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.790
 he is an idiot 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.010
 and I say it with all the love 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.300
 without taking away the word 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 a little bit too much julieta cassone time 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.520
 on the other hand, explaining is in some way 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.540
 the important thing 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.910
 what 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.660
 chaves and his home to a stage 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.310
 and show 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.430
 in front of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.060
 in fact in front of a pub 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.220
 and it is that all 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.040
 let's recognize it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.230
 we are a little heller 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.510
 and we know it and we have it very present because it is something that we try to combine 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.090
 before others the leading and singular sub-account 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.870
 it's hard for us to be seen as iliac 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.870
 China must be improved invent to annihilate 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.840
 but we realize that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.980
 no matter how much musicians grow, we seek to learn 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.550
 there are always going to be things that we face 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.460
 why 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.530
 we won them are Haitian nonsense because there are things we did not know about 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.780
 singer 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.539
 because because for some things well and we are going to do it 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.260
 scientific 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.330
 as I said before 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.570
 We disguise and try to hide it 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.900
 and it is logical interest 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.120
 but nevertheless 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.400
 someone 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.500
 someone like us 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.850
 iata 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.009
 but many other things and since on the one hand and on the other hand adult explains the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.520
 leader to get on stage to show ix cross and Carmen 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.489
 overwhelming generosity 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.529
 LiÃ©dson and 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.389
 and we feel 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.249
 we feel happy 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.819
 the fact that someone 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.199
 there is more 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.269
 justin impact 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.269
 without power 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.069
 and we love you 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.469
 I can explain that the axis 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.469
 because he is giving us something very difficult 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.199
 to show 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.199
 this idiot part 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.599
 that's clear 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.939
 hopefully 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.159
 for 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.159
 please 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.410
 please 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.859
 morning 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.509
 one
