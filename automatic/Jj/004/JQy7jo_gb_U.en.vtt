00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.500
 the wave cord commonly called 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.509
 badaro in English offers the possibility 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.820
 to develop endurance effectively 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.840
 muscle of the upper limbs when 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.820
 from sequences to expenses they will be 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.880
 solicited the cardiovascular system 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.680
 anaerobic the deep muscles of the co fr 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.109
 that the grip force for not 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.610
 name that those there 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.149
 we suggest in the first place to 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.969
 people 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.890
 another question given but crafty at the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.899
 times the action of the sheets to engage 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.360
 effectively the muscles of the corner and 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.980
 stabilize your posture and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.899
 parameters to take into account for 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.250
 adjust the intensity are both 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.840
 the study of movement 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.840
 it's that lowering costs 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.850
 it 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.740
 for this second exercise you center 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.560
 significantly both 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.990
 superficial and deep abdominals public 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.480
 in addition to your back and leveaux will be 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.400
 kept both the functions and 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.400
 abdominal engineers for the solution 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.460
 also be sure to keep the place 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.920
 columns in extension all along the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.190
 movements I talked about the basin a little to 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.690
 the way to stabilize also 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:36.260
 no possible your belt 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:38.210
 scapular and siberia for him the 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.560
 recharge is far from the axis of force and 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.140
 the more difficult it will be 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.000
 in this rising version causing the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.550
 ice rink is particularly fast 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.030
 in the efforts and easily at the level 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.030
