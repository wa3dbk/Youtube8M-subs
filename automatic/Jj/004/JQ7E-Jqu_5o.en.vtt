00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.820
 in the history of the ranch of the 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:27.400
 guamuchilito where they opened their beginnings 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.710
 it does not end hard always since very young 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.710
 humble was the friend who loves them lokarri 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.070
 now they tell the stories that lived 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:44.130
 there are things from scratch the two lines 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.130
 keys 727 I liked going back with you 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.390
 I remember that it came to mind 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.870
 give me a forgetting trip but here I 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 rail 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.800
 and between false stories follow the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.800
 stories that was not forgotten 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.760
 My operations and the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.920
 ranch we left the money always 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.900
 attracts problems and violent us 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.900
 we did because that's how the lanes are 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:24.650
 the witnesses who knew he was wearing 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:24.650
 they respected the friend I live and this band 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.600
 carmen pÃ©rez 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.210
 although the weather is the sierra de ojinaga 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.370
 when we all started we learned that 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.410
 the power is in the streets and suddenly 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.410
 He looks at me with my people and arms 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.479
 also the company puts the reins to 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.470
 people do not pay it like I did my 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.670
 needs 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.670
 I learned to spend money 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.200
 I had luxuries and special things 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.840
 women that I want the most I wash 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.840
 relief 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.349
 and in the music and all the attention to 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.480
 the people I love the most 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:18.849
 we tell them until we get tired 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.580
 and we bought songs from 200 to 300 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.860
 weekly and those talk about millions no 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.860
 They are pears or melons 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.480
 and in Colombia Pablo always waits for it and 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.480
 he faced the lords 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.239
 although I say it with great pleasure 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.239
 tenth we begin
