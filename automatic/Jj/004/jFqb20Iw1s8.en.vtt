typical of a situation where you have a

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.510 
typical of a situation where you have a
checkout<00:00:23.820> counter<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.870> you<00:00:25.140> stand<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.920> any

work with customers and you put the cash
register<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300

paying of the dry cleaning and the

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.530 
paying of the dry cleaning and the
problem<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.520> you're<00:00:32.640> standing<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.360> long

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
problem is if you're standing a long

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.720 
problem is if you're standing a long
period<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.079> time<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.829> puts<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.190> lot<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.399> stress

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
period of time it puts a lot of stress

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.340 
period of time it puts a lot of stress
on<00:00:35.970> your<00:00:36.059> back<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.720> what<00:00:36.870> they've<00:00:37.020> done<00:00:37.170> is

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
on your back and so what they've done is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.750 
on your back and so what they've done is
they've<00:00:37.470> got<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.800> anti-fatigue<00:00:38.250> mats

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.420 
they've got these anti-fatigue mats
which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> great<00:00:39.989> idea<00:00:40.040> but<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> thing<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
which is a great idea but the thing is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.280 
which is a great idea but the thing is
it's<00:00:41.699> still<00:00:41.970> really<00:00:42.329> hard<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.750> stand<00:00:43.050> all<00:00:43.260> day

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it's still really hard to stand all day

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's still really hard to stand all day
it<00:00:43.500> puts<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> lot<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.949> stress<00:00:44.220> on<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.489> feet

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420 
it puts a lot of stress on your feet
knees<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.390> low<00:00:45.540> back<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:47.250> we've<00:00:47.400> been

the<00:00:54.059> pump<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.480> those<00:00:54.659> is<00:00:54.870> when<00:00:55.079> you're

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the pump with those is when you're

Canada called in Virgo accessories and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.350 
Canada called in Virgo accessories and
this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> called<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.890> spine<00:01:14.280> saber<00:01:14.670> saddle

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
this is called a spine saber saddle

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.230 
this is called a spine saber saddle
chair<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.350> looks<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> saddles<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
chair and it looks like a saddles and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.630 
chair and it looks like a saddles and
what<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.690> do<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.710> sit<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
what you do with it is you sit on it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.450 
what you do with it is you sit on it
like<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> idea<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.860> opens<00:01:23.280> up

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
like this and the idea is it opens up

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
like this and the idea is it opens up
your<00:01:23.670> legs<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.060> little<00:01:24.090> bit<00:01:24.330> which<00:01:24.960> lowers<00:01:25.259> your

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
your legs a little bit which lowers your

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.180 
your legs a little bit which lowers your
pelvis<00:01:25.830> forward<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.460> allows<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> sit

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
pelvis forward and allows you to sit

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.520 
pelvis forward and allows you to sit
upright<00:01:28.760> position<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:29.840> also<00:01:29.990> has<00:01:30.350> an

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
upright position but it also has an

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.440 
upright position but it also has an
extended<00:01:31.010> cylinder<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.790> comes<00:01:32.000> way<00:01:32.270> up

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
extended cylinder so it comes way up

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.290 
extended cylinder so it comes way up
here<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.110> now<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:33.530> can<00:01:33.770> get<00:01:33.920> really<00:01:34.310> close<00:01:34.760> to

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
here and now you can get really close to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.900 
here and now you can get really close to
the<00:01:35.780> counter<00:01:36.410> so<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:37.130> doesn't<00:01:37.460> matter<00:01:37.670> that

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
the counter so it doesn't matter that

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.880 
the counter so it doesn't matter that
there's<00:01:38.150> no<00:01:38.330> leg<00:01:38.570> space<00:01:38.840> here<00:01:39.170> because<00:01:39.770> you

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
there's no leg space here because you

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.710 
there's no leg space here because you
can<00:01:40.040> slide<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.550> in<00:01:40.640> here
