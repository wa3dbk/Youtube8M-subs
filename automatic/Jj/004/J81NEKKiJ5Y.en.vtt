00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it's something that does not happen

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.569 
it's something that does not happen
nearly<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.829> particular<00:01:41.130> record

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
reason for that is because this is

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.700 
reason for that is because this is
abandons<00:01:45.780> moving<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.259> little<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:46.560> more

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
abandons moving in a little bit more

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.480 
abandons moving in a little bit more
mature<00:01:46.979> direction<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.060> had<00:01:48.299> cited<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
mature direction as I had cited and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.940 
mature direction as I had cited and
really<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.820> cannot<00:01:51.270> necessarily<00:01:51.770> use<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
really you cannot necessarily use the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.980 
really you cannot necessarily use the
formula<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.700> you've<00:01:53.939> used<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.420> five

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
formula that you've used now for five

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.499 
formula that you've used now for five
records<00:01:55.350> each<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> every<00:01:56.759> time<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.329> each

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
records each and every time with each

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.990 
records each and every time with each
and<00:01:57.689> every<00:01:57.899> song<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.560> quite<00:01:59.009> frankly<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
and every song because quite frankly it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.639 
and every song because quite frankly it
becomes<00:02:00.299> relatively<00:02:00.750> predictable<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
becomes relatively predictable and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.889 
becomes relatively predictable and
ultimately<00:02:02.579> will<00:02:02.969> bring<00:02:03.180> down<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> score<00:02:03.810> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
ultimately will bring down the score of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.590 
ultimately will bring down the score of
a<00:02:03.960> collective<00:02:04.350> album<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.979> well<00:02:05.600> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
a collective album because well you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.479 
a collective album because well you
heard<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.110> before<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> problem

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
heard it all before and it's a problem

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.309 
heard it all before and it's a problem
that<00:02:08.640> I've<00:02:08.940> seen<00:02:09.239> with<00:02:09.479> some<00:02:09.720> records<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.229> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
that I've seen with some records in the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.020 
that I've seen with some records in the
past<00:02:10.530> that

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
past that

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.970

definitely noted for you guys and
whenever<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.520> heard<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.910> all<00:02:14.000> before<00:02:14.120> that's

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
whenever you heard it all before that's

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.500 
whenever you heard it all before that's
just<00:02:14.870> not<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> good<00:02:15.440> thing<00:02:16.090> would<00:02:17.090> take<00:02:17.120> care

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
just not a good thing would take care

the big negatives that I do have for

the big negatives that I do have for
this<00:03:24.709> record<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.610> building<00:03:26.030> blocks

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
this record is that the building blocks

that they kind of make which would

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.590 
that they kind of make which would
traditionally<00:03:28.370> lead<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:28.940> that<00:03:29.030> crescendo

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.880 
phantom drone metal to a certain extent
this<00:03:41.720> really<00:03:42.049> shouldn't<00:03:42.320> bother<00:03:42.500> me<00:03:42.739> all<00:03:42.859> that

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
this really shouldn't bother me all that

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.590 
this really shouldn't bother me all that
much<00:03:43.220> but<00:03:43.430> I've<00:03:43.549> met<00:03:43.790> but<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.030> noticed<00:03:44.420> that

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
much but I've met but I noticed that

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.090 
much but I've met but I noticed that
with<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:44.870> particular<00:03:45.019> record<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.799> kind<00:03:46.010> of

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
with this particular record it kind of

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.640 
with this particular record it kind of
did<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.519> sort<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.480> wears<00:03:47.750> on<00:03:47.989> your<00:03:48.140> patience<00:03:48.590> a

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
did it sort of wears on your patience a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.140 
did it sort of wears on your patience a
little<00:03:48.890> bit<00:03:49.010> especially<00:03:49.310> whenever<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.970> know

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
little bit especially whenever you know

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.840 
little bit especially whenever you know
with<00:03:50.329> the<00:03:50.359> band<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:50.780> capable<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.470> by<00:03:52.250> examining

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
with the band is capable of by examining

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.240 
with the band is capable of by examining
their<00:03:53.030> history<00:03:53.420> very<00:03:53.630> closely<00:03:53.989> on<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.739> musical

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
their history very closely on a musical

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.610 
their history very closely on a musical
level<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:56.359> this<00:03:56.630> is<00:03:56.780> something<00:03:56.989> we're<00:03:57.350> at

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
level so this is something we're at

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.770 
level so this is something we're at
certain<00:03:58.310> points<00:03:58.730> it<00:03:58.880> does<00:03:59.150> tend<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.600> get<00:03:59.720> a

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
certain points it does tend to get a

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.930 
certain points it does tend to get a
little<00:04:00.019> bit<00:04:00.260> monotonous<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.920> tedious<00:04:01.760> it

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
little bit monotonous and tedious it

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.539 
little bit monotonous and tedious it
