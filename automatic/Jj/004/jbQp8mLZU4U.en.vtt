00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
worry about breaking the chain the axle

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.740 
worry about breaking the chain the axle
goes<00:00:11.099> through<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> wheel<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:11.820> once<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.570> pull

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
goes through the wheel and once you pull

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.270 
goes through the wheel and once you pull
the<00:00:12.780> axle<00:00:13.139> out<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.349> wheel<00:00:13.500> can<00:00:13.679> drop<00:00:13.860> down<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the axle out the wheel can drop down and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.829 
the axle out the wheel can drop down and
you<00:00:14.340> can<00:00:14.460> just<00:00:14.490> pop<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.179> know<00:00:15.389> move<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
you can just pop it you know move the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.660 
you can just pop it you know move the
chain<00:00:16.049> off<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> side<00:00:17.010> get<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.250> wheel<00:00:17.430> out

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
chain off to the side get the wheel out

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.800 
chain off to the side get the wheel out
and<00:00:17.850> then<00:00:17.970> put<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.240> back<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.539> when<00:00:18.660> you're

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and then put it back in when you're

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.420 
and then put it back in when you're
ready<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.529> that's<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.130> thing<00:00:20.279> when

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
ready so that's the first thing when

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.519 
ready so that's the first thing when
you're<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> newbie<00:00:20.880> now<00:00:21.270> second<00:00:21.960> thing<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you're a newbie now second thing is and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.570 
you're a newbie now second thing is and
the<00:00:22.590> main<00:00:22.740> reason<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.039> making<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.310> videos

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the main reason I'm making this videos

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.740 
the main reason I'm making this videos
for<00:00:23.789> me<00:00:25.460> when<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.490> pull<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> axle<00:00:27.269> out<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
for me when you pull the axle out the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.759 
for me when you pull the axle out the
wheel<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> whole<00:00:28.529> bunch<00:00:28.680> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
wheel is going to have a whole bunch of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.439 
wheel is going to have a whole bunch of
little<00:00:28.949> spacers<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:30.210> there's<00:00:30.390> some

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
little spacers in it so there's some

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.959 
little spacers in it so there's some
little<00:00:30.689> spacers<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.920> then<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
little spacers in here and then on the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.459 
little spacers in here and then on the
brake<00:00:33.270> side<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.950> brake<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:36.809> riding<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
brake side the brake is riding on the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.910 
brake side the brake is riding on the
axle<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.579> little<00:00:38.820> spacer<00:00:39.920> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
axle on this on this little spacer and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590 
axle on this on this little spacer and
there's<00:00:41.070> other<00:00:41.460> spacers<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.420> before

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
there's other spacers in here so before

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.090 
there's other spacers in here so before
you<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.110> anything<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.590> want<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> take<00:00:43.920> some

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
you do anything you want to take some

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.650 
you do anything you want to take some
pictures<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.610> shoot<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:44.879> video<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.480> exactly

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
pictures or shoot some video of exactly

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.420 
pictures or shoot some video of exactly
where<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> spacers<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.860> supposed<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> be

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
where all the spacers are supposed to be

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.709 
where all the spacers are supposed to be
because<00:00:47.760> once<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> pull<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.270> axle<00:00:48.629> out

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because once you pull that axle out

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.360 
because once you pull that axle out
everything<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> come<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:49.500> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
everything is just going to come out and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.590 
everything is just going to come out and
you<00:00:50.460> got<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> make<00:00:50.910> sure<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.120> put<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.420> in

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
you got to make sure you put it back in

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.580 
you got to make sure you put it back in
the<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:51.780> place<00:00:52.020> or<00:00:52.230> things<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.500> get

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the right place or things will get

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
the right place or things will get
squirrely<00:00:56.090> spinning<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> acts<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.629> bit

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
squirrely spinning the acts a little bit

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.430 
squirrely spinning the acts a little bit
helps<00:00:58.879> some<00:00:59.879> things<00:01:00.149> hit<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.420> floor<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.320> I'll

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
helps some things hit the floor so I'll

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.709 
helps some things hit the floor so I'll
get<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> app<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.010> halfway<00:01:02.219> out<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> then<00:01:03.510> just

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
get the app so halfway out and then just

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
get the app so halfway out and then just
kind<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> make<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> note<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.680> has<00:01:04.799> hit<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
kind of make a note of what has hit the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.000 
kind of make a note of what has hit the
floor<00:01:05.750> take<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> spacers<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.830> this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
floor take a look at the spacers on this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.760 
floor take a look at the spacers on this
side<00:01:08.220> then<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> keep<00:01:09.560> on<00:01:10.560> pulling<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:12.770> fail

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
side then kind of keep on pulling I fail

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.649 
side then kind of keep on pulling I fail
to<00:01:13.950> notice<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.310> they're<00:01:14.520> unlike<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to notice that they're unlike on a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.700 
to notice that they're unlike on a
street<00:01:15.960> bike<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.320> start<00:01:16.560> bike<00:01:16.740> has<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> big

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
street bike in start bike has this big

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
street bike in start bike has this big
chain<00:01:19.710> protector<00:01:20.220> thingy<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.900> I've<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
chain protector thingy that I've got to

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.910 
chain protector thingy that I've got to
remove<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:23.250> order<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> wheel<00:01:24.060> off

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
remove in order to get the wheel off

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.770 
remove in order to get the wheel off
alright<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.070> moving<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:27.150> don't<00:01:27.540> even<00:01:27.570> know

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
alright so moving the I don't even know

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.350 
alright so moving the I don't even know
if<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.930> thing<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.170> moving<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.119> chain<00:01:30.119> guide

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
if this thing is moving this chain guide

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.410 
if this thing is moving this chain guide
out<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.900> way<00:01:31.759> allows<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> wheel<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.210> drop

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
out of the way allows the wheel to drop

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
out of the way allows the wheel to drop
down<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.259> pop<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.710> put

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
down and then I can just pop it out put

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.950 
down and then I can just pop it out put
the<00:01:35.040> new<00:01:35.070> wheel

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.420 

this<00:01:41.960> way<00:01:42.230> if<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.890> want<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.130> switch<00:01:43.280> between

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
this way if I want to switch between

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.250 
this way if I want to switch between
tires<00:01:43.910> it's<00:01:44.270> just<00:01:44.450> easier<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.780> pop<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.110> wheel

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
tires it's just easier to pop the wheel

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.350 
tires it's just easier to pop the wheel
off<00:01:45.440> than<00:01:45.650> it<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:45.890> to<00:01:46.070> take<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.610> sand<00:01:46.880> tire<00:01:47.120> off

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
off than it is to take the sand tire off

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.580 
off than it is to take the sand tire off
and<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:47.660> every<00:01:47.900> time<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.170> want<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.320> go<00:01:48.440> in<00:01:48.530> the

and on every time you want to go in the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.750 
and on every time you want to go in the
sand<00:01:50.860> alright<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:51.920> put<00:01:52.160> a<00:01:52.190> little<00:01:52.340> grease<00:01:52.520> on

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
sand alright I put a little grease on

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.650 
sand alright I put a little grease on
the<00:01:53.120> spacer<00:01:54.310> from<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.550> old<00:01:55.700> wheel<00:01:56.030> put<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.540> on

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
the spacer from the old wheel put it on

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.680 
the spacer from the old wheel put it on
the<00:01:56.780> new<00:01:56.930> wheel<00:01:57.140> do<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:58.430> both<00:01:58.580> sides<00:01:58.690> your

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
the new wheel do that on both sides your

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.880 
the new wheel do that on both sides your
different<00:02:00.110> bikes<00:02:00.320> will<00:02:00.470> have<00:02:00.590> different

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
different bikes will have different

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.320 
different bikes will have different
types<00:02:01.040> of<00:02:01.190> spacers<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:01.790> one's<00:02:01.940> pretty<00:02:02.150> nice

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
types of spacers this one's pretty nice

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.660

and<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.680> same<00:02:03.890> on<00:02:04.100> both<00:02:04.130> sides<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.610> I

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
and it's the same on both sides so I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.830 
and it's the same on both sides so I
can't<00:02:04.910> screw<00:02:05.120> it<00:02:05.240> up<00:02:05.330> but<00:02:05.510> some<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.720> them<00:02:05.810> have

can't screw it up but some of them have
different<00:02:06.050> sizes<00:02:06.620> on<00:02:06.710> different<00:02:07.310> sides<00:02:07.490> to
