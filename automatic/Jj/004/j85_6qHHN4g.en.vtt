you're up or when you're throwing it it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.620 
you're up or when you're throwing it it
creates<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.400> movement<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.060> water<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.600> that

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
creates a movement in the water so that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.900 
creates a movement in the water so that
it<00:02:26.930> bass<00:02:27.440> cannot<00:02:27.830> feel<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.220> vibrations<00:02:28.790> in

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
it bass cannot feel the vibrations in

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.670 
it bass cannot feel the vibrations in
the<00:02:28.940> water<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.480> that's<00:02:29.930> pretty<00:02:30.230> cool<00:02:30.410> with<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
the water so that's pretty cool with the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.640 
the water so that's pretty cool with the
plastic<00:02:31.160> stand-up<00:02:31.580> back<00:02:31.820> tail<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:33.380> was<00:02:33.500> the

then here's the 10 inch let's do a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.979 
then here's the 10 inch let's do a
little<00:04:01.130> comparison<00:04:01.610> with<00:04:01.970> them<00:04:02.120> as<00:04:02.300> you<00:04:02.840> can

one but each one calls for different

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.010 
one but each one calls for different
situations<00:04:09.440> one<00:04:09.680> and<00:04:09.890> more<00:04:10.520> finicky<00:04:11.390> bite<00:04:11.750> or
