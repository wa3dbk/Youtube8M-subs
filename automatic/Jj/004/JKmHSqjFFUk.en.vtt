hey dr. Burke here in this video we're
going<00:00:03.429> to<00:00:03.519> talk<00:00:03.639> about<00:00:03.669> cramps<00:00:04.330> charley

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:04.870 
going to talk about cramps charley

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.840 
going to talk about cramps charley
horses<00:00:05.109> if<00:00:05.410> you<00:00:05.500> have<00:00:05.770> these<00:00:05.980> here<00:00:06.730> are<00:00:06.819> the

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
horses if you have these here are the

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.180 
horses if you have these here are the
causes<00:00:07.330> there's<00:00:07.509> four<00:00:07.870> main<00:00:08.290> causes<00:00:08.800> the

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
causes there's four main causes the

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.570 
causes there's four main causes the
number<00:00:09.400> one<00:00:09.730> cause<00:00:10.450> of<00:00:10.480> cramps<00:00:11.139> in<00:00:11.320> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
number one cause of cramps in the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.709 
number one cause of cramps in the
especially<00:00:12.580> when<00:00:12.820> you're<00:00:12.969> sleeping<00:00:13.389> at<00:00:13.509> night

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
especially when you're sleeping at night

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.890 
especially when you're sleeping at night
is<00:00:13.990> medication<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:15.309> side<00:00:15.610> effects<00:00:16.000> of<00:00:16.270> high

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
is medication the side effects of high

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.230 
is medication the side effects of high
blood<00:00:17.170> pressure<00:00:17.410> medication<00:00:18.189> also<00:00:18.970> high

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
blood pressure medication also high

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.140 
blood pressure medication also high
cholesterol<00:00:19.810> medication<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:20.619> also

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
cholesterol medication and also

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.349 
cholesterol medication and also
prednisone

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
prednisone

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.460 
prednisone
so<00:00:23.080> that<00:00:23.260> will<00:00:23.640> majorly<00:00:24.640> affect<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
so that will majorly affect the

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.410 
so that will majorly affect the
contraction<00:00:27.189> relaxation<00:00:27.760> of<00:00:27.880> your<00:00:27.939> muscles

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
contraction relaxation of your muscles

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.089 
contraction relaxation of your muscles
especially<00:00:28.689> at<00:00:28.990> night<00:00:29.170> so<00:00:29.679> that's<00:00:29.769> number<00:00:29.980> one

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
especially at night so that's number one

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.560 
especially at night so that's number one
number<00:00:30.939> two<00:00:31.090> too<00:00:32.020> much<00:00:32.680> calcium<00:00:33.570> calcium

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
number two too much calcium calcium

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.650 
number two too much calcium calcium
causes<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.440> contraction<00:00:36.370> of<00:00:36.490> muscles<00:00:37.030> now

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
causes the contraction of muscles now

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.170 
causes the contraction of muscles now
that<00:00:38.080> usually<00:00:38.470> comes<00:00:38.770> because<00:00:39.430> your<00:00:39.730> stomach

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
that usually comes because your stomach

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.180 
that usually comes because your stomach
is<00:00:40.510> off<00:00:40.840> if<00:00:41.020> you<00:00:41.140> have<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:41.260> lot<00:00:41.350> of<00:00:41.380> acid<00:00:41.800> reflux

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
is off if you have a lot of acid reflux

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.340 
is off if you have a lot of acid reflux
or<00:00:42.310> digestive<00:00:42.850> problems<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.810> means<00:00:44.140> you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
or digestive problems that means you

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.370 
or digestive problems that means you
don't<00:00:44.500> have<00:00:44.620> enough<00:00:45.480> acid<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:47.080> calcium

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
don't have enough acid and the calcium

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.150 
don't have enough acid and the calcium
doesn't<00:00:48.280> get<00:00:48.750> mobilized<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.140> so<00:00:50.740> that's<00:00:50.920> your

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
doesn't get mobilized and so that's your

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.230 
doesn't get mobilized and so that's your
going<00:00:51.310> to<00:00:51.370> end<00:00:51.460> up<00:00:51.490> having<00:00:51.730> too<00:00:51.850> much<00:00:51.940> calcium

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
going to end up having too much calcium

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.750 
going to end up having too much calcium
stuck<00:00:52.750> in<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.020> joints<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.650> all<00:00:53.770> that

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
stuck in the joints and all that

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.840 
stuck in the joints and all that
another<00:00:55.150> cause<00:00:55.420> would<00:00:55.690> be<00:00:55.720> taking<00:00:56.350> like<00:00:57.010> too

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
another cause would be taking like too

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.250 
another cause would be taking like too
many<00:00:57.970> calcium<00:00:58.600> supplements<00:00:59.110> that<00:00:59.140> are

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
many calcium supplements that are

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.260 
many calcium supplements that are
calcium<00:00:59.650> carbonate<00:01:00.250> that's<00:01:00.460> like<00:01:00.700> rocks

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
calcium carbonate that's like rocks

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.450 
calcium carbonate that's like rocks
you're<00:01:02.200> going<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.410> plug<00:01:02.800> up<00:01:02.830> things<00:01:03.190> let's<00:01:03.430> say

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
you're going to plug up things let's say

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.640 
you're going to plug up things let's say
you<00:01:03.550> want<00:01:03.700> to<00:01:03.760> prevent<00:01:04.030> osteoporosis<00:01:04.650> you're

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
you want to prevent osteoporosis you're

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.510 
you want to prevent osteoporosis you're
going<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.830> get<00:01:05.980> a<00:01:06.010> lot<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.220> crafts<00:01:06.430> because

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
going to get a lot of crafts because

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.860 
going to get a lot of crafts because
you're<00:01:06.700> taking<00:01:06.940> too<00:01:07.060> much<00:01:07.180> calcium<00:01:07.450> so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
you're taking too much calcium so

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.680 
you're taking too much calcium so
calcium<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:09.340> know<00:01:09.460> it<00:01:10.120> could<00:01:10.270> be<00:01:10.360> you're

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
calcium you know it could be you're

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.360 
calcium you know it could be you're
taking<00:01:10.990> too<00:01:11.110> much<00:01:11.260> vitamin<00:01:11.440> D<00:01:11.890> without

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
taking too much vitamin D without

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.970 
taking too much vitamin D without
divided<00:01:13.150> the<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:14.020> other<00:01:14.140> fats<00:01:14.440> like<00:01:14.590> vitamin

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
divided the the other fats like vitamin

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.720 
divided the the other fats like vitamin
k2<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:15.760> also<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:17.020> omega-3<00:01:17.500> fatty<00:01:17.710> acids<00:01:18.130> but

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
k2 and also the omega-3 fatty acids but

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.660 
k2 and also the omega-3 fatty acids but
too<00:01:19.180> much<00:01:19.330> calcium<00:01:19.690> because<00:01:20.590> calcium<00:01:20.680> always

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
too much calcium because calcium always

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.030 
too much calcium because calcium always
works<00:01:22.000> with<00:01:22.180> other<00:01:22.450> minerals<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.740> could

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
works with other minerals and it could

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.540 
works with other minerals and it could
be<00:01:24.250> too<00:01:25.050> you<00:01:26.050> don't<00:01:26.230> have<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.650> magnesium<00:01:26.980> to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
be too you don't have the magnesium to

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.060 
be too you don't have the magnesium to
transport<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:29.080> relate<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.409> calcium<00:01:29.920> so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
transport and to relate to calcium so

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.170 
transport and to relate to calcium so
you<00:01:30.580> always<00:01:30.880> want<00:01:31.510> to<00:01:31.600> take<00:01:31.930> these<00:01:32.440> minerals

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you always want to take these minerals

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.120 
you always want to take these minerals
together<00:01:34.180> especially<00:01:34.600> calcium<00:01:35.230> magnesium<00:01:35.350> so

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
together especially calcium magnesium so

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.670 
together especially calcium magnesium so
too<00:01:36.640> much<00:01:36.760> calcium<00:01:37.060> will<00:01:37.300> cause<00:01:37.480> it<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:37.840> then

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
too much calcium will cause it and then

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.070 
too much calcium will cause it and then
and<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:40.030> reason<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.300> bring<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.600> up<00:01:40.690> is<00:01:40.810> because

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
and the reason to bring it up is because

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.240 
and the reason to bring it up is because
if<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.290> have<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.440> cramp<00:01:41.710> and<00:01:41.830> you<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.070> take

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
if you have a cramp and you just take

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.030 
if you have a cramp and you just take
straight<00:01:42.520> calcium<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.150> might<00:01:43.360> make<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.630> worse

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
straight calcium it might make it worse

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.800 
straight calcium it might make it worse
number<00:01:45.040> three<00:01:45.250> to<00:01:45.850> little<00:01:46.240> magnesium

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
number three to little magnesium

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.020 
number three to little magnesium
magnesium<00:01:46.990> is<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.620> relaxation<00:01:48.280> mineral<00:01:48.880> of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
magnesium is the relaxation mineral of

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.360 
magnesium is the relaxation mineral of
the<00:01:49.540> muscle<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.170> that's<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.950> one<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.280> you

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
the muscle and that's the one that you

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.740 
the muscle and that's the one that you
really<00:01:51.400> want<00:01:51.790> to<00:01:51.909> take<00:01:52.060> if<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:52.330> have<00:01:52.360> cramps

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
really want to take if you have cramps

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.510 
really want to take if you have cramps
so<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.590> will<00:01:53.680> just<00:01:53.830> knock<00:01:53.979> it<00:01:54.130> out<00:01:54.220> like<00:01:54.340> that

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
so that will just knock it out like that

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.880 
so that will just knock it out like that
you<00:01:54.580> could<00:01:54.970> also<00:01:55.150> take<00:01:55.530> calcium<00:01:56.530> magnesium

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
you could also take calcium magnesium

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.460 
you could also take calcium magnesium
that<00:01:57.580> would<00:01:57.880> be<00:01:58.000> good<00:01:58.240> especially<00:01:58.960> if<00:01:59.229> it's<00:01:59.350> in

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
that would be good especially if it's in

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.680 
that would be good especially if it's in
a<00:01:59.560> 1<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.950> 1<00:01:59.979> ratio<00:02:00.370> because<00:02:01.270> that's<00:02:01.420> what<00:02:01.600> we

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
a 1 to 1 ratio because that's what we

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.310 
a 1 to 1 ratio because that's what we
need<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.770> fourth<00:02:03.100> cause<00:02:03.400> is<00:02:03.810> too<00:02:04.810> little

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
need and the fourth cause is too little

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.609 
need and the fourth cause is too little
potassium<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.549> because<00:02:07.479> potassium<00:02:08.140> also<00:02:08.289> is

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
potassium and because potassium also is

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.980 
potassium and because potassium also is
involved<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.220> muscle<00:02:09.729> contraction<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.450> that

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
involved in muscle contraction and that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.690 
involved in muscle contraction and that
would<00:02:11.200> come<00:02:11.590> from<00:02:11.860> not<00:02:12.040> eating<00:02:12.280> enough

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
would come from not eating enough

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.190 
would come from not eating enough
vegetables

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
vegetables

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.619 
vegetables
or<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.500> lot<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.980> stress<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.459> can<00:02:15.940> deplete<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
or a lot of stress that can deplete the

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.290 
or a lot of stress that can deplete the
potassium<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:17.819> don't<00:02:18.819> know<00:02:18.879> if<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.030> knew<00:02:19.150> this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
potassium I don't know if you knew this

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.690 
potassium I don't know if you knew this
but<00:02:19.360> our<00:02:20.080> bodies<00:02:20.470> need<00:02:20.650> about<00:02:20.860> 4700

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
but our bodies need about 4700

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.780 
but our bodies need about 4700
milligrams<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.150> potassium<00:02:22.239> every<00:02:22.989> single<00:02:23.470> day

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
milligrams of potassium every single day

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.850 
milligrams of potassium every single day
yeah<00:02:24.790> that's<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.209> seven<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.080> ten<00:02:26.379> cups<00:02:26.680> of

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
yeah that's like seven to ten cups of

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.440 
yeah that's like seven to ten cups of
vegetables<00:02:27.250> every<00:02:27.370> single<00:02:27.700> day<00:02:27.819> like<00:02:28.150> no

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
vegetables every single day like no

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.780 
vegetables every single day like no
one's<00:02:28.629> getting<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.560> no<00:02:29.739> wonder<00:02:30.069> they're

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
one's getting that so no wonder they're

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.759 
one's getting that so no wonder they're
deficient<00:02:31.030> potassium<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.989> also<00:02:32.290> if<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.590> add

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
deficient potassium and also if you add

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.250 
deficient potassium and also if you add
on<00:02:32.800> stress<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:34.090> will<00:02:34.239> deeply<00:02:34.420> deplete

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
on stress that will deeply deplete

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.440 
on stress that will deeply deplete
potassium<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.489> also<00:02:36.640> add<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
potassium and if you also add in the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.320 
potassium and if you also add in the
fact<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.810> sugar<00:02:38.470> depletes<00:02:38.860> potassium<00:02:39.550> no

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
fact that sugar depletes potassium no

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.619 
fact that sugar depletes potassium no
wonder<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.900> people<00:02:41.140> have<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.319> lot<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.530> cramps

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
wonder the people have a lot of cramps

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.180 
wonder the people have a lot of cramps
magnesium<00:02:43.629> comes<00:02:43.989> from<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> leafy<00:02:44.590> green<00:02:44.890> so

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
magnesium comes from the leafy green so

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.620 
magnesium comes from the leafy green so
again<00:02:45.489> if<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:45.760> those<00:02:46.180> vegetables

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
again if you have those vegetables

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.360 
again if you have those vegetables
you're<00:02:46.720> going<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.930> actually<00:02:47.170> kill<00:02:47.830> two<00:02:48.069> birds

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
you're going to actually kill two birds

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.180 
you're going to actually kill two birds
with<00:02:48.459> one<00:02:48.580> stone<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:50.170> I'm<00:02:50.410> not<00:02:50.709> saying<00:02:50.950> never

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
with one stone but I'm not saying never

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.069 
with one stone but I'm not saying never
have<00:02:51.459> calcium<00:02:51.819> like<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.480> should<00:02:52.660> have<00:02:52.690> some

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
have calcium like you should have some

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.430 
have calcium like you should have some
good<00:02:53.319> cheese<00:02:54.010> from<00:02:54.569> maybe<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.660> European<00:02:56.200> cheese

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
good cheese from maybe a European cheese

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.860 
good cheese from maybe a European cheese
or<00:02:56.709> grass-fed<00:02:57.099> cheese<00:02:57.400> or<00:02:57.730> some<00:02:58.299> dairy<00:02:58.599> like

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
or grass-fed cheese or some dairy like

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.020 
or grass-fed cheese or some dairy like
kefir<00:02:59.349> or<00:02:59.590> maybe<00:02:59.769> even<00:02:59.829> yogurt<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.760> would<00:03:00.940> be

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
kefir or maybe even yogurt that would be

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.970 
kefir or maybe even yogurt that would be
a<00:03:01.060> good<00:03:01.150> source<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.510> calcium<00:03:01.829> versus<00:03:02.829> just

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
a good source of calcium versus just

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.370 
a good source of calcium versus just
taking<00:03:03.310> pills<00:03:03.579> all<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.880> time<00:03:04.090> but<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:05.200> just

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
taking pills all the time but you just

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.370 
taking pills all the time but you just
want<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.680> look<00:03:05.769> at<00:03:05.980> these<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.459> potential

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
want to look at these as a potential

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.500 
want to look at these as a potential
cause<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.410> your<00:03:08.950> cramps<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:10.030> other<00:03:10.180> thing<00:03:10.390> is

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
cause of your cramps the other thing is

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.569 
cause of your cramps the other thing is
them<00:03:10.720> if<00:03:10.930> you're<00:03:11.230> if<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:12.010> take<00:03:12.220> apple<00:03:12.549> cider

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
them if you're if you take apple cider

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.729 
them if you're if you take apple cider
vinegar<00:03:12.900> you'll<00:03:13.900> make<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.319> body<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.620> little

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
vinegar you'll make the body a little

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.710 
vinegar you'll make the body a little
more<00:03:14.950> acidic<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.459> you'll<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:15.970> mobilize

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
more acidic and you'll really mobilize

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.530 
more acidic and you'll really mobilize
this<00:03:16.930> calcium<00:03:17.440> into<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.280> tissues<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.510> that

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
this calcium into the tissues so that

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.020 
this calcium into the tissues so that
episode<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.170> enter<00:03:20.350> vinegar<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.459> really<00:03:21.850> good

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
episode of enter vinegar is really good

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.690 
episode of enter vinegar is really good
for<00:03:22.209> cramps<00:03:22.630> because<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.400> acidifies<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.639> it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
for cramps because it acidifies and it

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.819 
for cramps because it acidifies and it
transports<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.600> lot<00:03:25.900> of<00:03:25.959> these<00:03:26.049> minerals<00:03:26.500> and

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
transports a lot of these minerals and

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.250 
transports a lot of these minerals and
it<00:03:27.130> also<00:03:27.220> helps<00:03:27.639> your<00:03:27.730> stomach<00:03:28.180> absorb<00:03:28.930> the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
it also helps your stomach absorb the

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.160 
it also helps your stomach absorb the
minerals<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.829> then<00:03:30.579> lastly<00:03:31.150> if<00:03:31.540> you're

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
minerals and then lastly if you're

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.330 
minerals and then lastly if you're
deficient<00:03:32.500> in<00:03:32.799> vitamin<00:03:33.250> b1<00:03:34.440> due<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.590> stress<00:03:35.980> or

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.400 
too many refined carbohydrates or sugar
you're<00:03:39.519> going<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.730> have<00:03:39.970> not<00:03:40.180> necessarily<00:03:40.410> a

you're going to have not necessarily a
cramps<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.489> your<00:03:42.519> calves

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
cramps in your calves

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.879 
cramps in your calves
you're<00:03:43.540> going<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.720> have<00:03:43.870> tenderness<00:03:44.470> in<00:03:44.769> your

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
you're going to have tenderness in your

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.920 
you're going to have tenderness in your
