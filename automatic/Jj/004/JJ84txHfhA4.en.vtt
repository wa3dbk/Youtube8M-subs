stupid<00:00:24.660> me<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:25.080> back<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> motor<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.039> I

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
stupid me put back in the motor and I

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.009 
stupid me put back in the motor and I
wasn't<00:00:27.300> paying<00:00:27.449> attention<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:29.750> think<00:00:30.750> that'll

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
do it I replace the spark plug with a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.450 
do it I replace the spark plug with a
plug<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.410> motor<00:00:37.649> right<00:00:37.890> there<00:00:38.129> is

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
plug out of that motor right there is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.160 
plug out of that motor right there is
the<00:00:38.640> identical<00:00:39.210> plugs<00:00:40.190> popped<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.370> back<00:00:41.399> in

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
the identical plugs popped it back in

bingo fires flawlessly it's about two

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.880 
bingo fires flawlessly it's about two
times<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.460> fast<00:00:48.200> crisp<00:00:49.200> throttle<00:00:49.500> response

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
times as fast crisp throttle response

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.670

throughout<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> entire<00:00:51.149> range<00:00:51.480> much<00:00:52.379> better

ah sometimes it's the simple things that
are<00:01:27.730> overlooked<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:32.140> if<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.500> weren't<00:01:32.710> for<00:01:32.770> the

now<00:02:34.050> I'm<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.320> checking<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:34.800> fuel<00:02:34.980> leaks

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
now I'm just checking for fuel leaks

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.430 
now I'm just checking for fuel leaks
since<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.490> had<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:36.020> primary<00:02:37.020> metering<00:02:37.260> block

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
since I had that primary metering block

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
that accelerator pump just because I

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.690 
that accelerator pump just because I
feel<00:04:08.230> like<00:04:08.379> I<00:04:08.500> can<00:04:08.650> get<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:08.830> little<00:04:09.190> bit<00:04:09.489> more

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
watching if you got a stumble and

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.570 
watching if you got a stumble and
popping<00:07:17.140> backfire<00:07:17.650> coming<00:07:18.070> on<00:07:18.190> you<00:07:18.430> don't

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
popping backfire coming on you don't

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.550 
popping backfire coming on you don't
know<00:07:18.670> what<00:07:18.850> it<00:07:18.910> is<00:07:19.060> it's<00:07:19.660> probably<00:07:19.930> your<00:07:20.290> spark

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
know what it is it's probably your spark

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.880 
know what it is it's probably your spark
plugs<00:07:21.240> or<00:07:22.240> it<00:07:22.570> could<00:07:22.690> be<00:07:22.750> other<00:07:23.140> but<00:07:23.440> in

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
plugs or it could be other but in

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.770 
plugs or it could be other but in
my<00:07:23.980> case<00:07:24.040> it<00:07:24.370> was<00:07:24.460> my<00:07:24.490> spark<00:07:24.820> plugs<00:07:25.060> all<00:07:25.570> right

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
my case it was my spark plugs all right

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.020 
my case it was my spark plugs all right
later
