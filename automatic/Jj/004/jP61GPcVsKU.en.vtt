we<00:00:26.550> were<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.150> confident<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.080> could<00:00:28.800> play

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269

good<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.689> indus<00:00:31.349> bit<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.669> always

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
good at the indus bit and we always

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.250 
good at the indus bit and we always
thought<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.540> were<00:00:33.660> stronger<00:00:33.899> team<00:00:34.230> than

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
thought that we were stronger team than

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.990 
thought that we were stronger team than
unicredit<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.890> love<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.340> we<00:00:35.520> never<00:00:35.670> figured

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
unicredit of love but we never figured

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880 
unicredit of love but we never figured

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
out how to correctly play against them

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.440 
out how to correctly play against them
but<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:39.329> finally<00:00:39.780> figured<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
but we we finally figured it out and I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
but we we finally figured it out and I
knew<00:00:42.450> where<00:00:42.600> we're<00:00:42.719> gonna<00:00:42.870> win<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.110> game<00:00:43.520> can

or Baron itches she's really strong all
around<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.950> feels<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
around right now so it feels like a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.090 
around right now so it feels like a
champion<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> look<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.290> pretty<00:01:52.710> much<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
champion to look out for pretty much and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.649 
champion to look out for pretty much and
when<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.399> first<00:01:53.790> pick<00:01:53.970> calloused<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.420> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
when they first pick calloused I I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.679 
when they first pick calloused I I
consider<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.350> being<00:01:55.619> like<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.240> champion<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.600> be

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
consider as being like a champion to be

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.550 
consider as being like a champion to be
able<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.899> play<00:01:58.020> against<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.409> because

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
able to play against it because

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200 
able to play against it because
callista's<00:01:59.100> such<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> lame<00:01:59.490> bully<00:01:59.790> so<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.030> have

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
callista's such a lame bully so you have

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
callista's such a lame bully so you have
a<00:02:00.240> lot<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> range<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:01.399> potentially<00:02:02.399> cover

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
a lot of range to potentially cover

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.370 
a lot of range to potentially cover
cover<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.329> weakness<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.840> they<00:02:03.990> ended<00:02:04.290> up

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
cover that weakness but they ended up

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.649 
cover that weakness but they ended up
Lane<00:02:04.560> shopping<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.399> don't<00:02:06.299> think<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.540> was<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
Lane shopping so I don't think it was a

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.940 
Lane shopping so I don't think it was a
bad<00:02:06.810> thing<00:02:06.990> either<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.259> me<00:02:07.350> because<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.680> scale

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
bad thing either for me because I scale

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.460 
bad thing either for me because I scale
so<00:02:08.129> well<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.789> had<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.440> play<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
so well so I just had to like play it

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.070 
so well so I just had to like play it
safe<00:02:10.709> because<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:11.520> CC<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.510> played<00:02:12.989> it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
safe because that all CC so I played it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
safe because that all CC so I played it
really<00:02:13.200> safe<00:02:13.319> I<00:02:13.620> think

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
really safe I think

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.410 
really safe I think
until<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.130> got<00:02:14.280> qss<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.940> then<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.120> played<00:02:15.300> it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
until I got qss and then I played it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.690 
until I got qss and then I played it
slightly<00:02:16.110> more<00:02:16.350> aggressive<00:02:16.710> but<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.160> wasn't

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
slightly more aggressive but it wasn't

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.890 
slightly more aggressive but it wasn't
really<00:02:17.790> needed<00:02:18.150> for<00:02:18.270> me<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> play<00:02:18.540> aggressive

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
really needed for me to play aggressive

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.870 
really needed for me to play aggressive
either<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.290> think<00:02:19.560> as<00:02:20.100> long<00:02:20.250> as<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.490> didn't<00:02:20.700> die<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
either I think as long as I didn't die I

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.040 
either I think as long as I didn't die I
would<00:02:21.090> never<00:02:21.240> gave<00:02:21.480> them<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> option<00:02:21.900> of

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
would never gave them the option of

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.230 
would never gave them the option of
winning<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.410> game<00:02:22.530> yeah<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.310> did<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.000> start

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
winning the game yeah and did the start

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.430 
winning the game yeah and did the start
of<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.360> game<00:02:24.480> was<00:02:24.660> really<00:02:24.930> interesting

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
of the game was really interesting

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.680 
of the game was really interesting
overall<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.070> way<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.370> had<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.700> full<00:02:27.180> video

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
overall the way we had the full video

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.230 
overall the way we had the full video
basically<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.520> guys<00:02:29.640> managed<00:02:30.000> to

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
basically and then you guys managed to

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.260 
basically and then you guys managed to
dive<00:02:30.600> under<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.290> tower<00:02:31.550> what<00:02:32.550> was<00:02:32.730> kind<00:02:33.150> of

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
dive under the tower what was kind of

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.300 
dive under the tower what was kind of
your<00:02:33.450> thought<00:02:33.690> process<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.110> did<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.680> did

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
your thought process that did you did

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.460 
your thought process that did you did
you<00:02:35.400> see<00:02:35.790> how<00:02:36.330> he'll<00:02:36.570> assign<00:02:36.780> was<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.020> little

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
you see how he'll assign was a little

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.200 
you see how he'll assign was a little
bit<00:02:37.620> out<00:02:37.740> of<00:02:37.770> position<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.760> go<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.060> there

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
bit out of position and to go in there

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.850 
bit out of position and to go in there
or<00:02:39.390> was<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.690> always<00:02:39.959> gonna<00:02:40.260> be<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.530> call<00:02:40.709> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
or was that always gonna be the call to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.370 
or was that always gonna be the call to
dive<00:02:41.600> basically<00:02:42.600> before<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> game<00:02:43.050> we<00:02:43.170> talked

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
dive basically before the game we talked

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.440 
dive basically before the game we talked
about<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.830> if<00:02:44.160> their<00:02:44.640> top<00:02:44.820> laner<00:02:45.000> goes<00:02:45.180> under

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
about if if their top laner goes under

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.900 
about if if their top laner goes under
the<00:02:45.570> tower<00:02:45.780> we're<00:02:46.050> gonna<00:02:46.170> try<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.640> bait<00:02:47.640> like

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the tower we're gonna try to bait like

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.580 
the tower we're gonna try to bait like
if<00:02:48.030> we're<00:02:48.180> going<00:02:48.300> on<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.630> guy<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.020> then<00:02:49.200> just

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
if we're going on that guy and then just

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.840 
if we're going on that guy and then just
turn<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.980> other<00:02:50.040> two<00:02:50.310> that's<00:02:50.490> helping

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
turn on the other two that's helping

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.330 
turn on the other two that's helping
helping<00:02:51.450> him<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.720> survive<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:53.220> he'll

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
helping him to survive and I think he'll

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.560 
helping him to survive and I think he'll
sign<00:02:53.580> just<00:02:53.760> made<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.030> mistake<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.540> he

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
sign just made that mistake that he

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.300 
sign just made that mistake that he
thought<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.380> would<00:02:55.500> dive<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.770> other<00:02:55.860> dollars

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
thought we would dive the other dollars

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.070 
thought we would dive the other dollars
and<00:02:56.459> he<00:02:56.520> was<00:02:56.640> his<00:02:56.760> out<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.970> position<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.510> then

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
and he was his out of position and then

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.540 
and he was his out of position and then
we<00:02:58.230> had<00:02:58.350> like<00:02:58.530> Alistair<00:02:58.890> which<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.280> great

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
we had like Alistair which is a great

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.310 
we had like Alistair which is a great
diver<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.120> then<00:03:00.150> he<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.690> hopes<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.050> aggro

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
diver and then he just hopes the aggro

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.510 
diver and then he just hopes the aggro
and<00:03:01.500> then<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.680> got<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.190> juiced<00:03:02.370> my

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
and then I got it and I juiced my

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.520 
and then I got it and I juiced my
summoner<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.360> think<00:03:03.780> even<00:03:03.989> if<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.260> thought

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530

kill<00:03:06.209> stairs<00:03:06.480> because<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:07.410> like<00:03:07.620> hires<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
kill stairs because that like hires the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.650 
kill stairs because that like hires the
tempo<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> game<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.180> they<00:03:09.239> need<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> lot<00:03:09.630> of

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
tempo of the game and they need a lot of

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.960 
tempo of the game and they need a lot of
time<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:09.989> scale<00:03:10.170> up<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.580> felt<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:11.790> we
