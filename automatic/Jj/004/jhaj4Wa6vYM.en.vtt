00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

alright<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:00.630> today<00:00:00.960> we're<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.530> use<00:00:01.650> air

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
alright so today we're going to use air

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.949 
alright so today we're going to use air
pressure<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.550> calculate<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.510> force<00:00:03.810> of

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
pressure to calculate the force of

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.309 
pressure to calculate the force of
gravity<00:00:04.350> now<00:00:04.850> look<00:00:05.850> over<00:00:06.029> here<00:00:06.170> force<00:00:07.170> of

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
gravity now look over here force of

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.509 
gravity now look over here force of
gravity<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:08.400> equal<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.790> mass<00:00:09.059> times<00:00:09.469> the<00:00:10.469> G<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
gravity is equal to mass times the G the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.270 
gravity is equal to mass times the G the
G<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.849> equal<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.750> 9.8<00:00:13.380> meters<00:00:13.740> per<00:00:13.830> seconds

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
G is equal to 9.8 meters per seconds

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.460 
G is equal to 9.8 meters per seconds
we're<00:00:14.490> going<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.639> do<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.020> we're<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.260> put

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
we're going to do is we're going to put

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.609 
we're going to do is we're going to put
the<00:00:16.980> ping<00:00:17.310> pong<00:00:17.340> ball<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:18.150> weighs<00:00:18.410> point<00:00:19.410> 1

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the ping pong ball that weighs point 1

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.050 
the ping pong ball that weighs point 1
ounces<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.930> here<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.230> then<00:00:22.820> we're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.970> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
ounces on here and then we're going to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.740 
ounces on here and then we're going to
turn<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.930> hair<00:00:25.170> dryer<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:27.119> forest<00:00:27.599> at

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
turn the hair dryer on and the forest at

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.560 
turn the hair dryer on and the forest at
which<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.140> hair<00:00:28.349> dryer<00:00:28.590> push<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
which the hair dryer push it and the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.450 
which the hair dryer push it and the
gravity<00:00:30.570> which<00:00:30.779> pushes<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.560> when<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.340> are

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
gravity which pushes down when they are

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.139 
gravity which pushes down when they are
equal<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.510> ball<00:00:33.780> will<00:00:33.989> hover<00:00:34.790> somehow<00:00:35.790> we

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
equal the ball will hover somehow we

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.900 
equal the ball will hover somehow we
will<00:00:36.329> figure<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> force<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.290> gravity

ruler

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.150 

we<00:00:55.270> work<00:00:55.450> very<00:00:55.480> well

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
we work very well

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.990 
we work very well
not<00:00:57.760> going<00:00:57.880> to<00:00:57.940> work

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
not going to work

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.580 
not going to work
what<00:00:59.360> did<00:00:59.480> not<00:00:59.660> maybe<00:00:59.870> we<00:01:00.050> should<00:01:00.260> get<00:01:00.350> moms

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
what did not maybe we should get moms

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.460 
what did not maybe we should get moms
again<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:00.980> hair<00:01:01.130> dryer<00:01:01.340> yes<00:01:02.210> we<00:01:02.420> sure<00:01:02.690> do<00:01:03.410> you

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
again to hair dryer yes we sure do you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.540 
again to hair dryer yes we sure do you
think<00:01:03.590> she'll<00:01:03.770> allow<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.220> no<00:01:06.190> we<00:01:07.190> won't<00:01:07.370> tell

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
think she'll allow it no we won't tell

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.620 
think she'll allow it no we won't tell
her<00:01:07.670> alright<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:10.670> infinity<00:01:11.240> Prague

it's a close this one we're just gonna

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:43.000 
it's a close this one we're just gonna
flip<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.310> ball<00:01:22.460> back<00:01:22.640> on<00:01:22.820> it<00:01:22.970> are<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.150> ready

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.880 

stop<00:01:46.579> there<00:01:47.079> maybe<00:01:48.079> we<00:01:48.229> need<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.409> bigger<00:01:48.649> ball

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
stop there maybe we need a bigger ball

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.380 
stop there maybe we need a bigger ball
yeah<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:49.790> need<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.060> girl<00:01:50.240> all<00:01:50.799> all<00:01:51.799> right<00:01:52.390> all

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
yeah we need to a girl all all right all

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.210 
yeah we need to a girl all all right all
right<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.630> time<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:53.930> have<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.049> bigger<00:01:54.229> bowl<00:01:54.470> so

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
right this time we have a bigger bowl so

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.109 
right this time we have a bigger bowl so
we'll<00:01:55.369> be<00:01:55.460> able<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.640> measure<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:55.939> more

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
we'll be able to measure it more

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.270 
we'll be able to measure it more
precisely<00:01:56.390> good<00:01:57.200> hey<00:01:58.030> that's<00:01:59.030> not<00:01:59.270> cares<00:01:59.630> me

get use my good stuff for your science

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.929 
get use my good stuff for your science
experiments<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:04.070> we're<00:02:04.250> just<00:02:04.280> gonna<00:02:04.580> do<00:02:04.789> the

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
experiments but we're just gonna do the

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.050 
experiments but we're just gonna do the
thing<00:02:05.210> no<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:06.320> is<00:02:06.470> mine<00:02:06.649> good<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.700> enough

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
thing no this is mine good is enough

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.020 
thing no this is mine good is enough
this<00:02:08.390> totally<00:02:08.630> doesn't<00:02:08.989> work<00:02:09.789> we<00:02:10.789> need<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
this totally doesn't work we need the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.600 
this totally doesn't work we need the
good<00:02:11.239> one<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.780> doesn't<00:02:12.170> work<00:02:12.290> at<00:02:12.440> all<00:02:12.530> oh<00:02:12.830> no

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
good one it doesn't work at all oh no

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.000 
good one it doesn't work at all oh no
take<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.849> good<00:02:14.090> one<00:02:14.300> now<00:02:14.569> if<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.410> hair<00:02:15.709> dryer

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
take a good one now if the hair dryer

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.180 
take a good one now if the hair dryer
pushes<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.150> ball<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.600> at<00:02:18.440> exactly<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.130> same

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
pushes the ball up at exactly the same

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.070 
pushes the ball up at exactly the same
amount<00:02:19.400> of<00:02:19.580> force<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.120> gravity<00:02:20.540> pushes<00:02:20.930> it

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
amount of force the gravity pushes it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.870 
amount of force the gravity pushes it
down<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:23.030> force<00:02:23.510> must<00:02:24.470> equal<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.340> hair

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
down then the force must equal the hair

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
down then the force must equal the hair
dryer<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.840> means<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.100> hair<00:02:28.489> dryer

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
dryer so that means that the hair dryer

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.699 
dryer so that means that the hair dryer
equals<00:02:29.900> mg<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.980> if<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.910> ball<00:02:32.269> weighs<00:02:33.140> point

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
equals mg and if the ball weighs point

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.850 
equals mg and if the ball weighs point
zero<00:02:34.040> or<00:02:34.340> point<00:02:34.610> 1<00:02:34.790> ounces<00:02:35.590> will<00:02:36.590> write<00:02:36.830> that

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
zero or point 1 ounces will write that

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.330 
zero or point 1 ounces will write that
here<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:40.750> gravity<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:42.049> 9.8<00:02:42.380> meters<00:02:43.310> per

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
here and gravity is 9.8 meters per

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.449 
here and gravity is 9.8 meters per
second<00:02:44.150> squared<00:02:44.180> then<00:02:44.840> H<00:02:45.200> equals<00:02:48.970> something

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
second squared then H equals something

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.000 
second squared then H equals something
so<00:02:52.480> maybe<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.750> should<00:02:53.780> go<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.200> school<00:02:54.709> dash

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
so maybe you should go to school dash

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.310 
so maybe you should go to school dash
science<00:02:55.579> taught<00:02:55.790> us<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.450> get<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.600> real<00:02:56.840> science

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
science taught us and get a real science
