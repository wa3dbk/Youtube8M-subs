 bit of brightness does not deepen the brightness 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:02:02.680

00:02:48.980 --> 00:03:05.060
 different 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:15.170
 I'm going to fan level zero and contrast 50 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:24.680
 percent or 40 depending on the object 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:28.570
