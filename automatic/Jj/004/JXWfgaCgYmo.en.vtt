00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.239

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.510
 When we open it, we go to the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.510
 option that says promises support to store 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.490

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.280
 short 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.280
 in this case 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.750

 in this case it has not achieved is load that 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.170
 we already did it previously for 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.170
 save us a little time that is 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.370
 once you are downloading software 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.370
 the film sorry 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.120
 we went to the fight open menu 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.920
 product 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.920
 and inside the center we put 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.030
 885 which is in 1720 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.660
 in the manual that is published in 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.110
 our page 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.710
 they found me the other phones 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.710
 lumen 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.000
 and we are going to open 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.100
 and once we open a product we 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.000
 let's extract it to me 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.000
 in the chest 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.900
 and here our 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.819
 firmware that we previously downloaded 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.610
 here we have to do is press the 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.790
 start button 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.799
 to get started 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.349
 I had to be downloading but in 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.670
 reality what you are going to do is verify 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.670
 that the filter is correct 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.120
 until this point the phone is 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.280
 disconnected from him 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.950
 of the computer we have not told 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.349
 still 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.140
 here is already asking us what 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:14.370
 let's connect the way to connect it is 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:18.379
 as indicated in red the buttons let's go 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.379
 to connect on 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.850
 but if he did not steal me where volume less 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.890
 and already parked until the phone is 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.890
 turn off and free 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.950
 those that vibrated now we call the button 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.950
 sample 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:51.650
 to start the party process 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.650
 the signature where the phone 13 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.790
 that what 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.010
 maybe we sometimes try to talk about what 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.290

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.629

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.930

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.590

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.440

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.400

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.400
