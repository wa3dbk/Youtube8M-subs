dome<00:01:28.610> brush<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.630> can<00:01:29.990> focus<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.619> black<00:01:30.920> in

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
dome brush so I can focus the black in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.280

the outer V and slightly into the outer
crease<00:01:33.649> this<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.729> slow<00:01:35.060> process<00:01:35.300> so<00:01:35.840> just

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
crease this is a slow process so just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.020 
crease this is a slow process so just
keep<00:01:36.259> building<00:01:36.500> up<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.979> color<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.610> blending
