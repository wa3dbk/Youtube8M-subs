00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
really trying to find a way to get

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.379 
really trying to find a way to get
better<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.519> mind<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.910> thought<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.240> were

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
better in my mind I thought we were

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.710

committed<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> mental<00:00:16.830> game<00:00:17.390> but<00:00:18.390> after

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
committed to the mental game but after

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.540 
committed to the mental game but after
spending<00:00:19.140> four<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:19.740> five<00:00:19.890> days<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.279> Brian

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
of playing the game one pitch at a time

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
neatest part about the entire system is

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.049 
neatest part about the entire system is
that<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:57.270> goes<00:00:57.480> beyond<00:00:57.809> baseball<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:59.460> helps

championship and Brian's impact has been
enormous<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.470> think<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> other<00:01:40.860> thing

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
enormous and and I think the other thing

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.289 
enormous and and I think the other thing
is<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.930> his<00:01:42.930> his<00:01:43.290> program<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.100> his<00:01:45.000> belief

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
is that his his program and his belief

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.990 
is that his his program and his belief
system<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.229> applicable<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.490> not

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
system is going to be applicable to not

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
system is going to be applicable to not
just<00:01:48.180> baseball<00:01:48.439> but<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.619> lot<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.799> other<00:01:49.979> sports

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
just baseball but a lot of other sports

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.789 
just baseball but a lot of other sports
because<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.689> process<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.470> about

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
because it is about process it is about

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.819 
because it is about process it is about
the<00:01:53.250> day-to-day<00:01:53.490> grind<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:55.350> getting<00:01:55.649> better

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the day-to-day grind of getting better

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
the day-to-day grind of getting better
each<00:01:56.009> day<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.909> think<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> can

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
each day and I think when you can

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.039 
each day and I think when you can
instill<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.380> within<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:59.009> team<00:01:59.990> then<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
instill that within your team then you

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.300 
instill that within your team then you
have<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> better<00:02:01.350> chance<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.740> success<00:02:01.920> over

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
the long haul I certainly can't

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.880 
the long haul I certainly can't

recommend Brian any stronger he's

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.580 
recommend Brian any stronger he's
