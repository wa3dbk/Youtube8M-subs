developing<00:01:02.670> alleged<00:01:03.300> allergic<00:01:03.750> reactions<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
developing alleged allergic reactions to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
developing alleged allergic reactions to
some<00:01:04.739> dyes<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.400> using<00:01:05.760> tattoo<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
some dyes that are using tattoo so the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.230 
some dyes that are using tattoo so the
public<00:01:06.810> should<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.200> aware<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.710> but

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
public should be aware of that but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.120 
public should be aware of that but
placing<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.330> tattoo<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.049> not<00:01:10.229> completely

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
placing a tattoo is not completely

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
placing a tattoo is not completely
risk-free<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.299> also<00:01:12.450> found<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
risk-free and I also found it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.510 
risk-free and I also found it
interesting<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.439> later<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> life<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.280> can

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
interesting that later in life you can

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
interesting that later in life you can
run<00:01:14.760> into<00:01:15.030> complications<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.409> an

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
run into complications if you have an

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.820 
run into complications if you have an
MRI<00:01:17.060> yeah<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.869> probably<00:01:19.290> has<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.680> with

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
MRI yeah it that probably has to do with

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.100 
MRI yeah it that probably has to do with
the<00:01:19.950> fact<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.299> develop<00:01:21.689> an<00:01:21.900> allergic

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the fact that if you develop an allergic

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.050 
the fact that if you develop an allergic
reaction<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.340> soft<00:01:23.729> tissue

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
reaction and you do have soft tissue

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270 
reaction and you do have soft tissue
swelling<00:01:24.650> potentially<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.740> soft<00:01:26.070> tissue

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
swelling potentially that soft tissue

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.550 
swelling potentially that soft tissue
swelling<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.180> mask<00:01:27.600> certain<00:01:28.110> things<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
swelling can mask certain things and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
swelling can mask certain things and
memory<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.270> common<00:01:30.570> though

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
memory that is not that common though

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.899 
memory that is not that common though
okay<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.770> there<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.880> just

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
okay but it's out there so it is up just

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.490

three wavelengths which has many

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.039 
three wavelengths which has many
advantages<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:04.500> process<00:02:04.950> involves<00:02:06.049> breaking

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
advantages the process involves breaking

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.139 
advantages the process involves breaking
down<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.619> pigment<00:02:08.039> particles<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.700> tattoo

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
down the pigment particles in the tattoo

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.420 
down the pigment particles in the tattoo
through<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.629> energy<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.229> laser<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.250> that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
through the energy of the laser so that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.580 
through the energy of the laser so that
the<00:02:11.550> body<00:02:11.790> scavenging<00:02:12.599> cells<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.290> come

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
the body scavenging cells can come

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.229 
the body scavenging cells can come
I and<00:02:14.040> they<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.550> actually<00:02:14.849> pick<00:02:15.030> up<00:02:15.120> those

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
I and they can actually pick up those

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.839 
I and they can actually pick up those
pigment<00:02:15.690> particles<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.260> take<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.530> elsewhere

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
pigment particles and take it elsewhere

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.949 
pigment particles and take it elsewhere
okay<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:17.910> any<00:02:18.150> side<00:02:18.420> effects<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.780> when

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
okay so any side effects that when

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.410 
okay so any side effects that when
you're<00:02:19.080> using<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.500> laser<00:02:19.620> uh<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:21.180> know<00:02:21.269> with

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you're using a laser uh you know with

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
you're using a laser uh you know with
any<00:02:21.510> laser<00:02:21.810> treatment<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.379> rare<00:02:22.680> side

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
any laser treatment there is rare side

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.970 
any laser treatment there is rare side
effects<00:02:23.220> which<00:02:23.370> include<00:02:23.519> risk<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.209> scarring

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
effects which include risk of scarring

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.250 
effects which include risk of scarring
an<00:02:25.980> infection<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.180> areas<00:02:27.569> where<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.050> do

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
an infection the areas where you do

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.589 
an infection the areas where you do
laser<00:02:28.860> do<00:02:29.310> scalp<00:02:29.670> up<00:02:29.849> for<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> few<00:02:30.239> days<00:02:30.390> at<00:02:30.569> a

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
laser do scalp up for a few days at a

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.030 
laser do scalp up for a few days at a
time<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.080> don't<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.440> keep<00:02:31.560> bandages

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
time and you don't have to keep bandages

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.850 
time and you don't have to keep bandages
on<00:02:32.160> those<00:02:32.340> areas<00:02:32.760> each<00:02:33.629> time<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.200> how<00:02:34.500> long

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
on those areas each time and how long

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.860 
on those areas each time and how long
does<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.250> stay<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.819> in<00:02:36.000> once<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.540> walk

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
does it stay can you go in once and walk

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.990 
does it stay can you go in once and walk
out<00:02:37.080> tattoo<00:02:37.500> free<00:02:37.769> yeah<00:02:38.040> it's<00:02:38.640> not<00:02:38.730> actually

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
out tattoo free yeah it's not actually

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.430 
out tattoo free yeah it's not actually
much<00:02:39.120> easier<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.569> get<00:02:39.690> attacker<00:02:40.019> than<00:02:40.319> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
much easier to get attacker than to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.860 
much easier to get attacker than to
remove<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.769> tattoo<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:42.000> process<00:02:42.269> can<00:02:42.840> take

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
remove a tattoo so the process can take

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.039 
remove a tattoo so the process can take
a<00:02:43.049> few<00:02:43.170> sessions<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:44.129> average<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:45.630> may<00:02:46.019> take

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
a few sessions on average it may take

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.259 
a few sessions on average it may take
six<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.739> eight<00:02:46.860> sessions<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.760> range<00:02:48.000> may

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
six to eight sessions and the range may

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.000 
six to eight sessions and the range may
include<00:02:48.540> anything<00:02:48.840> from<00:02:48.989> 3<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.440> 12<00:02:49.680> sessions

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
include anything from 3 to 12 sessions

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.120 
include anything from 3 to 12 sessions
it<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.610> is<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> gradual<00:02:51.269> process<00:02:51.890> with<00:02:52.890> time

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
it so it is a gradual process with time

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.190 
it so it is a gradual process with time
when<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.489> slowly<00:02:53.819> remove<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.299> tattoo<00:02:54.480> every

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
when you slowly remove a tattoo every

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.750 
when you slowly remove a tattoo every
time<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:55.470> do<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.709> laser<00:02:56.010> treatment<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> tattoo

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
time you do the laser treatment a tattoo

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.150 
time you do the laser treatment a tattoo
becomes<00:02:57.060> lighter<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.599> lighter<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.890> how

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
becomes lighter and lighter and how

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.979 
becomes lighter and lighter and how
expensive<00:02:59.700> are<00:03:00.030> these<00:03:00.239> treatments<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.870> it

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
expensive are these treatments is it

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.660 
expensive are these treatments is it
ever<00:03:01.110> covered<00:03:01.470> by<00:03:01.620> insurance<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:02.489> not

companies do consider to be a cosmetic

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.960 
companies do consider to be a cosmetic
procedure<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.980> cost<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.459> few<00:03:08.819> hundred

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
this method safer than previous removal

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.479 
this method safer than previous removal
techniques<00:03:19.130> basically<00:03:20.130> what<00:03:20.280> you're<00:03:20.430> doing

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
techniques basically what you're doing

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.809 
techniques basically what you're doing
is<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.450> know<00:03:21.569> we<00:03:22.430> you're<00:03:23.430> using<00:03:23.609> a

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
is that you know we you're using a

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.610 
is that you know we you're using a
specific<00:03:24.090> wavelength<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.930> light<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.500> a

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
specific wavelength of light of a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.199 
specific wavelength of light of a
certain<00:03:25.889> tissue<00:03:26.100> interaction<00:03:26.760> between<00:03:27.090> the

certain tissue interaction between the

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.259 
certain tissue interaction between the
light<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> skin<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.829> so<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.459> wave

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
light and the skin and so that wave

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.960 
light and the skin and so that wave
envelop<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.840> life<00:03:31.049> is<00:03:31.290> Scylla<00:03:32.069> is<00:03:32.280> absorbed

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
envelop of life is Scylla is absorbed

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.259

doing a movie now tell me in terms of

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.370 
doing a movie now tell me in terms of
these<00:05:12.130> laser<00:05:12.460> removals<00:05:13.330> should<00:05:14.230> this<00:05:14.320> be

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
these laser removals should this be

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.530 
these laser removals should this be
viewed<00:05:14.710> as<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:14.860> fix-all<00:05:15.370> oh<00:05:15.640> I<00:05:15.670> can<00:05:16.030> I<00:05:16.240> could

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
viewed as a fix-all oh I can I could

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.850 
viewed as a fix-all oh I can I could
have<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:16.840> removed<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.410> I'm<00:05:17.500> gonna<00:05:17.620> pull<00:05:17.800> out

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
have it removed so I'm gonna pull out

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.190 
have it removed so I'm gonna pull out
and<00:05:18.040> get<00:05:18.160> a<00:05:18.190> tattoo<00:05:18.610> now<00:05:18.820> it's<00:05:19.750> probably<00:05:19.990> not<00:05:20.170> a

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
and get a tattoo now it's probably not a

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.540 
and get a tattoo now it's probably not a
good<00:05:20.410> idea<00:05:20.470> to<00:05:20.770> think<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.070> it<00:05:21.160> that<00:05:21.190> way<00:05:21.340> you

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
good idea to think of it that way you

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.420 
good idea to think of it that way you
know<00:05:21.820> removing<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.930> tattoo<00:05:23.530> is<00:05:23.710> much<00:05:24.220> more

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
know removing a tattoo is much more

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.390 
know removing a tattoo is much more
arduous<00:05:24.820> than<00:05:25.410> placing<00:05:26.410> a<00:05:26.650> tattoo<00:05:27.040> it<00:05:27.190> does

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
arduous than placing a tattoo it does

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.400 
arduous than placing a tattoo it does
take<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.640> number<00:05:27.850> of<00:05:28.090> sessions<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.900> then<00:05:29.290> it's

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
take a number of sessions and then it's

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.200 
take a number of sessions and then it's
kind<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.560> a<00:05:29.680> work<00:05:29.950> in<00:05:30.220> time<00:05:30.520> so<00:05:30.820> I<00:05:30.850> think<00:05:31.120> that

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
kind of a work in time so I think that

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.530 
kind of a work in time so I think that
you<00:05:31.330> should<00:05:31.360> be<00:05:32.490> really<00:05:33.490> sure<00:05:33.760> about<00:05:34.090> if<00:05:34.450> you

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
you should be really sure about if you

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.700 
you should be really sure about if you
want<00:05:34.720> you're<00:05:34.960> going<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.140> get<00:05:35.200> a<00:05:35.260> tattoo<00:05:35.440> the

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
want you're going to get a tattoo the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.430 
want you're going to get a tattoo the
other<00:05:35.860> thing<00:05:36.130> also<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.520> consider<00:05:37.210> is<00:05:37.390> that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
other thing also to consider is that

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.720 
other thing also to consider is that
even<00:05:38.440> though<00:05:38.620> with<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.830> advent<00:05:39.190> of<00:05:39.370> this<00:05:39.550> new

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
even though with the advent of this new

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.300 
even though with the advent of this new
laser<00:05:39.910> daleks<00:05:40.390> try<00:05:40.570> advantage<00:05:41.020> if<00:05:41.500> we<00:05:41.800> can<00:05:42.100> get

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
laser daleks try advantage if we can get

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.490 
laser daleks try advantage if we can get
multiple<00:05:43.150> colors<00:05:43.450> removed<00:05:43.900> there<00:05:44.380> are

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
multiple colors removed there are

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.780 
multiple colors removed there are
certain<00:05:44.740> colors<00:05:45.100> that<00:05:45.250> are<00:05:45.370> still<00:05:45.610> very

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
certain colors that are still very

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.700 
certain colors that are still very
tricky<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.330> remove<00:05:46.660> yeah<00:05:46.870> the<00:05:47.320> public<00:05:47.680> should

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
tricky to remove yeah the public should

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.010 
tricky to remove yeah the public should
know<00:05:47.860> about<00:05:48.070> that<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:48.580> for<00:05:49.240> example<00:05:49.330> white

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
know about that and for example white

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.170 
know about that and for example white
tattoos<00:05:50.650> are<00:05:50.830> next<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.160> impossible<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.940> remove

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
tattoos are next to impossible to remove

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.080 
tattoos are next to impossible to remove
also<00:05:52.870> the<00:05:53.020> color<00:05:53.290> yellow<00:05:53.680> is<00:05:54.090> somewhat

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
also the color yellow is somewhat

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.910 
also the color yellow is somewhat
difficult<00:05:55.240> to<00:05:55.540> remove<00:05:55.780> as<00:05:55.960> well<00:05:56.200> all<00:05:56.500> rights<00:05:56.680> I

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
difficult to remove as well all rights I

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.990 
difficult to remove as well all rights I
would<00:05:57.040> have<00:05:57.160> felt<00:05:57.340> like<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.700> brighter<00:05:57.910> colors

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
would have felt like the brighter colors

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.990 
would have felt like the brighter colors
red<00:05:58.510> and<00:05:58.540> blue<00:05:58.930> but<00:05:59.590> not<00:05:59.770> so<00:05:59.980> no<00:06:00.340> actually<00:06:00.730> blue

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
red and blue but not so no actually blue

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.480 
red and blue but not so no actually blue
green<00:06:01.480> and<00:06:01.690> black<00:06:02.230> are<00:06:02.530> the<00:06:02.590> easiest<00:06:03.010> color<00:06:03.190> to

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
green and black are the easiest color to

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.790 
green and black are the easiest color to
remove<00:06:03.790> and<00:06:04.000> red<00:06:04.840> is<00:06:05.050> actually<00:06:05.230> much<00:06:05.590> easier

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
remove and red is actually much easier

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.620 
remove and red is actually much easier
now<00:06:06.130> with<00:06:06.310> this<00:06:06.610> new<00:06:06.670> laser<00:06:07.030> because<00:06:07.420> we<00:06:07.540> have

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
now with this new laser because we have

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.730 
now with this new laser because we have
a<00:06:07.660> certain<00:06:07.960> wavelength<00:06:08.410> that<00:06:08.500> we<00:06:08.590> can

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
a certain wavelength that we can

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.010 
a certain wavelength that we can
actually<00:06:08.860> hit<00:06:09.390> red<00:06:10.390> with<00:06:10.570> it<00:06:10.660> also

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
actually hit red with it also

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.870 
actually hit red with it also
