00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 Of course he quite tasty and very 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.220
 fast today namely because at the end 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.739
 my dear boss also really great today 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.690
 already shown and written down 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.050
 note what we have there as we 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.289
 Need for our delicious gingerbread 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.930
 hazelnut kernels, ground almonds 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:02.039
 gingerbread spice we need this sugar 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.359
 is a sugar substitute in similar 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.129
 I last time from mine 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.320
 drive we need a dark 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.200
 We need eggs, we need chocolate 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.340
 absolutely a nikolaus and we 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.800
 need for white powder as this question 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.020
 yes very often paul is popped up 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.050
 which protein in a lot of what you can 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.520
 your recommend what can you take 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.760
 We will answer this question at the end of the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.130
 take a little bit closer to the videos if they are 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.800
 It's the same with Christmas 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.870
 Summon it after the meal so 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.100
 Let's start with the beautiful ones 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.260
 make sweet gingerbread 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.210
 I'll show you that works fast 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.090
 and then we'll see you soon afterwards 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.560
 again 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.359
 so let's just do it today 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.289
 we start taking hazelnut kernels 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:49.939
 grab those shots in the almonds 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.520
 ground almonds in this case exactly 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:57.709
 the same with it a bit 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.140
 gingerbread spice a bit ios powder 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.179
 I am here for nature 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.140
 Variant so decided without taste 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.720
 and the whole thing is unheard 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.530
 Next, the eggs with the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.890
 sugar mixed together and that right 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.459
 you need about 3 45 to do that 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.079
 minutes 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.739
 it's a bit faster with me 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.739
 in the video 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.450
 then you pack the dry ingredients in 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.959
 the frothy beaten and tools 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.959
 gently fold in portions 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.530
 the whole is then a beautiful colored 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.510
 The wonderful one on one 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.780
 Of course, this can be done with baking tray 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.120
 before 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.620
 should be provided with baking paper and 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.230
 there is a small mess afterwards 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.990
 help of two teaspoons I do 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.990
 big generous blots on one 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.520
 baking tray 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.830
 because the whole thing does not look like it yet 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.120
 I'm a bit worried about gingerbread 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:22.750
 my fingers and bring this blob in 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.180
 a gingerbread just form, hopefully 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:30.150
 I do not mind that the gingerbreads 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.150
 that I press her so unattractive 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.940
 Now it's getting really hot for the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.010
 Gingerbread with air 140 degrees I pack 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.760
 my beautiful finished shaped 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:49.620
 gingerbread in the oven pack the whole thing 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.460
 Who can be a thermomix 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.220
 fortunate 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.730
 There the chocolate melts completely 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.840
 fast 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.129
 I honestly would not have one 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.599
 I would only eat them thermomix 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:05.180
 Well and then you go over with the brush 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.170
 the gingerbread about a once 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.530
 brush a bit 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.819
 so that's a nice one 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.310
 Chocolate lids always get 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:17.989
 finished so that was the delicious gingerbread 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.030
 recipe to our nikolaus and how 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.259
 promised there after eating well 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.060
 the relief is not even today 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:24.830
 I still have two Christmas 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.139
 wonderful gifts for you on the one hand 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.990
 I had recently asked if yes 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.680
 you are interested in one 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.729
 Nutrition Coach's momentum and the resonance 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.440
 was really great 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.840
 That's why I thought so now 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.180
 I've got everything in the way and have 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.520
 such a formally stamped out of nowhere 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.889
 and just want to try with her 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.419
 almost start and yes and with the 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.009
 description you will find the link to the 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.410
 forum that is still the same 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.490
 after that important because when is around 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.440
 second nicholas gift acts as 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.659
 second nicole is served namely 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:02.690
 on a sixth december six 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:05.389
 Of course not coladoses I am yes 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.539
 not the cola Santa Claus 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:12.440
 the nutritional nonsense and that's why 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:16.789
 has ex body this is so to speak this 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.159
 great company here and 61 cans for 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.560
 provided six ice packs in 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.310
 your taste and that gives 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.470
 to win it 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.530
 and I want a few short ones 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.810
 get rid of words about this protein because 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.520
 I would very often ask which 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.949
 you use protein powder you know what 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.440
 On the other hand, it is just as damaging 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.970
 there are side effects and i have myself 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.639
 with sascha the owner of ax body 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:44.539
 long time apart and with 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:47.659
 Much has spoken to him and I am simple 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.509
 came to the conclusion that this is the 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:52.190
 Product is what is currently what I am 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.290
 Best regards 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.030
 itself also users so the 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.100
 iks bonnie products are only available in 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.790
 Distributed pharmacies and directly over the 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.650
 shop and is really from the taste 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.020
 It's not very sweet either 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.570
 and not as artificial as many 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.610
 many other products and that's why he 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.980
 I can recommend the best heart 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.140

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.150

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.950

 description and post is just one 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.350
 Short comment I friends for long 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.370
