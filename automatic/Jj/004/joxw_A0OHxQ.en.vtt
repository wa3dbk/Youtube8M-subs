really cool art paper and I thought can

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.570 
really cool art paper and I thought can
I<00:00:19.230> try<00:00:19.410> some<00:00:19.710> because<00:00:20.039> I've<00:00:20.160> never<00:00:20.310> tried

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I try some because I've never tried

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.120 
I try some because I've never tried
straf<00:00:20.939> horse<00:00:21.210> mixed<00:00:21.720> media<00:00:22.080> paper<00:00:22.289> before<00:00:22.710> and

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
straf horse mixed media paper before and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.120 
straf horse mixed media paper before and
so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> got<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.330> kind<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.750> mini<00:00:25.109> tablet<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
so I got a little kind of mini tablet to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.400 
so I got a little kind of mini tablet to
try<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.779> kind<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.199> that's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
try out and it's kind of like that's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.009 
try out and it's kind of like that's
like<00:00:28.650> Bristol<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.849> think<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:30.630> it's

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
like Bristol but I think because it's

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.389 
like Bristol but I think because it's
mixed-media<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:32.099> um<00:00:32.460> Oh<00:00:34.309> something<00:00:35.309> else

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
mixed-media that um Oh something else

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.340 
mixed-media that um Oh something else
cool<00:00:35.790> cuz<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.239> can't<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.719> just<00:00:36.750> Bristol

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
cool cuz this can't be just Bristol

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.139 
cool cuz this can't be just Bristol
otherwise<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.860> would<00:00:37.980> say<00:00:38.100> Bristol<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.850> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
otherwise it would say Bristol so I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.479 
otherwise it would say Bristol so I
thought<00:00:39.420> we'd<00:00:39.600> try<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> out<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> painting<00:00:41.040> so

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
thought we'd try it out on a painting so

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.889

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
and again there's a ton of types of

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.179 
and again there's a ton of types of
seahorses<00:01:52.880> out<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:53.539> I<00:01:54.350> would<00:01:54.950> look<00:01:55.069> at

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
seahorses out there so I would look at

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.380 
seahorses out there so I would look at
some<00:01:55.369> reference<00:01:55.729> photos<00:01:55.789> if<00:01:56.149> there's<00:01:56.329> a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
some reference photos if there's a

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.059 
some reference photos if there's a
specific<00:01:57.020> type<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:57.469> seahorse<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.979> you'd

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
specific type of seahorse that you'd

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.580 
specific type of seahorse that you'd
like<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.399> see<00:01:58.609> but<00:01:59.569> when<00:01:59.899> it<00:02:00.020> was<00:02:00.170> little<00:02:00.409> belly
