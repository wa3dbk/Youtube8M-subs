00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
what's important to this

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.690 
what's important to this
we<00:00:08.879> take<00:00:09.240> whatever<00:00:10.019> has<00:00:10.440> been<00:00:10.589> designed<00:00:11.009> into

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
we take whatever has been designed into

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.910 
we take whatever has been designed into
that<00:00:11.849> particular<00:00:12.209> application<00:00:13.199> or<00:00:13.410> vehicle

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
that particular application or vehicle

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.210 
that particular application or vehicle
we<00:00:14.190> look<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.610> what's<00:00:14.940> been<00:00:15.179> done<00:00:15.480> our<00:00:15.900> testing

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
we look at what's been done our testing

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.979 
that stock air box or that stock filter
and<00:00:22.439> then<00:00:22.919> we<00:00:23.160> look<00:00:23.400> for<00:00:23.640> ways<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.849> improve<00:00:24.240> any

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
and then we look for ways to improve any

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.450 
and then we look for ways to improve any
of<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:25.410> three<00:00:25.680> attributes<00:00:25.829> that<00:00:26.399> are

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of the three attributes that are

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.970 
of the three attributes that are
important<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.509> an<00:00:27.630> air<00:00:27.750> filter<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.500> first<00:00:28.710> one

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
important to an air filter the first one

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.429 
important to an air filter the first one
is<00:00:29.160> air<00:00:29.369> flow<00:00:29.669> or<00:00:29.700> pressure<00:00:29.939> drop<00:00:30.509> the<00:00:31.020> second

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
is air flow or pressure drop the second

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
is air flow or pressure drop the second
one<00:00:31.559> is<00:00:31.739> its<00:00:32.070> efficiency<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:33.030> other<00:00:33.239> words

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
one is its efficiency in other words

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.080 
one is its efficiency in other words

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
what size particles of dirt does it stop

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.709 
what size particles of dirt does it stop
and<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.719> third<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.200> its<00:00:37.559> overall

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
and the third one is its overall

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
and the third one is its overall
building<00:00:39.719> up<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.050> dirt<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.530> its<00:00:40.650> capacity<00:00:41.340> when

it<00:01:00.570> makes<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.930> big<00:01:01.079> difference<00:01:01.470> if<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.710> have

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it makes a big difference if you have

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
it makes a big difference if you have
more<00:01:02.010> horsepower<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.120> better<00:01:03.329> engine

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
more horsepower you have better engine

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.780 
more horsepower you have better engine

those things are the reasons why people

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.289 
those things are the reasons why people
want<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> buy<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> high<00:01:08.640> performance<00:01:09.149> air

the actual test itself there's what they
call<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> conditioning<00:03:44.760> test<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.720> they<00:03:45.810> call

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
call a conditioning test and they call

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.170 
call a conditioning test and they call
it<00:03:46.110> then<00:03:46.320> there's<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.770> restriction<00:03:47.250> test<00:03:47.670> and

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
it then there's a restriction test and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.090 
it then there's a restriction test and
there's<00:03:48.390> an<00:03:48.510> initial<00:03:48.960> test<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.830> then<00:03:49.920> there's

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
there's an initial test and then there's

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.880 
there's an initial test and then there's
a<00:03:50.160> cumulative<00:03:50.430> test<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:52.200> conditioning

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
a cumulative test and the conditioning

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.470 
a cumulative test and the conditioning
tests<00:03:53.190> what<00:03:53.670> you're<00:03:53.820> doing<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.270> you're

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
tests what you're doing is you're

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.840 
tests what you're doing is you're
conditioning<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.800> filter<00:03:56.520> that<00:03:56.670> you're

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
conditioning the filter that you're

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.810 
conditioning the filter that you're
testing<00:03:57.120> along<00:03:58.020> with<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.920> absolute<00:03:59.460> filter

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
testing along with the absolute filter

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.640 
testing along with the absolute filter
which<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.150> part<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.540> test<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.350> room

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
which is part of the test to the room

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.920 
which is part of the test to the room
conditions<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.970> room<00:04:03.150> conditions<00:04:03.660> play

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
conditions and the room conditions play

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.780 
conditions and the room conditions play
a<00:04:03.960> huge<00:04:04.650> part<00:04:04.710> in<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.130> testing<00:04:05.520> because

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
a huge part in the testing because

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.530 
a huge part in the testing because
humidity<00:04:06.330> is<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:07.580> major<00:04:08.580> player<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.180> this

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
humidity is is a major player in this

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.150 
humidity is is a major player in this
because<00:04:09.900> anytime<00:04:10.140> you<00:04:10.260> have<00:04:10.410> humidity<00:04:10.740> you

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
because anytime you have humidity you

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.000 
because anytime you have humidity you
add<00:04:11.490> weight<00:04:11.850> with<00:04:12.330> water<00:04:12.660> moisture<00:04:12.960> so<00:04:13.740> the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
add weight with water moisture so the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.760 
add weight with water moisture so the
room<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.430> climate<00:04:14.790> ly<00:04:14.880> controlled<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:16.440> all<00:04:16.560> has

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
room is climate ly controlled it all has

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
to fall within a certain spec it's

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.140 
to fall within a certain spec it's
actually<00:04:19.710> monitored<00:04:20.190> by<00:04:20.340> an<00:04:20.460> outside<00:04:20.880> source

long at 20 hours a day and the
equivalence<00:05:31.729> ratio<00:05:31.879> is<00:05:32.379> 27,000<00:05:33.379> miles<00:05:33.560> in<00:05:34.069> 20

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
equivalence ratio is 27,000 miles in 20

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.420 
equivalence ratio is 27,000 miles in 20
hours<00:05:34.879> so<00:05:35.479> if<00:05:35.569> you<00:05:35.659> do<00:05:35.810> the<00:05:35.930> math<00:05:36.110> it's<00:05:36.949> 18

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
hours so if you do the math it's 18

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.860 
hours so if you do the math it's 18
times<00:05:37.940> 20<00:05:38.659> times<00:05:38.690> 27<00:05:39.789> 486<00:05:40.789> thousand<00:05:41.449> miles

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
times 20 times 27 486 thousand miles

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.010 
times 20 times 27 486 thousand miles
all<00:05:42.409> of<00:05:42.710> our<00:05:42.830> testing<00:05:43.490> actually<00:05:44.090> helps<00:05:44.810> us

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
all of our testing actually helps us

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.529 
all of our testing actually helps us
understand<00:05:45.710> where<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.789> improvements<00:05:47.389> can<00:05:47.509> be

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
understand where the improvements can be

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.540 
understand where the improvements can be
made<00:05:47.840> in<00:05:48.080> that<00:05:48.229> product<00:05:48.740> the<00:05:49.159> other<00:05:49.190> thing

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
made in that product the other thing

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.219 
made in that product the other thing
that<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.849> does<00:05:49.879> is<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.210> validates<00:05:50.810> that<00:05:50.930> from

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
that it does is it validates that from

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.659 
that it does is it validates that from
year<00:05:51.440> to<00:05:51.560> year<00:05:51.590> if<00:05:51.889> you<00:05:52.009> bought<00:05:52.190> a<00:05:52.219> filter

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
year to year if you bought a filter
