Wrestlemania<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:57.210> were<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> be

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
Wrestlemania we were just going to be

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.539 
Wrestlemania we were just going to be
slam<00:01:58.079> packed<00:01:58.380> full<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.619> stuff<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> sort<00:01:59.490> of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
slam packed full of stuff and it sort of

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.819 
slam packed full of stuff and it sort of
was<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.909> wait<00:02:00.689> till<00:02:00.869> next<00:02:00.930> week<00:02:01.350> wait<00:02:01.619> till

was like wait till next week wait till
next<00:02:01.979> week<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.180> I'm<00:02:03.659> guessing<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.409> that

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
next week and so I'm guessing that that

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.820 
raw and then have a drop off that way
you<00:02:09.599> know<00:02:10.080> that<00:02:10.459> slow<00:02:11.459> ratings<00:02:12.379> increase

the<00:02:16.770> race<00:02:16.950> at<00:02:17.190> WrestleMania<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.020> see

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the race at WrestleMania and then we see

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.780 
the race at WrestleMania and then we see

and most people will die off because

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.960 
and most people will die off because
they<00:02:23.520> don't<00:02:23.670> care<00:02:23.820> about<00:02:23.850> extreme<00:02:24.300> rules<00:02:24.510> but
