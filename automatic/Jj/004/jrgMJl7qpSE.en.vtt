00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.059
 was thinking about youtube this precious and 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.309
 after today is another name for gta 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.740
 san andreas and with you or even 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.920
 video title today's mode are the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.960
 textures of gta 5 for gte blood is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.779
 and first notice 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.689
 do not confuse textures with graphics 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.310
 graphics is one thing textures is another 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.650
 A lot of people think it's the same thing. 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.830
 but it is not then this video of today that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.170
 Today's mode is the textures and not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.850
 graphics, do not get in the way 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 so speaking this because I know a lot 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.860
 people will write in our comments 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 It has nothing to do with gta5 then 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 these textures 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.340
 do not mix things up it has to do with 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.530
 gta5 is very similar including and one more 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.649
 personal detail unfortunately this template 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.989
 it is not applied to the entire gta map 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.270
 san andreas is only in santos 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.829
 Unfortunately it works for you in the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.780
 map all great right 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.239
 if you do not already there're the bug 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.939
 because with me it did not work on the map 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.830
 all just the same saints 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.619
 this way that I bring to you today 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.780
 is version 2.0 of the most 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.240
 updated from the moment I'm recording 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.130
 this video is clear and another vision before 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.500
 install this mode and do not forget to 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.700
 make copies of your gte's files 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 san andreas 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 do not forget what's the matter with some problem 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.350
 you will get a copy of the files already 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.900
 original gta and something else that way 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.869
 It's very heavy, so if you have one 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.390
 Unfortunately, I do not have to 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.909
 to do that detail is there may be that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.560
 You're not open to trouble, are you? 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.170
 so if you had to 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.820
 unfortunately this way is not for you and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.220
 is this in the inscription as always goes 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.750
 being the name of the authors of the move and is 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.490
 So, now, let's go for installation. 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.829
 on staff now let's go for installation 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.229
 in the description of the video as it always will 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.270
 be the link of the way for you to download 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.670
 and you will also have to download a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.850
 program that also download the application 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.740
 link is down premiere the two 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.379
 the program does not have to be anything alone 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.569
 download extract and only I have done it here 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.770
 it's obvious to me the tac in the video you guys 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.870
 do it there 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.720
 I'm already here with the open program as 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.170
 I told you, he opens it. 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.210
 program application and it's only coming 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.940
 here in the program we will come here in 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.650
 the good and here you will find the folder 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.360
 from your gta san andreas 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.060
 that page that contains all the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.280
 cgpa files the same has already found 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.620
 here because you have already installed mode before 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.140
 to see it was working properly 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.420
 so here is the folder that gta san 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.080
 andreas that you are locating arrives 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.570
 in her 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.790
 you will see this part here models and 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.670
 select gt file at 3 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.980
 only he will break it you will click 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.740
 here in this room had already had green 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.990
 here and now we will find folder 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.970
 so it 's obvious that you've already 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.640
 realized that I did not even touch the part of the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.500
 modus office even extracted the files and 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.500
 just because we only use the program 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.310
 installation is then to find that the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.260
 folder is already here abiel and arriving here 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.530
 in it you will open this first 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.900
 match here gta 3 open she selects 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.900
 all files that are many 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.700
 select them all and click ok 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.430
 done that we will stay one more 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.410
 time in this series had here and now 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.540
 people will once again locate the folder 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.520
 of the mold you find once again 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.560
 soft pasta that we just got 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.350
 add the files in the program now 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.709
 It's the first folder in the second game. 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.080
 here as the name of the folder itself speaks 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.570
 vegetation and as there is also optional 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.580
 It's if you want I was there because 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.950
 I think it looks more beautiful, it's a combination. 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.440
 more but if you do not want you install 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.200
 I'm going to be there because I think more 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.010
 It's cute if you do not want you 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.660
 will choose then you open the folder 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.260
 select all files and click 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.440
 Open 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.540
 done it, just click here he goes 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.070
 load all files 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.900
 So it's going to take a little while there 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.510
 now also depend a little on your 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.510
