00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 concert campaign only the beta is without 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.410
 doubt a reference in Europe if we speak 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.790
 of classical music cello 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.889
 person who even has his own 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.590
 festival the solver festival that makes 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.139
 eight years is done in switzerland where they go 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.930
 discovering even some talents and 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.210
 just one of its future goals 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189
 is to return all that to the musicians 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
 young people and make a foundation that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.939
 discover the talents in Latin America 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.310
 He has spoken many things with her 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.250
 because he really has what she says 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.989
 a lot of personality and that shows in the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.030
 scenario because a good game the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.980
 can anyone touch that is how it says 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.010
 she the start talking but after 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.129
 that other one I do not know what it is that marks the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.129
 difference 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.239
 what feelings are today to return to 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.300
 your land agreed pretty incredible 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.089
 for not being here for me this one thing 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.969
 completely new I can not either 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.830
 imagine for example people I know 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.180
 since my childhood when I see them again 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 it's like how good all this time 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 happened it's not like it's not really real 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.100
 Today is the prize-winning drawer for raising 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.750
 popularity of classical music what do you 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000
 goes against in these recognitions of 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.659
 toffee this year it gives me a lot of joy 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.850
 know that that kind of representation what 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 they put with my person because I think 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.990
 that today is so divided the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 classical music of pop music almost 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.100
 all this and in the background the music 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.460
 classical was part of pop music 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.350
 of the moment 200 300 years ago ago of 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.869
 suddenly I came to the best with a 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.600
 or another vision not a bit of the wave 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.890
 I would say with another wave and maybe the best 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.409
 example I see my concerts there 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.450
 millions of guys in the first rows 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.140
 it does not excite me very much because 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.140
 Write letters 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.340
 and your Latin essence will be reflected and 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.160
 when you play on your cello 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.650
 classical score surely yes I 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.110
 I think I'm a mix too 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.610
 I was born here but at the same time it's the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.500
 Russian goal I have a French passport 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.630
 we do a bit of everything but 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.580
 obviously all my culture that I've 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.010
 lived here in Argentina and also what 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.200
 one is is the blood of each one the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.730
 temperament of each one is not I think 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.069
 that these are things that do not take us 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.440
 never one can a little bit to the best 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.080
 dominate more or less but most 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.660
 interesting is that with age more and more 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.660
 I'm attracted to the Latin roots not 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.580
 what parables are virtues that has 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.190
 the cello at the time of good to be 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.200
 a little part of that I think there's 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.850
 many things that the cello has 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.130
 different from many other instruments 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.240
 one of them 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.790
 the first thing is that the instrument 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.110
 is between us or is it between 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.540
 our arms between our legs 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.850
 it's like another human being is a part 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.380
 from me I never have the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.380
 feeling that I am with an instrument 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.770
 yes 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.300
 at the time of the works because there is no 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.550
 as many hours for cello as there are 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.080
 for piano for example is not true no 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.700
 there are so many but for example to me 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.190
 like to discover new things a little 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.790
 I know what the library until it 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.950
 better nobody found anyone really 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.900
 He knew they existed and that there was 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.910
 works that maybe did not touch so much 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.590
 they made us so famous in the period 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.550
 of jairÃ³n for example there are a lot of 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.550
 works that were never touched 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.219
 I like challenges sing to me 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.290
 would like in the future to be able to help 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.420
 really discover the talents in 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.430
 South America in Argentina in other countries 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.069
 also brasil or well and really can 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.510
 organize a kind of foundation for 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.489
 to be able to give them a scholarship to be able to leave 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.170
 of the country to do a kind of 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.760
 studies to the best abroad that 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.459
 it would be super interesting is a cute 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.260
 I would love the project and we know what 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.700
 what do you propose you achieve it so it is 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.680
 I think it's all a matter of time 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.680
 but things are done 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.620
 well we would be listening more 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.280
 time surely not good there will be another 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.280
 opportunity surely
