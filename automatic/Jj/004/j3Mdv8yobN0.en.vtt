on its own special ledger line is middle
C<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:17.550> note<00:00:17.760> two<00:00:18.000> lines<00:00:18.240> down<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.720> bass<00:00:18.990> F

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
C the note two lines down is bass F

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.970 
C the note two lines down is bass F
comes<00:00:20.220> out<00:00:20.400> from<00:00:20.550> an<00:00:20.700> F<00:00:20.820> laughs<00:00:21.470> one<00:00:22.470> two<00:00:22.680> three

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
comes out from an F laughs one two three

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.260 
comes out from an F laughs one two three
C<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.510> low<00:00:24.720> bass<00:00:25.050> C<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.860> then<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
C it is a low bass C and then I like to

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.390 
C it is a low bass C and then I like to
think<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.810> next<00:00:28.170> low<00:00:28.500> note<00:00:28.740> at<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> very

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
think of this next low note at the very

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.790 
think of this next low note at the very
bottom<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.210> ground<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.289> remember<00:00:31.770> our

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
bottom as the ground so remember our

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.250 
bottom as the ground so remember our
flagpole<00:00:32.340> F<00:00:32.850> from<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> treble<00:00:33.719> staff<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
flagpole F from the treble staff and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620 
flagpole F from the treble staff and
down<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.310> the<00:00:35.460> ground<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.120> we<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.450> this

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
down here is the ground so we have this

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440 
down here is the ground so we have this
note<00:00:36.900> G<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.460> found<00:00:38.760> at<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.060> very<00:00:39.239> bottom

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
note G and it's found at the very bottom

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.050 
note G and it's found at the very bottom
of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.170> bass<00:00:40.380> staff<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.310> this<00:00:41.579> helps<00:00:41.940> us

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
of the bass staff so this helps us

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.000 
of the bass staff so this helps us
anchor<00:00:42.600> these<00:00:42.930> two<00:00:43.380> new<00:00:43.500> notes<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.890> we're

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
anchor these two new notes that we're

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.790 
anchor these two new notes that we're
about<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> learn<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.840> G<00:00:46.170> which

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
about to learn so here we have G which

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.819 
about to learn so here we have G which
is<00:00:46.950> our<00:00:47.100> ground<00:00:47.520> floor<00:00:47.940> G<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.630> I'm<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
is our ground floor G and I'm going to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.130 
is our ground floor G and I'm going to
play<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.100> four<00:00:50.340> times<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.540> let's<00:00:51.720> find<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
play it four times so let's find it

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560 
play it four times so let's find it
again<00:00:52.320> middle<00:00:52.680> C<00:00:52.950> one<00:00:53.460> two<00:00:53.610> three<00:00:53.850> C<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.420> then

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
again middle C one two three C and then

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.569 
again middle C one two three C and then
if<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.930> even<00:00:55.320> lower<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> bottom<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
if this is even lower it's the bottom of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.319 
if this is even lower it's the bottom of
the<00:00:56.700> bass<00:00:56.880> staff<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:01.370> we<00:01:02.370> do<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the bass staff and we do know that if a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660 
the bass staff and we do know that if a
note<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> space<00:01:04.469> and<00:01:05.219> it's<00:01:05.399> touching

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
note is in a space and it's touching

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
note is in a space and it's touching
this<00:01:06.060> line<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.869> these<00:01:07.109> notes<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.530> neighbors

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
this line that these notes are neighbors

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.039 
this line that these notes are neighbors
so<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.459> have<00:01:08.639> G<00:01:08.999> a<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.270> being<00:01:12.959> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
so here we have G a this a being a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.319 
so here we have G a this a being a
neighbor<00:01:13.259> of<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.649> G<00:01:13.859> so<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.209> the

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
neighbor of the G so if this is the

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.330 
neighbor of the G so if this is the
ground<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.139> we're<00:01:16.740> underwater

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
ground and we're underwater

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.599 
ground and we're underwater
this<00:01:18.329> a<00:01:18.630> could<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.499> an<00:01:19.590> anchor<00:01:19.829> sitting<00:01:20.399> on<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
this a could be an anchor sitting on the

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.099 
this a could be an anchor sitting on the
ground<00:01:20.789> that's<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.209> nice<00:01:21.420> little<00:01:21.600> trick<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
ground that's a nice little trick to

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.090 
ground that's a nice little trick to
remember<00:01:22.529> G

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 

so<00:01:26.670> those<00:01:26.850> are<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> two<00:01:27.210> notes<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.630> going

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so those are the two notes we're going

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.719 
so those are the two notes we're going
to<00:01:27.900> learn<00:01:28.050> in<00:01:28.260> this<00:01:28.380> lesson<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.950> now<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.460> have

to learn in this lesson and now we have

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.190 
to learn in this lesson and now we have
learned<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.479> notes<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:30.960> bass

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
learned all of the notes in the bass

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.100 
learned all of the notes in the bass
staff<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:32.610> beginning<00:01:33.090> together<00:01:33.300> let's<00:01:33.870> play

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
staff so beginning together let's play

hand<00:01:59.039> position<00:01:59.460> shifts<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.149> at<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.050> end

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
hand position shifts and at the very end

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.940 
hand position shifts and at the very end
we<00:02:01.619> are<00:02:01.800> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.220> play<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.759> triad<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.740> maybe
