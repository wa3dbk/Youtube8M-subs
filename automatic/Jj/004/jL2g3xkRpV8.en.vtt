playing<00:00:03.810> some<00:00:03.959> WWE<00:00:04.560> 2k14<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:06.299> decided<00:00:06.629> I

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
playing some WWE 2k14 and I decided I

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.299 
playing some WWE 2k14 and I decided I
want<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.930> play<00:00:07.080> some<00:00:07.259> evolution<00:00:07.770> versus<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
want to play some evolution versus the

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.709 
want to play some evolution versus the
shield<00:00:08.580> except<00:00:08.910> it's<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.150> free-for-all

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
shield except it's a free-for-all

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:10.879 
shield except it's a free-for-all
so<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> shield<00:00:10.110> could<00:00:10.260> go<00:00:10.349> after<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.650> shield

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
so the shield could go after the shield

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.740 
so the shield could go after the shield
and<00:00:11.099> evolution<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.759> go<00:00:11.849> after<00:00:12.000> evolution<00:00:12.570> and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
and evolution can go after evolution and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.919 
and evolution can go after evolution and
there<00:00:13.019> can<00:00:13.139> only<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.410> one<00:00:13.559> winner<00:00:14.360> so<00:00:15.360> Seth
