00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
see this base is it's actually an easier

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.540 
see this base is it's actually an easier

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
opposed to one and why is it a little

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.870 
opposed to one and why is it a little
bit<00:02:40.380> easier<00:02:40.710> than<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> may<00:02:41.130> look<00:02:41.160> because<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
bit easier than it may look because the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.790 
bit easier than it may look because the
Queen<00:02:42.090> looks<00:02:42.300> centralized<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:43.560> does<00:02:43.680> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
Queen looks centralized in so does the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890 
Queen looks centralized in so does the
clan<00:02:44.010> castle<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.210> actually<00:02:45.390> see

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
clan castle but you can actually see

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.600 
clan castle but you can actually see
that<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.140> Queen's<00:02:46.440> range<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.100> obviously

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
that the Queen's range is obviously

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.600 
that the Queen's range is obviously
pretty<00:02:47.970> far<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.860> can<00:02:50.040> go<00:02:50.190> ahead<00:02:50.490> and

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
pretty far so if you can go ahead and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.000 
pretty far so if you can go ahead and
use<00:02:50.730> that<00:02:50.760> jump<00:02:51.360> spell<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.140> outline<00:02:52.590> wall

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
use that jump spell on the outline wall

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.530 
use that jump spell on the outline wall
as<00:02:53.250> long<00:02:53.490> as<00:02:53.670> you're<00:02:53.760> gonna<00:02:53.850> get<00:02:54.090> your<00:02:54.240> troops

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
as long as you're gonna get your troops

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.600 
as long as you're gonna get your troops
in<00:02:54.720> range<00:02:55.050> of<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.470> Queen<00:02:55.740> you're<00:02:56.220> gonna<00:02:56.400> be

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
in range of the Queen you're gonna be

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.000 
in range of the Queen you're gonna be
looking<00:02:56.940> pretty<00:02:57.180> good<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.750> when<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.650> pick

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
looking pretty good so when you pick

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.890 
looking pretty good so when you pick
where<00:02:59.340> do<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.580> go<00:02:59.730> ahead<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.180> attack<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> base

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
where do you go ahead and attack a base

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.750 
where do you go ahead and attack a base
from<00:03:01.170> using<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.650> go<00:03:01.830> lava<00:03:02.100> attack<00:03:02.460> be<00:03:02.670> at

townhall 9 or townhall 10 keep in mind

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.740 
townhall 9 or townhall 10 keep in mind
as<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.320> it's<00:03:08.190> not<00:03:08.430> always<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.150> place<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.600> want

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
as to it's not always the place you want

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.270 
as to it's not always the place you want
to<00:03:09.810> attack<00:03:09.990> from<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.350> not<00:03:10.530> always<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.070> most

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
to attack from is not always the most

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.910 
to attack from is not always the most
obvious<00:03:11.970> spot<00:03:12.270> yeah<00:03:12.900> remember<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.560> clean

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
obvious spot yeah remember that clean

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.240 
obvious spot yeah remember that clean
range<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.700> really<00:03:15.060> large<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:16.170> hitter<00:03:16.740> from<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
range is really large so hitter from a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.770 
range is really large so hitter from a
place<00:03:17.490> that<00:03:17.730> your<00:03:17.850> troops<00:03:18.120> will<00:03:18.239> be<00:03:18.360> least

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
place that your troops will be least

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360 
place that your troops will be least
vulnerable<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:19.739> where<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.220> actually

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
vulnerable but where you can actually

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.220 
vulnerable but where you can actually
get<00:03:20.640> an<00:03:20.760> air<00:03:20.910> defense<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.780> clan<00:03:21.989> castle

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.470 
get an air defense and the clan castle
as<00:03:22.560> well<00:03:22.770> as<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.980> Queen<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.790> once<00:03:24.060> again<00:03:24.209> we're

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
as well as the Queen so once again we're

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.690 
as well as the Queen so once again we're

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
gonna use a strategy here of having to

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.400 
gonna use a strategy here of having to
lava<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.300> first<00:03:27.510> two<00:03:27.630> lava<00:03:27.810> hounds<00:03:28.080> go<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.290> the

lava the first two lava hounds go to the

lava the first two lava hounds go to the
same<00:03:28.680> air<00:03:29.010> defense<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.670> then<00:03:30.060> he'll<00:03:30.239> have<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
same air defense and then he'll have the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.990 
same air defense and then he'll have the
third<00:03:30.840> lava<00:03:31.170> hound<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.709> come<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.250> if<00:03:32.580> in<00:03:32.760> from

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
a different angle shortly here so you

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.550 
a different angle shortly here so you
can<00:03:35.459> see<00:03:35.700> one<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> lava<00:03:36.270> hounds<00:03:36.660> flying<00:03:37.080> in

much<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:23.010> bunch<00:04:23.250> is<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.760> battery<00:04:24.270> as<00:04:24.450> bad<00:04:24.810> for

much of a bunch is a battery as bad for
a<00:04:25.200> couple<00:04:25.680> reasons<00:04:25.710> reason<00:04:26.400> number<00:04:26.430> one<00:04:26.850> is

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
a couple reasons reason number one is

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.470 
a couple reasons reason number one is
if<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.280> have<00:04:27.400> them<00:04:27.580> bunched<00:04:27.940> up<00:04:28.060> they're<00:04:28.300> more

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
if you have them bunched up they're more

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.840 
if you have them bunched up they're more
vulnerable<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:29.110> splash<00:04:29.560> damage<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:30.250> wizard

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
vulnerable to splash damage a wizard

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.520 
vulnerable to splash damage a wizard
tower<00:04:31.030> for<00:04:31.270> example<00:04:31.690> can<00:04:31.840> take<00:04:31.990> them<00:04:32.170> out<00:04:32.290> and

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
tower for example can take them out and

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.700 
tower for example can take them out and
reason<00:04:33.130> number<00:04:33.160> two<00:04:33.730> is<00:04:33.970> if<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:35.080> comes<00:04:35.230> down<00:04:35.380> to

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
reason number two is if it comes down to

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.050 
reason number two is if it comes down to
the<00:04:35.830> very<00:04:36.010> end<00:04:36.130> of<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.490> raid<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:36.880> you're

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
the very end of the raid and you're

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.460 
the very end of the raid and you're
counting<00:04:37.420> on<00:04:37.480> your<00:04:37.660> balloons<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.170> get<00:04:38.290> your

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
counting on your balloons to get your

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.620 
counting on your balloons to get your
percentage<00:04:38.950> as<00:04:39.130> time<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.580> ticking<00:04:39.970> down<00:04:40.180> if

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
percentage as time is ticking down if

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.030 
percentage as time is ticking down if
your<00:04:40.840> balloons<00:04:41.110> are<00:04:41.290> all<00:04:41.380> clumped<00:04:41.770> up<00:04:41.860> they're

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
your balloons are all clumped up they're

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.380 
your balloons are all clumped up they're
not<00:04:42.070> going<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.340> do<00:04:42.460> anybody<00:04:42.670> any<00:04:43.090> favors

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
not going to do anybody any favors

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.110 
not going to do anybody any favors
because<00:04:44.320> they're<00:04:44.620> very<00:04:44.830> slow-moving<00:04:45.220> so

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
because they're very slow-moving so

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.690 
because they're very slow-moving so
here's<00:04:46.390> the<00:04:46.540> last<00:04:46.810> attack<00:04:47.320> by<00:04:47.800> bit<00:04:48.070> family

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
here's the last attack by bit family

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.630 
here's the last attack by bit family
from<00:04:49.030> clash<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.900> he<00:04:50.260> has<00:04:50.440> another<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:51.010> really

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
from clash and he has another a really

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.000 
from clash and he has another a really
nice<00:04:51.820> attack<00:04:52.210> here<00:04:52.450> once<00:04:52.720> again<00:04:53.140> I<00:04:53.440> have<00:04:53.980> to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
nice attack here once again I have to

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.560 
nice attack here once again I have to
stress<00:04:54.520> that<00:04:54.550> look<00:04:54.940> where<00:04:55.120> he's<00:04:55.300> going<00:04:55.510> to

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
stress that look where he's going to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.560 
stress that look where he's going to
attack<00:04:55.930> from<00:04:56.230> it<00:04:56.650> doesn't<00:04:56.830> seem<00:04:57.340> like<00:04:57.790> the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
attack from it doesn't seem like the

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.870 
attack from it doesn't seem like the
Queen<00:04:58.840> might<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.530> might<00:04:59.710> be<00:04:59.860> targetable<00:05:00.550> from

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
Queen might it might be targetable from

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.240 
Queen might it might be targetable from
where<00:05:01.090> he<00:05:01.210> is<00:05:01.240> going<00:05:01.390> in<00:05:01.900> from<00:05:02.140> in<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.380> in<00:05:02.830> the

should have brought some wall breakers
at<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.460> very<00:05:09.730> least<00:05:10.030> if<00:05:10.330> he<00:05:10.390> wasn't<00:05:11.050> going<00:05:11.170> to

around so kind of an ominous start to

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.020 
around so kind of an ominous start to
this<00:05:17.800> raid<00:05:18.100> but<00:05:18.310> you'll<00:05:18.400> see<00:05:18.670> that<00:05:18.880> he

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
this raid but you'll see that he

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.730 
this raid but you'll see that he
certainly<00:05:19.270> makes<00:05:19.660> up<00:05:19.900> for<00:05:20.110> and<00:05:20.290> he<00:05:20.350> picks<00:05:20.590> off

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
golem on the golem lights are attracting

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.550 
golem on the golem lights are attracting
all<00:05:28.240> the<00:05:28.420> defensive<00:05:28.930> attention

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
all the defensive attention

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.980 
all the defensive attention
so<00:05:29.980> now<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.580> golem<00:05:30.910> eye<00:05:31.120> goes<00:05:31.360> in<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.900> the

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
so now the golem eye goes in and the

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.780 
so now the golem eye goes in and the
Queen's<00:05:32.260> gonna<00:05:32.500> follow<00:05:32.770> suit<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.430> the

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
Queen's gonna follow suit and the

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.790 
Queen's gonna follow suit and the
Queen's<00:05:34.060> actually<00:05:34.570> gonna<00:05:34.720> go<00:05:34.930> ahead<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.470> take

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
Queen's actually gonna go ahead and take

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.310 
Queen's actually gonna go ahead and take
out<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.130> opposing<00:05:36.610> Queen<00:05:36.880> only<00:05:37.120> level<00:05:37.450> 4<00:05:37.540> and

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
out the opposing Queen only level 4 and

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.810 
out the opposing Queen only level 4 and
then<00:05:38.410> she's<00:05:38.530> gonna<00:05:38.590> get<00:05:38.770> locked<00:05:39.040> on<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.520> that

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
then she's gonna get locked on to that

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.060 
then she's gonna get locked on to that
gold<00:05:40.480> mine<00:05:40.750> so<00:05:41.020> she<00:05:41.080> doesn't<00:05:41.500> get<00:05:41.950> an

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
gold mine so she doesn't get an

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.190 
gold mine so she doesn't get an
opportunity<00:05:42.760> to<00:05:42.910> take<00:05:43.090> out<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.450> air<00:05:43.600> defense

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
opportunity to take out the air defense

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.010 
opportunity to take out the air defense
so<00:05:44.740> things<00:05:45.010> are<00:05:45.190> not<00:05:45.400> looking<00:05:45.640> that<00:05:46.060> that<00:05:46.720> good

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
so things are not looking that that good

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.950 
so things are not looking that that good
this<00:05:47.620> early<00:05:48.010> on<00:05:48.160> but<00:05:48.370> luckily<00:05:48.640> the<00:05:49.360> base<00:05:49.630> is

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
this early on but luckily the base is

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.390 
this early on but luckily the base is
fairly<00:05:50.320> easy<00:05:50.530> because<00:05:52.620> Justin<00:05:53.620> here<00:05:53.890> breaks

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
fairly easy because Justin here breaks

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.880 
fairly easy because Justin here breaks
the<00:05:54.670> cardinal<00:05:55.180> rule<00:05:55.420> and<00:05:55.750> he<00:05:55.900> has<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.380> Expos

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
the cardinal rule and he has the Expos

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.590 
the cardinal rule and he has the Expos
facing<00:05:57.370> down<00:05:57.640> never<00:05:58.060> really<00:05:58.270> want<00:05:58.450> to<00:05:58.510> have

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
facing down never really want to have

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.420 
facing down never really want to have
the<00:05:58.690> expose<00:05:59.020> facing<00:05:59.440> down<00:05:59.650> as<00:05:59.890> a<00:05:59.920> townhall<00:06:00.400> 9

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
the expose facing down as a townhall 9

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.660 
the expose facing down as a townhall 9
no<00:06:01.420> matter<00:06:01.600> what<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.960> situation<00:06:02.110> is<00:06:02.740> so<00:06:03.190> those

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
no matter what the situation is so those

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.730 
no matter what the situation is so those
for<00:06:04.000> Tesla's<00:06:04.480> argument<00:06:04.990> create<00:06:05.230> a<00:06:05.350> little<00:06:05.560> bit

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
for Tesla's argument create a little bit

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.410 
for Tesla's argument create a little bit
of<00:06:05.860> a<00:06:05.920> problem<00:06:06.190> for<00:06:06.340> Biv<00:06:06.640> or<00:06:06.820> but<00:06:07.210> he's<00:06:07.300> gonna

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
of a problem for Biv or but he's gonna

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.210 
of a problem for Biv or but he's gonna
attack<00:06:07.780> this<00:06:07.930> base<00:06:08.140> from<00:06:08.290> all<00:06:08.530> angles<00:06:08.830> he<00:06:09.130> has

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
attack this base from all angles he has

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.670 
attack this base from all angles he has
another<00:06:09.460> fleet<00:06:10.270> of<00:06:10.450> balloons<00:06:10.840> coming<00:06:11.230> in<00:06:11.470> from

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
another fleet of balloons coming in from

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.740 
another fleet of balloons coming in from
the<00:06:11.770> north-east<00:06:12.250> as<00:06:12.820> you<00:06:12.940> can<00:06:13.120> see<00:06:13.390> and<00:06:13.630> then

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
the north-east as you can see and then

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.430 
the north-east as you can see and then
he<00:06:13.840> has<00:06:13.990> his<00:06:14.140> lava<00:06:14.410> lava<00:06:14.920> hounds<00:06:15.640> coming<00:06:16.180> in

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
he has his lava lava hounds coming in

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.830 
he has his lava lava hounds coming in
leading<00:06:17.440> the<00:06:17.560> way<00:06:17.740> for<00:06:17.770> another<00:06:18.460> last<00:06:19.180> phase

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
leading the way for another last phase

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.530 
leading the way for another last phase
of<00:06:20.160> balloons<00:06:21.160> and<00:06:21.490> lava<00:06:21.850> hound<00:06:22.150> in<00:06:22.420> the

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
of balloons and lava hound in the

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.610 
of balloons and lava hound in the
north-west

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
north-west

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.140 
north-west
so<00:06:23.980> he's<00:06:24.100> attacking<00:06:24.400> it<00:06:24.640> from<00:06:24.790> every<00:06:25.120> angle

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
so he's attacking it from every angle

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.420 
so he's attacking it from every angle
those<00:06:25.840> balloons<00:06:26.260> are<00:06:26.500> slowly<00:06:26.860> moving<00:06:27.130> their

clump of balloons there he's also
sitting<00:06:33.310> on<00:06:33.400> two<00:06:33.640> balloons<00:06:33.910> it<00:06:34.060> should<00:06:34.210> be

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
sitting on two balloons it should be

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.270 
sitting on two balloons it should be
noted<00:06:34.690> now<00:06:35.110> if<00:06:35.260> he<00:06:35.380> had<00:06:35.470> gotten<00:06:35.740> that<00:06:36.010> air

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
defense down things would be looking a

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.870 
defense down things would be looking a
lot<00:06:38.169> better<00:06:38.230> right<00:06:38.740> now<00:06:38.800> but<00:06:38.980> thankfully<00:06:39.700> like

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
lot better right now but thankfully like

I said those

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.110 
I said those
expos<00:06:41.200> are<00:06:41.380> facing<00:06:41.770> down<00:06:42.010> so<00:06:42.370> he<00:06:42.820> doesn't<00:06:42.880> have

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
expos are facing down so he doesn't have
