 / b / of multiplication in aspa 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.040
 a by d 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.370
 we write the + sign 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.190
 multiply in aspa b by c 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.380
 then we multiply the denominators b 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.380
 by d 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.509

 two thirds plus one quarter 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.570
 multiply in a row two by four 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.570
 the result is 8 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.060
 we wrote 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.060
 the plus sign 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.320
 multiply in 3- by-1 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.039
 the result is 3 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.780
 We multiply the denominators 3 by 4 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.780
 the result is 12 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.380
 we operate the numerator 83 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.320
 the result is 11 then at the end it 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.320

 in aspa a by d 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.970
 we write the minus sign 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.270
 multiply in aspa b by c 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.550
 then we multiply the denominators b 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.550
 by d 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.270

 two fifths minus three sevenths 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.120
 multiply on the 2-by-7 blade 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.120
 the result is 14 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:12.280
 we write the minus sign we multiply 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.280
 in blade 5 x 3 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.410
 fifteen 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.260
 then we multiply the denominators 5 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.840
 for 7 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.840
 the result 35 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.360
 we operate the numerator 14 minus 15 gives us 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.620
 minus 1 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.799
 The final result is 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.799
