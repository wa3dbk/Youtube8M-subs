00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it so that we pick two contestants each

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.859 
it so that we pick two contestants each
week<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> those<00:01:35.729> two<00:01:35.939> contestants<00:01:36.479> actually

face<00:01:37.140> off<00:01:37.409> head-to-head<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.490> game<00:01:38.700> earlier

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
face off head-to-head in a game earlier

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.090 
face off head-to-head in a game earlier
in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> day<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.290> winner<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.860> game

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
in the day and the winner of that game

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.889 
in the day and the winner of that game
ends<00:01:41.490> up<00:01:41.579> facing<00:01:42.030> me<00:01:42.180> later<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> evening

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
in the eventual pink slips game so it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.289 
in the eventual pink slips game so it
basically<00:01:46.020> gives<00:01:46.470> me<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:47.009> chance<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.149> guess

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
basically gives me a chance to I guess

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.690 
basically gives me a chance to I guess
see<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.380> better<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> two<00:01:50.100> people<00:01:50.490> because

we<00:01:50.820> might<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.180> somebody<00:01:51.479> who's<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:51.689> good

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
we might have somebody who's really good

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.149 
we might have somebody who's really good
and<00:01:52.140> somebody<00:01:52.380> who's<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.560> bad<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
unfortunately the person that's probably

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.630 
unfortunately the person that's probably
bad<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.799> game<00:01:55.829> isn't<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.549> able

best<00:01:58.950> competition<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.790> can<00:02:00.060> obviously<00:02:00.509> we

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
best competition that I can obviously we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.350 
best competition that I can obviously we
could<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.369> 32<00:02:02.369> team<00:02:02.640> tournament<00:02:03.090> or

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
could do like a 32 team tournament or

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.700 
could do like a 32 team tournament or
something<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.869> every<00:02:04.229> week<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:04.560> it's

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
something like that every week but it's

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.530 
something like that every week but it's
just<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.399> too<00:02:05.490> much<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.969> try<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.270> put<00:02:06.390> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
just it's too much to try and put that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.880 
just it's too much to try and put that
together<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.020> I've<00:02:07.140> been<00:02:07.259> trying<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.740> do

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
together so I've been trying to just do

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.790 
together so I've been trying to just do
to<00:02:08.340> people<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.690> winner<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.989> them<00:02:10.259> faces

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
to people and the winner of them faces

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.920 
to people and the winner of them faces
off<00:02:10.950> against<00:02:11.250> me<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.610> same<00:02:11.910> thing<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.780> we've

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
off against me so same thing like we've

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.580 
off against me so same thing like we've
been<00:02:13.080> doing<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.379> path

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
been doing the path

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.949 
been doing the path
few<00:02:13.830> weeks<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.340> you're<00:02:14.760> chosen<00:02:14.970> one<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.840> you

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
few weeks if you're chosen one of you

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.210 
few weeks if you're chosen one of you
will<00:02:16.110> need<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.290> stream<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.650> game<00:02:16.920> so

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
will need to stream the game so

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.800 
will need to stream the game so
hopefully<00:02:17.760> if<00:02:17.849> you're<00:02:18.000> chosen<00:02:18.209> you're<00:02:18.540> able

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
hopefully if you're chosen you're able

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.420 
hopefully if you're chosen you're able
to<00:02:18.959> if<00:02:19.140> neither<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.250> might

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
to if neither of you can then we might

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.610 
to if neither of you can then we might
have<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.700> move<00:02:20.819> on<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.239> other<00:02:21.269> contestants<00:02:22.170> but

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
have to move on to other contestants but

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.110 
have to move on to other contestants but
usually<00:02:23.099> we've<00:02:23.220> had<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.580> where<00:02:23.700> at<00:02:23.819> least<00:02:23.970> one

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
usually we've had it where at least one

usually we've had it where at least one
person<00:02:24.450> has<00:02:24.660> been<00:02:24.840> able<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.140> stream<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.410> game

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
back but especially considering the fact

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.569 
back but especially considering the fact
that<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:54.209> only<00:02:54.329> two<00:02:54.540> cards<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.620> this<00:02:56.130> week<00:02:56.340> we

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
one of the absolute best defensive

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.229 
one of the absolute best defensive
players<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.620> game<00:03:07.650> other<00:03:08.610> than<00:03:08.730> maybe<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
players in the game other than maybe the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.759 
players in the game other than maybe the
golden<00:03:09.569> tickets<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.019> some<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.319> ultimate

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
golden tickets and some of the ultimate

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.890 
golden tickets and some of the ultimate
legends<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.489> our<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:12.209> might<00:03:12.360> be<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.690> best

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
legends this is our it might be the best

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.500 
legends this is our it might be the best
defensive<00:03:13.470> player<00:03:13.650> in<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.890> game<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.329> an

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
defensive player in the game so it is an

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.449 
defensive player in the game so it is an
absolute<00:03:15.900> monster<00:03:16.140> it's<00:03:16.860> going<00:03:17.099> for<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.340> think

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
absolute monster it's going for I think

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.009 
absolute monster it's going for I think
somewhere<00:03:17.970> around<00:03:18.090> like<00:03:18.389> three<00:03:18.660> hundred<00:03:18.780> and

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
somewhere around like three hundred and

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.410 
somewhere around like three hundred and
fifty<00:03:19.350> thousand<00:03:19.889> coins<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.370> PlayStation<00:03:21.000> 4<00:03:21.239> so

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
fifty thousand coins on PlayStation 4 so

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.660 
fifty thousand coins on PlayStation 4 so
still<00:03:21.720> has<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> ton<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.350> value<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.160> then<00:03:23.579> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
still has a ton of value and then the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.220 
still has a ton of value and then the
other<00:03:23.700> card<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.389> we're<00:03:24.510> playing<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.200> a

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
other card that we're playing for is a

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.750 
other card that we're playing for is a
card<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.620> you've<00:03:25.739> seen<00:03:25.980> me<00:03:26.160> using<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
card that you've seen me using for the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.729 
card that you've seen me using for the
past<00:03:26.970> couple<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.480> weeks<00:03:27.540> here<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.109> pink<00:03:28.440> slips

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
past couple of weeks here on pink slips

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.410 
past couple of weeks here on pink slips
and<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.340> my<00:03:29.370> head<00:03:29.639> to<00:03:29.730> head<00:03:29.880> games<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.299> things

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
and in my head to head games and things

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.809 
and in my head to head games and things
like<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.139> guess<00:03:32.069> we<00:03:32.370> are<00:03:32.519> going<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.730> be

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
like that I guess we are going to be

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.360 
like that I guess we are going to be
playing<00:03:32.940> for<00:03:33.420> golden<00:03:34.200> ticket<00:03:34.560> Cam<00:03:34.799> Newton<00:03:35.220> now

playing for golden ticket Cam Newton now

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.460 
playing for golden ticket Cam Newton now
this<00:03:35.549> is<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.760> plus<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.299> strength<00:03:36.780> Cam<00:03:37.109> Newton

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
this is the plus to strength Cam Newton

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.069 
this is the plus to strength Cam Newton
it<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:38.000> admittedly<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.660> cheaper<00:03:40.049> of

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
it is admittedly it is the cheaper of

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.449 
it is admittedly it is the cheaper of
the<00:03:40.200> two<00:03:40.290> it's<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.650> one<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.889> I<00:03:40.950> have<00:03:41.190> and

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
the two it's the one that I have and

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.610 
the two it's the one that I have and
it's<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.639> one<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.849> i've<00:03:41.970> been<00:03:42.120> using<00:03:42.329> but<00:03:43.079> to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
it's the one that i've been using but to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.830 
it's the one that i've been using but to
me<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:44.160> actually<00:03:44.669> think<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.480> card<00:03:45.750> is

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
me I actually think that this card is

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.870 
me I actually think that this card is
getting<00:03:46.079> really<00:03:46.500> undervalued<00:03:46.889> by<00:03:47.340> people

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
getting really undervalued by people

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.979 
getting really undervalued by people
because<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.269> know<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.419> lot<00:03:48.510> of<00:03:48.660> people<00:03:48.780> really

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
because I know a lot of people really

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.990 
because I know a lot of people really
like<00:03:49.349> that<00:03:49.500> plus<00:03:49.709> two<00:03:49.950> speed<00:03:50.250> normally<00:03:50.819> I'm

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
like that plus two speed normally I'm

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.940 
like that plus two speed normally I'm
all<00:03:51.180> about<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.540> plus<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.930> speed<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:52.739> if<00:03:52.859> you

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
all about the plus to speed but if you

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.699 
all about the plus to speed but if you
watched<00:03:53.160> my<00:03:53.310> videos<00:03:53.790> on<00:03:54.090> like<00:03:54.870> defensive<00:03:55.380> line

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
watched my videos on like defensive line

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.190 
watched my videos on like defensive line
defensive<00:03:56.669> ends<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.389> things<00:03:57.599> like<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.840> in

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
defensive ends and things like that in

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.289 
defensive ends and things like that in
the<00:03:58.290> game<00:03:58.470> I'm<00:03:58.980> gonna<00:03:59.130> tell<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.519> guys<00:03:59.669> I<00:03:59.970> think

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
the game I'm gonna tell you guys I think

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.490 
the game I'm gonna tell you guys I think
strength<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.959> one<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> most

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
strength is one of the most

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.909 
strength is one of the most
underutilized<00:04:02.340> or<00:04:03.030> undervalued<00:04:03.650> things<00:04:04.650> in

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
underutilized or undervalued things in

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.220 
underutilized or undervalued things in
the<00:04:05.069> game<00:04:05.220> because<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:06.329> is<00:04:06.569> an<00:04:06.690> attribute<00:04:06.840> that

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
the game because it is an attribute that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.289 
the game because it is an attribute that
goes<00:04:07.560> into<00:04:07.799> all<00:04:08.160> kinds<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:08.880> different<00:04:09.030> things

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299
