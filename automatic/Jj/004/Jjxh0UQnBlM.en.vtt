00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
could basically just choose it so this

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.450 
could basically just choose it so this
is<00:01:09.759> for<00:01:10.030> board<00:01:10.240> members<00:01:10.450> actually<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:12.250> just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
is for board members actually you just

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.560 
is for board members actually you just
get<00:01:12.670> into<00:01:12.880> some<00:01:13.060> gameplay<00:01:13.509> for<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.840> guys<00:01:15.570> I've

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
get into some gameplay for you guys I've

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.440 
get into some gameplay for you guys I've
been<00:01:16.780> enjoying<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.640> rag<00:01:18.850> doll<00:01:19.090> effect

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
been enjoying the the rag doll effect

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.770 
been enjoying the the rag doll effect
and<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:19.720> think<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.850> is<00:01:21.909> one<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.570> best

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
and I think that this is one of the best

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.700 
and I think that this is one of the best
things<00:01:23.080> ever<00:01:23.409> to<00:01:25.200> reach<00:01:26.200> unturned<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
things ever to reach unturned this

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.389 
things ever to reach unturned this
zombies<00:01:30.159> are<00:01:30.399> you<00:01:31.000> getting<00:01:31.270> pretty<00:01:31.450> close<00:01:34.140> ok

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
zombies are you getting pretty close ok

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.499 
zombies are you getting pretty close ok
so<00:01:36.399> as<00:01:36.580> I<00:01:36.729> say<00:01:36.970> no<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.509> rag<00:01:37.659> dolls<00:01:37.960> are<00:01:39.509> really

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
so as I say no the rag dolls are really

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:49.200 
so as I say no the rag dolls are really
nice<00:01:40.659> actually<00:01:43.979> headshot<00:01:44.979> ok<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.970> rag

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
nice actually headshot ok so the rag

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.559 
nice actually headshot ok so the rag
doll<00:01:49.569> is<00:01:49.929> like<00:01:50.640> zombies<00:01:51.640> are<00:01:51.819> flying<00:01:52.060> area<00:01:52.360> I'm

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
doll is like zombies are flying area I'm

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.080 
doll is like zombies are flying area I'm
not<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.990> show<00:01:53.319> it<00:01:53.530> if<00:01:54.039> it's<00:01:54.220> for<00:01:54.580> all<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.659> all

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
zombies and still other players would be

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.169 
zombies and still other players would be
able<00:01:59.799> to<00:02:00.750> fly<00:02:01.750> this<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:03.310> kind<00:02:03.970> of<00:02:04.090> like

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
able to fly this it's kind of like

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
fly but what I I am really scared about

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.839 
fly but what I I am really scared about
is<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.239> zombies<00:02:11.280> walking<00:02:12.280> over<00:02:13.920> short<00:02:14.920> walls

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
is the zombies walking over short walls

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.940 
is the zombies walking over short walls
and<00:02:16.150> stuff<00:02:16.330> like<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.569> before<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.590> was<00:02:17.620> easy

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
and stuff like that before it was easy

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.280 
and stuff like that before it was easy
to<00:02:18.150> trick<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.300> zombies<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.870> could<00:02:20.050> run

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
to trick the zombies you could run

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.010 
to trick the zombies you could run
inside<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:21.099> let<00:02:21.670> them<00:02:21.819> go<00:02:22.209> inside<00:02:22.629> and<00:02:22.810> run

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
inside then let them go inside and run

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.650 
inside then let them go inside and run
outside<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.849> stuff<00:02:24.849> like<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.330> then

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
outside and stuff like that and then

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.780 
outside and stuff like that and then
it'd<00:02:26.200> be<00:02:26.730> escaping<00:02:27.730> more<00:02:28.030> easily<00:02:28.330> but<00:02:29.519> co<00:02:30.519> fair

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
it'd be escaping more easily but co fair

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.300 
it'd be escaping more easily but co fair
that<00:02:30.970> zombie<00:02:31.330> flied<00:02:33.090> soon

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that zombie flied soon

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.580
