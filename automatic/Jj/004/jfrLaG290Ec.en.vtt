00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
out with I had to change the length of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.320 
out with I had to change the length of
the<00:02:23.170> belt<00:02:23.440> because<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:24.360> his<00:02:25.360> motor<00:02:25.690> is

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
the belt because that his motor is

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.320 
the belt because that his motor is
slightly<00:02:28.330> smaller<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.770> ran<00:02:30.640> an<00:02:30.820> adjustment

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
slightly smaller and I ran an adjustment

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.760 
slightly smaller and I ran an adjustment
ring<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:33.090> took<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.120> belt<00:02:34.450> that's<00:02:34.660> about<00:02:35.140> an<00:02:35.470> inch

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
ring so took a belt that's about an inch

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:44.560 
ring so took a belt that's about an inch
or<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.989> shorter

powered<00:03:37.230> by<00:03:37.650> wall<00:03:37.980> wart<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.459> I'll<00:03:38.610> plug<00:03:38.820> that

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
powered by wall wart and I'll plug that

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.670 
powered by wall wart and I'll plug that
in<00:03:39.270> here<00:03:40.550> okay<00:03:41.550> I<00:03:41.810> hope<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.050> can<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.530> is

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
in here okay I hope you can see it is

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.280 
in here okay I hope you can see it is
blue<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:48.510> course<00:03:48.750> we're<00:03:48.930> out<00:03:49.050> here<00:03:49.230> in

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
blue the of course we're out here in

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.140 
blue the of course we're out here in
sunlight<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.090> may<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.300> be<00:03:51.480> extremely<00:03:52.410> visible

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
sunlight so may not be extremely visible

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.940 
sunlight so may not be extremely visible
but<00:03:54.150> that's<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:55.519> tachometer<00:03:57.650> let's<00:03:58.650> get<00:03:58.830> it

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
but that's the tachometer let's get it

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.990 
but that's the tachometer let's get it
started<00:03:59.220> here

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.589 

okay

okay

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:17.500 
okay
see<00:04:09.140> it's<00:04:09.370> 495<00:04:11.230> rpm<00:04:12.849> and<00:04:13.849> slow<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.209> down<00:04:16.510> that's

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
see it's 495 rpm and slow it down that's

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.100 
see it's 495 rpm and slow it down that's
about

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:31.740 

about<00:04:23.740> 200<00:04:24.250> rpm<00:04:25.349> on<00:04:26.349> a<00:04:26.560> 14-inch<00:04:27.460> wheel<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:30.750> you

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
about 200 rpm on a 14-inch wheel so you

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.110 
about 200 rpm on a 14-inch wheel so you
can<00:04:31.960> figure<00:04:32.229> your<00:04:32.680> surface<00:04:33.400> speed<00:04:33.580> per<00:04:33.849> minute

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
can figure your surface speed per minute

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.920 
can figure your surface speed per minute
from<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:35.669> I'm<00:04:36.669> going<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.389> put<00:04:37.569> a<00:04:37.599> chart

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
from that and I'm going to put a chart

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.650 
from that and I'm going to put a chart
up<00:04:38.110> here<00:04:38.169> for<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:39.520> various<00:04:39.940> speeds<00:04:40.360> in<00:04:40.630> the

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
up here for the various speeds in the

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.450 
up here for the various speeds in the
surface<00:04:41.139> feet<00:04:41.349> per<00:04:41.560> minute<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:44.340> haven't<00:04:45.340> done

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
surface feet per minute and haven't done

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.469 
surface feet per minute and haven't done
that<00:04:45.639> yet<00:04:45.880> down<00:04:46.690> below<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.080> can<00:04:47.289> see<00:04:47.470> the
