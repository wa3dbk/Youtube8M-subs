00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
honestly it's just not worth it if

bad<00:03:12.900> move<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.469> let<00:03:13.680> them<00:03:13.889> build<00:03:14.609> this<00:03:14.819> in<00:03:15.000> China

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
bad move to let them build this in China

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.390 
bad move to let them build this in China
again<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.609> know<00:03:17.729> the<00:03:17.879> Chinese<00:03:18.120> not<00:03:19.250> not<00:03:20.250> to

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
again you know the Chinese not not to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.280 
again you know the Chinese not not to
really<00:03:20.639> rag<00:03:20.849> on<00:03:21.060> them<00:03:21.269> but<00:03:21.449> you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:22.169> they

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
really rag on them but you know they

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.659 
really rag on them but you know they
don't<00:03:22.470> exactly<00:03:22.680> pay<00:03:22.979> their<00:03:23.159> workers<00:03:23.280> well

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
they really just don't understand

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.819 
they really just don't understand
quality<00:03:26.729> control<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.500> bokor<00:03:28.500> when<00:03:28.709> they're

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
quality control and bokor when they're

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.469 
quality control and bokor when they're

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
bringing these knives and I guess they

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.179 
bringing these knives and I guess they
don't<00:03:30.930> understand<00:03:31.379> quality<00:03:31.680> control<00:03:31.979> either

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
don't understand quality control either

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.939 
don't understand quality control either
so<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:33.389> know<00:03:33.509> if<00:03:34.019> I<00:03:34.169> were<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.409> maker<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.889> I

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
so you know if I were the maker and I

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.099 
so you know if I were the maker and I
were<00:03:35.069> selling<00:03:35.519> licensing<00:03:36.150> my<00:03:36.269> design<00:03:36.659> that's

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
were selling licensing my design that's

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.409

like<00:03:37.349> my<00:03:37.560> flagship<00:03:38.159> design<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.849> would<00:03:38.970> insist

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
like my flagship design I would insist

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.390 
like my flagship design I would insist
on<00:03:39.569> them<00:03:39.720> making<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.199> in<00:03:40.409> the<00:03:40.949> best<00:03:41.129> place

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
on them making it in the best place

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.849
