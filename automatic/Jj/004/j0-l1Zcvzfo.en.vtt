00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
we are in windows server eight and I'm

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.169 
we are in windows server eight and I'm
going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.100> show<00:00:02.190> you<00:00:02.310> how<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.550> promote<00:00:02.790> a

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
going to show you how to promote a

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.309 
going to show you how to promote a
server<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:04.110> be<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.770> domain<00:00:05.160> controller<00:00:05.190> in

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
server to be a domain controller in

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.330 
server to be a domain controller in
previous<00:00:07.319> versions<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.799> would<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:08.040> go<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.220> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
previous versions you would just go to a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.759 
previous versions you would just go to a
command<00:00:08.730> prompt<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.269> type<00:00:09.330> DC<00:00:09.960> promo<00:00:10.530> but

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
command prompt and type DC promo but

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.089 
command prompt and type DC promo but
that<00:00:10.980> no<00:00:11.219> longer<00:00:11.370> works<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:12.150> server<00:00:12.750> eight<00:00:13.099> so

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
that no longer works in server eight so

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.039 
that no longer works in server eight so
we'll<00:00:14.370> go<00:00:14.490> ahead<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:15.150> do<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> little

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
we'll go ahead and do it a little

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.960 
we'll go ahead and do it a little
differently<00:00:16.730> we<00:00:17.730> will<00:00:18.000> click<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:18.840> server

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
differently we will click on server

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.769
