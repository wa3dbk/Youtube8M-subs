00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.660
 all harm from ohnickel and in this video i 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 I will continue to work on global 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.840
 map and oddly enough it will also 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.250
 most likely about taking a trap but here 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.000
 there will also be about capturing capture well let's begin 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:33.559
 everything in order our setup consists of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:40.100
 heavy tanks is 6 100 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:47.969
 457 250 g1 would be a chat and because then you 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.450
 light and pdf page 5 like a good good 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.469
 Damager 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:59.039
 and what we do so is 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.980
 that we initially mutual income positions 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 until we continue where 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.210
 siesta will eat 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.970
 going to h1 square behind this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 a house 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:19.009
 created drum tanks going 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.920
 house and ch3 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.270
 through and we need to understand if the opponent 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.780
 this one goes square 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.990
 well enough ethernet 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.150
 siesta eggs 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.930
 go straight ahead to d1 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:41.810
 distracting the offensive group yes I 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.610
 That e 100 enough problems deliver 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.479
 thread they dance for the night damage 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.080
 Board all such a group of reels 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.680
 manifests like this and starts 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:02.530
 disassemble them by 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.600
 the rear most likely appears here from 4 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.360
 but definitely can't make out 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.390
 scary fast us and we are not distracted 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.390
 on it and watch the video 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.540
 the judges that we form a group 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.209
 I'm going ahead 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.870
 since all the same green tanks lay for 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.870
 two sheets 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:43.090
 divide our side 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:45.579
 for the hundredth notice the towers pierce I'm leaving 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.629
 to recharge and understand that 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.629
 start taking 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.310
 grabbing a global map is one day 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.560
 victories 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.290
 if mom did not have time to return earlier 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.739
 even the destruction of a certain 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.049
 part 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:09.000
 no part of the enemy was not cleaned 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:10.590
 habitually and accordingly we 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.109
 back light tanks 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.540
 jenek tanks tanks naturally come 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:19.960
 faster begin to eat churn capture 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.300
 they do it accordingly 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.780
 and here I will tell in the development of capture well 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.350
 I hope everyone knows about it but often in 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.600
 Maternity hospital is different when there are many 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.730
 tanks will see but sleep need to shoot 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.209
 different tanks 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.680
 to churn off each one 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.120
 certain capture need 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.180
 good exactly destroy let's give by 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.879
 footsteps can just play it on 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.829
 to capture 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:58.150
 I find all recharges accordingly 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.150
 also screw on recharge 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:07.090
 implemented pashink turrets 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:10.239
 then you take in order not to be better than me and 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.590
 here actually comes finishing moves 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:19.320
 the opponent is such a video turned out 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:23.340
 the thing is like someone it will be useful 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.340
 immediately and I hope that 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.400
 interested in viewing actual 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.180
 videos and on the global tarot map to all 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.180
 thank you all bye
