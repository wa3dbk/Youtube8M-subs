00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.299
 good to all I'm poché and good here you 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.120
 I bring a video of dragon ball z h no 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.090
 bears and good is to teach you in the 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.580
 tour I'm doing for ps3 thanks 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.400
 to the help of angelillo who believes that 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.770
 wonder and good I wanted to teach you in 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.570
 concrete this function that would be for 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.760
 change our character that we have 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.950
 created when we are in the selection 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.440
 of characters change ours by 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.560
 of which we can select either 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.350
 for other characters that can not be 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.650
 use in the game worth characters 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.360
 like the monkeys that we can not choose 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.670
 the enemies that come out with some 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.980
 enemies that do not come out in the history of 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.580
 emigrates the bad one from the end of the game 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.700
 we could also use as you see is 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.920
 robot is worth the frog the capsule of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.879
 is from when it came to plant to ground 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.830
 there was also a little bit here the bird 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.900
 ok we can use some 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.160
 characters as I say we can 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.960
 put but they are not 100% playable worth 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.180
 sometimes it stays like the character 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.550
 nailed while we are fighting or something 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.000
 of that anyway then 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.950
 you will have some some videos of how 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 use some characters and well then 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 you will see that some have attacks 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.410
 that I have in my character and others 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.270
 characters will have the ones that we say that 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.340
 they would have in history 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.740
 the monkeys for example already carry their 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.049
 attacks 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.090
 and then if I put the frog for example 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.979
 or the ship would have the attacks that 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.229
 I have opposite my created character 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.899
 ok we could even transform it into 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.700
 super saiyan and those things although you'll see 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.130
 that looks a bit and begins to put 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.710
 the chosen character when what 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.539
 we become super saiyan if it is not a 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.540
 sayán is usually put the color red or 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.280
 black vale 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.960
 but good as you are seeing are 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.330
 all these characters 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.730
 latour of the moment will be private I do not know if 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.400
 I'll publish it in case the public 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.020
 will be in the forum and nothing else I hope that 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.430

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.380

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.920
