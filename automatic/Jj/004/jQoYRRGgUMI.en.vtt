00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 DFG Science TV function by diversity pioneering work in China the largest at 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.660
 DAX Peter Menne on biodiversity 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:13.859
 to find out how the diversity of tree species work 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.550
 Forest ecosystem, researchers plan a large-scale experiment 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.989
 on this area with a size of 50 hectares that equates to about 70 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.010
 Football fields used to be huge wood plantations with fast 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.879
 grow the conifers 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.289
 After clear-cutting this monoculture is now supposed to be a colorful mix of trees 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.820
 be planted 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.140
 St 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.640
 is now the right one these new forests will be very different from the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.030
 Differ preferences 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.400
 We will mix up to 16 species in different areas 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.440
 Dick ship all this was prepared last year and the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.840
 Trees grown in a nearby nursery is clarified that Oberried 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.100
 criticized 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.990
 the researchers claim that biodiversity is a mixture 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.610
 Tree species for consuming a bankruptcy team is important 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.390
 this assumption is based on the so-called niche theory 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.680
 accordingly, there is an optimal range for each species along an environment 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.010
 kg Emden that can be, for example, the light in one far 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.000
 In the area of ​​this environment kg can end certain species especially well 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390
 grow and thus multiply 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.770
 the niches of the species so their existence areas are along the environmental 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 mapped differently 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.140
 if two species grow together on one surface then that is 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.680
 The ducks are so high that together they have the environment 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.670
 for example, make better use of the light, this is better at four 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.480
 species 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.540
 Have 8 or even 16 types 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.000
 According to this theory, the environment could be the fear that it will be used 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 "The more species occur together 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.800
 The international research team discussed for a long time how to do this 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.190
 Can test theory in practice 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.920
 this was not a special challenge, as in previous experiments 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.770
 short-lived and short-lived species are used but dreams and 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.379
 shrubbery 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.680
 The researchers are particularly interested in how the trees will grow 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.109
 they used a variety of tree species in a nursery 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:23.589
 the retrospective Renz profits 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.959
 to go to farms or the trees have to be ported to Franz here 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.169
 the beginning of a great logistic operation 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.079
 They will not just pull you completely in this large area 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.679
 but each tree will see its individual place 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.969
 have a very specific place in each of the logs 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.090
 that means that the workers are voting according to a predetermined plan 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:46.159
 have to work out turmoil 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.159
 To be with title is way artwork credit 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.669
 As with the casting game sinking ships, the area was in rows 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.339
 and split 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.569
 400 boxes are planted in each box 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.249
 Therefore, the boxes must be large enough to later one 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.449
 to be able to accommodate a sufficient number of mature trees 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.309
 The experiment is divided into sets of ten apartments each 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:14.729
 The 400 trees of the same species can therefore belong to one 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.189
 Pray monoculture 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.799
 of every kind there is such a monoculture so 16 in total 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.370
 Each two cards are then mixed so that there are 8 different two types 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.370
 Give mixtures 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.649
 as well four different four kinds of mixtures 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:39.150
 two different 8 hard mixes and a mix with all 16 Appel 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.200
 at which point which mixture is applied and where exactly each 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.729
 single tree comes to stand within a surface is left to chance 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.929
 the result of this experiment will show us how natural because 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.760
 System works based on that, researchers can make suggestions 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:03.029
 work again can be managed and used much better 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:08.139
 the experiment is long term and an evaluation is about 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.499
 Generations of scientists success 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:15.189
 a perspective that has a tradition in China to say it with Confucius words 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.499
 do you think of a year very lonely come 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.699
 Do you think of a decade planning a tree 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.759
 do you think of a century would be the people 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:35.899
