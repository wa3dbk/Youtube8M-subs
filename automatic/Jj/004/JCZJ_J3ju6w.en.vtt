00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 so the purpose of these two little videos 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.580
 it's going to be showing you how 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.040
 correctly position the thumb of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.420
 left hand to make less effort 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.670
 and have easier positions it's 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.260
 true that generally speaking we do not know 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.029
 too much how to position it given 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.859
 that we look and arry in habit 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.020
 to look at it or face it and not back 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.279
 which is a good habit certainly 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.189
 but in any case we do not see at all 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.519
 how do their push position on the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.680
 guitar 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.890
 so we'll go straight to one of the 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.750
 greatest difficulties to which are 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.190
 confronted the beginners ie 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.300
 that we make the bars and so finally barred 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.250
 imagine for example a major 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 blocked we could say we must 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 to pose 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.399
 the index well between the bars then 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.890
 we position his fingers here and we 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.060
 position well his thumb in the middle the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.770
 hand and why not in the middle of the handle 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.780
 but then I'm going off and I want 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.330
 to say wait for the thumb it's fine to 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.010
 flat here I do a beautiful swamp 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.990
 and I can assure you that at this moment 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.750
 I have the same problem as a beginner 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.250
 that is to say I say to myself wow I will not 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.140
 to work like that because that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.460
 hurts the truth is that when we 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.770
 gets used to playing guitar 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.450
 it's not just that you get muscle or 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.860
 fingers and hands of course we get 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.540
 muscle a little but it's mostly we 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.150
 will learn to take positions that 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.190
 are a lot less tiring and for 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.660
 to make a bar is actually me I'm not going 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.490
 at all played like this to do the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.140
 bars and so I first go to you 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.310
 show how I play the bar and is 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.340
 then I went to see right away the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.340
 difference 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.280
 the difference you see it all from 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.280
 afterwards pushes it instead of being in the middle 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.460
 vertically it is completely in 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.530
 oblique to about two-thirds of the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.899
 sleeve secondly if you look 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.799
 now the front of the hand here you 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.270
 notice that the index is not 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.610
 parallel between the two bars in 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.770
 does it's a little bit on the side there 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.350
 is oblique so the thumb and in 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.960
 oblique and by whose index is in 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.670
 oblique between the two bars and the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.780
 Mamette bed obliquely from 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.600
 there the position of the floor she is 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.250
 a lot so easy to do that we get 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.019
 much less tired then I you 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.540
 recalls one if you have not seen the 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.000
 blow is watching it video 05 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.069
 a good position if there is one thing to 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.030
 remember that especially in position 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.190
 folk 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.200
 you have to advance the advanced guitar the 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.000
 handle like that we do not want to tackle 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.739
 right now that relaxes the wrist 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.920
 so if you move the guitar 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.750
 enough that you put the index one 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.910
 type an oblique and that you put the 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.290
 inch forget that two-thirds of the 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.019
 sleeve from the bottom you will see 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.570
 a suite that bars and so a 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.340
 pleasure to do them and if you play in 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.540
 power strings ie just this 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.810
 would be two low bass body that's 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.810
 the same 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.770
 here you have seen the oblique thumb 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.840
 and obliquely and in addition it is turned 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.310
 an easy so I'll show you 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.020
 now by cons if we play a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.520
 little bit solo how do we do by 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.750
 example a position that I called 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.060
 simply position the handle of 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.680
 hello how are you 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.600
 the thumb just to name see is 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.050
 not at all under the handle 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.530
 in the middle he is posed above he exceeds 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.410
 of the handle 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.800
 and here we have a very flexible position 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.370
 like that and we'll be able to slide long 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.370
 penguin 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.170
 2 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.819
 we 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:46.870
 2 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:48.430
 and we can empty them no problem 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.349
 of speed obviously in this 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.319
 deposition he no problem to find 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:56.319
 their marks and so here we play 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.489
 like that then that's the little thing 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.590
 whose brice is very flexible 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.989
 see we can climb December it's 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.719
 when we go down to down 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.099
 towards the serious ones that is to say climb towards 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.409
 the serious guard corps 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.060
 you will see that the hand of this 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:14.079
 position a little handshake she 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.280
 will be like that naturally 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.590
 which makes sense at the same time the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.970
 obviously grows it will turn it's to 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.960
 to say that we must not keep the thumb 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.639
 upright right and in addition we turn it 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.979
 and he speaks a little that he obliquely 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.910
 of the hand see him too is the same 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.360
 like just now for bars 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.949
 to awaken the mecca like that but that's it 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.210
 becomes easy especially if in addition you 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.539
 start playing on the bass strings 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.060
 you have outright thumb that share 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.870
 fan finally the hand that goes into 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.300
 fan pay to have a position 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.830
 much easier so it allows me 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.449
 to make the transition for the second 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.270
 video where I'm going to show you precisely 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.680
 fan position and especially 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.690
 for the piece forbidden games which 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.880
 has the advantage of having approximately 4.5 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.139
 different thumb position whose 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.180
 position of the mountains but also 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.949
 others that I showed you everything from 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.949
 next so I tell you right now
