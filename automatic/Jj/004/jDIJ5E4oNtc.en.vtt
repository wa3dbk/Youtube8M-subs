00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
looking at is 4200 revs carry 156

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.990 
looking at is 4200 revs carry 156
launched<00:01:44.909> 19<00:01:45.899> degrees<00:01:46.229> nearly<00:01:46.740> 20<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> ball

launched 19 degrees nearly 20 and ball
speed<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.420> 108<00:01:49.110> let's<00:01:49.590> give<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.979> another<00:01:50.009> hit

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
speed of 108 let's give that another hit

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.030 
speed of 108 let's give that another hit
so<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.710> slightly<00:01:52.710> more

so<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.519> very<00:02:56.549> similar<00:02:57.030> numbers<00:02:57.269> to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
so you can see very similar numbers to

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.470 
so you can see very similar numbers to
the<00:02:57.660> first<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.049> with<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.290> Proby<00:03:02.239> about<00:03:03.239> hit

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.840 
little less spin and 18 nearly 19 degree
launch<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.859> see<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.100> numbers<00:03:14.400> are<00:03:14.519> very

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
launch so you see the numbers are very

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.690 
launch so you see the numbers are very
similar<00:03:15.799> subject<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.920> where<00:03:17.100> I'm<00:03:17.340> hitting<00:03:17.489> it

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
similar subject to where I'm hitting it

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.729 
similar subject to where I'm hitting it
on<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.910> face<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.630> get<00:03:18.870> one<00:03:19.049> exactly<00:03:19.500> at<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
on the face if I get one exactly at the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.229 
on the face if I get one exactly at the
middle<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.250> did<00:03:20.400> with<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.639> pro<00:03:20.850> b1<00:03:21.209> I

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
middle like I did with the pro b1 I

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.670 
middle like I did with the pro b1 I
think<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.720> would<00:03:21.810> actually<00:03:21.930> see<00:03:24.680> identical

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
think you would actually see identical

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.979 
think you would actually see identical
numbers<00:03:28.670> it's<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.730> stronger<00:03:30.060> hit<00:03:30.329> felt<00:03:30.810> more

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
numbers it's a stronger hit felt more

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.559 
numbers it's a stronger hit felt more
middle<00:03:31.260> e<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.470> me<00:03:32.060> let's<00:03:33.060> see<00:03:33.239> what<00:03:33.359> we<00:03:33.450> get

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
middle e to me let's see what we get

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:39.379 
middle e to me let's see what we get
with<00:03:33.720> outs<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.019> 111<00:03:34.790> 19<00:03:35.790> launched<00:03:36.200> 4500<00:03:37.370> 161<00:03:38.389> so

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
with outs of 111 19 launched 4500 161 so

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.559 
with outs of 111 19 launched 4500 161 so
can<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.900> see<00:03:40.049> what's<00:03:40.200> going<00:03:40.260> on<00:03:40.620> there<00:03:41.359> can<00:03:42.359> I

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
can you see what's going on there can I

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.840 
can you see what's going on there can I
can't<00:03:42.840> feel<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.230> difference<00:03:43.620> when<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.430> hit<00:03:44.670> the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
can't feel the difference when I hit the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.650 
can't feel the difference when I hit the
two<00:03:45.060> arguably<00:03:46.280> but<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:47.880> fun<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> would<00:03:48.510> say

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
two arguably but it's so fun I would say

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.900 
two arguably but it's so fun I would say
that<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:49.200> Nike<00:03:49.560> makes<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.069> slightly<00:03:50.670> louder

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
that the Nike makes a slightly louder

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.410 
that the Nike makes a slightly louder
noise<00:03:51.620> which<00:03:52.620> then<00:03:52.799> makes<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.190> feel<00:03:53.700> like

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
noise which then makes you feel like

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.629 
noise which then makes you feel like
it's<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.840> harder<00:03:55.470> ball<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.160> pro<00:03:56.340> v1

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
it's a harder ball and that the pro v1

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.050 
it's a harder ball and that the pro v1
is<00:03:56.760> softer<00:03:57.329> but<00:03:58.139> for<00:03:58.380> me<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.980> I've<00:03:59.819> done<00:03:59.970> this

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
is softer but for me and I've done this

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.430 
is softer but for me and I've done this
test<00:04:00.269> with<00:04:00.420> drivers<00:04:00.870> I've<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:01.200> doing<00:04:01.380> it

you're telling me he can feel that

you're telling me he can feel that
difference

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
difference

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.920 
difference
well<00:04:13.110> it's<00:04:13.830> feel<00:04:14.190> rather<00:04:15.000> than<00:04:15.330> physical

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
well it's feel rather than physical

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.750 
well it's feel rather than physical
because<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.709> physical<00:04:17.070> numbers<00:04:17.430> with<00:04:17.610> these

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
because the physical numbers with these

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.470 
because the physical numbers with these
are<00:04:18.060> very<00:04:18.390> very<00:04:18.840> similar<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.910> feel<00:04:21.270> can<00:04:21.450> be

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
are very very similar and feel can be

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.570 
are very very similar and feel can be
built<00:04:21.750> around<00:04:21.840> branding<00:04:22.440> beliefs<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.400> what<00:04:23.430> a
