all<00:01:30.929> I<00:01:30.960> did<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:31.710> take<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.640> kayak<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.929> the

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
all I did was take the kayak out of the

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.930 
all I did was take the kayak out of the
equation<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.069> just<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> paddler<00:01:35.819> out

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
equation so it's just the paddler out

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.980 
equation so it's just the paddler out
there<00:01:36.149> with<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> paddles<00:01:36.719> and<00:01:36.840> nothing<00:01:37.200> else

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
there with the paddles and nothing else

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.040 
there with the paddles and nothing else
once<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.680> found<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.010> right<00:01:40.190> paddle<00:01:40.810> all<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:41.840> had

to<00:01:42.140> do<00:01:42.320> was<00:01:42.560> forget<00:01:42.980> everything<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.670> knew<00:01:43.880> about

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910
