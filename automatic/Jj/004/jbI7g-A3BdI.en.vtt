 the for the sport igmg 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.000
 and I want to bring you closer 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.140
 what to look for when buying a power station 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.060
 should pay attention 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.560
 a power station is the ideal 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.779
 Training device for weight training too 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 Home they are great for 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.880
 beginners but also for experienced 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.099
 strength athlete for the beginner offers 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.120
 a power station has the advantage that the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.309
 offers guided movement and thereby 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 Training injury prevents for 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.210
 experienced strength athletes offers one 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.160
 power to the possibility of muscle groups 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.350
 to address specifically and am thereby 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.449
 better opportunities the training goals 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.949
 to realize 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.920
 Generally, a power station offers the 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.989
 advantage that you have the function of many 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.269
 strength training devices united 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.790
 and thus in small space many 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.710
 training opportunities offers at the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.300
 You should buy a power station 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.159
 However, some things to consider 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.680
 first they should go to the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.080
 material quality, however, also pay attention 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.060
 on how the material is processed 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 important is in the adjustment mechanism 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.320
 to make sure that the clean 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.420
 are processed that means also after 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.070
 numerous adjustment your quality 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.289
 Keep them as long as possible 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.090
 have fun with the training device 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.549
 They should be in the upholstery quality 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.140
 make sure that the upholstery is double 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.899
 Sewn are made of a robust 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 artificial leather and as thick as possible 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.950
 have stable back walls 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.369
 and of course they should be on the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.840
 quality of the cables thus pay attention to the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.850
 cables of the cables should be on 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.609
 Steel ropes are made of plastic 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.439
 are sheathed while the rolls are in 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.039
 ideally, of course, ball be stored 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.539
 which of course should be a much 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.109
 more even circulation causes the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.280
 Another one should pay attention to which 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.759
 training possibilities in which form 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.560
 present at the power station 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.320
 providing these kraftstation of body force 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 for example, the possibility the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.940
 upper body very extensive too 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.760
 but also train the hull and the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.340
 legs further offers these kraftstation 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.560
 not only guided exercises but also 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.500
 numerous cables over the also free 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.170
 exercise can be performed 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.980
 for example, is a lateral 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.980
 Cable attached 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.370
 with whom a free training is performed 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.230
 can be 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.819
 especially for experienced 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.709
 weightlifting is very valuable right now 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.829
 this exercise has a higher coordinative 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.060
 claim 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.819
 In addition, this power station offers 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.470
 numerous adjustment options 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.389
 means the upholstery can be at height 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.950
 be adjusted and then the size of the 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.840
 be adapted to exercising 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.730
 but also the back cushion can 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.900
 I will show you now 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.920
 Just like the seat pad 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.930
 is adjusted 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.239
 and now he is optimally suited to mine 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.040
 size adjusted now I can breast 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.040
 press once on this device show 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:21.590
 in the standard version is what post 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:25.010
 now press a classic 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.680
 training form for the chest muscles 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.470
 But you can also use this power station 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:36.409
 the active lens system activate this 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:39.760
 means here is a lock is solved 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:42.409
 The press is unstable on the sides 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.689
 that means one has here now at the 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:50.030
 training a higher coordinative 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:52.010
 Claim as you see I have to 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.970
 stabilize and that resembles the 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.620
 training with the dumbbell offers 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.109
 this power station is two lateral 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:07.609
 Cables that can be easily adjusted 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:09.230
 are operated by a lever the 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.769
 You can either use in connection 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.500
 for example butterflies or came across or 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:20.510
 for example, use individually for the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.130
 Golf swing or other exercise very much 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.199
 it makes sense to extend this 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.030
 the power station via an additional 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.590
 module like in this case one 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.900
 Leg press can also 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.150
 without problems the thigh 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.400
 the thigh muscles or even that 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.070
 be trained butt I hope this 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.870
 video helps you find the right one 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.849
 power station to find and 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.949
 Of course, hope that they too 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:47.539
