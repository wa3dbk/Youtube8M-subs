00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.600
Today I will be making banana puri or kele ki puri.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.440
These are delicious fried puffed Indian bread.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.320
These can be enjoyed both by children and adults.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.580
Banana puris are good for festive occasion, and holidays.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.580
This can be served for breakfast or as a snack.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.440
This is my friends recipe from Hudson or Hayo.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.680
This recipe will make about 40 puris.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.900
For this recipe we need:

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.860
1 ripe banana about 8 inch long

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.560
1/2 cup of sugar

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.240
1 tablespoon of melted butter or ghee

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.720
3 tablespoons of coarsely ground almonds,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.620
I have used 18 almonds.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.400
1/8 teaspoon of coarsely ground cardamom

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.120
Pinch of salt

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.060
3/ 4 cup of whole wheat flour (atta)

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.600
3/4 cup of all purpose flour (maida or plain flour)

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.780
About 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour for rolling.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.240
We also need oil to fry.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.940
This is a simple recipe.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.400
First I will mash the banana

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.300
and then mix all the ingredients together

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.020
to make a firm and smooth dough.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.040
Then roll them in 2 inch diameter and fry.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.400
Banana puri will be ready to serve.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.240
First I will make the dough.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.680
I have already peeled and sliced the banana in a small pieces

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.580
and now I will just mash them.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.920
Mash them really good.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.840
And after mashing banana is about half a cup.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.940
Now I will add the sugar.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.080
Salt

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.620
Almond powder

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.260
Cardamom powder

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.000
And butter.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.360
Mix it well.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.300
Mix it well till everything comes together.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.860
And now I am going to add the flour

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.020
(whole wheat flour)

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.780
All purpose flour

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.280
Again mix them.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.660
Again mix it till everything comes together.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.700
Now I will just oil my finger

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.900
and make the dough.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.560
Dough is looking good.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.660
So now we need to cover this

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.460
and let it rest for about 2 hours.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.960
I have made this dough about 2 hours before

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.960
so dough is ready.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.100
And I am going to divide them in 4 equal parts.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.040
Then take one part roll it between your palm

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.320
and put it in dry flour lightly.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.200
It helps rolling and will not stick to the surface.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.160
Roll it in about 8 inch diameter.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.680
Now if it is start sticking just put little more flour

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.600
and put it over.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.740
We don't want to use too much flour.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.220
So puri shouldn't be very thin.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.340
It's looking right.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.300
Now I am using the cup for cutting

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.000
this will make about 2 inch diameter puris.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.300
But you can use the cookie cutter

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.280
or anything you would like to in any shape and size.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.380
Remove the extras.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.020
Heat is on, medium high.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.180
So first I will check the oil if it is ready

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.040
to do the just put a little piece of dough

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.400
and it's sizzling

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.740
and it should come up slowly.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.820
So oil is looking good.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.820
So I am ready to fry the banana puris.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.840
And don't overcrowd the frying pan.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.760
Let's give them the room to puff up.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.880
And just press them lightly to help them to puff.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.900
Puris should be dark brown both sides

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.880
and it will take about 1.5-2 minutes to fry them.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.760
Let's turn them.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.580
They should be little bit darker brown than what there are right now.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.460
So I will turn them again.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.580
While you are frying them you can smell the banana and cardamom.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:54.340
So you have to turn the puris 3-4 times just to make sure they are done right.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.040
This is looking really good.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.620
And I like to take them out on paper towel

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.540
so it's absorbs some extra oil.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:21.020
This took me maybe little more than 2 minutes  to fry this batch.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.440
Banana puris are ready.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.120
You can serve them hot or at room temperature

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.960
They have a unique banana flavor enhanced with cardamom.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:46.220
Banana puris are especially good for picnic or to take them out for travel.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:47.660
Enjoy.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.060
Thank you.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.640
