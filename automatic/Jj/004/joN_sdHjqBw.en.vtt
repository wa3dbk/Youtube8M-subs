00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.960 
chapter 9 and later on the video you'll
see<00:00:15.750> why<00:00:15.980> now<00:00:16.980> whenever<00:00:17.279> you're<00:00:17.490> farming<00:00:17.880> you

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
see why now whenever you're farming you

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.550 
see why now whenever you're farming you
always<00:00:18.180> want<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.359> take<00:00:18.510> casual<00:00:18.990> difficulty

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
always want to take casual difficulty

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.929 
always want to take casual difficulty
because<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.279> significantly<00:00:20.880> more

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
because you get significantly more

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.340 
because you get significantly more
resources<00:00:21.539> than<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.840> would<00:00:22.050> if<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.289> were

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
resources than you would if you were

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.290 
resources than you would if you were
playing<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.680> impossible<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.430> don't<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.240> if

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
playing on impossible I don't know if

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.759 
playing on impossible I don't know if
this<00:00:24.420> affects<00:00:24.689> key<00:00:24.869> scavenger<00:00:25.289> bugs<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.650> it

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
this affects key scavenger bugs but it

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.410 
this affects key scavenger bugs but it
definitely<00:00:25.890> affects<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> stuff<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.119> pick<00:00:27.240> up

you<00:02:22.140> don't<00:02:22.200> know<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.740> door<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:22.950> here

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
you don't know this door right here

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.850 
you don't know this door right here
every<00:02:24.270> time<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.540> closes<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:25.140> will<00:02:25.290> spawn<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.560> new

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
every time it closes it will spawn a new

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.620 
every time it closes it will spawn a new
resource<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.520> ground<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.450> will<00:02:27.540> be

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
resource on the ground and it will be

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.060 
resource on the ground and it will be
random<00:02:27.959> each<00:02:28.110> time<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:28.770> you're<00:02:28.890> lucky

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.100 
random each time so if you're lucky
you'll<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:30.180> know<00:02:30.270> tungsten<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.959> if

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you'll get a you know tungsten and if

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.260 
you'll get a you know tungsten and if
you're<00:02:31.230> not<00:02:31.350> good<00:02:31.680> scrap<00:02:32.100> metal<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.610> I'm<00:02:33.150> just

you're not good scrap metal so I'm just
gonna<00:02:33.420> speed<00:02:33.660> up<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> video<00:02:33.930> because<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.500> is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680

your dirt scavenger BOTS you return as
well<00:03:40.050> so<00:03:40.830> I'm<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.010> gonna<00:03:41.100> start<00:03:41.370> making<00:03:41.520> my

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
well so I'm just gonna start making my

00:03:41.670 --> 00:04:02.369 
well so I'm just gonna start making my
way<00:03:41.730> back<00:03:41.910> there<00:03:42.270> right<00:03:42.420> now

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.869 

and<00:04:03.379> that's<00:04:04.069> pretty<00:04:04.219> much<00:04:04.370> all<00:04:04.519> there<00:04:04.640> is<00:04:04.670> to

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
and that's pretty much all there is to

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.209 
and that's pretty much all there is to
it<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.269> again<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.170> chose<00:04:06.349> chapter<00:04:06.680> 9<00:04:06.829> because<00:04:07.099> of

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
it so again I chose chapter 9 because of

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.160 
it so again I chose chapter 9 because of
that<00:04:07.310> farming<00:04:07.730> spot<00:04:07.969> so<00:04:08.359> uh<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.959> know<00:04:09.049> I<00:04:09.079> could

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
that farming spot so uh you know I could

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.869 
that farming spot so uh you know I could
farm<00:04:09.469> for<00:04:09.650> other<00:04:09.829> resources<00:04:10.189> while<00:04:10.519> wait<00:04:10.760> for

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
farm for other resources while wait for

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.670 
farm for other resources while wait for
the<00:04:10.969> pots<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.359> return<00:04:11.629> but<00:04:12.290> if<00:04:12.379> you<00:04:12.439> don't<00:04:12.560> want

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
the pots to return but if you don't want

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.899 
the pots to return but if you don't want
to<00:04:12.739> do<00:04:12.829> that<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.129> can<00:04:13.250> pretty<00:04:13.370> much<00:04:13.459> drop<00:04:13.760> your

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
to do that you can pretty much drop your

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.399 
to do that you can pretty much drop your
scavenger<00:04:14.090> butts<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.629> you<00:04:14.719> run<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.989> math<00:04:15.140> on

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
scavenger butts and you run the math on

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.289 
scavenger butts and you run the math on
any<00:04:15.650> chapter<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.310> I'm<00:04:16.850> just<00:04:17.000> telling<00:04:17.120> you

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
any chapter and I'm just telling you

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.819 
any chapter and I'm just telling you
wondering<00:04:17.750> why<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:17.870> placed<00:04:18.350> them<00:04:18.530> randomly

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
wondering why I placed them randomly

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.110 
wondering why I placed them randomly
instead<00:04:19.220> of<00:04:19.310> those<00:04:19.400> sweet<00:04:19.729> spots

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
instead of those sweet spots

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.270 
instead of those sweet spots
um<00:04:20.269> because<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.959> haven't<00:04:21.620> really<00:04:21.829> noticed<00:04:21.919> a

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
um because I haven't really noticed a

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.800 
um because I haven't really noticed a
significant<00:04:22.759> difference<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.479> ration

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
significant difference in the ration

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.140 
significant difference in the ration
seals<00:04:24.020> now<00:04:24.889> if<00:04:25.039> you<00:04:25.190> push<00:04:25.370> on<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.789> sweet<00:04:26.060> spot

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
seals now if you push on the sweet spot

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.810 
seals now if you push on the sweet spot
you<00:04:26.300> do<00:04:26.509> get<00:04:26.690> more<00:04:26.840> resources<00:04:27.229> but<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.520> ration

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
you do get more resources but the ration

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.770 
you do get more resources but the ration
seals<00:04:29.060> pretty<00:04:29.270> much<00:04:29.419> stays<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.750> same

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
seals pretty much stays the same

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.360 
seals pretty much stays the same
actually<00:04:30.650> as<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.770> matter<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:31.039> fact<00:04:31.250> I've

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
noticed that I got more rational sales

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.870 
noticed that I got more rational sales
by<00:04:33.380> placing<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:33.860> randomly<00:04:34.190> than<00:04:34.520> not<00:04:34.729> in
