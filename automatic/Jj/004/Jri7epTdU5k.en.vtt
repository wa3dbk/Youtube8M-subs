00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.230
 all of them all notice that I do not know why 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 which one to begin to see let's start with 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 the coats very that whistle 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.980
 and order two coats because a lot of 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.160
 you see me from countries where now 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.740
 It's cold that I super enchanted about 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.230
 all this because it has a super fabric 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.360
 soft is for amount of cold because 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.660
 It has a double lining that is to say inside 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.050
 it's like I have a little frog, it's not itchy 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.790
 a super comfortable fabric, soft head 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.400
 I would even wear it to go to 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.080
 sleep but hey who does call me 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
 very hot so of course not 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.880
 I can do it but surely I'm going to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.550
 give a lot of use when going to Italy is a 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.560
 very easy color to combine to me 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.619
 love in gray and has the detail 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.710
 that also brings the cap the hat 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.600
 brings two pockets on the sides and brings a 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.759
 front sign that I still have not been able to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 decipher what it means if any of 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.320
 you know this language and he loves me 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 say goodbye says reforested tirso 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.740
 house nós non hoy sos nick and after 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.270
 underneath it has as if it were a bear 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.610
 I suppose it will be friends of hello 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.620
 kitty 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.150
 a bear that is touching his navel 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.610
 can be and the bear is called action and 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.160
 bring us this rope here that is 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.230
 to tie only in front and so you tops 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.850
 in the neck and you do not get coldness that 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.479
 you're going to tell him nothing is super simple 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.370
 pretty basic but I liked it a lot 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.920
 much much much especially the quality 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.479
 of the fabric and cap amount I'm sure 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.770
 of that good I put it a moment and 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.570
 conama to moderate the here in 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.670
 bank nor was I dying of heat 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.100
 then I ordered this white that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.140
 he also brings his hood now used 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.180
 a lot and the truth is that they are comfortable 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.560
 because if the weather is so very a way 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.810
 and you want to protect yourself in hair because you 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.030
 you pull it up and this one brings the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.400
 detail that the inside of the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.620
 cap is brown and that same detail 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.170
 brings it here in the front part that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.239
 if they close it here with these pins 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.430
 it looks full white but if you leave it 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.620
 so semi open it looks super nice 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.690
 because you see this detail of the brown of 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.030
 lining inside this fabric I also 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.820
 like a lot is much finite than the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.560
 other than gray is also softer 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.330
 well the two fabrics are soft only 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.300
 this cover slightly less 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.490
 it's forward details are not defined 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.730
 what things it is but it seems like a mill 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.190
 it's not abstract but it's nice 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.530
 amount this blouse is super pretty and 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.590
 although it is a nativity scene I do not know why 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.590
 they sent me the size 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.900
 but I liked how you saw because the same 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.180
 the fact that it looks so super wide gives 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.330
 the touch that bohemian I like I like 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.810
 I really like the flights the handyman 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.030
 so this little detail of the strip 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.030
 brown here in the sleeve that you also 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.250
 you can tie the neck detail that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.920
 is with this elastic ah I did not tell them that 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.000
 the fabric of this blouse is like jeans 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.040
 but soft little soft is super 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.120
 super pretty was one of the things that 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.760
 I liked it better 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.500
 over here now I have two good pullover 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.269
 we tell him so young I know 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.980
 that in each country the terms change 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.230
 let me know how they are called in their 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.220
 countries to this because in Cuba we say 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.370
 polo see this white pullover I thought 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.230
 spectacular I know that it is very peculiar and 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.980
 that not everyone dares to wear 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.870
 this but it's nice, I like it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.340
 much the idea the sign that works 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.410
 is super comical parental advisory 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.500
 with explicit while they change 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.650
 she has been wearing clothes with signs 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.630
 with numbers and in this case I like 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.790
 also that they combined two types of 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.010
 fabrics different types of fabric this is 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.739
 like a lycra fabric is to say that it comes 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.560
 the tread and has a finish as well 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.300
 bright and the other is like a mesh that 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.700
 It has also been used a lot 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.320
 but it's a hard mesh and I like that 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.360
 bring the mesh does on the top 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.630
 that in the bottom of the pullover 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.090
 this with a jeans with a black skirt 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.750
 long long that is can be combined 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.180
 in many ways with 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.180
 in jeans and a jacket over 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.480
 Question 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.200
 they go in therapies answers 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.270
 and the truth is that it is super super 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.900
 super fashion and I liked this amount 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.070
 it also runs and zico so 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.880
 you have to teach a little belly 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.830
 with this 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.280
 then asked me also is 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.050
 super nice I loved especially the 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.150
 colors that are very colorful very 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.580
 happy for spring-summer I see it 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.290
 spectacular and as you see in this case 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.810
 are combining in a number the 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.900
 flowers great sign below that if I 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.230
 they kill I do not know what it means says art rayón 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.620
 what do you mean rays 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.050
 and it would look nice combined with a james 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.270
 a psychotic short in jeans and a 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.400
 jacket for example in jeans over the 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.860
 only little problem that has this pullover 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.300
 is that it is super cortical just below 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.670
 of the breasts so you have to walk 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.380
 with all the belly to the air the alternative 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.870
 not to show belly with this little town 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.060
 would be to put on a vest type 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.530
 I'm going to show you here a white one that 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.240
 I have to give me up to pity because he knows 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.130
 that there is a button I put in the washing machine 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.840
 and when those who lacked button and 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.400
 search and search and search button and not 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.410
 I found the button on the washing machine 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.570
 swallowed a button I believe but I loved them 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.490
 show to give you an idea of how 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.110
 do when they have a garment as well 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.880
 is that you and all the belly out and 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.160
 also it gives them worth showing then 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.440
 hooked on this type of vest 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.020
 this also has a fantastic fabric 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.690
 has a super good super firm fabric 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.140
 is a little elasticized see this me 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.610
 I think it was there that everything liked me and 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.840
 got to say this I think it was what 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.240
 I liked it better but it is that everything 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.910
 liked and finally the little dress that 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.500
 I bring since it is super nice 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.900
 also what I liked the most was a color 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.100
 what is a phosphorescent pink you 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.360
 They know that when in summer 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.870
 begin to use the colors 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.210
 phosphorescent the fluorine and this I like 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.090
 especially because it brings the fantasy of 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.670
 palmitas so it's very a subject 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.470
 like miami summer spring way very 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.030
 pretty the figure to be carved in the 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.250
 part of above and then in the part of 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.800
 below it opens and stays like this for adif 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.660
 under bell the only downside that has 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.910
 this dress is that the fabric is a 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.220
 little bit warm because it's like a 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.680
 material a little bit hard I would say that 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.840
 pulling for nylon that is a contra 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.450
 because it 's a little bit uncomfortable to use 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.030
 but it 's a pro because let's say 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.040
 squeeze here you contain the masses is 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.570
 almost a good strip and so far the 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.580
 videito of today as they saw that they were 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.980
 little things but sometimes it's better 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.650
 little bit and of better quality than not much 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.750
 and that in the end they have very bad fabrics or 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.760
 that are very badly finished and one 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.190
 ends by throwing them in a corner and not 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.500
 using that is a tip that I give if 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.790
 They decide to buy in these pages 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.280
 Asians who also set a 

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.890
 little in the price and do not buy as much 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.080
 cheaper because almost always the most 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.070
 more cheaper is what less quality 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.410
 have and other 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.110
 that's why today, as always, the shipment 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.690
 The shipping cost that is also not the 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:49.060
 cheaper or the free because almost 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.340
 always those things then travel without a 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.290
 tracking name jaime well in term 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.150
 English that means without a number of 

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.950
 crawling and therefore your new you know 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.420
 where the package goes and is more 

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.730
 likely to be missed from that 

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.110
 way and since we have added more nothing 

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.150
 Come and visit me with my networks 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.430
 that we always keep there 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.710
 contact between video and video opens the 

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.030
 information box that I leave there 

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.950
 all the links the little things that 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.540
 showed and also the links to my networks 

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.290
 social a little big kiss and we 

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.290
 we see in the next
