00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:10.959 
our Kirby IEC plug and now we remove the

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:12.389 
our Kirby IEC plug and now we remove the
connector<00:01:11.380> which<00:01:11.529> is<00:01:11.679> some<00:01:11.920> reason<00:01:12.279> is<00:01:12.369> a

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
connector which is some reason is a

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:20.269 
connector which is some reason is a
different<00:01:12.880> size<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:13.659> stalks<00:01:14.049> 15<00:01:19.109> okay

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:20.279 
different size this is a stalks 15 okay

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.679 
different size this is a stalks 15 okay
now<00:01:21.279> in<00:01:21.459> this<00:01:21.520> case<00:01:21.789> I'm<00:01:22.029> going<00:01:22.179> to<00:01:22.240> use<00:01:22.299> a<00:01:22.479> a

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
now in this case I'm going to use a a

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.300 
now in this case I'm going to use a a
non<00:01:23.289> genuine<00:01:23.799> color<00:01:25.679> works<00:01:26.679> every<00:01:27.009> bit<00:01:27.189> as

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
non genuine color works every bit as

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.599 
non genuine color works every bit as
good<00:01:27.490> as<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.909> original<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.950> quite<00:01:30.249> as<00:01:30.399> soft

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
good as the original not quite as soft

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.419 
good as the original not quite as soft
these<00:01:30.999> are<00:01:31.179> a<00:01:31.209> very<00:01:31.479> soft<00:01:31.810> cord<00:01:32.469> which<00:01:33.069> I<00:01:33.219> have

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
these are a very soft cord which I have

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.019 
these are a very soft cord which I have
heard<00:01:33.779> results<00:01:34.779> in<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.490> cords<00:01:36.789> being

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:37.029 
heard results in that the cords being

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:40.499 
heard results in that the cords being
cut<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.719> little<00:01:38.020> bit<00:01:38.169> but<00:01:39.090> anyway<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.119> can't<00:01:40.359> not

and then we go back to the number 20

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.610 
and then we go back to the number 20
talks<00:02:18.569> wiggle<00:02:19.569> that<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:19.959> we<00:02:20.080> can<00:02:20.200> see<00:02:20.440> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
talks wiggle that so we can see the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:34.080 
talks wiggle that so we can see the
whole<00:02:20.830> clearly<00:02:22.350> there<00:02:23.350> we<00:02:23.530> go<00:02:31.770> okay<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.970> now

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
whole clearly there we go okay and now

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.800 
whole clearly there we go okay and now
just<00:02:34.980> for<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.010> sake<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.340> neatness<00:02:36.970> what<00:02:37.720> I'm

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
just for the sake of neatness what I'm

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.960 
just for the sake of neatness what I'm
actually<00:02:37.989> going<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:40.270> refit<00:02:40.930> our<00:02:41.170> old

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.490 

cord<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.709> better<00:02:47.920> cut<00:02:48.250> up<00:02:49.140> now<00:02:50.140> grab<00:02:50.350> this

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
cord with a better cut up now grab this

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.410 
cord with a better cut up now grab this
one<00:02:51.900> just<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.080> can<00:02:53.260> cover<00:02:53.440> up<00:02:53.620> these<00:02:54.420> screw

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
one just so I can cover up these screw

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.300 
one just so I can cover up these screw
holes<00:02:55.450> basically<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:58.860> guess<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.010> could<00:03:00.160> do

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
holes basically I guess you could do

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.780 
holes basically I guess you could do
this<00:03:00.430> without<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:02.160> without<00:03:03.160> this<00:03:03.459> bit<00:03:03.670> of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
this without the without this bit of

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.120 
this without the without this bit of
rubber<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:05.440> put<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.650> screws<00:03:05.950> directly

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
rubber you just put the screws directly

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:16.229 
rubber you just put the screws directly
in<00:03:06.489> there<00:03:08.700> let's<00:03:09.700> just<00:03:09.790> do<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.269> up<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.850> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
in there let's just do this up and the

in there let's just do this up and the
bottom<00:03:16.510> one<00:03:19.170> okay<00:03:20.970> yeah<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:23.200> machine<00:03:23.590> has<00:03:23.799> a

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
bottom one okay yeah this machine has a

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.949 
bottom one okay yeah this machine has a
marker<00:03:24.250> switch<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.670> can't<00:03:24.940> run<00:03:25.329> it<00:03:25.480> without

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
marker switch you can't run it without

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.380 
marker switch you can't run it without
connecting<00:03:26.769> your<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:28.390> boot<00:03:28.720> in<00:03:29.019> properly

and again for neatness will fit the cord
correctly<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.549> side<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:36.970> machine

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.670 

okay<00:03:43.579> should<00:03:44.579> plan<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:44.939> earlier<00:03:45.299> anyway<00:03:45.870> go

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
okay should plan this earlier anyway go
