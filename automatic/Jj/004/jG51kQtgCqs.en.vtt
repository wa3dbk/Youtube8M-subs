is<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.590> beta<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.610> not<00:00:11.820> optimized

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
is this is beta and it's not optimized

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.580

game<00:00:37.980> will<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.120> very<00:00:39.149> high<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.620> um<00:00:41.600> see

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
game will do very high and then um see

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.510 
game will do very high and then um see
advanced<00:00:42.899> graphics<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.860> think<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> might

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
advanced graphics and I think it might

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.299 
advanced graphics and I think it might
make<00:00:44.730> me<00:00:44.910> restart<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:46.350> high<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:47.070> would

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
make me restart but high I think would

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.709 
make me restart but high I think would

shows<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> GPU<00:01:27.150> temp<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.460> 41<00:01:29.970> degrees

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
shows the GPU temp and it's 41 degrees

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.399 
shows the GPU temp and it's 41 degrees
celsius<00:01:30.659> as<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.170> haven't

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
celsius as of right now we haven't

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.050 
celsius as of right now we haven't
started<00:01:31.560> anything<00:01:31.920> i'm<00:01:32.250> getting<00:01:32.490> about<00:01:32.579> 45

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
started anything i'm getting about 45

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.390 
started anything i'm getting about 45
frames<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> screen<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.619> probably

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
frames in the screen but that probably

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.990 
frames in the screen but that probably
doesn't<00:01:35.640> matter<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.759> so

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
doesn't matter and so

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.900 
doesn't matter and so
so<00:01:41.990> yeah<00:01:42.200> we're<00:01:42.530> getting<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:42.920> 25<00:01:43.550> frames

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
so yeah we're getting like 25 frames

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.420 
so yeah we're getting like 25 frames

you what my settings look like what I
play<00:02:11.750> one<00:02:12.160> it's<00:02:13.160> not<00:02:13.340> it's<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:14.000> like<00:02:14.120> I'm

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
play one it's not it's not like I'm

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.140 
play one it's not it's not like I'm
sacrificing<00:02:14.570> much<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:17.450> play<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:17.840> that

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
this game is amazing it's free not to do

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.620 
this game is amazing it's free not to do
anything<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.910> get<00:02:23.090> at<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.420> after

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
anything to get at you on after

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.570 
anything to get at you on after
pre-order<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.200> just<00:02:24.440> there<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.340> can<00:02:25.489> add

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
pre-order it is just there you can add

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.570 
pre-order it is just there you can add
it<00:02:25.760> choose<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.709> frames<00:02:30.980> are<00:02:31.160> definitely

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
it choose the frames are definitely

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.390 
it choose the frames are definitely
dipping<00:02:31.970> ocean

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
dipping ocean

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.990 
dipping ocean
and<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.700> exchanged<00:02:36.270> that's<00:02:36.660> good<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:38.610> yeah<00:02:38.820> as

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and we exchanged that's good but yeah as

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
and we exchanged that's good but yeah as
you<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.270> see<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.690> staying<00:02:39.960> at<00:02:40.080> about<00:02:40.320> 30

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
you can see it's staying at about 30

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.410 
you can see it's staying at about 30
frames<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.250> go<00:02:41.370> ahead<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.640> try<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.270> eat<00:02:42.390> one

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.610 
frames so go ahead and try to eat one
more<00:02:42.750> kill<00:02:42.960> or<00:02:43.110> something<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.470> and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
then I'll go to switch back to just my

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.110 
then I'll go to switch back to just my
settings<00:02:47.640> what<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.850> roll<00:02:48.060> with<00:02:52.400> Wow<00:02:53.400> okay<00:02:53.850> you

ok hope I get that kill

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.660 
ok hope I get that kill
so<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.709> crash<00:03:42.950> light<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.519> gotta

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
so this is crash light you just gotta

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.979 
so this is crash light you just gotta
protect<00:03:43.939> this<00:03:44.060> objective<00:03:44.540> but<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:44.870> have

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
protect this objective but you have

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.699 
protect this objective but you have

Oh

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.000 

skin<00:04:02.360> gets<00:04:02.540> pretty<00:04:02.720> crazy

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.180 

shit

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.810 

okay<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.220> respond<00:04:12.580> with<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.940> shotgun<00:04:14.820> hunter

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
okay I respond with the shotgun hunter

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.069 
okay I respond with the shotgun hunter
mode<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:16.150> pretty<00:04:16.359> cool<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.600> would<00:04:16.840> have<00:04:16.930> done

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
mode is pretty cool I would have done

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.270 
mode is pretty cool I would have done
that<00:04:17.320> but<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.560> figured<00:04:17.890> this<00:04:17.980> would<00:04:18.100> be<00:04:18.160> a

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
that but I figured this would be a

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.360 
that but I figured this would be a
little<00:04:18.430> more<00:04:18.609> intensive<00:04:19.120> on<00:04:19.239> my<00:04:19.420> GPU<00:04:20.200> this<00:04:21.160> is

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
little more intensive on my GPU this is

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.770 
little more intensive on my GPU this is
just<00:04:21.549> more<00:04:21.700> shit's<00:04:21.940> happening<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.540> then<00:04:22.690> on

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
just more shit's happening and then on

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.730 
just more shit's happening and then on
punt<00:04:23.020> remote<00:04:23.260> it's<00:04:23.410> kind<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.620> like

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
punt remote it's kind of like

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.150 
punt remote it's kind of like
everybody's<00:04:24.370> hiding<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.880> not<00:04:25.330> really<00:04:25.600> much

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
everybody's hiding and not really much

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.810 
everybody's hiding and not really much
so<00:04:27.160> then<00:04:27.280> this<00:04:27.370> is<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.550> real<00:04:27.760> strain<00:04:28.060> test

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.280 

yeah<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.000> about<00:04:34.090> 60<00:04:34.540> frames<00:04:34.780> so<00:04:34.960> I'm<00:04:35.050> kind<00:04:35.260> of

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
yeah so about 60 frames so I'm kind of

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.670 
yeah so about 60 frames so I'm kind of
