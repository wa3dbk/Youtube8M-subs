the<00:01:07.320> championship<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.070> felt<00:01:08.550> I<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.910> a<00:01:08.940> lot

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the championship I felt I have a lot

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.410 
the championship I felt I have a lot
more<00:01:09.450> energy<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:11.100> maybe<00:01:11.670> when<00:01:11.910> I<00:01:11.940> was<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
more energy then maybe when I was in the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
more energy then maybe when I was in the
semi-final<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.050> French<00:01:13.260> Open<00:01:13.380> few<00:01:13.770> years<00:01:13.890> ago

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
semi-final the French Open few years ago

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.120 
semi-final the French Open few years ago
when<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.520> felt<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.530> was<00:01:16.530> exhausted

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
when I felt that really was exhausted

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.180 
when I felt that really was exhausted
almost<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> end<00:01:17.940> of<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> think<00:01:19.890> that

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
almost at the end of it so I think that

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.670 
almost at the end of it so I think that
we<00:01:20.280> helped<00:01:20.490> me<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.940> kind<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.930> switch<00:01:22.170> off<00:01:22.410> when

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
we helped me to kind of switch off when

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.290 
we helped me to kind of switch off when
I<00:01:22.770> need<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.250> then<00:01:23.310> switch<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.850> again<00:01:24.150> when

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
I need to and then switch on again when

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.600 
I need to and then switch on again when
I'm<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.600> court<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.710> obviously<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.310> know

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I'm on the court and obviously I know

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.040 
I'm on the court and obviously I know
exactly<00:01:27.060> when<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> need<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.570> do<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.900> ready
