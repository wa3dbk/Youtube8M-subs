00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.210 
updated as well as the border color
let's<00:04:06.990> make<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.410> real<00:04:07.620> ugly<00:04:08.070> red<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.460> blue<00:04:10.220> I

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
let's make it a real ugly red and blue I

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.449 
let's make it a real ugly red and blue I
think<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.880> one<00:04:12.120> there's<00:04:12.540> also<00:04:12.750> a

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
think this one there's also a

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.800 
think this one there's also a
transparent<00:04:14.459> button<00:04:14.760> which<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:15.390> going<00:04:15.750> to

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
transparent button which is going to

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.260 
transparent button which is going to
make<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.170> background<00:04:16.880> see-through<00:04:17.880> clear

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
make the background see-through clear

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.390 
make the background see-through clear
which<00:04:21.270> is<00:04:21.299> pretty<00:04:21.690> handy<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.470> think<00:04:23.250> what<00:04:23.370> I

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
which is pretty handy I think what I

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.720 
which is pretty handy I think what I
want<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.760> do<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.090> go<00:04:24.270> ahead

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
want to do is go ahead

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.350 
want to do is go ahead
I<00:04:25.830> don't<00:04:26.830> know<00:04:26.920> have<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.250> like<00:04:27.460> black<00:04:27.730> I<00:04:28.030> guess

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.050 

and<00:04:31.360> then<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.200> corner<00:04:32.500> style<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.640> you

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
and then the corner style so this is you

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.840 
and then the corner style so this is you
can<00:04:34.180> see<00:04:34.330> here<00:04:34.510> there's<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.780> rounded<00:04:35.200> corner

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
can see here there's a rounded corner

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.500 
can see here there's a rounded corner
and<00:04:36.850> by<00:04:37.030> toggling<00:04:37.390> this<00:04:38.250> corner<00:04:39.250> style<00:04:39.550> you're

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
and by toggling this corner style you're

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.920 
and by toggling this corner style you're
going<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.020> be<00:04:41.140> able<00:04:41.260> to<00:04:42.060> kind<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.270> fix<00:04:43.780> the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
going to be able to kind of fix the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.500 
going to be able to kind of fix the
radius<00:04:44.290> here<00:04:44.500> on<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.740> corners<00:04:45.210> all<00:04:46.210> right<00:04:46.330> so

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
radius here on the corners all right so

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.060 
radius here on the corners all right so
