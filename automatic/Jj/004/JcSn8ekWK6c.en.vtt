00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.529
 And he the youtube crew. 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.960
 Today I'll do one more tutorial today. 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.690

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.880
 you know everything so much success on your pc 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.460
 this is processor and processor temperature 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.960
 mother plate cause and tals 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 first we will need to download the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.529
 Everest and I think it's one of the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.750
 better to know if it took down goes 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.980
 download that I had already downloaded but I 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.469
 I'm going to download again 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 a lot of people have this doubt down 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.820
 here I will go back leaving the link in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.969
 Personal description of my parent 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.809
 here by my side there was content 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:52.789
 It's kwai here, the program just goes 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:58.199
 you downloaded and we will install the program 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:01.440
 here it appeared so damage the nexus is 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.080
 next to that while in the case edson lobão 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.299
 down will have a program where they will 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 put any antivirus and seif is 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:23.610
 I do not like this business took over 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.659
 this is only our faith in us not only you 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.030
 khalifa 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.860
 She knows I 'm recording, how are you? 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.540
 Italy after having to download the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.970
 problem is there is not just put here 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.820
 for me it also goes and tie does not have 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:51.829
 nothing to do with the attack is the IMF 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:54.090
 so we also open and have opened z 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.750
 now we will get a sense of everything 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.439
 about the pccs is overheating i guess 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.860
 What for me is a temperature above 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.680
 40 degrees 42 degrees there's already something to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.310
 you propose is worry now leaves 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.720
 I knew that chanti here in 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.290
 computer 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.440
 it will detect all the information if it 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.270
 the pc will give it to you you will know that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.460
 its 47 ° motherboard proceed feeling 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.850
 So you can believe that right here in the 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.610
 has already approved the call for a 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.550
 person is old but only process is one 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.800
 87 sense of how do thanks to motherboard 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.440
 This super normal kit would be 30 degrees 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.550
 processor for me 40 degrees from now 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.920
 super good but many 60 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.970
 my source that does not show but it leaves 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.940
 I see here 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.000
 she sure must be about 80 70 degrees 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.510
 in the source because I cut her cooler 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.500
 Our taurine is here. 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.740
 at the time I record or if I cut the 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.480
 cooler her fan of her color because it's 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.490
 making noise very annoying because 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.830
 if he already bought a new pc from here today 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.220
 Even I do not care. I saw that shit one. 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.010
 garbage to someone then personal beauty already 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.620
