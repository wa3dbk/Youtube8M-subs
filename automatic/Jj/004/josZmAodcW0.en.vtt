00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
start cooking our quinoa we're going to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.420 
start cooking our quinoa we're going to
do<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:33.540> thing<00:00:33.809> that's<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.410> essential<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
do one thing that's really essential and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.340 
do one thing that's really essential and
that's<00:00:35.640> rinsing<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> now<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.050> main<00:00:37.320> reason

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that's rinsing it now the main reason

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.340 
that's rinsing it now the main reason
why<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:38.040> rinse<00:00:38.370> our<00:00:38.760> quinoa<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.960> don't<00:00:40.200> do

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
why we rinse our quinoa if you don't do

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.930 
why we rinse our quinoa if you don't do
it<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> turn<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.460> bitter

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it it's going to turn out very bitter

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.750 
it it's going to turn out very bitter
so<00:00:42.480> by<00:00:42.629> rinsing<00:00:42.870> our<00:00:43.770> quinoa<00:00:44.160> under<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> water

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
so by rinsing our quinoa under the water

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940 
so by rinsing our quinoa under the water
but<00:00:45.450> gets<00:00:45.660> rid<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.079> outer<00:00:46.320> layer<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
but gets rid of that outer layer that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.500 
but gets rid of that outer layer that
actually<00:00:47.460> makes<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:48.360> bitter<00:00:50.329> now<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
actually makes it very bitter now as a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.260

ways<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.829> well<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.250> you're<00:01:35.729> having<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
ways to do it as well so you're having a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.789 
ways to do it as well so you're having a
chicken<00:01:36.299> dish<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.900> actually<00:01:37.259> good<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.470> use

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
chicken dish it's actually good to use

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.580 
chicken dish it's actually good to use
chicken<00:01:38.610> stock<00:01:38.909> instead<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.600> water<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.380> just

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
chicken stock instead of water it just

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
chicken stock instead of water it just
gives<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.860> nice<00:01:41.159> extra<00:01:41.820> flavor<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
gives that nice extra flavor but you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.590 
gives that nice extra flavor but you
could<00:01:43.110> also<00:01:43.229> use<00:01:43.530> beef<00:01:43.829> stock<00:01:44.250> or<00:01:44.490> even<00:01:45.210> better

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
could also use beef stock or even better

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.899 
could also use beef stock or even better
you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.049> use<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.229> vegetable<00:01:46.590> stock<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.579> doesn't

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
you can use a vegetable stock it doesn't

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.060 
you can use a vegetable stock it doesn't
overpower<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.720> taste<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> quinoa<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
overpower the taste of the quinoa but it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.460 
overpower the taste of the quinoa but it
does<00:01:50.250> add<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> nice<00:01:50.850> taste<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.380> of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
does add a nice taste to it but of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
does add a nice taste to it but of
course<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> plane<00:01:53.520> which<00:01:54.090> will

so<00:01:58.710> there's<00:01:58.950> one<00:01:59.100> thing<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.610> love<00:01:59.759> about

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
so there's one thing I really love about

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.969 
so there's one thing I really love about
using<00:02:00.240> quinoa<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> plain<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
using quinoa you can have it plain and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
using quinoa you can have it plain and
it'll<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> nice<00:02:02.610> nutty<00:02:02.969> flavor<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.110> can

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
it'll be a nice nutty flavor or you can

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.990 
it'll be a nice nutty flavor or you can
change<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> flavor<00:02:04.829> slightly<00:02:05.369> by<00:02:05.670> adding

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
change the flavor slightly by adding

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.660 
change the flavor slightly by adding
different<00:02:06.299> types<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.840> stock<00:02:07.340> ok<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.610> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
different types of stock ok so as you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
different types of stock ok so as you
can<00:02:08.759> see<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> has<00:02:09.239> now<00:02:09.360> started<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.899> boil<00:02:10.110> so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
can see it has now started to boil so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.820 
can see it has now started to boil so
now<00:02:10.800> we're<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> turn<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.400> down<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
now we're going to turn it down to

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.310 
now we're going to turn it down to
low<00:02:12.160> simmer<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.240> we're<00:02:13.630> gonna<00:02:13.750> place<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.020> lid

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
low simmer and we're gonna place a lid

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.510 
low simmer and we're gonna place a lid
on<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.590> we're<00:02:14.710> gonna<00:02:14.800> let<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.070> simmer<00:02:15.400> away

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520

for<00:02:15.670> exactly<00:02:16.270> 15<00:02:16.900> minutes<00:02:17.040> but<00:02:18.040> feel<00:02:18.190> free<00:02:18.370> to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
for exactly 15 minutes but feel free to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.920 
for exactly 15 minutes but feel free to
experiment<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.780> little

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
experiment if you like it a little

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.380 
experiment if you like it a little
tougher<00:02:20.470> boil<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.160> less<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.910> if<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.270> it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
tougher boil it less but if you like it

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.270 
tougher boil it less but if you like it
a<00:02:22.450> little<00:02:22.600> softer<00:02:22.900> cook<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.800> for<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.980> few<00:02:24.220> more

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
a little softer cook it for a few more

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.790 
a little softer cook it for a few more
minutes<00:02:24.460> but<00:02:25.360> personally<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.810> find<00:02:26.050> 15<00:02:26.500> minutes

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
minutes but personally I find 15 minutes

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.140 
minutes but personally I find 15 minutes
is<00:02:27.040> exactly<00:02:27.790> how<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.300> it
