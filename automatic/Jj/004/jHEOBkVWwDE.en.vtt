00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.250
 serves all of the 20 spaces or are doctor 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.500
 white we are here today with the new one 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 review of a crappy footballer 14 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 roofs 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.439
 as I promised I bring you today 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.210
 second star of borussia dormund 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.529
 robert lewandowski a striker 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 crazy 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.820
 last year an incredible boom after 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.590
 his performance in the champions league is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.269
 worth less than 64 meters col 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.340
 correct we review this year as yes 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.710
 therefore it involves 86 evaluation valley then 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 very high we see in the field as yes 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.129
 therefore involves speed that speed 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.110
 not bad 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.780
 certainly we must not take lewandowski 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 as one to run and that's it 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.890
 be his bojang teammate 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.930
 lewandowski speed is very good 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.239
 physical strength is not bad at times 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 manages to jump opponents sometimes 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.110
 no this is a bit also depends on 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.360
 game of course you can't think of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.940
 do as unique ibrahim can leave e 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.670
 he will take all his opponents 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 this is not the kind of player for 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 do this anyway reality has me 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.670
 surprised I thought really much worse 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.560
 you almost don't even need to use the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.900
 card that you are increasing 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.420
 speed passing to the shooting we begin with the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.270
 weak side sometimes the finalization is 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.180
 low enough you can see here some of the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.729
 clip in which rising comes against one 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.369
 but one with the goalkeeper and he is wrong 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.350
 something that does not happen all 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.299
 so I can't figure out if a 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.009
 lewandowski problem that anyway not 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.659
 has a very high finalization like i 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.579
 greatest game finalizers 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.140
 we have seen gomez sheaths have more than 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.560
 he in finalization 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.000
 or if it is a temporal thing then 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.399
 maybe some games will come out 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.960
 finalize and in others will succeed 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.640
 quietly to score because I have to 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.110
 see here other great goals that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.340
 also marks from the distance because one 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.579
 good shooting power 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.950
 this however of the distance I mean 20 25 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.810
 meters at most very difficult to score 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.700
 from 30 meters how could it be his 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.890
 version you move aroused will go 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.240
 last year is much more difficult 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.570
 scores go far with the players 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.860
 base plus four stars weak foot 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.210
 so you can go quietly 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.440
 pull both right and yes 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.870
 good rigorist is not exceptional 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.750
 however a value on 78 of penalties that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.360
 it's not too bad it's not even that good 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.210
 the dribbling and good other player of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.530
 one meter and 84 a good 4-star agility 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.060
 steel, however, did not write e 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.430
 so you won't be able to do it easily 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.900
 a whole series of skins passages 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.370
 quite good can safely 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.710
 play as the only point 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.540
 header but also this surprise 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.220
 very good for a non player 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.290
 very high I prefer more players 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.660
 high as can be gomez and songs 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.340
 respect us as bassini as they can 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.650
 be lewandowski falcao will have a 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.510
 high activation value therefore also 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.370
 the recommended head shot taking off 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.540
 davis restyle recommended for 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.910
 lewandowski 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.080
 the first should be shooting gunner 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.300
 dribbling and header 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.640
 I prefer mental shooting so I can 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.080
 go up a little its value of 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.850
 finalization so I go a little 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.100
 correct low finalization 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.450
 or finalizer even here in range 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.980
 head shot I don't call it lightly 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.320
 shooting and completeness of state the card 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.480
 previous field 3 instead a plus 2 where 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.580
 do n't use lewandowski 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.290
 advice with me striker in a 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.360
 two- pronged attack were tested in a 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.840
 3 5 2 did not satisfy me at all 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.700
 I recommend instead as a single tip 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.250
 absolutely or in a 4 3 3 and wii royce 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.960
 and robben are the exterior or in a 4 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.090
 2 3 1 because lewandowski manages to 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.800
 stop the ball to pick up the team 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.970
 you have very fast exteriors like 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.140
 farfan and reus that can 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.570
 quietly go to the bottom e 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.310
 cross and lewandowski ovo in time ad 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.620
 go and stow away the heads in the warrants 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.450
 definitely promoted we saw a 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.850
 good shot good physical strength as 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.410
 4 star teleskill that is weak on 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.510
 world race is much better than respect 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.330
 last year passed from high to high 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.610
 medium high negative sides the cost is on 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.350
 60 70 thousand believe on xbox a little bit of 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.210
 thicker 3 so it can be altino 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.370
 take the bad games while waiting for 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.990
 cope save for lewandowski the long 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.760
 as we have seen they are not the maximum e 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.380
 the stamina a little pasture at the end of the game 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.700
 you may have problems take yourself 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.800
 a substitute like it can be a little 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.480
 better that it breaks completely 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.250
 matches are entered in the seventieth 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.690
 about before closing he wanted 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.460
 announce you two new series he had 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.020
 intention to do the first is a guide 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.580
 to the modules that will replace a little 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.020
 recommended teams to use 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.400
 we're going to see all the pro modules 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.699
 meeting for each and the second is 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.440
 a little challenge to laugh at trams and so 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.509
 doctor wise against a stiff than a stiff one 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.310
 which testifies to electronics in Italy 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.780
 which recommends the theme of the week 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.460
 I can do it on Monday we have it 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.410
 personal challenge let's see who guesses more 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.340
 tweet players as if they were video 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.690
 you liked the site online with 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.370
 comments written by the channel us there 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.139
 we will see tomorrow most likely with 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.139
 the poop review hello to everyone
