00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
we put it in the delay time on oh wait I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.260 
we put it in the delay time on oh wait I
have<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.509> idea

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
maybe something like that on the floor

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.410 
maybe something like that on the floor
right<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.960> um<00:01:49.229> very<00:01:50.189> good<00:01:50.520> should<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.210> done

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
right so um very good should have done

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.249 
right so um very good should have done
that<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.930> start<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:53.630> that's<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.930> them

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that from the start so that's just them

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.100 
that from the start so that's just them
with<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> delay<00:01:56.340> whether<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.420> nays

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
with the delay whether the nays

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:11.540 
with the delay whether the nays
um<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.490> lowest<00:01:59.910> setting<00:02:09.740> it<00:02:10.740> sounds<00:02:11.130> like<00:02:11.310> if

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
um the lowest setting it sounds like if

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:31.460 
um the lowest setting it sounds like if
you're<00:02:11.760> playing<00:02:12.150> inside<00:02:12.570> of<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.840> cube<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:30.470> extra

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
you're playing inside of a cube so extra

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.230 
you're playing inside of a cube so extra
points<00:02:31.860> if<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.130> tell<00:02:32.520> me<00:02:32.550> what<00:02:32.910> balloons

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
points if you can tell me what balloons

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:57.320 
points if you can tell me what balloons
try<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.630> not<00:02:34.050> record<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:35.160> what<00:02:35.780> eight<00:02:56.330> you

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
try to not record that is what eight you

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.790 
try to not record that is what eight you
can<00:02:57.510> hear<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.930> back<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:58.440> somewhere<00:02:59.010> and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
can hear it back there somewhere and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.720 
can hear it back there somewhere and
let's<00:03:01.800> see<00:03:01.950> okay<00:03:02.400> let's<00:03:02.640> put<00:03:02.850> delay<00:03:03.150> time<00:03:03.420> on

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
let's see okay let's put delay time on

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:14.420 
let's see okay let's put delay time on
and<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:06.630> course<00:03:06.900> repeat<00:03:07.890> on<00:03:08.070> full<00:03:12.769> okay<00:03:13.769> let's

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
and of course repeat on full okay let's

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:27.430 
and of course repeat on full okay let's
do<00:03:14.850> something<00:03:15.330> repeat<00:03:16.700> when<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.730> repeat

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.520 

well<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:28.920> does<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.489> delay<00:03:30.060> right<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.900> so

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
well it just does one delay right and so

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.270 
well it just does one delay right and so
usually<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:33.209> one<00:03:33.510> being<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.049> analog<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.739> use

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
usually this one being the analog I use

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.080 
usually this one being the analog I use
it<00:03:35.459> around<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.459> maybe<00:03:38.459> something<00:03:38.790> like

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
it around that and maybe something like

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:50.130 
it around that and maybe something like
that<00:03:39.330> so

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.960 

yes<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:52.370> now<00:03:52.520> on<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.060> next<00:03:53.300> one<00:03:53.720> Oh

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.330 

the<00:03:58.970> cables<00:03:59.480> long<00:03:59.720> enough<00:04:00.640> okay<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.680> that's

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
the cables long enough okay so that's

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.050 
the cables long enough okay so that's
the<00:04:04.550> other<00:04:04.670> one<00:04:06.220> now<00:04:07.220> if<00:04:07.459> we<00:04:07.489> set<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.910> delay

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
the other one now if we set the delay

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.800 
the other one now if we set the delay
time<00:04:08.450> very<00:04:09.050> low<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:10.130> repeater<00:04:10.550> out<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:13.810> we've

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
time very low to repeater out that we've

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.530 
time very low to repeater out that we've
got<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.110> bathroom<00:04:15.290> setting<00:04:16.040> again<00:04:16.390> more<00:04:17.390> or

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
got the bathroom setting again more or

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.400 
got the bathroom setting again more or
less<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:18.380> if<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:18.680> can<00:04:18.890> you<00:04:19.549> can<00:04:19.730> realize

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
less but if you can you can realize

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.430 
less but if you can you can realize
listen<00:04:21.410> here<00:04:21.950> it's<00:04:22.300> typical<00:04:23.300> digital<00:04:23.630> it's

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
listen here it's typical digital it's

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.880 
listen here it's typical digital it's
just<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:25.160> got<00:04:25.340> way<00:04:25.669> more<00:04:25.900> definition<00:04:26.900> but<00:04:27.500> you

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
just you got way more definition but you

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.280 
just you got way more definition but you
have<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.490> sacrifice<00:04:28.730> um<00:04:29.360> let's<00:04:29.840> call<00:04:30.110> it

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
have to sacrifice um let's call it

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.690 
have to sacrifice um let's call it
warmth<00:04:30.919> right<00:04:32.710> it's<00:04:33.710> not<00:04:33.919> that<00:04:33.980> obvious<00:04:34.340> in

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
warmth right it's not that obvious in

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.240 
warmth right it's not that obvious in
that<00:04:34.730> setting<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:36.470> longer<00:04:36.830> they<00:04:37.220> get

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
that setting but the longer they get

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.700 
that setting but the longer they get
because<00:04:40.250> digital<00:04:40.640> is<00:04:41.210> perfect<00:04:41.870> but<00:04:42.110> perfect

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
because digital is perfect but perfect

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:52.940 
because digital is perfect but perfect
it's<00:04:42.919> not<00:04:43.010> always<00:04:43.340> perfect<00:04:43.850> right

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:05:11.000 

eight

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.660 

still<00:05:12.010> it's<00:05:12.250> it's<00:05:12.610> not<00:05:12.910> a<00:05:13.650> I've<00:05:14.650> tried<00:05:15.190> lots<00:05:15.430> of

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
still it's it's not a I've tried lots of

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.790 
still it's it's not a I've tried lots of
delays<00:05:16.000> believe<00:05:16.480> me<00:05:16.690> and<00:05:16.960> it's<00:05:17.350> not<00:05:17.940> -<00:05:18.940> no

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
delays believe me and it's not - no

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.010 
delays believe me and it's not - no
actually<00:05:20.800> it's<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.430> quite<00:05:21.760> warm<00:05:22.240> sounding<00:05:22.870> it's

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
actually it's a quite warm sounding it's

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.410 
actually it's a quite warm sounding it's
old<00:05:23.320> and<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.800> older<00:05:24.280> digital<00:05:24.820> delays<00:05:25.120> they

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
old and the older digital delays they

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.370 
old and the older digital delays they
sound<00:05:25.860> somehow<00:05:27.060> warm<00:05:28.060> are<00:05:28.330> not<00:05:28.480> exactly<00:05:29.140> like

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
sound somehow warm are not exactly like

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.490 
sound somehow warm are not exactly like
analog<00:05:29.920> what<00:05:30.190> we<00:05:30.340> did<00:05:30.490> back<00:05:30.790> there<00:05:31.060> um<00:05:31.500> one

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
analog what we did back there um one

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:43.910 
analog what we did back there um one
second<00:05:33.040> that's<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:35.220> analog<00:05:36.220> one<00:05:36.640> again<00:05:39.720> okay

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.080 

now<00:05:44.920> listen<00:05:45.130> listen<00:05:45.940> with<00:05:46.240> your<00:05:46.480> ears

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.560 

that<00:05:52.090> was<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.480> digital<00:05:52.960> one<00:05:53.200> and<00:05:54.120> now<00:05:55.120> the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
that was the digital one and now the

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:04.800 
that was the digital one and now the
analog<00:06:01.169> see<00:06:02.169> how<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.470> note<00:06:03.030> fates<00:06:04.030> and<00:06:04.419> kinda

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
analog see how the note fates and kinda

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.690 
analog see how the note fates and kinda
gets<00:06:04.990> a<00:06:05.140> bit<00:06:05.370> mafia<00:06:06.370> or<00:06:06.550> whatever<00:06:08.100> but<00:06:09.100> that's

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
gets a bit mafia or whatever but that's

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.780 
gets a bit mafia or whatever but that's
that's<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.360> beauty<00:06:10.720> of<00:06:10.750> analog<00:06:11.290> somehow<00:06:11.790> but

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
that's the beauty of analog somehow but

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.590 
that's the beauty of analog somehow but
um<00:06:13.030> well<00:06:13.870> I<00:06:13.900> must<00:06:14.320> admit<00:06:14.500> that<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:16.320> use<00:06:17.320> this

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
um well I must admit that I use this

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.400 
um well I must admit that I use this
d810<00:06:19.600> pedal<00:06:20.410> well<00:06:21.310> here's<00:06:21.700> my<00:06:22.380> pedal<00:06:23.380> board

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
d810 pedal well here's my pedal board

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.650 
d810 pedal well here's my pedal board
what<00:06:23.860> I'm<00:06:23.979> using<00:06:24.160> is<00:06:24.340> it's<00:06:24.490> for<00:06:24.820> delays<00:06:25.210> right

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
what I'm using is it's for delays right

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.300 
what I'm using is it's for delays right
now<00:06:25.870> on<00:06:26.229> there<00:06:26.640> and<00:06:27.640> um<00:06:28.260> well<00:06:29.260> the<00:06:29.560> guys<00:06:29.830> are

now on there and um well the guys are

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.150 
now on there and um well the guys are
one<00:06:30.610> of<00:06:30.760> the<00:06:30.880> guys<00:06:31.030> from<00:06:31.390> from<00:06:32.229> long<00:06:32.440> wave<00:06:32.740> one

you have heard their music you you will
definitely<00:06:41.919> hear<00:06:42.220> this<00:06:42.430> pedal<00:06:42.820> and<00:06:43.000> it's<00:06:43.780> it's

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
definitely hear this pedal and it's it's

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.560 
definitely hear this pedal and it's it's
it's<00:06:44.650> actually<00:06:45.160> very<00:06:45.310> good<00:06:45.460> they're<00:06:46.180> both

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
it's actually very good they're both

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.040 
it's actually very good they're both
very<00:06:46.840> good<00:06:47.169> and<00:06:47.380> you<00:06:48.130> know<00:06:48.250> I<00:06:48.280> don't<00:06:48.640> want<00:06:48.820> to

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
very good and you know I don't want to

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.080 
very good and you know I don't want to
blow<00:06:50.050> up<00:06:50.260> the<00:06:50.440> market<00:06:50.890> or<00:06:51.010> whatever<00:06:51.400> but<00:06:51.850> I

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
blow up the market or whatever but I

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.840 
blow up the market or whatever but I
think<00:06:52.900> and<00:06:53.229> I'm<00:06:53.770> pretty<00:06:54.040> certain<00:06:54.340> because

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
think and I'm pretty certain because

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.000 
think and I'm pretty certain because
I've<00:06:55.060> had<00:06:55.270> lots<00:06:55.540> of<00:06:55.690> delay<00:06:55.990> pedals<00:06:56.410> as<00:06:56.620> I<00:06:56.650> said

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.010 
I've had lots of delay pedals as I said

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.900 
I've had lots of delay pedals as I said
and<00:06:57.220> I've<00:06:57.370> had<00:06:57.610> at<00:06:58.260> 89<00:06:59.260> as<00:06:59.560> well<00:06:59.800> I<00:07:00.010> think<00:07:00.370> this

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
and I've had at 89 as well I think this

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.930 
and I've had at 89 as well I think this
one<00:07:01.180> the<00:07:01.300> CD<00:07:01.630> 10<00:07:01.870> is<00:07:02.080> exactly<00:07:02.950> the<00:07:03.310> same<00:07:03.580> thing

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:03.940 
one the CD 10 is exactly the same thing

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.890 
one the CD 10 is exactly the same thing
it's<00:07:04.540> just<00:07:04.870> another<00:07:05.200> another<00:07:06.330> how<00:07:07.330> they<00:07:07.660> put

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
it's just another another how they put

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.469 
it's just another another how they put
around<00:07:08.020> it<00:07:08.440> but<00:07:09.070> I<00:07:09.370> don't<00:07:09.700> see<00:07:09.880> why<00:07:10.120> you<00:07:10.180> have

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 
around it but I don't see why you have

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.460 
around it but I don't see why you have
to<00:07:10.510> spend<00:07:10.930> so<00:07:11.110> as<00:07:11.470> so<00:07:11.979> big<00:07:12.280> box<00:07:12.580> you<00:07:12.789> know<00:07:12.940> like

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
to spend so as so big box you know like

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.080 
to spend so as so big box you know like
the<00:07:14.710> 89<00:07:15.460> so<00:07:16.150> I<00:07:16.800> think<00:07:17.800> now<00:07:18.280> this<00:07:18.550> time<00:07:18.850> it

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.090 
the 89 so I think now this time it

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.880 
the 89 so I think now this time it
worked<00:07:19.330> better<00:07:19.540> and<00:07:21.840> well<00:07:22.840> yes<00:07:23.050> I<00:07:23.350> think<00:07:23.380> I

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
worked better and well yes I think I

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:29.720 
worked better and well yes I think I
deserve<00:07:24.220> a<00:07:24.880> little<00:07:25.570> bit<00:07:25.810> more<00:07:26.850> beer<00:07:27.850> oh<00:07:28.710> yeah

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:29.730 
deserve a little bit more beer oh yeah

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.900 
deserve a little bit more beer oh yeah
okay

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
okay
