kind of and I think the flavorings
probably<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> cake<00:02:47.040> flavor<00:02:47.459> or<00:02:47.700> something

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
probably like a cake flavor or something

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.010 
probably like a cake flavor or something
so<00:02:48.510> definitely<00:02:48.870> getting<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:50.030> cakey<00:02:51.030> flavor<00:02:51.780> in

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
like to go to Chinese restaurants and

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.210 
like to go to Chinese restaurants and
get<00:03:30.600> chicken<00:03:30.930> teriyaki<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.650> stuff<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.070> that

get chicken teriyaki or stuff like that

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.440 
get chicken teriyaki or stuff like that
it's<00:03:32.550> almost<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:32.820> having<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.209> chicken

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
it's almost like having a chicken

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.090 
it's almost like having a chicken
teriyaki<00:03:33.780> sandwich<00:03:34.440> with<00:03:34.590> some<00:03:34.739> lettuce<00:03:34.950> and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
teriyaki sandwich with some lettuce and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.740 
teriyaki sandwich with some lettuce and
tomatoes<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.730> some<00:03:35.970> mayonnaise<00:03:36.360> but

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
tomatoes and some mayonnaise but

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.000 
tomatoes and some mayonnaise but
apparently<00:03:37.260> they're<00:03:37.560> really<00:03:37.709> having<00:03:37.830> this

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
apparently they're really having this

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.920 
apparently they're really having this
for<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.250> limited<00:03:38.610> time<00:03:38.670> which<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.330> think<00:03:39.390> that

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
for a limited time which I think that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.330 
for a limited time which I think that
this<00:03:40.080> should<00:03:40.230> be<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.590> permanent<00:03:41.130> thing<00:03:41.160> on

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
this should be a permanent thing on

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.699 
this should be a permanent thing on
their<00:03:41.430> menu<00:03:41.760> pretty<00:03:42.510> dynamite<00:03:42.900> for<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.350> red

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
their menu pretty dynamite for the red

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.130 
their menu pretty dynamite for the red
