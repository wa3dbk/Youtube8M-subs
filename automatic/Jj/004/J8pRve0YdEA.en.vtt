is<00:00:11.639> now<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.719> spring<00:00:13.440> number<00:00:13.799> one<00:00:13.980> looks

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
is now what the spring number one looks

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.340 
is now what the spring number one looks
like<00:00:14.570> you've<00:00:15.570> been<00:00:15.690> getting<00:00:15.839> her<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> little

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
like you've been getting her a little

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.279 
like you've been getting her a little
closer<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:17.180> can<00:00:18.180> see<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.570> we've<00:00:18.660> taken<00:00:18.900> some

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
closer you can see that we've taken some

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.590 
closer you can see that we've taken some
CL<00:00:19.560> rock<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.160> covered<00:00:20.490> our<00:00:20.609> plastic<00:00:23.600> we've

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
CL rock and covered our plastic we've

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
CL rock and covered our plastic we've
got<00:00:24.810> our<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.350> pipe<00:00:25.590> coming<00:00:26.400> out

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
got our out of that pipe coming out

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.259 
got our out of that pipe coming out
there<00:00:26.789> we've<00:00:27.060> got<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:28.199> would<00:00:28.650> say<00:00:28.859> about

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
there we've got about I would say about

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.630 
there we've got about I would say about
six<00:00:30.269> seven<00:00:30.510> eight<00:00:30.810> -<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.710> almost<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.430> full

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640

six seven eight - you know almost a full
pipe<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.059> water<00:00:33.239> coming<00:00:33.570> over<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:33.870> right

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
pipe of water coming over there right

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.680 
pipe of water coming over there right
now<00:00:35.160> that's<00:00:35.460> our<00:00:35.550> overflow<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.540> can

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
now that's our overflow so that we can

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.799 
now that's our overflow so that we can
pour<00:00:37.260> some<00:00:37.290> Javits<00:00:37.800> into<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.100> system<00:00:38.809> chalk

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809

since kind of interested now I'll be
gotta<00:00:53.039> see<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.670> make<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> rain<00:00:54.120> pump

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
gotta see if we can make a rain pump

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540 
gotta see if we can make a rain pump
we'd<00:00:54.899> love<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> ramp<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.980> well<00:00:56.340> we're

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
we'd love to get a ramp up well we're

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.450 
we'd love to get a ramp up well we're
looking<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.149> we've<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.329> enough<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
looking to see if we've got enough of a

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
looking to see if we've got enough of a
enough<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.699> fall<00:00:59.940> down<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.989> try<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> put

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
enough of a fall down here to try to put

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.930 
enough of a fall down here to try to put
a<00:01:01.559> ramp<00:01:01.770> pump<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.399> area<00:01:02.699> somewhere

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
a ramp pump down in this area somewhere

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.660 
a ramp pump down in this area somewhere
we're<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> try<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.920> but<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.280> only

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
we're going to try it but that's only

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.010 
we're going to try it but that's only
spring<00:01:05.909> number<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> take<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
spring number one I'm going to take you

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.800 
spring number one I'm going to take you
this<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.880> Ranko<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.600> we'll<00:01:09.990> come<00:01:10.200> over<00:01:10.430> and

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
this way Ranko and we'll come over and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.190 
this way Ranko and we'll come over and
this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.080> where<00:01:13.320> spring<00:01:13.890> number<00:01:14.280> two<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:15.200> think

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
this is where spring number two I think

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
this is where spring number two I think
they're<00:01:16.560> both<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> same<00:01:16.860> source<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.729> said

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
they're both the same source as I said

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.989 
they're both the same source as I said
before<00:01:19.009> but<00:01:20.009> again<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:22.520> covered<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.640> up

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
before but again we covered it up

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:28.349 
before but again we covered it up
we<00:01:25.539> covered<00:01:25.929> it<00:01:26.079> up<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.729> put<00:01:27.729> some<00:01:27.759> shale<00:01:28.090> rock

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
we covered it up and put some shale rock

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:33.330 
we covered it up and put some shale rock
to<00:01:28.569> it<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:30.509> we've<00:01:31.509> got<00:01:31.749> about<00:01:31.990> two<00:01:32.499> three

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
to it and we've got about two three

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.230 
to it and we've got about two three
quarters<00:01:33.909> of<00:01:34.229> an<00:01:35.229> inch<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.590> half<00:01:35.619> fight

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
quarters of an inch and a half fight

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.569 
quarters of an inch and a half fight
come<00:01:37.240> under<00:01:37.420> this<00:01:37.630> one<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:39.100> now<00:01:39.280> we're<00:01:39.459> going

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.179 
come under this one so now we're going
to<00:01:39.640> go<00:01:40.479> up<00:01:40.600> in<00:01:40.749> this<00:01:40.869> area<00:01:41.140> up<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:41.469> beyond<00:01:41.799> here

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
to go up in this area up and beyond here

and grab some leaves and buckets of
leaves<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:46.229> we'll<00:01:47.229> cover<00:01:47.409> all<00:01:47.649> this<00:01:47.829> up<00:01:48.039> it'll

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
leaves and we'll cover all this up it'll

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.249 
leaves and we'll cover all this up it'll
so<00:01:48.759> natural<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.270> won't<00:01:49.569> know<00:01:49.719> it's<00:01:49.869> even<00:01:49.990> here

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
so natural you won't know it's even here

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.199 
so natural you won't know it's even here
except<00:01:50.500> for<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.770> would<00:01:51.369> be<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.520> little<00:01:51.759> tight

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209

except for you would be a little tight
with<00:01:52.420> water<00:01:52.750> flowing<00:01:53.170> out<00:01:53.259> of<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.579> is

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
with water flowing out of it and that is

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.559 
with water flowing out of it and that is
I'll<00:01:55.030> try<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.270> get<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.479> little<00:01:55.750> clearer<00:01:56.219> closer
