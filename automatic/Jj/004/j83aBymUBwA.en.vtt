into<00:00:22.849> theatre<00:00:23.300> in<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.599> same<00:00:23.840> game<00:00:24.560> that<00:00:25.460> I

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
into theatre in the same game that I

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.450 
into theatre in the same game that I
looked<00:00:26.179> at<00:00:26.359> these<00:00:26.539> lions<00:00:27.259> and<00:00:27.529> as<00:00:27.769> you<00:00:28.099> spawn

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
looked at these lions and as you spawn

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.689 
looked at these lions and as you spawn
in<00:00:28.779> those<00:00:29.779> orbs<00:00:30.380> are<00:00:30.619> actually<00:00:31.130> they're<00:00:31.429> there

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
in those orbs are actually they're there

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.460 
in those orbs are actually they're there
they're<00:00:31.970> actually<00:00:32.360> underneath<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.260> paws<00:00:33.440> of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
they're actually underneath the paws of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.040 
they're actually underneath the paws of
the<00:00:33.800> line<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:34.339> then<00:00:34.519> they<00:00:34.640> disappear<00:00:35.300> for

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
the line but then they disappear for

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.229 
the line but then they disappear for
whatever<00:00:36.470> reason<00:00:38.199> so<00:00:39.199> again<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.430> that<00:00:40.460> just<00:00:40.879> a

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239
