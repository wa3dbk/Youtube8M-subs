00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:05.990
 hello friends investors are warmly welcome to our learning room I 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.470
 I'm on the highway will explain in this video about the reversion pattern of those who 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.730
 investment called drilling or worse without 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.169
 drilling is a high standard that signals reversal of a 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.000
 low price for high movement 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 what are its main characteristics 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.509
 first 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.649
 occurs after a set low motion 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:38.059
 according to 2 500 with distinct colors are part of the pattern the first has to be 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.210
 one-fifth low with the large body and the second has to be a high time 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.139
 furthermore the body of the second time has to invade the body of the first 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:54.440
 little the opening price of the second that in return is less than aldi closing 

00:00:54.439 --> 00:01:00.249
 of the first and the closing price of the second is between the close of 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:01.910
 opening of the first 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.290
 ie within the region occupied by the body 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.210
 what factors potentiate drilling 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.540
 first opening text of the second time below the minimum of the first 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.460
 even better if it is below a support area on the chart 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.660
 second 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.940
 closing price of the second time closer to the opening of the first 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.890
 be the greater the invasion in the better body 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.890
 in the third the fire high in the formation of the second time preferably superior 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 first aldo 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.120
 and finally 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.110
 formation of the pattern within a high price trend 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.070
 there is usually no need to have a confirmation 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.240
 drilling 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.320
 however it is very important to wait for a stronger signal when the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.060
 body of the second canedo invade less than half of the durkheim body of the previous 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.470
 in other words when the closing price of the second time is longer 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.539
 near the close of the first 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:18.519
 In this case, the confirmation usually occurs when the opening price of the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.349
 next to me is above the closing of the second half of the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.419
 drilling 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:28.839
 or the closing price of the next one that entered is above the closing of the 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.760
 second drilling time 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.760
 better still if it is above the maximum 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.369
 let's go to the example 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:43.039
 in the daily chart of csn a 3 we can observe the occurrence of a perforation 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:49.109
 that after the price drop, a 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.129
 great bass field 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.840
 then the next April article paredÃ£o below the minimum of the day 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.510
 and had a support area also demonstrating a 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.499
 negative 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:07.689
 however during the day there was strong buying pressure which 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.619
 provided a higher closure invading body than in the period in 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.349
 the review of the initial perspective of the day 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.919
 note that in this example the closing price of the second time invades more 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:29.439
 than 50% of the body than in the previous fact that potentiates the chance of high 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.699
 of the price thus dispensing with the need for a confirmation signal 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.099
 the formation of the drilling usually reveals as an opportunity to buy 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:45.499
 in the example this graphic pattern resulted in a strong upward movement 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:48.239
 of action 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.469
 congratulations 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.269
 You have completed another step. 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.119
 I always hope to count on your presence in our learning room 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.199
 thank you very much
