sleeping net and I put this on my head
this<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.619> what<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.920> net<00:02:07.100> looked<00:02:07.399> like<00:02:07.810> it's

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
this is what the net looked like it's

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.320 
this is what the net looked like it's
kind<00:02:08.989> of<00:02:09.020> like<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.170> bonnet<00:02:09.649> basically<00:02:10.429> but<00:02:10.970> it

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
kind of like a bonnet basically but it

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.240 
kind of like a bonnet basically but it
has<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.600> lot<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.989> holes<00:02:12.350> in<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.890> get<00:02:13.070> more

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.480 
flexi rods out so I made sure I took my
time<00:05:08.280> to<00:05:08.820> take<00:05:09.030> each<00:05:09.270> one<00:05:09.300> out<00:05:10.040> and<00:05:11.040> I<00:05:11.310> would

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
time to take each one out and I would

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.670 
time to take each one out and I would
that<00:05:11.760> under<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.450> hair<00:05:12.660> dryer<00:05:12.690> because<00:05:13.230> my

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
that under the hair dryer because my

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.970 
that under the hair dryer because my
hair<00:05:13.890> still<00:05:14.160> felt<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.550> little<00:05:14.700> moist<00:05:15.000> and<00:05:15.390> damp

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
hair still felt a little moist and damp

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.230 
hair still felt a little moist and damp
because<00:05:16.980> you<00:05:17.130> know<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.580> air<00:05:17.730> probably<00:05:18.120> could

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
because you know the air probably could

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.700 
because you know the air probably could
circulate<00:05:18.600> too<00:05:18.780> well<00:05:18.960> with<00:05:19.080> off<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:19.260> flexi

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
circulate too well with off the flexi

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.680 
circulate too well with off the flexi
rods<00:05:19.920> in<00:05:20.100> my<00:05:20.190> hair<00:05:20.400> so<00:05:20.580> once<00:05:21.210> I<00:05:21.300> took<00:05:21.360> them<00:05:21.600> out

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
rods in my hair so once I took them out

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.610 
rods in my hair so once I took them out
i<00:05:21.720> left<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:23.150> shirley<00:05:24.150> temple<00:05:24.450> curls<00:05:24.660> in<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.350> i

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
i left the shirley temple curls in and i

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.470 
i left the shirley temple curls in and i
said<00:05:25.830> under<00:05:26.040> the<00:05:26.130> hair<00:05:26.310> dryer<00:05:26.340> for<00:05:26.850> about<00:05:27.030> 20

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
said under the hair dryer for about 20

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.910 
said under the hair dryer for about 20
minutes<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:27.960> then<00:05:28.170> my<00:05:28.290> hair<00:05:28.470> was<00:05:28.590> pretty<00:05:28.800> much

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
minutes and then my hair was pretty much

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.730 
minutes and then my hair was pretty much
dry<00:05:29.280> then<00:05:29.970> i<00:05:30.270> decided<00:05:30.600> to<00:05:30.810> take<00:05:30.990> them<00:05:31.230> out<00:05:31.410> and

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
dry then i decided to take them out and

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.910 
dry then i decided to take them out and
i<00:05:32.430> just<00:05:32.460> took<00:05:32.730> each<00:05:32.940> section<00:05:33.750> each<00:05:33.990> scroll<00:05:34.650> and

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
i just took each section each scroll and

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.470 
i just took each section each scroll and
just<00:05:35.160> kind<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.900> loosely<00:05:38.030> broke<00:05:39.030> them<00:05:39.180> apart

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
just kind of loosely broke them apart

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.430 
just kind of loosely broke them apart
and<00:05:40.880> yeah<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.150> this<00:05:42.600> is<00:05:42.780> the<00:05:42.930> look<00:05:43.140> and

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
and yeah and this is the look and

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440
