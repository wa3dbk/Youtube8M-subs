00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
channel and what I see it as is an

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.590 
channel and what I see it as is an
opportunity<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.399> expand<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.149> channel<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
opportunity to expand the channel a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.030

and crazy or anything like that but kind
of<00:00:37.260> my<00:00:37.410> idea<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.960> for<00:00:39.960> example<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.469> went

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
of my idea what it is for example I went

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.799 
of my idea what it is for example I went
up<00:00:40.770> hiking<00:00:40.980> recently<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> went<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
up hiking recently I went up one of the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.860 
up hiking recently I went up one of the
peaks<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.230> forget<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> name<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> video<00:00:44.190> but

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
peaks I forget the name of the video but

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.319 
peaks I forget the name of the video but
there<00:00:45.870> was<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.879> part<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> video<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
there was a part of the video that I

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.880 
there was a part of the video that I
really<00:00:48.629> liked<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.110> wanted<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> leave<00:00:49.680> in

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
really liked that I wanted to leave in

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.639 
really liked that I wanted to leave in
and<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.219> talked<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:51.440> solo<00:00:52.440> backpacking

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649

solo<00:00:53.489> hiking<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.180> my<00:00:54.420> take<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.870> now

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
solo hiking and my take on it now

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
solo hiking and my take on it now
obviously<00:00:55.410> probably<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.460> somewhat<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> an

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
obviously probably have somewhat of an

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.569 
obviously probably have somewhat of an
idea<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.870> time<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.579> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
idea because I do it all the time but so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.799 
idea because I do it all the time but so
I<00:00:59.609> kind<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> want<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.120> use<00:01:00.210> random<00:01:00.629> ramblings

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
I kind of want to use random ramblings

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
I kind of want to use random ramblings
for<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.500> type<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> thing<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.910> my

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
for that type of thing because in my

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.539 
for that type of thing because in my
videos<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.110> allotted<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.100> 10-minute

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
videos I'm allotted just that 10-minute

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.429 
videos I'm allotted just that 10-minute
window<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.240> sometimes<00:01:06.990> they'll<00:01:07.320> do

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
window right and sometimes they'll do

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.890 
window right and sometimes they'll do
two<00:01:07.590> partners<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.310> often<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.659> so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
two partners not very often but and so

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.630 
two partners not very often but and so
I'm<00:01:10.020> removing<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.890> lot<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.159> stuff<00:01:11.369> from<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
I'm removing a lot of stuff from the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.280 
I'm removing a lot of stuff from the
videos<00:01:11.970> either<00:01:12.150> they<00:01:12.360> slow<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> video<00:01:13.020> down

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
videos either they slow the video down

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.830 
videos either they slow the video down
or<00:01:13.760> I<00:01:16.130> just<00:01:17.130> need<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> remove<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:18.299> time

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
or I just need to remove them for time

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.219 
or I just need to remove them for time
constraints<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> maybe<00:01:21.509> I'll<00:01:21.659> use<00:01:21.840> random

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
constraints so maybe I'll use random

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.570 
constraints so maybe I'll use random
ramblings<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.740> take<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> those<00:01:23.340> things

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
ramblings to take some of those things

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
mentioned and put them in that random

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.780 
mentioned and put them in that random
Ram<00:01:29.520> rambling<00:01:30.240> series<00:01:31.340> other<00:01:32.340> things<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.759> could

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
Ram rambling series other things I could

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.580 
Ram rambling series other things I could
use<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.439> maybe

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that door open for that random rambling

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.319 
that door open for that random rambling
series<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:43.439> again<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.310> kind<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> use

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
series and just again to kind of use

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.630 
series and just again to kind of use
that<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:46.049> expand<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> channel<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> little<00:01:47.460> bit

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that to expand the channel a little bit

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.819 
that to expand the channel a little bit
to<00:01:47.820> expand<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> experience<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.259> my<00:01:49.439> channel

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
to expand it experience of my channel

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.620 
to expand it experience of my channel
and<00:01:49.890> hopefully<00:01:50.579> it'll<00:01:50.759> work<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.570> doesn't
