00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
let's see so what just happened was I

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.360 
let's see so what just happened was I
clicked<00:07:02.890> on<00:07:03.040> su<00:07:03.670> it<00:07:03.940> said<00:07:04.690> su<00:07:05.100> binaries<00:07:06.100> need

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
clicked on su it said su binaries need

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.610 
clicked on su it said su binaries need
to<00:07:06.550> be<00:07:06.670> updated<00:07:06.880> can<00:07:07.780> I<00:07:07.840> guess<00:07:08.020> it<00:07:08.200> needed<00:07:08.380> to

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
to be updated can I guess it needed to

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.340 
to be updated can I guess it needed to
try<00:07:08.950> to<00:07:09.010> reboot<00:07:09.640> into<00:07:09.880> torpor<00:07:10.690> clockworkmod

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:11.350 
try to reboot into torpor clockworkmod

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.770 
try to reboot into torpor clockworkmod
recovery<00:07:11.380> to<00:07:12.190> update<00:07:12.550> the<00:07:12.730> su<00:07:13.000> binaries<00:07:13.630> and

recovery to update the su binaries and

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.130
