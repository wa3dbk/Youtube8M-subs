about that is because this is a

up<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.260> trailer<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.519> do<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.880> and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
up the trailer you can do that and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.670 
up the trailer you can do that and
everyone<00:02:55.690> just<00:02:55.959> needs<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.200> know<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.440> passcode

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.990 
they don't have to have individual keys
this<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.830> very<00:03:00.130> similar<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:02.010> 32b<00:03:03.010> HDS<00:03:03.580> type

what<00:03:30.400> this<00:03:30.609> reminds<00:03:31.030> me<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.329> is<00:03:31.630> very<00:03:32.500> much<00:03:32.709> the

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
what this reminds me of is very much the

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.740 
what this reminds me of is very much the
way<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.190> they<00:03:33.370> put<00:03:33.670> together<00:03:33.760> slides<00:03:34.299> now<00:03:34.540> in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
way that they put together slides now in

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.780 
way that they put together slides now in
toy<00:03:34.959> haulers<00:03:35.440> they<00:03:36.010> generally<00:03:36.400> won't<00:03:36.549> have

toy haulers they generally won't have

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.370 
toy haulers they generally won't have
overhead<00:03:37.239> cabinets<00:03:37.750> because<00:03:37.900> they<00:03:38.200> don't

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
overhead cabinets because they don't

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.949 
overhead cabinets because they don't
tend<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.889> be<00:03:39.010> used<00:03:39.310> very<00:03:39.579> often<00:03:39.880> instead<00:03:40.810> you

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
tend to be used very often instead you

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.960 
tend to be used very often instead you
get<00:03:41.079> bigger<00:03:41.350> windows<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.069> big<00:03:42.220> lounge<00:03:42.459> so

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
get bigger windows and a big lounge so

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.000 
get bigger windows and a big lounge so
that's<00:03:43.180> that's<00:03:43.420> you<00:03:44.170> know<00:03:44.290> reminiscent<00:03:44.920> of

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
that's that's you know reminiscent of

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.650 
that's that's you know reminiscent of
something<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.489> would<00:03:45.639> see<00:03:45.790> maybe<00:03:46.180> out<00:03:46.420> of<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
something I would see maybe out of the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.199 
something I would see maybe out of the

Jayco seismic line and I just kind of

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.640 
Jayco seismic line and I just kind of
tells<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.200> thought<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.590> the
