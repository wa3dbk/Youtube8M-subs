and as you can see

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.270 
and as you can see
the<00:02:11.290> calper<00:02:12.069> won't<00:02:12.520> even<00:02:13.620> won't<00:02:14.620> even<00:02:14.920> fit

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
the calper won't even won't even fit

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
around the note2 with a case so it's

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.449 
around the note2 with a case so it's
pretty<00:02:19.750> big<00:02:21.900> lengthwise<00:02:23.160> now

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
pretty big lengthwise now

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.400 
pretty big lengthwise now
with<00:02:24.730> wise<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.569> three<00:02:26.470> point<00:02:27.900> four<00:02:28.900> inches

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
with wise it is three point four inches

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.479 
with wise it is three point four inches
and<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.520> thickness<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:32.650> about<00:02:33.840> point<00:02:35.280> six<00:02:36.280> one

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
and the thickness is about point six one

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.640 
and the thickness is about point six one
inches

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
inches

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.860 
inches
all<00:02:38.650> right<00:02:38.769> so<00:02:38.950> adds<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.910> significant<00:02:40.540> amount

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
all right so adds a significant amount

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
bear no to but it's bearable now we'll

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.000

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
go to the Defender Series case now this

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.690 
go to the Defender Series case now this
is<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:55.200> most<00:02:56.200> rugged<00:02:56.500> most<00:02:56.830> durable<00:02:57.130> Otterbox

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
is the most rugged most durable Otterbox

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.360 
is the most rugged most durable Otterbox
case<00:02:57.819> they<00:02:58.180> have<00:02:58.500> features<00:02:59.500> three<00:03:00.040> layers<00:03:00.280> of

commuter as the commuters outer case is

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.600 
commuter as the commuters outer case is
a<00:03:08.170> hard<00:03:08.530> plastic<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.330> defender<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.989> rubber

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
a hard plastic so the defender is rubber

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.990 
a hard plastic so the defender is rubber
commuter<00:03:12.610> hard<00:03:13.090> plastic<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:15.519> we'll<00:03:15.640> take<00:03:15.850> that

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
commuter hard plastic so we'll take that

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.140 
commuter hard plastic so we'll take that
off<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:17.709> defender<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.459> come<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.820> our<00:03:18.850> inner

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
let me repeat that again before I

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.690 
the defender rubber on the inside of the
commuter<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.510> it's<00:03:49.660> pretty<00:03:49.870> much<00:03:49.989> just

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
commuter so it's pretty much just

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.400 
commuter so it's pretty much just
reversed<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.769> also<00:03:54.150> has<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.510> built-in<00:03:55.750> screen

screen protector of the Commuter Series

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.940 
screen protector of the Commuter Series
case<00:04:03.329> so<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.019> also<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.260> fairly<00:04:05.470> simple

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
case so this is also a fairly simple

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.849 
case so this is also a fairly simple
case<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.340> use<00:04:06.489> just<00:04:06.730> separate<00:04:07.060> all<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.269> pieces

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
case to use just separate all the pieces

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.660 
case to use just separate all the pieces
place<00:04:08.859> your<00:04:09.130> note<00:04:09.370> 2<00:04:10.209> into<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.959> backplate

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
place your note 2 into the backplate

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.000 
place your note 2 into the backplate
snap<00:04:12.670> on<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.180> front<00:04:13.630> plate<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.680> then

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
snap on the front plate like so and then

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.940 
snap on the front plate like so and then
after<00:04:18.190> that<00:04:18.519> we'll<00:04:19.419> reattach<00:04:19.810> our<00:04:20.289> outer

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
after that we'll reattach our outer

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.450 
after that we'll reattach our outer
silicone<00:04:23.950> or<00:04:24.250> rubber<00:04:24.280> skin<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:27.010> we'll<00:04:27.130> just<00:04:27.340> do

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
silicone or rubber skin so we'll just do

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.440 
silicone or rubber skin so we'll just do
that<00:04:29.880> and<00:04:30.880> there<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.090> have<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:33.210> phone<00:04:34.210> is<00:04:34.330> now

measure<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.330> one<00:04:46.510> out<00:04:46.690> so<00:04:47.500> it's<00:04:47.650> obviously

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
measure this one out so it's obviously

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.170 
measure this one out so it's obviously
pretty<00:04:49.810> long<00:04:50.490> adds<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.610> decent<00:04:51.940> amount<00:04:52.000> of

three point four nine inches I'm just

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.200 
three point four nine inches I'm just
going<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.570> re<00:05:04.690> measure<00:05:04.930> out<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:06.210> computer

going to re measure out the computer

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.110 
going to re measure out the computer
it's<00:05:07.990> about<00:05:08.140> three<00:05:08.440> point<00:05:08.680> four<00:05:08.980> -<00:05:09.250> not<00:05:09.970> that

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
it's about three point four - not that

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.970 
it's about three point four - not that
big<00:05:10.330> of<00:05:10.420> a<00:05:10.480> difference<00:05:11.220> thickness<00:05:12.220> wise<00:05:12.900> is

big of a difference thickness wise is

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:23.400 
big of a difference thickness wise is

about 0.7 inches compared to the point

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.650 
about 0.7 inches compared to the point
five<00:05:24.070> six<00:05:24.580> inches<00:05:24.850> so<00:05:25.240> there's<00:05:25.570> a

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
five six inches so there's a
