00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.820
 There is a chance that you people who knack does not exist 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.109
 there are differences between humans and animals 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.169
 but a thin border on western countries 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.119
 that is not all 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.119
 So in other words you can't say that we have a test in Syria 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.609
 because think that complexity 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.609
 I am always the piglet of that relationship between 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.720
 Elburg does the ingenious stuff because it is staggering for years 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.330
 no news 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.240
 gs that was always 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 in the tub 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.240
 but in that street 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 center in tongeren 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 so if you wouldn't do so for sex 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.510
 m that meaning of the word none is that along with psv 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 And it is a person who is able to live the life they do 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 to be able to close psychiatrists 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.520
 I meditate on the risks of using genius and will be the book 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280
 actually a small village 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.690
 to get genius back 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 but now actually it is 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.730
 the whole philosophy has been like classical music to exclude people 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.180
 and they have always been looking for a pass 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.930
 well the people without it 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.540
 concern is to be so on speech 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.290
 the logos as the Greeks are 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.390
 people 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.360
 and the exotics 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 perished with other statements I found the knife to go 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.040
 maaskant someone against whom she does our best 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.859
 Goedzo that the new parking that if you vote 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.029
 on 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.509
 the press difference is conceived 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:16.509
 there is always a dip that is also has 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.409
 for example, help here 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.159
 That means the 80 km between people who

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.440
 Philip Krajinovic 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:34.089
 I think you 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.089
 the book sector 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.609
 do not prosecute 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.609
 so i dont like you 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.559
 our attention 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.559
 the test proponent 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.029
 a little 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.030
 the animals that
