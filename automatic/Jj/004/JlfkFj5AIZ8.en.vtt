00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.590
 So now I will show how the back part is revealed. 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.430
 i.e 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.710
 then the lid opens so 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.069
 let's say not very convenient 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:14.809
 but to hook the plant from participating here from 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.640
 edema the game is not very sharp but so how is it 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.710
 it is not very pleasant to the touch 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.769
 by the way here here here is a sweetheart for 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.739
 fastening three bags 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.689
 So actually we do not hide 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.379
 revealed he said so not very 

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:30.739
 convenient as 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.699
 stuck in some parts and 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:35.089
 buckwheat do not want to break this 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:37.480
 snuggle up 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.950
 in all places 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.950
 how is it like this 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.460
 honestly i was absolutely 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.140
 no doriana 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.290
 it really hurts plastic to break up plastic 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.300
 if typical so typical of cosmos 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.979
 such 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.899
 that's tons just such that from this traveled 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.989
 typical plastic black 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.770
 the scratches on it are very strong and here 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.720
 That remains, for example, you can see here 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.640
 already a little worn out 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.570
 we actually hid the majority 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 the cap you can see as a correction 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.799
 all card is standard 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.100
 wrote daughters 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.500
 and here is a memory card 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.610
 hot-swappable without any problems 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.220
 the fact that the cover has to be removed from 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.060
 the other side there are no extra connectors 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.940
 will be 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.360
 oh here she is control and tarbut it makes no sense 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.670
 shoot no because from the stream in this 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.690
 there is nothing 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.610
 ohh year there is such a rubberized 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.970
 here 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.420
 things around the speaker chores loud 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 in the cabul and there 1230 milliamps 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.220
 small in principle in size 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.370
 that's how it looks inside 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.130
 cows 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.119
 let's try it back and now 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.799
 let's still show once 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.920
 opened show 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.760
 what do we have there inside 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.710
 Here is such a battery can 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.180
 be suddenly interested in somebody 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.359
 will be familiar 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.339
 how many conductors does he have 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.639
 battery packs 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.639
 and so here he looks inside 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.909
 back forehead 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.909
 and close the cup cover close 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.959
 good and comfortable 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.649
 and rub as for chandeliers and squeaks 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.409
 but 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.059
 I would not say that right in the morning at hand 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.929
 governor 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:38.969
 at least I believe not 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.449
 violins are very very easy action but 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.659
 it may already be this unit 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.329
 tested so basically you all 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.219
 conveniently 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.179
 and most physically that he 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.609
 hand he holds very well without problems then 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.109
 there is such a Kiev in a very good size 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.479
 by the way he is not very big and not 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.069
 thick i mean people are totally with him 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.539
 most normal if here for example show 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.319
 that Moscow will see what 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.149
 hefty about politics 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:11.719
 and this is what it seems to find 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.389
 there are tribunes here 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.049
 he doesn't know how to seem like a little 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.619
 but some 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.219
 over large 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.529
 although in principle it has exactly the parameters 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.949
 same 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.149
 in front of the bailout rooms is that 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.899
 him 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:32.330
 scout 96 store here are sections 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.980
 two and a half remember a millimeter yes eye 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.939
 two and a half meters 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.329
 and here we have three and a half meters 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.309
 there are any headphones you can connect 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.199
 gold is onslaught but the mail is more convenient 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.989
 we like it so it may be a little bit 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.989
 It runs not all the same cure this model 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.739
 come kant gets dirty very much 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:58.769
 so no 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.260
 but in any case it is necessary any screen 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.959
 dirty all the same touchscreen 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.959
 they mostly do not take 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.239
 it is erased easily
