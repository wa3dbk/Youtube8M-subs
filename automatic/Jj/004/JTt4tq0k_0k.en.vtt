00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.059 

I<00:00:05.000> used<00:00:06.000> some<00:00:06.240> rectangular<00:00:06.870> tubing<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.770> create

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
I used some rectangular tubing to create

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.390 
I used some rectangular tubing to create
the<00:00:08.220> door<00:00:08.429> sills<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.440> they<00:00:10.440> do<00:00:10.500> add<00:00:10.920> quite<00:00:11.340> a

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
the door sills and they do add quite a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.980 
the door sills and they do add quite a
bit<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.700> strength<00:00:13.490> and<00:00:14.490> as<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.540> turns<00:00:15.750> out

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
bit of strength and as it turns out

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.290 
bit of strength and as it turns out
keeping<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.920> original<00:00:17.400> floor<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:17.970> not<00:00:18.000> going

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
keeping the original floor was not going

my<00:00:32.969> cab<00:00:33.270> mounts<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.870> decided<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.410> use<00:00:34.590> 3-inch

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
my cab mounts I decided to use 3-inch

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.510 
my cab mounts I decided to use 3-inch
exhaust<00:00:35.489> pipe<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> welded<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.380> washer<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
exhaust pipe so I welded a washer and a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.060 
exhaust pipe so I welded a washer and a
nut<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> inside<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> could<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.800> run<00:00:40.920> up

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
nut to the inside so I could just run up

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
nut to the inside so I could just run up
bolt<00:00:41.399> right<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:41.879> through<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> isolator<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
bolt right up through the isolator and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
bolt right up through the isolator and
and<00:00:44.219> catch<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.760> cab<00:00:45.410> as<00:00:47.030> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> was

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and catch the cab as you can see I was

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.290 
and catch the cab as you can see I was
having<00:00:48.870> trouble<00:00:49.410> with<00:00:49.530> my<00:00:49.590> welder<00:00:50.090> turned<00:00:51.090> out

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
having trouble with my welder turned out

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.299 
having trouble with my welder turned out
to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> core<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.379> wire<00:00:52.649> feed<00:00:52.980> cable

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
to be the core for the wire feed cable

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.410 
to be the core for the wire feed cable
was<00:00:53.610> causing<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> problem<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:56.000> put<00:00:57.000> together<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
was causing the problem I put together a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.900 
was causing the problem I put together a
wooden<00:00:57.809> buck<00:00:58.109> using<00:00:58.590> plywood<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.520> two<00:00:59.760> by

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
wooden buck using plywood and two by

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330 
wooden buck using plywood and two by
fours<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.050> could<00:01:01.289> shape<00:01:01.530> my<00:01:01.680> transmission

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
fours so I could shape my transmission

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.700 
fours so I could shape my transmission
tunnel<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.850> think<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.930> how<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> old-timers

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
tunnel I think it's how the old-timers

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.440 
tunnel I think it's how the old-timers
used<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.180 

this<00:01:08.450> might<00:01:08.659> have<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.869> be<00:01:09.020> a<00:01:09.140> prototype

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
this might have to be a prototype

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:22.670 
this might have to be a prototype
we'll<00:01:10.490> see<00:01:10.700> how<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:10.880> fits

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.310 

I<00:01:22.940> had<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.090> scab<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.660> a<00:01:24.750> piece<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
I had to scab in a piece in this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.860 
I had to scab in a piece in this
bulkhead<00:01:25.740> area<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.940> made<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.330> properly

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
bulkhead area so it made up properly

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.850 
bulkhead area so it made up properly
with<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.230> front<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.620> transmission

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
with the front of the transmission

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
with the front of the transmission
tunnel<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.450> shape<00:01:30.750> had<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.080> correspond<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
tunnel the shape had to correspond to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.650 
tunnel the shape had to correspond to
the<00:01:32.070> five-speed<00:01:32.580> transmission<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.510> going

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
the five-speed transmission I was going

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.190 
the five-speed transmission I was going
to<00:01:33.720> use

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to use

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.280 
to use
it's<00:01:35.010> an<00:01:35.190> NV<00:01:35.490> 3500<00:01:36.480> transmission<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.110> came

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
it's an NV 3500 transmission that came

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.740 
it's an NV 3500 transmission that came
out<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.710> five-speed<00:01:38.700> v8<00:01:39.030> Dakota<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.600> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
out of a five-speed v8 Dakota so all you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.280 
out of a five-speed v8 Dakota so all you
really<00:01:42.930> need<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.410> do<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.800> work<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:45.260> well<00:01:46.260> a

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
really need to do this work is a well a

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.690 
really need to do this work is a well a
cut-off<00:01:46.590> wheel<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:48.290> MIG<00:01:49.290> welder<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.800> a<00:01:49.890> sharpie

cut-off wheel a MIG welder and a sharpie
that's<00:01:51.480> all<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.750> need<00:01:53.510> so<00:01:54.510> I<00:01:54.990> had<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> cut<00:01:55.710> this

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that's all you need so I had to cut this

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.890 
that's all you need so I had to cut this
part<00:01:56.220> out<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.660> where<00:01:57.810> my

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
part out here because this is where my

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.770 
part out here because this is where my
CAD<00:01:58.170> mount<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.100> where<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> Outrigger<00:02:00.660> and

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
CAD mount is and where the Outrigger and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.930 
CAD mount is and where the Outrigger and
the<00:02:00.840> frame<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.380> carrying<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.250> cab<00:02:02.460> mount<00:02:02.760> you

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
the frame is carrying the cab mount you

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.160 
the frame is carrying the cab mount you
know<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> cab<00:02:03.420> mount<00:02:03.630> goes<00:02:03.750> across<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
know the cab mount goes across the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.770 
know the cab mount goes across the
frames<00:02:04.440> about<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.820> piece<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
frames about here this piece the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.930 
frames about here this piece the
original<00:02:07.110> piece<00:02:07.260> was<00:02:07.440> gonna<00:02:07.560> hit<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
original piece was gonna hit that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.000 
original piece was gonna hit that
outrigger<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> frame<00:02:09.510> so<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.709> had<00:02:10.890> to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
outrigger on the frame so this had to

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.949 
outrigger on the frame so this had to
get<00:02:11.160> modified<00:02:11.430> anyway<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.600> cut<00:02:12.840> out

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
get modified anyway so I just cut out

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.960 
get modified anyway so I just cut out
whatever<00:02:13.170> was<00:02:13.410> rusty<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.490> replaced

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
whatever was rusty and and replaced

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.720 
whatever was rusty and and replaced
every<00:02:15.930> place<00:02:16.140> didn't<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.520> whole

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
every place didn't do this this whole

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.520 
every place didn't do this this whole
area<00:02:21.090> back<00:02:21.270> here<00:02:21.330> was<00:02:21.690> pretty<00:02:21.870> bad<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:22.440> was

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
area back here was pretty bad there was

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.760 
area back here was pretty bad there was
a<00:02:22.590> lot<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:23.100> lot<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.490> little<00:02:23.790> holes<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.510> and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
a lot of a lot of little holes in it and

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.900 
a lot of a lot of little holes in it and
so<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:25.890> not<00:02:26.010> really<00:02:26.250> worth<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.459> savings<00:02:26.820> it

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
so it's not really worth the savings it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.110 
so it's not really worth the savings it
was<00:02:27.000> best<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.510> cut<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> whole<00:02:28.530> thing<00:02:28.830> out

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
was best just to cut the whole thing out

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.910 
was best just to cut the whole thing out
and<00:02:30.120> replace<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.870> new<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:34.470> took<00:02:34.650> an<00:02:34.769> old

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and replace it with new it took an old

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.670 
and replace it with new it took an old
excavator<00:02:35.700> bucket<00:02:36.120> pin<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.330> had<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.959> welded<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
excavator bucket pin I had and welded a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.920 
excavator bucket pin I had and welded a
piece<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.280> angle<00:02:38.580> iron<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:39.780> I

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
piece of the angle iron on to it so I

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.930 
piece of the angle iron on to it so I
could<00:02:40.080> stick<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.560> vise<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:41.760> way<00:02:41.910> I

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
could stick it in the vise that way I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.449 
could stick it in the vise that way I
could<00:02:42.120> make<00:02:42.269> my<00:02:42.480> curves<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.680> like<00:02:44.300> patches

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
could make my curves and like patches

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.850 
could make my curves and like patches
I'm<00:02:47.459> using<00:02:47.670> my<00:02:48.140> handy<00:02:49.140> little<00:02:49.260> Eastwood

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
I'm using my handy little Eastwood

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.720 
I'm using my handy little Eastwood
clamps<00:02:50.489> here<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:52.560> hold<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:52.950> panel<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.519> place

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
clamps here to hold this panel in place

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.979 
clamps here to hold this panel in place
while<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.980> weld<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:57.180> once<00:02:57.420> again<00:02:57.570> we're

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
while I weld it in and once again we're

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.900 
while I weld it in and once again we're
using<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.380> little<00:02:58.530> clamps<00:02:59.190> from<00:02:59.340> Eastwood

company<00:03:01.160> they're<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.340> sponsoring<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.450> I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
company they're not sponsoring this I

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.539 
company they're not sponsoring this I
just<00:03:03.720> think<00:03:04.200> people<00:03:04.350> should<00:03:04.530> have<00:03:04.800> them<00:03:05.040> and

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
just think people should have them and

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.940 
just think people should have them and
that's<00:03:05.670> where<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:05.970> find<00:03:06.180> them<00:03:06.950> because

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
that's where you find them because

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.280 
that's where you find them because
there's<00:03:08.220> curvature<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.360> cab<00:03:09.660> I'm

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
there's curvature in the cab I'm

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.580 
there's curvature in the cab I'm
starting<00:03:11.130> out<00:03:11.220> in<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> corner<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.360> here<00:03:13.519> and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
starting out in the corner up here and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.490 
starting out in the corner up here and
just<00:03:16.590> tack<00:03:16.860> weld<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.850> about<00:03:18.510> maybe<00:03:18.690> six<00:03:19.380> or

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
just tack weld that about maybe six or

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.140 
just tack weld that about maybe six or
eight<00:03:19.650> inches<00:03:19.980> out<00:03:20.160> from<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> corner<00:03:20.790> and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
eight inches out from the corner and

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.470 
eight inches out from the corner and
then<00:03:21.630> move<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.049> clamps<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.299> just<00:03:24.299> keep

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
then move the clamps and just keep

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.100 
then move the clamps and just keep
tacking<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.350> conform<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.519> curve

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
tacking it and conform to the curve

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.390 
tacking it and conform to the curve
I<00:03:31.670> figured<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.790> would<00:03:32.880> be<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.030> lot<00:03:33.300> easier<00:03:33.540> to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
I figured it would be a lot easier to

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.350 
I figured it would be a lot easier to
weld<00:03:35.400> these<00:03:35.580> panels<00:03:36.180> on<00:03:36.920> like<00:03:37.920> tip<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.880> cab<00:03:39.150> up

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
weld these panels on like tip the cab up

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.660 
weld these panels on like tip the cab up
on<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.660> up<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> firewall<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.160> standing<00:03:41.580> on

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
on it up on the firewall and standing on

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.790 
on it up on the firewall and standing on
it<00:03:41.790> those<00:03:44.660> those<00:03:45.660> little<00:03:45.750> clamps<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.590> use

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
it those those little clamps that I use

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.700 
it those those little clamps that I use

what I got from eastwood they do a

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.840 
what I got from eastwood they do a
pretty<00:03:49.890> good<00:03:49.950> job<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.370> keeping<00:03:50.490> everything

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
pretty good job of keeping everything

00:03:50.850 --> 00:04:00.349 
pretty good job of keeping everything
flush<00:03:51.620> really<00:03:52.620> like<00:03:52.860> that

and the reservoir for the hydraulic
sludge<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.990> what<00:04:56.139> I<00:04:56.169> did<00:04:56.289> was<00:04:56.650> modify<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.520> Dakota

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
sludge so what I did was modify a Dakota

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.890 
sludge so what I did was modify a Dakota
bracket<00:04:59.520> to<00:05:00.520> hold<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.970> suspend<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:01.509> pedals

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
bracket to hold to suspend the pedals

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.300 
bracket to hold to suspend the pedals
and<00:05:03.300> it's<00:05:04.300> gonna<00:05:04.419> work<00:05:04.599> fine<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.830> they<00:05:05.949> bolted

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
and it's gonna work fine and they bolted

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.290 
and it's gonna work fine and they bolted
it<00:05:06.430> through<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.930> firewall<00:05:07.930> gildo<00:05:08.409> hole<00:05:09.300> it's

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
it through the firewall gildo hole it's

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:19.500 
it through the firewall gildo hole it's
pretty<00:05:10.539> much<00:05:10.630> pretty<00:05:11.409> much<00:05:11.530> ready<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.919> go

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.330 

so<00:05:20.510> here<00:05:20.720> I'm<00:05:20.870> modifying<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.920> radiator

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
so here I'm modifying the radiator

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.630 
so here I'm modifying the radiator
support<00:05:22.580> from<00:05:23.480> a<00:05:23.600> Dakota<00:05:24.220> so<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.490> tops<00:05:25.790> of<00:05:26.390> the

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
support from a Dakota so the tops of the

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.190 
support from a Dakota so the tops of the
support<00:05:28.640> will<00:05:28.910> made<00:05:29.180> up<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.480> the<00:05:29.570> nose<00:05:29.840> of<00:05:29.870> the

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
support will made up to the nose of the

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.340 
support will made up to the nose of the
57<00:05:33.460> lettuce<00:05:34.460> fabricated<00:05:35.240> these<00:05:35.390> out<00:05:35.660> of<00:05:35.840> angle

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
57 lettuce fabricated these out of angle

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.350 
57 lettuce fabricated these out of angle
steel<00:05:36.680> so<00:05:36.980> they'd<00:05:37.100> be<00:05:37.220> a<00:05:37.250> little<00:05:37.430> stronger

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
steel so they'd be a little stronger

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:45.020 
steel so they'd be a little stronger
instead<00:05:38.750> of<00:05:38.840> using<00:05:38.930> sheet<00:05:39.260> metal

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.800 

I<00:05:46.700> thought<00:05:47.700> it<00:05:47.880> might<00:05:48.000> be<00:05:48.030> smart<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.600> weld

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
I thought it might be smart the weld

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.140 
I thought it might be smart the weld
nuts<00:05:49.170> on<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.530> back<00:05:49.830> make<00:05:50.760> it<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:50.910> little<00:05:51.030> easier

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
nuts on the back make it a little easier

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.020 
nuts on the back make it a little easier
when<00:05:51.540> I'm<00:05:51.860> mounting<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:53.130> fenders<00:05:53.550> nothing

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
when I'm mounting the fenders nothing

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.370 
when I'm mounting the fenders nothing
else<00:05:54.240> would<00:05:54.360> be<00:05:54.390> one<00:05:54.660> less<00:05:54.840> thing<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:55.140> fumble

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
else would be one less thing to fumble

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.600 
else would be one less thing to fumble
with<00:05:55.710> behind<00:05:55.980> the<00:05:56.190> bracket<00:05:58.190> so<00:05:59.190> this<00:05:59.340> is<00:05:59.490> the

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
with behind the bracket so this is the

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.600 
with behind the bracket so this is the
modified<00:06:00.000> radiator<00:06:00.810> support<00:06:00.990> in<00:06:01.560> place<00:06:01.830> and

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
modified radiator support in place and

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.390 
modified radiator support in place and
it's<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.540> holding<00:06:03.870> up<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:04.050> nose<00:06:04.320> here

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
it's just holding up the nose here

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.790 
it's just holding up the nose here
I<00:06:05.540> had<00:06:06.540> to<00:06:06.630> test<00:06:06.870> fit<00:06:07.170> it<00:06:07.260> to<00:06:07.320> make<00:06:07.470> sure<00:06:07.500> that

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
I had to test fit it to make sure that

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.130 
I had to test fit it to make sure that
bolt<00:06:08.790> holes<00:06:09.060> were<00:06:09.240> gonna<00:06:09.390> line<00:06:09.600> up<00:06:09.630> after<00:06:10.110> I

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
bolt holes were gonna line up after I

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.110 
bolt holes were gonna line up after I
did<00:06:10.290> my<00:06:10.320> welding<00:06:10.830> but<00:06:11.070> everything's<00:06:11.670> fine

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
did my welding but everything's fine

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.460 
did my welding but everything's fine
which<00:06:12.480> is<00:06:12.630> good<00:06:13.310> reassuring<00:06:14.900> but<00:06:15.900> those<00:06:16.080> bolts

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
which is good reassuring but those bolts

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.860 
which is good reassuring but those bolts
will<00:06:16.590> come<00:06:16.770> out<00:06:17.120> when<00:06:18.120> I<00:06:18.150> put<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.390> fenders<00:06:18.720> on

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
will come out when I put the fenders on

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.270 
will come out when I put the fenders on
those<00:06:19.020> bolts<00:06:19.260> will<00:06:19.440> also<00:06:19.890> go<00:06:20.040> through<00:06:20.250> the

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
those bolts will also go through the

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.810 
those bolts will also go through the
fenders<00:06:21.440> so<00:06:22.440> these<00:06:22.620> pieces<00:06:22.980> here<00:06:23.460> gonna<00:06:23.670> have

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
fenders so these pieces here gonna have

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.940 
fenders so these pieces here gonna have
to<00:06:23.940> get<00:06:24.090> cut<00:06:24.420> out<00:06:24.600> because<00:06:25.350> they're<00:06:25.680> gonna<00:06:25.770> be

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
to get cut out because they're gonna be

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:43.139 
to get cut out because they're gonna be
in<00:06:26.040> the<00:06:26.130> way<00:06:26.310> of<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.550> decoder<00:06:26.850> radiator

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:43.149 

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:45.540 

and<00:06:43.539> powdered<00:06:44.020> a<00:06:44.110> little<00:06:44.679> bit<00:06:44.860> of<00:06:44.949> an<00:06:45.039> issue

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
and powdered a little bit of an issue

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.659 
and powdered a little bit of an issue
putting<00:06:46.240> the<00:06:46.330> radiator<00:06:46.749> in<00:06:47.189> it<00:06:48.189> turns<00:06:48.429> out

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:48.669 
putting the radiator in it turns out

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.629 
putting the radiator in it turns out
when<00:06:48.879> the<00:06:49.059> hood<00:06:49.360> is<00:06:49.749> shut<00:06:50.289> part<00:06:51.129> of<00:06:51.219> the<00:06:51.279> inside

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 
when the hood is shut part of the inside

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:52.949 
when the hood is shut part of the inside
of<00:06:51.669> the<00:06:51.849> foot<00:06:52.029> is<00:06:52.119> gonna<00:06:52.270> hit<00:06:52.389> the<00:06:52.419> radiator

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959 
of the foot is gonna hit the radiator

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:56.909 
of the foot is gonna hit the radiator
cap<00:06:54.119> so<00:06:55.119> I<00:06:55.149> had<00:06:55.300> to<00:06:55.389> cut<00:06:55.629> a<00:06:55.659> little<00:06:55.959> area<00:06:56.139> out<00:06:56.499> on

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
cap so I had to cut a little area out on

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.059 
cap so I had to cut a little area out on
the<00:06:57.189> inside<00:06:57.339> you<00:06:57.909> can<00:06:57.999> see<00:06:58.679> it<00:06:59.679> used<00:06:59.860> to<00:06:59.979> be

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:00.069 
the inside you can see it used to be

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:02.999 
the inside you can see it used to be
like<00:07:00.249> that<00:07:01.349> so<00:07:02.349> I<00:07:02.379> had<00:07:02.499> to<00:07:02.589> cut<00:07:02.740> a<00:07:02.770> little

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
like that so I had to cut a little

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:08.040 
like that so I had to cut a little
section<00:07:03.369> out<00:07:03.550> and<00:07:05.309> fabricate<00:07:06.309> some<00:07:06.490> pieces<00:07:07.050> to

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
section out and fabricate some pieces to

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.969 
section out and fabricate some pieces to
receive<00:07:08.499> the<00:07:08.679> cap<00:07:10.199> so<00:07:11.199> I<00:07:11.229> had<00:07:11.409> to<00:07:11.499> make<00:07:11.679> up<00:07:11.709> a

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979 
receive the cap so I had to make up a

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:14.189 
receive the cap so I had to make up a
couple<00:07:12.610> little<00:07:12.819> pieces<00:07:13.089> out<00:07:13.389> of<00:07:13.479> my<00:07:13.569> 18<00:07:13.899> gauge

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 
couple little pieces out of my 18 gauge

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:21.149 
couple little pieces out of my 18 gauge
steel<00:07:14.969> get<00:07:15.969> in<00:07:16.089> here<00:07:16.300> like<00:07:16.479> so<00:07:19.679> so<00:07:20.679> when<00:07:20.800> I<00:07:20.830> weld

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:21.159 
steel get in here like so so when I weld

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:23.909 
steel get in here like so so when I weld
that<00:07:21.399> all<00:07:21.639> in<00:07:21.969> there<00:07:22.539> and<00:07:23.199> grind<00:07:23.439> everything

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 
that all in there and grind everything

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.869 
that all in there and grind everything
off<00:07:24.099> it'll<00:07:24.399> it'll<00:07:25.360> work<00:07:25.599> pretty<00:07:25.779> good
