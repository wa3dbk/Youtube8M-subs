00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.650
 welcome to the new meat video 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.750
 plant remember that in previous videos 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 I think those who were past do not know how 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.189
 I do not have ordered in the channel 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.630
 we saw with the substrate types 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.849
 different there were in the alternatives 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.600
 that we had the blond mob that like 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.700
 You saw there were few but in this video 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.410
 today I'm going to teach you to go to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.290
 transplant an already normal extraction and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.450
 we are going to put 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.450
 let's use the wood chip 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.020
 and in the coconut fiber you will see how it is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.170
 a very simple process is the same as 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.300
 any other type of transplant and how 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.610
 the csa the tapeworm continue to survive the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.989
 after a certain time you will not see 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.879
 this video you will see in videos 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.059
 next but good in this one goes to the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.309
 beginning of the process and so nothing to 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.080
 I shut up and we go to it and good as 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.600
 you see here we have the other substrates the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.800
 coconut fiber that we have put around 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.880
 of 40% and 60% of wood chips 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.850
 remember that both are perfect 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 alternatives to blonde peat and that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.500
 two severely damage us in the middle 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.200
 environment since the impact on zero does not 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.869
 exists unless it is the minimum 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.360
 possible and good here we have the to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.520
 racing since we are going to transplant 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.990
 I have tried to make it a salvation 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.780
 that has not yet left the 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.940
 hibernation to not make life bitter 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.940
 to those who are already in floral workshop 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520
 and good in this case is a copy of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.670
 that ration and have still taken a 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.380
 generation we have both their dishes 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.380
 we mix them 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.229
 you see as the substrate resulting from the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.259
 of the mixture of these two is a substrate 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.129
 what 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.310
 pretty spongy enough to fix 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:18.040
 spongy and also contains fiber 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.409
 coconut that lowers the ph a bit and 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.400
 will give a bit of body what unifies everything 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.590
 it is made more uniform by coconut fiber 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.010
 will allow us to retain a little more 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.159
 of moisture that had to be made the chip 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.159
 of wood 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.410
 well we have it 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.410
 we put water 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.610
 6 is already hydrated even faster 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.610
 that in the blond mob 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.210
 this is the result 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.850
 and if we press 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.850
 you see how it holds water very well 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.430
 even if it's perfect 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.420
 we take the new pot and fill it 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.790
 up to half more or less 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.430
 now you 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.200
 and now we take the old plant the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.519
 plant in question I cut this one this 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.519
 pot because it was already broken 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.989
 to remove the peat 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.099
 we separate 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.680
 fix as a small outbreak 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.680
 half twisted 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.930
 but you can see the little outbreak that 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.450
 starts to come out so in a couple 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.319
 of weeks we will have new sheets of 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.319
 that cooked clay 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.190
 and the usual typical when it comes to 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.190
 transport we fill we make a 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.130
 little hole 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.609
 we put the plant the root 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.620
 and we finished with tapas 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.870
 in this case there are no problems and if 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.909
 we press a little more than the peat 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.810
 blonde since the wood chip as I have 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:29.210
 said that gives us a lot of aeration to 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.319
 substratum 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.550
 and see how it has been perfect you see 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:39.410
 here we have a result and now the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.720
 process to follow is exactly the same 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.400
 than with any other with any 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.230
 another carnivorous plant that we have in 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.230
 blonde mob 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.420
 and well this has been all for today 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.950
 It has been a very simple video but now 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.230
 you have seen we already have a 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.410
 representation of how to do what 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.850
 proportion is more or less use and 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.080
 well I hope you liked this 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.270
 video and you 've already seen what 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.710
 it is an incentive more to have plants 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.280
 what animals the fact that we can 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.750
 use sawdust or wood shavings in 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.659
 our plants and that is that we are 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.030
 sincere in what kind of plants 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:20.689
 market we will be able to use sawdust 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.919
 not only in these we see ourselves in the 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.919
 next video chao
