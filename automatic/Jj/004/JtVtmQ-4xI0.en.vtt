00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
eyes I think the only way that you could

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.479 
eyes I think the only way that you could
get<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.760> have<00:04:21.000> more

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
get to have more

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.249 
get to have more
like<00:04:21.669> than<00:04:21.819> this<00:04:22.000> is<00:04:22.270> if<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.900> happen<00:04:23.229> to

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
like than this is if you happen to

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.200 
like than this is if you happen to
ingest<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:23.949> whole<00:04:24.099> clove<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.669> stuff<00:04:24.940> and

ingest a whole clove of the stuff and

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.480 
ingest a whole clove of the stuff and
really<00:04:26.139> I<00:04:26.259> don't<00:04:26.380> think<00:04:26.590> I'd<00:04:26.860> recommend<00:04:27.370> that

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490
