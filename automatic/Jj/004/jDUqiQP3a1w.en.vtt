00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.619
 I came as fast as I could

 was murdered 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.530
 they sure are clear murder is one 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.530
 exclusively capitalist disease 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.969
 let it be good there is no murder in 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.149

 someone has beaten off my son and 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.440
 you do not do it 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.930
 there's always free running around me 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.860
 have to find him 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.860
 I come with 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.340
 I thought that will interest you 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.200
 remains one more 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.880
 I need is why are the children like that? 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.479
 important this best will not stop 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.490
 close 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.640
 how are you going to bring him to justice? 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.899
 for two 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.979
 somebody has to do it anyway 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:31.609
 could still die a child in the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.609
 stop killer 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:01.690
 All children between nine and 14 years 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:04.409
 43 total 44 my son's son 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.409
 has also been murdered 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.109
 Kindt 44 struck 137 minutes one 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.650
 Age approval is not yet 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.989
 known 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.629
 but I type fsk 16 and stacks off the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.219
 fourth june 2015 in german cinemas 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.280
 and tells the story of leo 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.989
 demidow fans to the war hero of the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.790
 Soviet Union only one of the 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.950
 flag hoisted in berlin's 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.420
 images around the world gone what 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.430
 The story here is only one 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.200
 the later from the Soviet system 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.329
 function only at the secret service one 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.920
 of which one is afraid but also first 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.989
 one of those so a little human in 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.939
 the oh-so-evil world in all only 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.799
 want to break off and kill and first 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.750
 but also one of the must 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.669
 that murder kills a serial killer of 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.290
 children cut up or perfidiously 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.120
 and drowned or was too 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.709
 at the same time can not pursue this 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.510
 because murder can not do it in paradise 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.609
 give after stalin murder is one 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.200
 capitalist illness and what makes 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.730
 one if one is functional but the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.549
 system can not contradict it 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.230
 a child arises 44 a thriller of 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.970
 in many moments it has great aspects 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.359
 tom hardy as the main character in the 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.709
 role 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.970
 but much of his trade from the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.500
 provide treatment on his shoulder 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.780
 can and especially here a lot 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.220
 gloomy image of the soviet union lines 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.389
 But in many moments, yes, too 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.799
 can not decide properly there is 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.750
 There are two complete strands of action 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.579
 the career of this man is over 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.169
 turns at some point needs to borrow 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.459
 or this system and 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.690
 but at the same time the story 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.010
 this murder she tries her 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.379
 to enlighten his side a woman 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.120
 magnificently played by noomi rapace the 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.709
 where you do not really know what it is 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.150
 gary has oldman or 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.799
 another one has a box in it 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.479
 In any case, a nice mix 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.340
 from good actors beautiful optics 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.349
 the movie that can actually do more 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.849
 but should be disappointed at the very end 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.959
 and then you ask yourself why it is 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.310
 him two strands of action that way 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.780
 equivalent told if that's not 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.790
 really knows that wants to fell to me now 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.379
 actually say that gross enemy image 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.299
 from good and evil and all are evil 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.919
 in the middle of the Soviet Union during tom 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.699
 hardy the only good thing is with his 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.530
 woman guided 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.569
 is also a bit unrealistic 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.459
 But that's the way it is 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.959
 to draw a black and white picture 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.189
 just too easy to get one 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.109
 to make thriller in many 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.970
 moments should be exciting but almost 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.489
 He has many dramatic elements and 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.930
 the 137 minutes are then easy 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.609
 half an hour too long that one 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.870
 think in between that is now 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.489
 somehow just a tick too 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.710
 become boring few moments 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.729
 and means the child 44 at the end of such a 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.040
 film is born he would normally 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.780
 directv that is on dvd and blu 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.370
 come out and not necessarily in the cinema 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.630
 but i'm running with tom hardy maybe 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.340
 You can try cast there a bit 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.080
 to move in this direction and should am 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.430
 end means I'm not overwhelmed 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.990
 but rather under the world not well because 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.430
 the whole thing in the film notes the 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.960
 could have been pinching others with a few 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.870
 But they are more skillful and mean 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.580
 applies 44 gets from me as a thriller 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.530
 four and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.390
 Overall, only disappointing 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.050
 4 out of 10 possible points are a pity 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.670
 what a shame 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.710
 and there I am in my review of it 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.420
 like to leave a thumbnail this place 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.220
 we do not otherwise know that you exist 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.170
 a few left around me and tomorrow around 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.180
 15 clock, of course, at the latest, a new one 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.640
 video and hope you are 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.640
 of course again at 3
