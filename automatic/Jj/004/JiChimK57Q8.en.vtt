00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
and I thought for this card it'd be very

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.689 
and I thought for this card it'd be very
appropriate<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.259> just<00:05:04.439> take<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.590> couple<00:05:04.800> that

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
appropriate so just take a couple that

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:14.140 
appropriate so just take a couple that
match<00:05:05.939> your<00:05:06.120> color<00:05:06.360> scheme

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.530

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.870 

think<00:05:20.540> three<00:05:20.930> will<00:05:21.110> be<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.350> magic<00:05:21.500> number
