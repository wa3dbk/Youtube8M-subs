00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
from he had a retro 3 but I think on the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.310 
from he had a retro 3 but I think on the
quarter<00:01:03.239> they're<00:01:03.390> pretty<00:01:03.570> pretty<00:01:03.840> well<00:01:04.140> for

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
quarter they're pretty pretty well for

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
quarter they're pretty pretty well for
life<00:01:04.640> that's<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> history<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> shoe<00:01:06.360> and

Jordan<00:04:26.479> 189<00:04:27.139> they<00:04:27.470> call<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.740> 89<00:04:28.130> because<00:04:28.490> you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
Jordan 189 they call it 89 because you

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.040 
Jordan 189 they call it 89 because you
can<00:04:28.729> see<00:04:28.880> they<00:04:29.000> have<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.540> mesh<00:04:29.750> right
