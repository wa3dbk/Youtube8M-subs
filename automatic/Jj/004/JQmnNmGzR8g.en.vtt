00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 clean up having fun if if you 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.720
 see that it's possible for students 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.670
 a family assistant's assistant 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.500
 and collective is a company 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.210
 Dance Ardèche imagined a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.130
 another way to learn the job 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.509
 annoyance bourgeois nicolas ferro you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 tell us a little bit about this 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.670
 surprising ball story and she 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.500
 dance but make no mistake 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.539
 accomplished gestures are not done at 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.779
 hazard 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 first we do all ages and after we 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.129
 do the claws then until the end 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.930
 this is the technical gesture the high school 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.969
 learn has served as raw material to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.710
 the choreographer the company of 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.600
 mobylettes intervenes in school 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.789
 to introduce all audiences to the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.480
 artistic practice 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.980
 the gestures does the most gently for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.590
 that they are clearly visible and well 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.760
 ample for us how does that matter 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.430
 we can make a matter 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.500
 choreographic by distorting it into 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.650
 repeating and so it's working 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.290
 with with this group for I was at 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.600
 heart of my concerns 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.220
 choreographic note that in this 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
 script written by the four small 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.710
 housewives clichés have a hard tooth 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.140
 the role of the leader goes to the single male 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.150
 but in the end at the end it's long 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.890
 years they refused domination 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.890
 still you saw the conclusion 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.610
 in short the artistic transformation 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.729
 in any case applies to all 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.710
 disciplines 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.330
 it's not like it's 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.500
 sell the ferment because we have fun 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.930
 there is the click behind 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.369
 initially it was difficult because 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.560
 that they are used to when I 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.850
 gives a drawing sheet and there in 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.800
 did they were asked to create 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.810
 with their bodies so it was inevitably 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.090
 more difficult but we are in a 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.190
 society also where the young and the image in 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.650
 done is very present so eventually 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.420
 it carried them to the end in five 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.340
 work sessions the apprentices have 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.500
 managed to make gesture a priori 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.810
 daunting a real moment of pleasure 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.520
 a lesson that can even be 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.520
 application alone at home 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.650
 the following report is likely to 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.650
 you on
