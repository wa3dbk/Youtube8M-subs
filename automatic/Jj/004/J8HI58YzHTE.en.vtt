00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.410

 obstacles and which normally damages the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.560
 our car mainly the wheels but 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.110
 of the car ends up being an attitude almost 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.360
 which is automatic 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.940
 after all, they end up giving a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:46.469

 of exclusivity for the car and has no 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.110
 way 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.690
 the proximity to asphalt causes 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.120
 some problems in this relationship with good 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.820
 appearance as the grated wheel or 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.530
 for many people is a reason for 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.410
 a lot of headaches 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.570
 but here in Brazil the repair process 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 has become more and more sophisticated 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.100
 bringing more confidence in this type of 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.340
 service this company she brought a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.890
 industry standard repair process 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.750
 American for Brazil, we went there 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.759
 We brought the receiving technology 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 training to be able to start using a 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.409
 another process of repair in which people 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.880
 can give structural guarantee guarantee of 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.600
 that the wheel has safety to be 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.450
 repaired 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.880
 when entering the repair line the wheel 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.000
 pass first by the knee 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.890
 after superficial scratching and scratching 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 are filled with a special mass 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.900
 quick-drying 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.850
 then the part is sanded manually and 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.000
 prepared to enter the cabin of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.000
 painting 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.300
 the cost of wheel repair can vary 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.979
 between 250 and 400 reais 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.350
 the advantage of having equipment 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.840
 Modern that is the reduction of time 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.880
 repair and impose new standards of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.520
 quality also for those who think of 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.229
 customize the wheel the main thing that 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.350
 we also brought the market in the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.910
 differentiation because repair is the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.840
 repair of raised wheels with the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.610
 cnc lathe 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.470
 this is the most different thing 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.790
 people have why until today nobody in the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.830
 brazil made repairs of wheels of 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.580
 using a computerized lathe 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.160
 like this 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.680
 diamond wheels represent the ultimate 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.050
 trend in this automotive fashion 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.840
 but there are those who prefer to change the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.630
 color in which case the service eliminates the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.220
 need to remove the tire by reducing 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.220
 enough working time
