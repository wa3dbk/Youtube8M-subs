part<00:05:32.760> of<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.150> dream<00:05:33.390> so<00:05:34.380> it's<00:05:34.500> just<00:05:34.710> kind<00:05:34.920> of

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
part of the dream so it's just kind of

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.360 
part of the dream so it's just kind of
given<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.250> student<00:05:36.230> or<00:05:37.230> the<00:05:37.260> teacher<00:05:37.770> an<00:05:38.130> idea

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
given the student or the teacher an idea

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.830 
given the student or the teacher an idea
of<00:05:38.460> how<00:05:38.610> well<00:05:38.820> they're<00:05:38.940> doing<00:05:38.970> in<00:05:39.210> class<00:05:39.480> and

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
of how well they're doing in class and

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.270 
of how well they're doing in class and
as<00:05:40.290> the<00:05:40.560> grade<00:05:40.800> changes<00:05:41.400> so<00:05:42.390> too<00:05:42.450> does<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:42.870> bar

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
as the grade changes so too does the bar

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.350 
as the grade changes so too does the bar
see<00:05:44.280> as<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.610> keeps<00:05:44.730> going<00:05:45.030> down<00:05:45.590> it<00:05:46.590> gets<00:05:46.740> worse

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
see as it keeps going down it gets worse

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.780 
see as it keeps going down it gets worse
but<00:05:48.360> for<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.600> sake<00:05:48.840> we're<00:05:49.170> gonna<00:05:49.260> go<00:05:49.470> say<00:05:49.830> 90

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
but for the sake we're gonna go say 90

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.260 
but for the sake we're gonna go say 90
