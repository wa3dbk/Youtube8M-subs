what<00:00:01.020> does<00:00:01.170> it<00:00:01.319> mean<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.680> be<00:00:01.800> an<00:00:01.890> architecture

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
what does it mean to be an architecture

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.390 
what does it mean to be an architecture
means<00:00:02.820> so<00:00:03.120> many<00:00:03.419> things<00:00:03.710> rather<00:00:04.710> than<00:00:05.009> it<00:00:05.190> be

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
means so many things rather than it be

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.509 
means so many things rather than it be
fewer<00:00:06.210> things<00:00:06.480> fits<00:00:07.109> more<00:00:07.350> things<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:08.429> it

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
fewer things fits more things we see it

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.180 
fewer things fits more things we see it
as<00:00:08.639> an<00:00:08.760> expanding<00:00:09.420> profession<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.889> we<00:00:11.010> don't

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
as an expanding profession and we don't

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.919 
as an expanding profession and we don't
see<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.429> role<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.670> architects<00:00:12.360> diminishing

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
see the role of architects diminishing

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.829 
see the role of architects diminishing
we<00:00:13.110> see<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.380> becoming<00:00:13.980> greater<00:00:14.570> the<00:00:15.570> best

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
we see it becoming greater the best

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.240 
we see it becoming greater the best
thing<00:00:16.049> about<00:00:16.109> architecture<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.920> think<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.220> that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
thing about architecture I think is that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.570 
thing about architecture I think is that
you<00:00:17.460> feel<00:00:17.699> really<00:00:18.090> engaged<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.199> global

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
you feel really engaged in global

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.890 
you feel really engaged in global
conversations<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:21.180> big<00:00:21.480> things<00:00:21.779> that

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
conversations like big things that

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
conversations like big things that
people<00:00:22.050> are<00:00:22.529> interested<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.640> around<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
people are interested in around the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.000 
people are interested in around the
world<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:25.019> feel<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.800> actually

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
world and you feel like you can actually

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.640 
world and you feel like you can actually
make<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:27.060> sort<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.330> active<00:00:27.840> contribution<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
make some sort of active contribution to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.320 
make some sort of active contribution to
that<00:00:28.680> even<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.250> it's<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> small<00:00:29.670> scale<00:00:30.150> in

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
that even if it's on a small scale in

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.069 
that even if it's on a small scale in
individual<00:00:31.140> projects<00:00:31.669> working<00:00:32.669> regionally

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079

every single person knows what you're

doing you can be walking down the street
and<00:00:38.700> people<00:00:39.000> stop<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> talk<00:00:40.379> about<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and people stop you and talk about the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.810 
and people stop you and talk about the

work that you're doing
and<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.899> adds<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.410> level<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.829> accountability

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and that adds a level of accountability

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.779 
and that adds a level of accountability
to<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.329> work<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.340> it<00:00:47.340> means<00:00:47.579> you're

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to the work that we do it means you're

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.520 
to the work that we do it means you're
always<00:00:47.910> striving<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.870> something<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> little

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
always striving to do something a little

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.580 
always striving to do something a little
bit<00:00:49.649> better<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:51.270> business<00:00:51.719> started<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.379> as<00:00:52.559> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
bit better the business started out as a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.090 
bit better the business started out as a
bit<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.100> accident<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:54.350> have<00:00:55.350> always<00:00:55.680> enjoyed

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
bit of an accident I have always enjoyed

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.330 
bit of an accident I have always enjoyed
working<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.510> others<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.920> major

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
working with others that's a major

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.340 
working with others that's a major
reason<00:00:59.730> why<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> co-working<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.050> us

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
reason why I have the co-working with us

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950 
reason why I have the co-working with us
is<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:03.000> good<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.600> own<00:01:03.719> you

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
is that you know good on your own you

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.950 
is that you know good on your own you
learn<00:01:04.170> from<00:01:04.619> others<00:01:05.240> I've<00:01:06.240> always<00:01:06.570> been<00:01:06.720> drawn

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
learn from others I've always been drawn

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.649 
learn from others I've always been drawn
to<00:01:06.990> making<00:01:07.500> things<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:09.000> University<00:01:09.630> of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to making things and the University of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.380 
to making things and the University of
Tasmania<00:01:09.840> definitely<00:01:10.470> advocates<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
Tasmania definitely advocates for that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.719 
Tasmania definitely advocates for that
it's<00:01:12.390> nice<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.869> finish<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.920> busy<00:01:14.070> day<00:01:14.220> at

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
it's nice to finish a really busy day at

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.789 
it's nice to finish a really busy day at
work<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.299> come<00:01:15.659> home<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.470> into<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
work and just come home and get into the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.190 
work and just come home and get into the
garage<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.340> start<00:01:18.060> shaping<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.720> sanding<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
garage and start shaping or sanding a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
garage and start shaping or sanding a
piece<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.470> wood<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.880> about

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
piece of wood it's a bit about

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.020 
piece of wood it's a bit about
reflection<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.600> guess<00:01:22.189> there<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.369> many<00:01:23.670> many

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
reflection I guess there are many many

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.840 
reflection I guess there are many many
ways<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.930> an<00:01:25.200> architect<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.280> contribute

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
ways to be an architect and contribute

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
ways to be an architect and contribute
to<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> built<00:01:27.360> environment<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.560> us<00:01:28.890> we

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
to the built environment but for us we

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.090 
to the built environment but for us we
both<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:30.180> wanted<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.110> develop<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.680> practice

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
both really wanted to develop a practice

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.160 
both really wanted to develop a practice
model<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> meant<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.180> could<00:01:33.450> be<00:01:33.810> part

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
model that meant that we could be part

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.960 
model that meant that we could be part
of<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> conversation<00:01:35.159> which<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.490> for

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
of a conversation which was for

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.680 
of a conversation which was for
many<00:01:36.690> rather<00:01:37.020> than<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.440> benefit<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.130> few

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
many rather than the benefit of a few

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.120 
many rather than the benefit of a few
erinite<00:01:39.690> speak<00:01:40.140> quite<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.440> lot<00:01:40.650> about<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
erinite speak quite a lot about the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.520 
erinite speak quite a lot about the
values<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.700> live<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.970> practice<00:01:42.480> fire<00:01:42.690> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
values that we live a practice fire and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.470 
values that we live a practice fire and
one<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.860> those<00:01:44.010> is<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.460> stealthy<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.150> I

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
one of those is to be stealthy and I

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.510 
one of those is to be stealthy and I
think<00:01:45.660> that<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> realization<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.860> being<00:01:47.430> an

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
think that the realization that being an

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
think that the realization that being an
architect<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.630> an<00:01:48.870> influencer

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
architect you can be an influencer

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.130 
architect you can be an influencer
within<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.640> realm<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.150> city<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.870> an

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
incredibly important role and so we like

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
incredibly important role and so we like
to<00:01:54.540> think<00:01:54.810> about<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.620> role<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:55.860> code<00:01:56.220> can

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to think about the role that code can

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.420 
to think about the role that code can
play<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.330> influence<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.590> built<00:01:58.800> environment

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430

for me being in a large practice means

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.330 
for me being in a large practice means
that<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.360> enabled<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.040> can

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
that you can be enabled so you can

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.430 
that you can be enabled so you can
actually<00:02:14.520> bring<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.330> kind<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.959> really

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
architect you have to be curious about

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.759 
architect you have to be curious about
your<00:03:44.909> clients<00:03:45.450> about<00:03:45.510> sites<00:03:46.019> about<00:03:46.319> the

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
your clients about sites about the

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.670 
your clients about sites about the
possibilities<00:03:47.519> within<00:03:48.269> any<00:03:48.629> project<00:03:49.200> your

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
possibilities within any project your

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.710 
possibilities within any project your
ability<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.159> make<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> difference<00:03:51.030> or<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.329> add

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
ability to make a difference or to add

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.500 
ability to make a difference or to add
value<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.889> I<00:03:52.920> think<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.579> way<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:54.239> has

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
value but I think in a way that has

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.750 
value but I think in a way that has
relevance<00:03:55.290> that's<00:03:55.769> not<00:03:56.099> just<00:03:56.459> about

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
relevance that's not just about

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.110 
relevance that's not just about
architecture<00:03:57.799> there<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:59.069> definitely<00:03:59.760> a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
architecture there is definitely a

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.330 
architecture there is definitely a
commitment<00:04:00.690> from<00:04:01.200> local<00:04:01.590> architects<00:04:02.069> in

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
commitment from local architects in

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.220 
commitment from local architects in
regional<00:04:02.760> areas<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.450> sort<00:04:03.659> of<00:04:03.720> bleed<00:04:03.959> for

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
regional areas to sort of bleed for

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.500 
regional areas to sort of bleed for
their<00:04:04.349> project<00:04:04.799> so<00:04:05.370> it's<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.879> nice<00:04:06.030> feeling<00:04:06.480> to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
their project so it's a nice feeling to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.259 
their project so it's a nice feeling to
be<00:04:06.599> able<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.900> drive<00:04:07.139> around<00:04:07.349> and<00:04:07.940> actually<00:04:08.940> see

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
be able to drive around and actually see
