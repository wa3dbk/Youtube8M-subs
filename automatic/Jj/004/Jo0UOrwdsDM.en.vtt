unfortunately<00:03:53.970> as<00:03:54.150> far<00:03:54.209> as<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.660> know<00:03:54.720> there

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
unfortunately as far as I know there

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.310 
unfortunately as far as I know there
isn't<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.470> French<00:03:55.920> striker<00:03:56.610> with<00:03:57.120> five<00:03:58.049> star

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
isn't a French striker with five star

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.870 
isn't a French striker with five star
skills<00:03:58.680> and<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:59.160> don't<00:03:59.220> think<00:03:59.489> there's<00:03:59.760> one

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
skills and I don't think there's one

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.130 
skills and I don't think there's one
that<00:03:59.970> links<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.390> these<00:04:00.510> two<00:04:00.720> we're<00:04:00.900> strong

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
that links to these two we're strong

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.509 
that links to these two we're strong
link<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:01.410> that's<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.620> bit<00:04:01.769> unfortunate<00:04:02.040> if<00:04:02.430> you

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
link so that's a bit unfortunate if you
