00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
right hand pretty much for the main

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.630 
right hand pretty much for the main
little<00:01:12.460> riff<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.820> just<00:01:13.120> F<00:01:13.860> B<00:01:14.860> flat<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.460> then

little riff is just F B flat and then

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.010 
little riff is just F B flat and then
also<00:01:16.150> a<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.590> I'm<00:01:18.010> gonna<00:01:18.310> play<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:19.420> left<00:01:19.690> hand

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
also a so I'm gonna play the left hand

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.320 
also a so I'm gonna play the left hand
by<00:01:20.860> itself<00:01:21.190> first<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.759> can<00:01:21.910> kind<00:01:22.119> of<00:01:22.180> hear

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
by itself first so you can kind of hear

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.550 
by itself first so you can kind of hear
how<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.600> goes<00:01:22.750> because<00:01:23.080> when<00:01:23.229> it's<00:01:23.350> playing

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
how it goes because when it's playing

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.710 
how it goes because when it's playing
even<00:01:24.460> when<00:01:24.580> I<00:01:24.610> slow<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:24.880> down<00:01:25.000> it's<00:01:25.330> still<00:01:25.540> kind

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
even when I slow it down it's still kind

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.719 
even when I slow it down it's still kind
of<00:01:25.780> fast<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.110> I'm<00:01:26.860> gonna<00:01:26.979> play<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.310> left<00:01:27.520> hand

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
of fast so I'm gonna play the left hand

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:42.830 
of fast so I'm gonna play the left hand
just<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:27.910> you<00:01:27.970> can<00:01:28.119> hear<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.509> tempo<00:01:29.050> of<00:01:29.110> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.740 

then<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.530> repeats

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
then it just repeats

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.540 
then it just repeats
so<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> idea<00:01:47.010> that<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.370> then<00:01:47.460> now

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
so you get the idea that and then now

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.680 
so you get the idea that and then now
I'm<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.790> going<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:47.940> play<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.420> hand

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
I'm just going to play the right hand

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.730 
I'm just going to play the right hand
this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.410> weird<00:01:49.560> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
this is going to be kind of weird but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
this is going to be kind of weird but
just<00:01:49.920> play<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.160> right<00:01:50.250> hand<00:01:50.310> by<00:01:50.550> itself<00:01:51.110> as<00:01:52.110> if

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
just play the right hand by itself as if

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:18.080 
just play the right hand by itself as if
the<00:01:52.530> left<00:01:52.710> hand<00:01:52.890> we're<00:01:53.010> also<00:01:53.130> playing<00:01:53.400> with<00:01:53.580> it

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.570 

and<00:02:18.270> then<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.780> starts<00:02:19.290> over<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.620> repeats<00:02:19.950> now

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
and then it starts over and repeats now

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.000 
and then it starts over and repeats now
I'm<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.849> play<00:02:21.000> both<00:02:21.420> hands<00:02:21.660> together

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
I'm going to play both hands together

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.589 
I'm going to play both hands together
slowly<00:02:23.010> as<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.400> can<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:24.000> really<00:02:24.060> hard<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.480> play

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
slowly as I can it's really hard to play

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.479 
slowly as I can it's really hard to play
it<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:24.959> slow<00:02:25.170> because<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.530> just<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.890> just

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
it really slow because it just is just

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.710 
it really slow because it just is just
weird<00:02:26.730> because<00:02:26.880> I'm<00:02:27.060> used<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.390> playing<00:02:27.599> it

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
weird because I'm used to playing it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.360 
weird because I'm used to playing it
quickly<00:02:27.989> but<00:02:28.590> I'm<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> try<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.040> slow<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
quickly but I'm going to try to slow it

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.350 
quickly but I'm going to try to slow it
down<00:02:29.489> here<00:02:29.940> for<00:02:30.060> you

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:03:09.250 

you

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.820 

and<00:03:09.680> then<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.950> repeats<00:03:11.260> okay<00:03:12.260> I'll<00:03:12.500> play<00:03:12.620> one

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
and then it repeats okay I'll play one

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.990 
and then it repeats okay I'll play one
more<00:03:12.920> time<00:03:13.069> slowly

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:04:01.740 

you

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.510 

and<00:04:02.050> then<00:04:02.500> it<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.920> just<00:04:03.340> restarts<00:04:05.340> now<00:04:06.340> this

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
and then it it just restarts now this

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.920 
and then it it just restarts now this
