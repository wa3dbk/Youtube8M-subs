00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hello dear listeners with you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.889
 necrosis and today's podcast I dedicate 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.009
 one of the best carry themselves in dota and this 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.180
 Brie is a column that you did not 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.210
 boring to watch i added a video series and so 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.150
 stuck hero is very simple but at the same time 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.939
 strong and survives well in battle on 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 the later stages of the game he is inferior to the lady 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.800
 centuries like woad or antimag therefore 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.890
 they need to play aggressively and play 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.140
 finish early recently myself for him 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.870
 played and defeated the enemy board 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.540
 I had a good account for my support 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
 but the fact is that the enemy antimagic with 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.129
 battlefury mantra i'm nothing 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.370
 I could not oppose in the end 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.489
 lost but let's not talk about sad let's 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.309
 talk about his strengths 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.289
 main weapon needle characters the more often you 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.230
 use needles on the enemy 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.930
 the more damage you do and the needles 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.729
 can fly every three seconds 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.030
 so the damage will increase quickly 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.250
 further goes to your secret that is snot 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.479
 they slow down the enemy and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.490
 lower his armor 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.780
 and needles it just causes physical 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.390
 bristol survives damage 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 passive which reduces any damage to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.520
 back 40 percent 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 damage to the side also decreases but by 20 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.689
 percent 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.020
 moreover, when receiving 200 damage 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.030
 needles fly out automatically along the ridge 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 at the end of ulta 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.740
 similar to berserk rage when brie 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.990
 column use skills 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.060
 it increases attack power and speed 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.130
 running 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.619
 it follows that we have a tank with 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.829
 good damage and single target control 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.229
 they are easy to farm it can be collected in 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.689
 clean tank or damager i.e. 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.840
 differently depending on what you need 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.689
 your team as I told them easily 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.700
 play and not boring and not strong 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.399
 support you can kill the enemy already 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.649
 at the second level, these heroes can 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.569
 play aggressively sometimes indulge 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.209
 become impudent 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.340
 and on this podcast over everyone thanks 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.340
 for your attention and good games for you
