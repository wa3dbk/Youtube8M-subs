00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.090
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.980
 Welcome to x 5 x 1 is now ready and 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.420
 fernando del moral and I bring you a video 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.270
 about a security breach that has 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.309
 been in icloud related to pan my 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.619
 iphone and my ipad that is to say your 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.000
 device in 70s 4 versions 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.410
 previous according to see this video 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.880
 This morning here in Spain early in the morning 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.560
 Martian has uploaded it in his channel 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.010
 martian phone I will leave your video in the 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.590
 description 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.419
 and that is a video that came out yesterday 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.100
 agreement network came out a video in which 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.990
 a user explained the failure of 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.260
 security that logically according to 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.630
 published more than a few has already been 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.910
 advised to informed support to Paul of this 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.980
 failure that apparently no one 7.1 is going to be 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.309
 arranged since it has not been possible 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.620
 realize it in the goals good this video 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.970
 I'm going to do it more than anything 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.050
 informative because I think it's a 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.210
 video in which it's good that people 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.500
 is informed because although it is 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.870
 true that there will be a solution in the year 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.059
 7.1 There are going to be many people who still 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.860
 There are 704 or fall by the issue of 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.340
 jailbreak then those people will want 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.500
 avoid that to see the failure consists I'm going to 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.690
 explain is a problem of 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.900
 security that there is that allows a 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.440
 user that accesses the device if it goes 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.690
 to settings in icloud you can disable the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.360
 find my iphone tab simply 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.130
 doing a combination of commands 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.080
 something totally simple that is so 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.790
 easy as getting in the direction of 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.710
 that person's mail try to change 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.130
 the password give cancel then 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.990
 get into the password again 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.299
 where it says description that normally 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.950
 It is icloud, because you delete it there and 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.200
 automatically when giving what is there 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.060
 deactivates the tab find my 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.850
 iphone in that way the user who has 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.229
 picked up a phone because he could 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.890
 directly restore and I would not have 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.480
 no block 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.450
 in 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.770
 or that in theory in theory would be why 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.270
 in the end the case is that the person in that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.270
 case the person who tries 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.550
 and recover a phone logically not 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.410
 will be able to locate it on the map because 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.780
 this tab is disabled then 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.200
 it would be a handicap how we can avoid 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.440
 this good everyone you know that if we go 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.820
 in settings in general there is a tab 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.420
 under the automatic block that puts 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.100
 restrictions there we can 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.690
 activate some restrictions is a menu 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.330
 that we usually do not use 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.460
 because because really in our 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.610
 phone we only use it but 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.980
 maybe compensate if you are a user that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.810
 Get your phone out a lot because you work 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.610
 outside continuously in offices where 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.770
 many people go to your house or you have 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.960
 forgiven to office or go out to the street 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.970
 you take off the ipad or whatever maybe 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.500
 agree to have the blockade or 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.780
 restrictions at least when you leave 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.190
 how can you activate the restriction 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.020
 It's very easy, I say, you have to go to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.940
 general in the general 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.080
 but first you have to make adjustments in general 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.060
 and in general a menu there 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.770
 restrictions you have to add a 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.720
 code the code with which you're going to 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.690
 block those are you going to perform those 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.440
 restrictions and down everything near by 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.420
 the bottom there is a menu that 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.910
 put accounts I think if I'm not wrong what 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.490
 I'm going to look at restrictions settings 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.630
 if it says allow account changes you 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.090
 you have to select the option of 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.890
 accounts and you have to deactivate it from that 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.070
 form you when you go back to settings 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.570
 you'll see that in the icloud tabs of 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.510
 facetime messages 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.810
 you can not make any changes worth 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.349
 that's because I say 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.330
 to these restrictions and in that way the 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.989
 invader or the intruder because he could not 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.810
 do this method to disable to 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.220
 find my iphone and ipad what you have and 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.780
 this is what I wanted to do today in 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.310
 video format guys wanted to report 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.569
 about this failure is a country of safety 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.810
 which I repeat is going to be solved by 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.880
 apple in the betas of them and knitted 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.010
 is not already being fixed but about 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.099
 all seeing that a lot of audience of this 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.050
 channel is jailbreak audience because that 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.730
 people surely do not update me 7.1 to 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.019
 not for a failure that has 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.299
 had and had to be forced 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.180
 restore that you know the solution is worth 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:12.430
 well guys, I say goodbye, many 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.390
