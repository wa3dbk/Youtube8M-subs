00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.450
 citysense you 612 a tool too 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.429
 and I was pretty stupid and then I finished 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.340
 mate and played the start of this 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.539
 season and after a month I was free to 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.539
 to go 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.040
 I've been thinking about it for a few days and 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.890
 I then decided to put it around the hole 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.380
 to do and it requires one 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.609
 a very nice experience a challenge 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.609
 to play a South America 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.090
 I honestly knew very little 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.890
 panning the competition for the club 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.450
 and of the city ​​and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.410
 yes when i arrived here was actually 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.030
 so really a bit of a surprise because 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.230
 if you think a colombia then you think 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.600
 to tropical areas and beach and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.770
 and beautiful women that's me here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.510
 actually a bit against it 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.980
 I actually you have to be in the little ones 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.379
 you are right in the middle of the mountains 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.629
 nothing to do but to say that 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.550
 I am now well adjusted and that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.379
 the people are very friendly 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.289
 so in itself he gets very good to me 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.289
 sense here that happens more often 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.720
 the previous he still a bit of a picture 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.880
 forms of what it would be and you thought 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.250
 for you you can trace it in between 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.290
 the highest level for colombia is therefore 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.460
 I am going to train him well and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.920
 arise mentally surely also 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.580
 good but so I already have a little 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.380
 disappointed because actually a meadow 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.860
 is what were back cows and 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.160
 pearl 1:30 walk so light pairs flows 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.570
 and good little focused on the field and 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.220
 very bumpy 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.310
 rock hard not rained for a while 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.310
 has 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.140
 so it was my first feeling 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.459
 bit 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.680
 you actually leave as quickly as possible 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.530
 but in the end and I stayed and and 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.989
 now i'm used to it and has it like 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.990
 I have to say a charm 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.609
 andre we are we are getting of it 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.180
 they come 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.180
 so material 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.430
 hey 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:03:12.409
 now they are yellow, so here was the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:15.889
 contest in her eyes than at the toilets 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.889
 monkey even sees 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.140
 the quality of van 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.310
 of soccer in colombia always free 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.829
 hard to estimate from finally 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.019
 great wines and nice spray if you like 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.640
 a man who was playing it himself can 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.170
 you already have several 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.819
 comparative no so competition but me 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.450
 think in general comparing 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.829
 is with top jupiler league and below 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.069
 in the premier division 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:48.069
 who is you lying to 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.530
 often take the course from 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.330
 and here 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.330
 just up 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.880
 this is the stadium 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.080
 only yes what the other one is 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.940
 today the precise now fifteen minutes before 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.920
 the rest about a day should really be full 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.160
 and not quite enough then don't be 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.470
 so that's why it is for the muscles 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.480
 a pity it makes me sit with one 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.110
 a home video game 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.370
 we got 2000 mine during the round yes 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.050
 to gamble 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.390
 wash against top clubs that sit 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.660
 more man but it is because of the 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.370
 supporters of opponent 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.140
 keep them against national 40 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.390
 million address here then there are risks 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.350
 from national museums then 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:52.370
 sneakers us like me really going here 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.810
 watching our club and the city 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.570
 is the dough and instep for a special whole 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.420
 hard to turn around here 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.980
 find which way you make so much 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.370
 beautiful things with separate things 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.370
 very quick 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:12.320
 if here to spread column yes then you do 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.139
 but six years of good play and then 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.460
 you can easily repress with a nice portrait 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.139
 you or your own team you or in america 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.510
 sit or 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.040
 or in southern Europe because it is whole 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.889
 many the heads really really high 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.530
 Written in South America and also 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.050
 a south south europe so we are too 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.540
 just a lot of opportunity will from here 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.690
 to take a nice step and in addition 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.520
 just make it for you 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.990
 a very nice experience for your life 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.919
 experience a different culture one 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:47.540
 learn to speak another language and other 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.610
 meet people and so all in all 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.540
 on the one hand it is difficult but on the 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.400
 other side once you 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.090
 you run a guess i am then is 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.090
 it is a very nice experience
