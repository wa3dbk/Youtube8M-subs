 you can go proposing challenges 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.780
 we will start with the hair totally 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.600
 I have washed it clean in this case with the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.250
 oceanic shampoo of the dge then I'm going to 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.380
 apply a product to give volume to 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.590
 roots and one to hydrate means 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.590
 to tips 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.190
 to brush the hair because it is wet 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.750
 and it's very fragile and you can start like this 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.790
 that until it's dry I'm not going to 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.340
 brush I will dry it first with a 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.230
 dryer down to give volume and 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.480
 then I'll finish it up 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.550
 now is when we're going to brush it and what 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.550
 I'm going to brush upwards 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.650
 Apply some heat protector and 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.470
 we are ready to start curling 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.600
 the color cycler has two forms two 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.580
 sides as you see on one side is flat and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 on the other hand he has an entrance there is 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.990
 where do you have to put the hair 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.030
 ok in the flat area you always have to 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.030
 stay away from your head 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.810
 always use very small strands to 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.310
 make it easier to not apply 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.310
 the here to go fixing the curls 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.670
 has two directions of curl and that makes 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.980
 easier it is finished much more 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.019
 nice we can curl one side to the head 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.099
 to one side and the other side of the 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.099
 head to the other side 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.739
 when we have finished combing with the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.510
 fingers or with a wide comb I'll 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.730
 Apply some dry shampoo on the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.560
 roots to give volume and this would be 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.639
 our hairstyle number 1 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.639
 the loose waves 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.280
 the next hairstyle is very easy 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.140
 we started with the previous hairstyle and 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.820
 let's take the tie that you want and 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.890
 we are going to wear it behind the neck and 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.810
 we will raise it to the head I will take 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.020
 my bangs to make it look more beautiful 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.950
 make a simple loop turn it to the side 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.950
 and it is already 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.890
 this is the number 2 hairstyle the sweet 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.460
 for the third we are going to take one of the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.200
 sides and a front lock and we're going to 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.220
 start to twist them and as we go 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.020
 twisting we are adding more strands 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.970
 front until we reach the height 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.690
 from the ear we will hold it with a 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.690
 pineapple back 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.630
 and this is the option 3 lateral twist 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.670
 for the last option we are going to take 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.710
 all the hair to one side I'm going to 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.430
 leave two strands that will frame my 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.590
 face I create a low side ponytail and 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.270
 separate the hair in three strands the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.580
 first I'm going to twist it, I'm going to 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.890
 roll around the base of the 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.890
 pigtail and fasten them with a fork 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.320
 we will do the same with the rest of the 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.209
 pigtail and in the last hairpin I'm going to 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.980
 ensure that the bow is not loose 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.980
 but it stays fixed to the head 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.990
 and this is the last the fourth bun the 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.990
 romantic side 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.009
