why<00:02:30.220> are<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.370> doing<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.730> you<00:02:30.790> might<00:02:31.090> ask<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
why are you doing that you might ask the

why are you doing that you might ask the

about five six turns four less felt into
this<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.780> there's<00:02:40.989> no<00:02:41.079> more<00:02:41.319> fuel<00:02:41.620> until<00:02:41.920> you

conditions<00:03:04.480> improve<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.290> was<00:03:05.470> averaging

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
conditions improve and I was averaging

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.500 
conditions improve and I was averaging
about<00:03:06.010> 70<00:03:06.430> kilometres<00:03:06.639> per<00:03:06.970> hour<00:03:07.209> for<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
about 70 kilometres per hour for the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.009 
about 70 kilometres per hour for the
following<00:03:07.840> 35<00:03:08.409> kilometres<00:03:09.629> now<00:03:10.629> this<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.900> the

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
following 35 kilometres now this is the

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.140 
following 35 kilometres now this is the
dry<00:03:11.260> season<00:03:11.650> but<00:03:11.739> it's<00:03:11.889> very<00:03:12.040> easy<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.639> see<00:03:12.879> how

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
dry season but it's very easy to see how

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.179 
dry season but it's very easy to see how
conditions<00:03:13.720> could<00:03:13.930> deteriorate<00:03:14.319> if<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:15.069> was

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
conditions could deteriorate if it was

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.290 
conditions could deteriorate if it was
raining

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
raining

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.150 
raining
so<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.200> condition<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.830> road<00:03:19.010> is

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
so the condition of the road is

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.370 
so the condition of the road is
generally<00:03:19.730> pretty<00:03:19.970> good<00:03:20.150> although<00:03:20.960> there<00:03:21.260> are

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
generally pretty good although there are

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.200 
generally pretty good although there are
some<00:03:21.560> sections<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.160> Marja<00:03:22.520> need<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.820> be<00:03:22.940> aware

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
some sections of Marja need to be aware

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.559 
some sections of Marja need to be aware
of

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569

in the dry season only small sections of
the<00:03:54.750> road<00:03:54.960> are<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.410> bad<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:56.280> these<00:03:56.460> are<00:03:56.610> the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the road are this bad but these are the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.710 

I've<00:04:02.620> got<00:04:02.860> 58<00:04:03.280> kilometres<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.940> go<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.360> look

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
I've got 58 kilometres to go and look

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.339 
I've got 58 kilometres to go and look
what<00:04:05.050> I<00:04:05.110> can<00:04:05.170> see<00:04:05.470> ahead<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.680> me<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:10.349> that's

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
what I can see ahead of me that that's

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.630 
what I can see ahead of me that that's
definitely<00:04:11.560> tarmac<00:04:12.130> isn't<00:04:12.430> it

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640
