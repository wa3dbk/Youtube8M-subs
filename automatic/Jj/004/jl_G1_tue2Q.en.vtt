00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.980
 arrows like pro alexander peskova 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.180
 whether it was possible 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:42.990
 when you go to the biathlon race well 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:46.290

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.440
 special way not to call in 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.270
 say later with the words 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.130
