00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
down the stairs to show us the mob trap

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.960 
down the stairs to show us the mob trap
that<00:00:12.240> we've<00:00:12.389> built<00:00:12.570> over<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.930> last<00:00:13.139> day<00:00:13.380> or<00:00:13.410> so

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
that we've built over the last day or so

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.410 
that we've built over the last day or so
we<00:00:14.970> were<00:00:15.000> lucky<00:00:15.269> enough<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.990> find<00:00:16.490> to<00:00:17.490> mob

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
we were lucky enough to find to mob

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.750 
we were lucky enough to find to mob
spawner<00:00:19.080> right<00:00:19.500> next<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.800> each<00:00:19.890> other<00:00:20.040> which

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
spawner right next to each other which

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.279 
spawner right next to each other which
is<00:00:20.790> just<00:00:21.090> down<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.480> right<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:21.900> yeah<00:00:22.890> only

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
is just down to the right here yeah only

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.510 
is just down to the right here yeah only
if<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> look<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:25.830> room<00:00:26.100> we've<00:00:26.310> got

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
if we have a look in this room we've got

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.660 
if we have a look in this room we've got
a<00:00:27.060> skeleton<00:00:27.810> spawner<00:00:28.080> which<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.250> can't<00:00:29.490> see

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
a skeleton spawner which we can't see

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.890 
a skeleton spawner which we can't see
any<00:00:29.789> skeletons<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.660> stage

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
any skeletons in there at this stage

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.170 
any skeletons in there at this stage
they'll<00:00:31.260> spawn<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.740> second<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> over<00:00:33.000> this

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
they'll spawn in a second and over this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.820 
they'll spawn in a second and over this
side<00:00:33.449> we've<00:00:33.629> got<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> zombie<00:00:34.140> spawner<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.710> we've

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
side we've got a zombie spawner so we've

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.619 
side we've got a zombie spawner so we've
got<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.220> spawn<00:00:35.519> us<00:00:35.670> right<00:00:36.059> next<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> each<00:00:36.449> other

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
got to spawn us right next to each other

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.650 
got to spawn us right next to each other
I<00:00:36.900> have<00:00:37.769> never<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.160> seen<00:00:38.520> spoilers<00:00:39.510> like

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
I have never actually seen spoilers like

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.240 
I have never actually seen spoilers like
that<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.989> close<00:00:40.230> together<00:00:40.440> before<00:00:40.920> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that that close together before so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790 
that that close together before so
extremely<00:00:42.149> lucky<00:00:42.420> because<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.440> means<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.710> we

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
extremely lucky because it means that we

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.520 
extremely lucky because it means that we
get<00:00:44.070> double<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.820> mobs<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.870> our<00:00:45.960> money<00:00:46.170> for

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
get double the mobs for our money for

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
get double the mobs for our money for
the<00:00:46.620> mob<00:00:46.890> trap<00:00:47.130> there's<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.180> skeleton<00:00:48.390> that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the mob trap there's a skeleton that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.260 
the mob trap there's a skeleton that
spawned<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.059> what<00:00:51.059> they're

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
spawned in there now and what they're

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.660 
spawned in there now and what they're
supposed<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.890> basically<00:00:53.250> fall

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
supposed to do is they basically fall

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.549 
supposed to do is they basically fall
into<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> water<00:00:54.000> courses<00:00:54.540> inside<00:00:55.320> those

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
into the water courses inside those

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.290 
into the water courses inside those
rooms<00:00:56.149> get<00:00:57.149> swept<00:00:57.539> along<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.309> into<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.670> mob

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
rooms get swept along and into this mob

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
rooms get swept along and into this mob
elevator<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.980> there's<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
elevator and you can see there's a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.430 
elevator and you can see there's a
zombie<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.960> I'll<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.259> wait<00:01:04.410> for

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
zombie going up there I'll just wait for

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.139 
zombie going up there I'll just wait for
a<00:01:04.619> skeleton<00:01:05.039> to<00:01:05.160> come<00:01:05.369> through<00:01:05.610> hopefully

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
a skeleton to come through hopefully

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.469 
a skeleton to come through hopefully
want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> come<00:01:06.570> through<00:01:06.750> fairly<00:01:06.990> soon<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:09.270> mob

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
want to come through fairly soon the mob

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.419 
want to come through fairly soon the mob
traps<00:01:09.780> here<00:01:10.050> are<00:01:10.200> actually<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.830> seven

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
traps here are actually like seven

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.469 
traps here are actually like seven
blocks<00:01:12.330> apart<00:01:12.539> actually<00:01:13.700> cover<00:01:14.700> between<00:01:15.179> each

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
blocks apart actually cover between each

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.340 
blocks apart actually cover between each
other<00:01:15.660> yeah<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> account<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.399> earlier

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
other yeah I account to them earlier

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.910 
other yeah I account to them earlier
seven<00:01:19.350> eight<00:01:19.530> ish<00:01:19.800> ok<00:01:21.319> anyway<00:01:22.319> there's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> 50

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
seven eight ish ok anyway there's a 50

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.350 
seven eight ish ok anyway there's a 50
of<00:01:22.979> skeletons<00:01:23.399> they're<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:23.819> walking

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of skeletons they're just not walking

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.940 
of skeletons they're just not walking
into<00:01:24.599> the<00:01:24.810> water<00:01:25.020> at<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.289> stage<00:01:25.560> they<00:01:25.770> will

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
into the water at this stage they will

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.410 
into the water at this stage they will
soon<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.550> then<00:01:26.759> they'll<00:01:26.910> all<00:01:27.030> sort<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.300> go

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
soon and then they'll all sort of go

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.930 
soon and then they'll all sort of go
here<00:01:27.660> we<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.899> come<00:01:28.709> on<00:01:28.830> move<00:01:29.099> across<00:01:29.369> stop

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
here we go come on move across stop

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.540 
here we go come on move across stop
looking<00:01:30.179> at<00:01:30.240> me

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.220 

now<00:01:34.120> doesn't<00:01:34.660> want<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.840> go<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.080> water

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
now doesn't want to go in the water

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.790 
now doesn't want to go in the water
there's<00:01:35.830> lots<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.610> zombies<00:01:36.730> coming<00:01:37.150> through

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
there's lots of zombies coming through

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.590 
there's lots of zombies coming through
they<00:01:38.800> will<00:01:38.950> eventually<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.730> basically<00:01:40.450> the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
they will eventually and basically the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.230 
they will eventually and basically the
idea<00:01:40.660> behind<00:01:41.170> this<00:01:41.440> one<00:01:41.650> is<00:01:41.800> mobs<00:01:42.670> will<00:01:42.910> spawn

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
idea behind this one is mobs will spawn

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.330 
idea behind this one is mobs will spawn
if<00:01:43.600> you're<00:01:43.840> within<00:01:44.020> 15<00:01:44.530> blocks<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:45.010> them<00:01:45.160> and

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
if you're within 15 blocks of them and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.790 
if you're within 15 blocks of them and
they'll<00:01:46.030> stop<00:01:46.330> spawning<00:01:46.660> if<00:01:46.990> there's<00:01:47.530> the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
they'll stop spawning if there's the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.980 
they'll stop spawning if there's the
same<00:01:48.040> sort<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.370> mob<00:01:48.580> within<00:01:48.970> eight<00:01:49.240> blocks<00:01:49.480> so

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
same sort of mob within eight blocks so

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.230 
same sort of mob within eight blocks so
we<00:01:50.110> have<00:01:50.230> to<00:01:50.380> get<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.680> actual<00:01:50.950> mob<00:01:51.280> trap<00:01:51.580> more

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
we have to get the actual mob trap more

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.380 
we have to get the actual mob trap more
than<00:01:52.360> eight<00:01:52.480> blocks<00:01:52.720> away<00:01:53.050> but<00:01:53.380> less<00:01:53.560> than<00:01:53.590> 15

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
than eight blocks away but less than 15

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.990 
than eight blocks away but less than 15
so<00:01:55.390> anyway<00:01:55.870> up<00:01:56.110> they<00:01:56.290> go<00:01:56.470> up<00:01:56.890> there<00:01:57.520> we<00:01:57.610> go<00:01:57.760> now

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
so anyway up they go up there we go now

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000 
so anyway up they go up there we go now
we're<00:01:58.120> getting<00:01:58.300> skeletons<00:01:58.720> going<00:01:59.020> up<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.380> up

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
we're getting skeletons going up the up

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.870

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
they get drawn up 23 blocks to this

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.610 
they get drawn up 23 blocks to this
water<00:02:10.390> course<00:02:10.750> that<00:02:10.990> we've<00:02:11.080> got<00:02:11.290> running<00:02:11.500> up

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
water course that we've got running up

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.260 
water course that we've got running up
here<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.200> come<00:02:14.350> up<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.090> that

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
here and so come up here this is that

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.520 
here and so come up here this is that
this<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.690> top<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.020> elevator<00:02:17.110> here

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
this is the top of the elevator here

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.170 
this is the top of the elevator here
come<00:02:17.680> here<00:02:17.980> come<00:02:18.040> now<00:02:18.160> skeletons<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:19.000> saw

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
come here come now skeletons that we saw

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.570 
come here come now skeletons that we saw
before<00:02:19.770> they've<00:02:20.770> basically<00:02:20.920> arrived<00:02:21.370> at<00:02:21.520> the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
before they've basically arrived at the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.210 
before they've basically arrived at the
top<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:23.470> pushed<00:02:23.740> along<00:02:23.890> this

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
top and then get pushed along this

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.780 
top and then get pushed along this
channel<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.410> from<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.220> elevator<00:02:27.550> they<00:02:27.670> get

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
channel so from the elevator they get

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.970 
channel so from the elevator they get
pushed<00:02:28.000> along<00:02:30.900> until<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.990> get<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.170> this<00:02:32.350> area

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
pushed along until I get to this area

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.750 
pushed along until I get to this area
here<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.460> fall<00:02:34.090> down<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.750> 23<00:02:35.200> blocks<00:02:35.350> again

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
here and fall down the 23 blocks again

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.610 
here and fall down the 23 blocks again
which<00:02:36.760> leaves<00:02:37.150> them<00:02:37.360> with<00:02:37.620> theoretically

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
which leaves them with theoretically

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.660 
which leaves them with theoretically
half<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.160> heart<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:40.050> life<00:02:41.050> left<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:42.310> we'll<00:02:42.459> run

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
half a heart of life left so we'll run

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.660 
half a heart of life left so we'll run
back<00:02:42.880> downstairs<00:02:43.270> again<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.770> we'll<00:02:45.550> watch

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
back downstairs again and we'll watch

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.570 
back downstairs again and we'll watch

YouTube video i'll put the link in if i
can<00:05:21.169> find<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:22.539> but<00:05:23.539> it's<00:05:23.690> really<00:05:23.810> quite

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
can find it but it's really quite

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.210 
can find it but it's really quite
effective<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.530> actually<00:05:24.740> having<00:05:24.830> those<00:05:24.979> two

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
effective and actually having those two

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.210 
effective and actually having those two
mob<00:05:25.370> traps<00:05:25.669> together<00:05:26.000> really<00:05:26.780> make<00:05:27.050> it<00:05:27.229> very

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
mob traps together really make it very

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.570 
mob traps together really make it very
very<00:05:28.490> good<00:05:28.789> I<00:05:29.740> haven't<00:05:30.740> timed<00:05:31.009> it<00:05:31.160> to<00:05:31.250> see<00:05:31.430> how

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
very good I haven't timed it to see how

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.040 
very good I haven't timed it to see how
much<00:05:31.729> experience<00:05:31.849> you<00:05:32.270> get<00:05:32.479> you<00:05:32.720> know<00:05:32.840> per

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
much experience you get you know per

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.710 
much experience you get you know per
minute<00:05:33.380> or<00:05:33.440> etc<00:05:33.860> but<00:05:34.160> you<00:05:34.669> do<00:05:35.300> level<00:05:35.599> up

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
minute or etc but you do level up

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.480 
minute or etc but you do level up
reasonably<00:05:36.319> quickly<00:05:36.590> I<00:05:36.889> mean<00:05:37.130> it's<00:05:37.220> as<00:05:37.310> fast

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
reasonably quickly I mean it's as fast

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.980 
reasonably quickly I mean it's as fast
as<00:05:37.729> the<00:05:37.819> mob<00:05:37.970> traps<00:05:38.240> themselves<00:05:38.780> actually

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
as the mob traps themselves actually

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.480 
as the mob traps themselves actually
spawn<00:05:39.409> I<00:05:39.650> think<00:05:39.979> we<00:05:40.069> probably<00:05:40.190> should

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
spawn I think we probably should

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.200 
spawn I think we probably should
optimize<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:42.099> the<00:05:43.099> actual<00:05:43.250> trap<00:05:43.639> area<00:05:43.909> itself

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
optimize the the actual trap area itself

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.610 
optimize the the actual trap area itself
a<00:05:44.300> little<00:05:44.479> bit<00:05:44.569> more<00:05:44.780> with<00:05:44.960> deeper<00:05:45.259> water<00:05:45.470> etc

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
a little bit more with deeper water etc

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.510 
a little bit more with deeper water etc
we'll<00:05:46.490> get<00:05:46.639> to<00:05:46.759> that<00:05:46.789> one<00:05:47.030> day<00:05:47.210> I<00:05:47.240> guess<00:05:48.520> anyway

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
we'll get to that one day I guess anyway

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.099 
we'll get to that one day I guess anyway
that's<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.150> so<00:05:50.960> this<00:05:51.319> is<00:05:51.349> our<00:05:51.680> mob<00:05:51.889> trap
