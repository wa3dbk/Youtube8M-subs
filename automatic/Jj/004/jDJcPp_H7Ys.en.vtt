improving your speed and coordination
picking<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.030> notice<00:00:33.300> at<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
picking and I think we notice at the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.470 
picking and I think we notice at the
same<00:00:33.660> time<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:35.100> first<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.790> start<00:00:36.090> off<00:00:36.180> with

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
same time so first of all start off with

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.549 
same time so first of all start off with
a<00:00:37.070> temporal<00:00:38.070> tremor<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.989> metronome<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
a temporal tremor on the metronome that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.660 
a temporal tremor on the metronome that
you're<00:00:40.680> comfortable<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:43.460> just<00:00:44.460> as<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you're comfortable with just as a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:01:02.660 
you're comfortable with just as a
warm-up

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.219 

okay<00:01:03.670> now<00:01:03.850> notice<00:01:04.119> my<00:01:04.390> picking<00:01:04.839> hand

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
okay now notice my picking hand

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.719 
okay now notice my picking hand
it's<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.680> wrist<00:01:05.950> which<00:01:06.189> is<00:01:06.310> doing<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.549> work

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
it's the wrist which is doing the work

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.810 
it's the wrist which is doing the work
not<00:01:07.000> my<00:01:07.180> thumb<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.810> not<00:01:08.409> me<00:01:08.590> elbow<00:01:08.950> okay<00:01:09.759> so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
not my thumb and not me elbow okay so

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.899 
not my thumb and not me elbow okay so
make<00:01:10.090> sure<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.360> picking<00:01:10.810> from<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.080> list<00:01:11.909> okay

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
make sure the picking from the list okay

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.910 
make sure the picking from the list okay
so<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.659> player<00:01:14.140> pattern<00:01:14.500> that<00:01:14.649> I'll<00:01:14.799> break

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
so on a player pattern that I'll break

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:36.330 
so on a player pattern that I'll break
it

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.590 

now<00:01:37.340> all<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.700> do<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:37.970> I<00:01:38.120> want<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.300> increase<00:01:38.510> the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
now all I do is I want to increase the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.960 
now all I do is I want to increase the
time<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.800> pay<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.040> double<00:01:40.280> speed<00:01:40.670> so

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
time that I pay the double speed so

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.500 
time that I pay the double speed so
example<00:01:41.480> the<00:01:41.600> first<00:01:42.200> pattern<00:01:42.560> was<00:01:45.100> name<00:01:46.510> one

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
example the first pattern was name one

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.280 
example the first pattern was name one
lot<00:01:47.750> in<00:01:48.430> quavers<00:01:49.430> one<00:01:50.180> lot<00:01:50.360> in<00:01:50.480> semiquavers

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.920 

now<00:01:54.290> I'm<00:01:54.410> gonna<00:01:54.500> play<00:01:55.030> one<00:01:56.030> lot<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.420> quavers

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
now I'm gonna play one lot in quavers

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:08.420 
now I'm gonna play one lot in quavers
two<00:01:57.350> losses

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.740 

then<00:02:09.430> you<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:09.789> increase<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.330> amount<00:02:10.570> that

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
then you just increase the amount that

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:30.870 
then you just increase the amount that
you're<00:02:10.869> doing<00:02:11.020> on<00:02:11.260> semiquavers<00:02:11.890> so

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:40.570 

moon

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:50.130 

Ang's<00:02:41.580> made<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.970> for

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.230 

Oh

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.010 

then<00:02:58.240> all<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.450> do<00:02:58.800> get<00:02:59.800> your<00:02:59.890> metronome<00:03:04.020> if

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
then all you do get your metronome if

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.530 
then all you do get your metronome if
you<00:03:05.170> using<00:03:05.290> one<00:03:05.560> like<00:03:05.710> this<00:03:06.210> obviously<00:03:07.210> you

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
you using one like this obviously you

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.110 
you using one like this obviously you
would<00:03:07.660> use<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.920> bar<00:03:09.130> if<00:03:09.430> using<00:03:09.670> an<00:03:09.760> electronic

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
would use the bar if using an electronic

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.680 
would use the bar if using an electronic
one<00:03:10.240> easy<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.540> program<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.990> and<00:03:11.380> just<00:03:11.560> move<00:03:11.740> it

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
one easy to program it and just move it

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.870 
one easy to program it and just move it
two<00:03:13.690> clicks<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.370> increasing<00:03:15.820> the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
two clicks so that you increasing the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:24.630 
two clicks so that you increasing the
speed<00:03:16.090> slightly<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:24.130> then<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.370> pair<00:03:24.520> the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
speed slightly and then you pair the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.270 
speed slightly and then you pair the
same<00:03:24.820> pattern<00:03:25.120> again<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.960> start<00:03:26.290> off<00:03:26.440> with<00:03:27.070> one

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
same pattern again so start off with one

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:44.040 
same pattern again so start off with one
lot<00:03:27.520> of<00:03:27.900> semi-famous

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.630 

then<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:44.530> move<00:03:44.680> up<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:44.860> two<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.400> can<00:03:45.490> come

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
then you move up to two you can come

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.930 
then you move up to two you can come
back<00:03:45.760> as<00:03:45.940> well

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:07.450 

Oh

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.060 

guess<00:04:07.880> what<00:04:08.030> we<00:04:08.090> do<00:04:08.240> now

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.370 

move<00:04:13.100> we<00:04:13.640> metronome<00:04:14.240> up<00:04:14.390> two<00:04:14.750> clicks<00:04:17.320> by<00:04:18.320> the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
move we metronome up two clicks by the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.990 
move we metronome up two clicks by the
way<00:04:18.500> this<00:04:18.650> is<00:04:18.799> just<00:04:18.920> an<00:04:19.100> example<00:04:19.190> or<00:04:19.730> another<00:04:19.760> I

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
way this is just an example or another I

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.310 
way this is just an example or another I
want<00:04:20.150> you<00:04:20.269> just<00:04:20.330> to<00:04:20.510> play<00:04:20.690> this<00:04:20.900> pattern<00:04:21.110> you

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
want you just to play this pattern you

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.580 
want you just to play this pattern you
can<00:04:21.440> play<00:04:21.560> any<00:04:21.769> pattern<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.100> like<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:22.670> a<00:04:22.700> scale

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
can play any pattern you like so a scale

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.450 
can play any pattern you like so a scale
let's<00:04:24.590> see<00:04:24.650> how<00:04:24.770> would<00:04:24.920> work<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.280> major

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
let's see how would work on a major

00:04:25.460 --> 00:05:02.180 
let's see how would work on a major
scale

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:20.420 

there<00:05:03.190> you've<00:05:03.340> got<00:05:03.550> two<00:05:03.730> astronomy

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430
