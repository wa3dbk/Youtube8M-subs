all I'm saying is the longer we sit here
the<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.539> time<00:00:55.050> they<00:00:55.260> have<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.620> shore<00:00:55.890> up

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the more time they have the shore up

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
the more time they have the shore up
their<00:00:56.190> defenses<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:57.300> should<00:00:57.449> hit<00:00:57.600> them<00:00:57.719> sooner

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
their defenses we should hit them sooner

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.529

rather than later

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.450 
rather than later
we<00:01:00.539> barely<00:01:00.870> had<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.230> manpower<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.010> keep<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
we barely had the manpower to keep the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.939 
we barely had the manpower to keep the
Citadel<00:01:02.940> fortified<00:01:03.570> we've<00:01:04.199> been<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
Citadel fortified we've been over this

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.570 
Citadel fortified we've been over this
before<00:01:05.129> seven<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:08.009> wait<00:01:08.220> until<00:01:08.250> they

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
before seven so we just wait until they

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
before seven so we just wait until they
decide<00:01:08.940> we're<00:01:09.119> next<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.630> list

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
decide we're next on the list

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
decide we're next on the list
if<00:01:10.259> the<00:01:10.770> pride<00:01:10.979> goes<00:01:11.190> in<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.820> might<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
if the pride goes in now we might have a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.740 
if the pride goes in now we might have a
chance<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:13.649> if<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.009> fail<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
chance and if you fail then what the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
chance and if you fail then what the
risk<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.259> worth<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> reward

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
risk is not worth the reward

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.230 
risk is not worth the reward
I<00:01:18.049> agree<00:01:19.320> without<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.070> ghek<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.280> purifier<00:01:21.030> is

I agree without the ghek the purifier is

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.630 
I agree without the ghek the purifier is
useless<00:01:21.690> to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> Enclave<00:01:22.289> anyway<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:23.460> may

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
useless to the Enclave anyway they may

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.719 
useless to the Enclave anyway they may

have<00:02:14.010> had<00:02:14.160> time<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.430> analyze<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:15.590> perhaps<00:02:16.590> we

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
have had time to analyze it perhaps we

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.990 
have had time to analyze it perhaps we
have<00:02:17.220> underestimated<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.450> Enclave<00:02:20.000> Salome

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
have underestimated the Enclave Salome

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
be right an attack may be necessary now

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.620 
be right an attack may be necessary now
if<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.220> Enclave<00:02:26.610> has<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.970> ghek<00:02:27.150> there's

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
if the Enclave has the ghek there's

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.330 
if the Enclave has the ghek there's
nothing<00:02:28.080> stopping<00:02:28.380> them<00:02:28.560> from<00:02:28.830> starting<00:02:29.220> the
