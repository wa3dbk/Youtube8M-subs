 hello dear youtube community here is on 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.510
 as the shame on cover tv with 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.730
 instrument presentations part 10 2 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.070
 flop flutes 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.660
 you can cheerfully recite quite well 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 use two soprano or two nino 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.130
 that's what many think it is 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.500
 musically a bit boring 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.800
 so I have here a soprano one 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 so carlino that was in about tab 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
 are voted for two flights 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.070
 to sound it at the same time 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.620
 relatively easy I'll take a lead 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.910
 in the hand and plays it to the second 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.250
 flute namely in the hand and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.110
 Actually, that's it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.410
 now you could both at the same time 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.410
 play 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.870
 Now you have noticed when I am with 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.080
 both played at the same time 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.510
 I also move my hands with it 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.640
 we have a quad parallel the 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.800
 allegedly medieval was very popular 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.690
 now it is so that, of course 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.900
 no two-part harmony in classical 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.369
 But it is not the same 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.390
 hell just needs hell 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.390
 move differently 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.900
 yes that was it again two 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.840
 Flutes at the same time if you ask too 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.860
 this subject then likes to have in the bottom 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.350
 comments on the flutes so the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.660
 I buy the soprano flute in the normal way 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.560
 toys were loading there is here 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.380
 best 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.790
 the sopranino does not get that i have 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.190
 from the music business you have the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.140
 cheapest wooden model taken with 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.870
 German handle wise both find one 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.790
 German handle wise this would be ennstal 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.010
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.180
 if you made more suggestions have 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.590

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.580
