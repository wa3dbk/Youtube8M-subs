00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.580
 or the one that the friends of youtube I am 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.830
 freedom to this time I'm going to 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.109
 teach or I'll give you some tips 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.240
 how to have details with your partner without 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.799
 have to spend so much good money 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.080
 I personally think that I do not know 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.320
 you need a lot of money to 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.560
 tell him how much you love him or 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.300
 she how much you love her I feel she is 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.369
 question of creativity of each 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.429
 currently the world is going through 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.250
 a very complex economic situation 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:33.100
 but I think you can have with your 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.770
 couple certain details that do not cost 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.500
 a lot and they mean pretty clear with the 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.539
 purpose of maintaining the day relationship 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.059
 with a fresh day what does not fall on the 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.850
 monotony but you can give it a 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.219
 little bit of humor and insight to 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.340
 the relationship basically what we're going to 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.160
 to do is to tell our partner I love you 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.120
 I miss you I do not forget you're in my 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.269
 mind 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.780
 you are my everything but in a practical way 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.000
 simple economic and later I will give 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.040
 tips and a little more complex or more 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.650
 made for your partner 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.420
 but for the moment I will give these that I think 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.280
 that come in handy for people 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.920
 who are young or for students 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.600
 the first tip that I can give you is that 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.980
 simply and simply go out to 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.620
 walk together 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.280
 in this way they can share time 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:28.160
 you can exercise if there are 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.190
 near a small flower, the gift is 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.550
 take it by the hand or take the hand 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.360
 if they sell traditional sweets 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.970
 purchase of some 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.130
 dedicate a little bit of time to your 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.800
 couple the second guy that I can give you 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.640
 is that you write secret messages this 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.060
 I love buying a block of post-its 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.520
 and you start to write 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 nice notes or messages drawings what 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.370
 you want and you're going to hide them in all 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.620
 You can put parts for example if 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.080
 you are at school you can put one to 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.660
 hidden in your backpack so that when 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.670
 get home and take out the supplies 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.530
 Schoolchildren can see your message 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.170
 If you are already married you can put the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.720
 post-it or the messages in those in the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.390
 bags of pants and the day you 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.160
 girl is going to wash clothes while checking 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.810
 in the bags of the pants I 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.780
 you will find the messages that are for 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.370
 she if your guy smokes for example 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.590
 You can also put it in the pack 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.840
 some nice message you can finally 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.290
 put them everywhere there are people 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.330
 that they even do 100 or 200 post-it with 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.760
 little gifts of love and stick them in 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.799
 cars of their boyfriends or their girlfriends or 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.180
 in the room here basically what 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.240
 let's do is take advantage of the factor 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.850
 Sun 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.850
 that the person does not know and is not expected 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.790
 that you're going to put a little bit of 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.440
 love comes the third type advice that you 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.200
 I can give is that you serious and some 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.930
 romantic message of love or jim to what 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.420
 you want 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.569
 and it can be on a compact disc can 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.819
 be in the recorder cell and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.500
 even by youtube you can make a 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.129
 declaration of love and very 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.129
 romantic 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.140
 adri if you are looking at this message 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.910
 I want to tell you that I love you that you are a 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.300
 wonderful person and I send you a kiss 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.670
 huge and things like that this is 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.980
 practical is romantic and I assure you that a 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.410
 your girl will like a statement 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.970
 of public love who does not like the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.580
 fourth piece of advice that I can give you is that 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.180
 it seems something rich to eat makes a 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.310
 week my adriana asked me to 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.260
 prepare chocolate truffles those of 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.840
 do in fact I learned them to do here 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.330
 on youtube and if we buy the 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.790
 ingredients and I prepared a rich truffle 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.310
 The truth is that he is a good father when 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.770
 You can export you helpful with the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.080
 person that you love to apapacharla 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.770
 consent to always tell you hey ya 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.840
 you ate and I prepare something for you 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.180
 just make him a lemon juice 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.610
 when you want the person charged 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.160
 special sense then that's another 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.930
 advice that I can give you to prepare 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.550
 It is something delicious to eat if you do not plan 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.490
 gives you the kitchen for nothing 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.760
 money these days and you can buy 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:20.700
 a rich dinner and pamper that person 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.060
 for a day another advice that I can give you 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.190
 is that they get a tent and 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.410
 that they set up a camp in the garden 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.170
 the house can tell stories of 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.500
 terror can even put a radius of 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:38.600
 batteries and listen to some music and 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.210
 buy sweets in short is terrific and 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.460
 Become a child to love one 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.230
 woman or a man another advice that you 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.210
 I can give is that they rob the person 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.880
 just like I 'm telling you, steal 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.610
 you steal it cloth one day you get like this without 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.540
 tell your school or your work what 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.090
 you get out of there and they run away together where 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.110
 where you you want to where the road 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.000
 I carried 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.810
 just lose if that 's totally 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.570
 Romantic may suddenly be going to 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.930
 another city for a day and they're going to 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.250
 walk together for a walk, they go to eat and 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.270
 do not kidnap what you forget about 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.130
 world 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.770
 Another advice that I can give you is that you 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.370
 make a blanket to dream he made me one and 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.070
 he was very father you go to a store and you ask 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.550
 to sell you certain meters of cloth and 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.340
 on that fabric you're going to paint or you're going to 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.920
 write something beautiful for that person 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.530
 you can even draw pink hearts 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.320
 figures what you want is more you 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.120
 you can ask for help from your friends and between 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.490
 everyone does something very beautiful and 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.980
 later you will hang it on your 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.720
 home or near your home you must 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.080
 put where many people can see it 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.420
 and usually the lovers usually 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.910
 put them in the main avenues that 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.730
 connect to the house of the boy or the girl 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.410
 in question well there are a lot of 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.810
 details that you can have with your partner 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.570
 it's just a matter of being creative 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.510
 if they are already married for example one day 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.580
 Take your partner and tell them you know that this 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.380
 day do not do anything this day I'm going to 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.260
 do everything I'll let you go I'll 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.440
 pass if you arrive tired or tired of 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.540
 I work because you do not put some candles on me 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.570
 in the room and you give him one more 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.100
 rich with oil to relax for 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.070
 that he forgot a little bit of so many 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.530
 pressures and also for example in a 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.620
 cold winter night while they are 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.380
 watching TV and embrace the tender mind 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.700
 you look her in the eye and give her a little 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.170
 kiss if you are in bed for example and 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:49.230
 embrace it in such a way that your body 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.820
 look for each part of her body that 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.410
 hug that you know well that is 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.050
 sensual and that can remove any 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.990
 cold and most importantly treat it 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.520

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.250
