00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.499
 Another topic that did not exist was education 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.570
 34 percent of a vintage study 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.699
 This puts Germany in seventh place on the fourth-last place 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.439
 So Germany really does not have too many students and that's why 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.379
 Listening inflationary in every bar talk of better educational opportunities 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.710
 Minister Schavan, for example, claims that neither high 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.599
 Tuition still poor parents Applied to Riehen then put off 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.990
 have to go to university next to Bafög and scholarships there are indeed loans extra 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.900
 for students 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.560
 Kanzian's evil trap will be wrong Lutz Polanski Marcus Zeitler 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.220
 In the first part of my life, I sensed that I really wanted that one 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.220
 come to his family have no money 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.710
 that his club was aware of him because I always thought that you were the same 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.060
 Has opportunities 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.350
 We should no longer have their real name 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.340
 she's calling us July 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.330
 After graduating from college and then a decent job that was her plan 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.570
 Some semesters got Juliane Bafög but that was not enough so she grabbed her 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 to bank loans which are not available for students old loans 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.310
 needed because he 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.370
 No, my parents could not help you financially 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.300
 and who did not already work from the first day of school anyway 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.950
 pretty much worked 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.980
 which in turn has led her to study his four so long 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.060
 works then unfortunately you can not prove the courses you actually occupy 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.300
 I would like to take a look then on which day of the week I have to be free 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.060
 can study 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.060
 and we have moreover we can still have the tuition 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.979
 Hundreds of thousands of students know that 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.820
 no rich parents tuition too little Bafög hardly time to work 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.070
 for the Federal Education Minister no problem her proposal 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410
 something international 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.580
 cheap is 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.200
 is the one in their systems belongs to credit and this includes the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.729
 Question of student loans we are currently experiencing this 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.060
 individual parties in their political program 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.430
 the very strong demand a conversion of the financing system that is 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.770
 Away from the state welfare-organized grant Bafög added 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.769
 loan 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.099
 And that does not make you aware of that, of course, exactly 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.019
 these young people we actually need as an academic one 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.760
 Debt situation where they possibly no longer drive 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.439
 gainful employment 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.800
 The high costs are already there 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.320
 Children from low-income families from studying as reasons for 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.000
 the study waiver during every fourth to fifth tuition 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.529
 missing financial conditions and 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.039
 Juliane did not let herself be deterred and still studying the problem 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:46.370
 despite graduating, she has been looking for a permanent job many for over a year 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.949
 However, loan agreements require that the repayment be no later than one year after 

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:55.349
 End of the study Ude but after payment of the last credit, it does not matter if 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.969
 You may or may not be July Arne's biggest problem now is her 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.039
 Student loan from the German bank 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.999
 No hours were not possible 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:09.169
 And, of course, not one single day at all did not present ne sais as 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.349
 First of all, the Staudernheimer must 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.879
 to despair right after that because I thought we did not have to kill him 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.209
 our roads are still in use 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.250
 No employment at all The German bank only answers us in writing 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.970
 In principle, there is no deferral in the credit agreements 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.369
 intended 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:29.310
 However, case-related solutions could be agreed otherwise 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.310
 Train individual customer connections do not speak out 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.709
 The student loans are not deferred is not the only risk 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.019
 Many banks do not agree on fixed but variable interest rates so can 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.489
 from five com at 9 fast times 8 Kommern 9% become 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.189
 Student loans are also available here at the state-controlled Kreditanstalt 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.979
 for reconstruction KfW 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.079
 Students should be able to taste the kfw credits because here are more accommodating 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.669
 is deferred as with most private banks but also the KfW works 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.509
 with variable interest rates the interest rate ceiling of the state bank is even at nine 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.249
 Come on a spots are 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.979
 One can not include creditworthy all banks student loan course 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.669
 a debt ratio 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:19.400
 The loan has variable interest rates which has the disadvantage that you can still start 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.770
 can not even calculate how high at the end in the 2 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.819
 that the repayment will be there is an upper limit, moreover, with 19 1 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.789
 Percent gigantic 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.370
 just with the student loan of a state bank in one 

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:34.229
 calculable debt 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.629
 We have asked the Federal Ministry of Education for an interview 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:38.919
 vain 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.669
 how many students have so far been indebted with student loans 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.999
 But nobody but monitor are now the first time KfW internal data and 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:52.599
 Alone there have been 10,000 students since its launch three years ago 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.499
 signed monthly loan amount 476 euros on average the 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.259
 Most borrowers are freshmen 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.990
 No students the big embrace from the first day of their study 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.310
 To finance a livelihood with loans they finance a big one 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.780
 Sven's debt got the credit Brunner insisted that after graduation 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.919
 Even a job right now has a job and can pay back 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.840
 If you can not do that you can bypass irrevocable debt 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.639
 During the last weeks I talked with some consultants nationwide 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.270
 who have confirmed to me that I myself can of two typical examples 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.460
 In my case, he was a student with 20 cans of Euro per cent 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.500
 Students dt 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.860
 which has become the Che market and now 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.860
 The band should repay animals every month, which they can not 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.249
 totally desperate in the other case a student has 50 000 euros 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.430
 because not at all how it should continue 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.710
 and how is Juliane going? 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.969
 in the debt advice of the city have three days ago 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.210
 I can only miss one 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.050
 to go in the direction of insolvency proceedings 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.379
 a dream goal 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.379
 Personal bankruptcy 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.419
 because he has no chance on an out of court settlement no offer 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.089
 can do 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.089
 completed a degree 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.919
 Well completed according to languages ​​is a club of the fair Rhineland 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.330
 Vedder had informed his parents
