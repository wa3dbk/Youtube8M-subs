00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
women the first thing I think of when I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.330 
women the first thing I think of when I
look<00:00:27.869> at<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.230> thing<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> Cadillac

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
look at this thing is a Cadillac

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.380 
look at this thing is a Cadillac
Escalade<00:00:29.930> but<00:00:30.930> it<00:00:31.020> doesn't<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.279> lot<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
Escalade but it doesn't have a lot of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.760 
Escalade but it doesn't have a lot of
what<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.660> kind<00:00:33.810> of<00:00:33.900> like<00:00:34.020> s<00:00:34.170> Canadian<00:00:34.590> has

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
what they kind of like s Canadian has

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.340 
what they kind of like s Canadian has
it's<00:00:35.239> definitely<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> different<00:00:36.690> structure<00:00:37.079> up

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it's definitely a different structure up

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
it's definitely a different structure up
here<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:38.280> back<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> little<00:00:39.030> different

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
here it's back is a little different

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.830

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
there were four acts of the same but

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.709 
there were four acts of the same but
it's<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.100> supposed<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.719> it's

other than it's a black SUV so let's go

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.179 
other than it's a black SUV so let's go
ahead<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.439> transform

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
ahead and transform

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
ahead and transform
let's<00:01:17.970> zoom<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.600> bit<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
gonna do is take the figure and break

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.850 
gonna do is take the figure and break
its<00:01:23.070> prov<00:01:24.350> next<00:01:25.350> thing<00:01:25.470> we're<00:01:25.560> gonna<00:01:25.649> do<00:01:25.829> is

next thing we're gonna do is gonna grab

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.170 
next thing we're gonna do is gonna grab
up<00:01:44.700> here<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.409> fold<00:01:46.409> him<00:01:46.680> open<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.790> uh

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
up here and fold him open like that uh

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.600 
up here and fold him open like that uh
like<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> now<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> also<00:01:50.009> grab<00:01:50.399> back

like that now you can also grab back

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.310 
like that now you can also grab back
here<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> actually<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.630> push<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> tire

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
here and actually just push the tire

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.719 
here and actually just push the tire
flat<00:01:53.159> against<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> back<00:01:55.490> then<00:01:56.490> we're<00:01:56.610> going

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
flat against the back then we're going

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.819 
flat against the back then we're going
to<00:01:56.789> grab<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.570> section<00:01:58.350> between<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
to grab the section between the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.249 
to grab the section between the
taillights<00:01:59.369> here<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.719> rotate<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.200> back

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
taillights here and we rotate that back

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.039 
taillights here and we rotate that back
all<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> way<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.950> expose<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.610> head<00:02:02.899> turn<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
all the way to expose the head turn the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.410 
all the way to expose the head turn the
head<00:02:04.170> around<00:02:04.670> now<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.329> bit

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
head around now this is a little bit

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.150 
head around now this is a little bit
tricky<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.869> actually<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.500> get<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.829> here

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
tricky you actually have to get in here

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.330 
tricky you actually have to get in here

and fold it forward and back once again
forward<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.820> then

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
forward and then

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.980 
forward and then
and<00:02:15.780> let<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.020> go<00:02:16.110> back<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.880> then<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.450> tokuda

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
and let it go back and then the tokuda

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.340

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.840 
molds I think he's the best people let
me<00:04:25.800> rephrase<00:04:26.099> that<00:04:26.160> he's<00:04:26.550> deaf

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850
