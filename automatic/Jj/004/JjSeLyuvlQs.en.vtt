the<00:01:46.030> next<00:01:46.299> string<00:01:49.799> once<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:50.920> get<00:01:51.069> down<00:01:51.220> to

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
the next string once you get down to

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.710 
the next string once you get down to
their<00:01:51.579> what<00:01:51.789> I<00:01:51.819> need<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.090> guys<00:01:52.239> to<00:01:52.420> do<00:01:52.539> is

their what I need you guys to do is

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.839 
their what I need you guys to do is
you're<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.959> same<00:01:53.289> thing<00:01:53.679> but<00:01:53.860> backwards<00:01:54.099> down

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
you're the same thing but backwards down

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:08.490 
you're the same thing but backwards down
up<00:01:55.539> down<00:01:55.869> up<00:01:56.799> down<00:02:06.750> then<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.840> just<00:02:08.049> finish<00:02:08.349> on

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
up down up down then you just finish on

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.529 
up down up down then you just finish on
that<00:02:08.530> up<00:02:08.799> pick<00:02:09.069> okay<00:02:09.509> practice<00:02:10.509> that

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
that up pick okay practice that

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.410 
that up pick okay practice that
alternate<00:02:11.530> picking<00:02:11.769> down<00:02:12.190> up<00:02:12.489> down<00:02:12.730> pack

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.910 

it's<00:02:19.420> another<00:02:19.660> technique<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.410> guys<00:02:20.560> can<00:02:20.770> work

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
it's another technique you guys can work

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.980 
it's another technique you guys can work
on<00:02:21.130> once<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.520> work<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.940> down<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.300> up<00:02:22.450> you

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
on once you work on the down and up you

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.320 
on once you work on the down and up you
can<00:02:23.140> work<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.830> one<00:02:24.220> single<00:02:24.640> string<00:02:25.150> that

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
can work on just one single string that

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.410 
can work on just one single string that
e<00:02:25.540> string<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.440> two<00:02:26.770> three<00:02:27.280> four<00:02:27.670> two<00:02:28.030> three

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
four five three four five six so on and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.780 
four five three four five six so on and
so<00:02:32.230> forth<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:33.010> know<00:02:33.100> what<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.250> can<00:02:33.520> go<00:02:33.550> as

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
so forth and you know what you can go as

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.580 
so forth and you know what you can go as
high<00:02:33.820> as<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.180> guys<00:02:34.360> want<00:02:34.660> once<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.410> get<00:02:35.530> to

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
high as you guys want once you get to

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.220 
high as you guys want once you get to
these<00:02:35.860> frets<00:02:36.220> over<00:02:36.370> here<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.910> lot<00:02:37.840> closer

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
these frets over here a lot closer

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.420 
these frets over here a lot closer
together<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:38.800> going<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> be<00:02:39.070> harder<00:02:39.400> to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
together it's going to be harder to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.770 
together it's going to be harder to
reach<00:02:39.700> up<00:02:39.940> there<00:02:40.060> if<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.270> haven't<00:02:40.540> let<00:02:40.630> your

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
reach up there if you haven't let your

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.780 
reach up there if you haven't let your
guitar<00:02:41.020> like<00:02:41.200> mine<00:02:41.440> has<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.070> little<00:02:42.400> space

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
guitar like mine has this little space

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.220 
guitar like mine has this little space
here<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.330> stick<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.750> hand<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.170> you

here for you to stick that hand and you

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.440 
here for you to stick that hand and you
can<00:02:44.350> get<00:02:44.440> those<00:02:44.590> fingers<00:02:44.980> up<00:02:45.160> there

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
can get those fingers up there

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.700 
can get those fingers up there
unfortunately<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> guitar<00:02:47.200> like<00:02:47.560> that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
unfortunately like a guitar like that

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
got this big loop very very hard to

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.900 
got this big loop very very hard to
reach<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.960> got<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.140> do<00:02:53.200> one<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.380> these<00:02:53.560> but<00:02:53.920> if

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
reach you got to do one of these but if

I want you to start string skipping
string<00:03:19.630> skipping<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:20.260> playing<00:03:20.680> on<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:20.920> sixth

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
string skipping is playing on the sixth

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.560 
string skipping is playing on the sixth
string<00:03:21.250> which<00:03:21.580> is<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> base<00:03:22.000> one<00:03:22.239> of<00:03:22.360> course

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
string which is the base one of course

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.250 
string which is the base one of course
one<00:03:23.290> two<00:03:23.800> three<00:03:24.430> four<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.090> then<00:03:25.510> jumping<00:03:25.959> over

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
one two three four and then jumping over

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.840 
one two three four and then jumping over
the<00:03:26.709> 5th<00:03:26.920> string<00:03:27.220> getting<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.640> fourth

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
the 5th string getting to the fourth

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.400 
the 5th string getting to the fourth
string

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
string

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.090 
string
then<00:03:29.950> going<00:03:30.160> back<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.550> fifth<00:03:30.790> string<00:03:32.100> into

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
then going back to the fifth string into

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.920 
then going back to the fifth string into
the<00:03:33.220> third<00:03:33.460> string

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.880 

up<00:03:36.290> to<00:03:36.469> the<00:03:36.560> 4th<00:03:36.859> string<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.500> second

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
up to the 4th string and the second

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.699 
up to the 4th string and the second
string<00:03:41.439> up<00:03:42.439> the<00:03:42.739> third<00:03:42.980> string<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:45.260> down<00:03:45.560> to

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
string up the third string and down to

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.800 
string up the third string and down to
that<00:03:45.829> first<00:03:46.099> string

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.510 

so<00:03:49.440> you're<00:03:49.620> skipping<00:03:49.830> strings<00:03:50.190> you're<00:03:50.340> going

you<00:05:41.610> can<00:05:41.729> make<00:05:41.850> up<00:05:42.000> 1423<00:05:42.960> that<00:05:43.860> works<00:05:44.100> as<00:05:44.310> well

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
you can make up 1423 that works as well

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.240 
you can make up 1423 that works as well
just<00:05:44.820> get<00:05:45.389> you<00:05:45.570> some<00:05:45.750> more<00:05:45.960> more<00:05:46.770> experience

somewhere those are the drills I think
are<00:05:56.729> most<00:05:56.960> important<00:05:57.960> when<00:05:58.380> learning<00:05:59.160> how<00:05:59.370> to
