00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.060
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.730
 sew a swimsuit for a doll for you 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.200
 need a fabric that does not crumble 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.610
 the edges and which stretches very well 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.690
 it is desirable to use the same fabric 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 from which sew swimsuits for people 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:47.020
 sewing pins 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 thread and needle scissors as well as small 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.149
 scissors I will use manicure 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.730
 take a small piece of cloth that 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:03.600
 will reach approximately the middle 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:07.149
 hip doll wrap around doll 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:15.790
 we stretch the fabric and fasten it when 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:19.200
 the help of sewing pins like this 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.729
 should have to be 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.729
 all bends of the doll's body are underlined 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.959
 now remove 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.300
 and with the help of scissors we cut off the excess 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.800
 but too close to the pins not cut off 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.580
 need i will leave some stock 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.580
 millimeters like that I did 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:04.160
 pins can be removed and now with 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.190
 help threads and needles sew this 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:18.440
 a curved edge like that 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:22.700
 turn out and dress on the doll so 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:30.110
 up sits well now take 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:34.570
 nail scissors and neatly 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.570
 cut out the middle 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:52.900
 I will have it like this 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:52.900
 width first cut one god 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.160
 now the second god 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:04:01.180
 unroll the pupa and cut out the back 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.180
 part of the swimsuit also doing the middle and 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:19.459
 quietly bringing it up and exactly 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:22.370
 do we on the other hand connect 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.100
 the front part is not behind the back swimsuit 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.900
 parts are not behind the swimsuit back 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.040
 I got more than the front 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.190
 so compare the back 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:38.650
 not for the swimsuit with the front cut off 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.060
 superfluous and flashing the pool chat is ready 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.420
 before you can decorate any 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.900
 bow or beads it all depends 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.900
 your fantasy
