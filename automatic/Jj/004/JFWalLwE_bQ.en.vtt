launch of the game now i'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.149> assume<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.629> means<00:01:00.750> maybe<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
ahead and assume that means maybe like a

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
ahead and assume that means maybe like a
week<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.680> two<00:01:01.829> after<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.730> probably<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.180> be

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
week or two after it's probably gonna be

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
week or two after it's probably gonna be
similar<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> when<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> game<00:01:04.199> first<00:01:04.350> came<00:01:04.710> out

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
similar to when the game first came out

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.039 
similar to when the game first came out
how<00:01:05.159> they<00:01:05.339> sort<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> delayed<00:01:06.000> online<00:01:06.479> because

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
how they sort of delayed online because

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.780 
how they sort of delayed online because
if<00:01:07.260> they<00:01:07.409> did<00:01:07.470> release<00:01:07.770> heist<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.430> day<00:01:08.580> oh<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
if they did release heist the day oh and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.100 
if they did release heist the day oh and
most<00:01:09.270> people<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.689> go<00:01:09.750> play<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
most people are going to go play that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.840 
most people are going to go play that
instead<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> exploring<00:01:11.010> single<00:01:11.520> player<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
instead of exploring single player and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.130 
instead of exploring single player and
all<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> new<00:01:12.150> stuff<00:01:12.210> which<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> makes<00:01:12.960> sense

all the new stuff which it makes sense

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.740

from<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.300> old<00:03:21.480> consoles<00:03:22.080> will<00:03:22.320> actually

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
from the old consoles will actually

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.530 
from the old consoles will actually
replace<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.280> newer<00:03:23.550> character<00:03:24.120> they<00:03:24.360> also

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
replace the newer character they also

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.450 
replace the newer character they also
mention<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.110> progression<00:03:25.710> data<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.160> in

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
mention the progression data and in

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.610 
mention the progression data and in
particular<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.000> in-game<00:03:27.390> money<00:03:27.570> RP<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.320> rank

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
particular the in-game money RP and rank

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.310 
particular the in-game money RP and rank
however<00:03:29.130> they<00:03:29.400> don't<00:03:29.700> really<00:03:29.970> mention<00:03:30.600> cars

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
however they don't really mention cars

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.160 
however they don't really mention cars
and<00:03:31.770> properties<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:33.600> still<00:03:33.840> up<00:03:34.020> in<00:03:34.140> the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
and properties so that's still up in the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.080 
and properties so that's still up in the
air<00:03:34.260> maybe<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.250> will<00:03:35.400> be<00:03:35.520> included<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:36.000> the

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
air maybe that will be included in the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.060 
air maybe that will be included in the
progression<00:03:36.570> data<00:03:36.750> I'm<00:03:37.110> really<00:03:37.590> hoping<00:03:37.890> that

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
progression data I'm really hoping that

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.700 
progression data I'm really hoping that
cars<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.390> properties<00:03:39.990> transfer<00:03:40.530> because

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
cars and the properties transfer because

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.350 
cars and the properties transfer because
I<00:03:40.860> would<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.220> suck<00:03:41.460> we<00:03:41.670> had<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.850> rebuy<00:03:42.090> all

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
I would really suck we had to rebuy all

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.510 
I would really suck we had to rebuy all
of<00:03:42.540> our<00:03:42.660> cars<00:03:42.930> again<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.680> at<00:03:43.770> least<00:03:43.860> RP<00:03:44.280> rank

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
of our cars again but at least RP rank

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.400 
of our cars again but at least RP rank
and<00:03:44.730> NDA<00:03:45.060> money<00:03:45.300> we<00:03:45.480> know<00:03:45.630> for<00:03:45.840> sure<00:03:45.900> now

and NDA money we know for sure now

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.600 
and NDA money we know for sure now
obviously<00:03:46.590> once<00:03:47.100> you<00:03:47.190> transfer<00:03:47.400> your

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
obviously once you transfer your

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.910 
obviously once you transfer your
character<00:03:48.090> that's<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:49.080> know<00:03:49.200> they<00:03:49.710> said

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
character that's it you know they said

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.650 
character that's it you know they said
you<00:03:50.040> can<00:03:50.280> go<00:03:50.430> back<00:03:50.580> on<00:03:50.760> old<00:03:50.940> consoles<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.510> play

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
you can go back on old consoles and play

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.110 
you can go back on old consoles and play
but<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.080> can't<00:03:52.320> retransfer<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:54.060> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
but you can't retransfer it it's a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.840 
but you can't retransfer it it's a
one-time-only<00:03:54.630> deal<00:03:54.960> and<00:03:55.440> then<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.490> biggest

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
one-time-only deal and then the biggest

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.000 
one-time-only deal and then the biggest
thing<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.150> all<00:03:57.330> is<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.660> if<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.560> bought

the<00:04:07.950> same<00:04:08.540> console<00:04:09.540> family<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:10.440> if<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.650> bought

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
the same console family so if you bought

ps4 everything will transfer but that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.210 
ps4 everything will transfer but that
shark<00:04:21.270> card<00:04:21.540> money<00:04:21.810> all<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.560> regular<00:04:22.979> money

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
shark card money all the regular money

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
the shark card when I'm guessing that's

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.180 
the shark card when I'm guessing that's
just<00:04:26.340> something<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.760> do<00:04:26.880> with

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
just something to do with

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.910 
just something to do with
the<00:04:27.520> consoles<00:04:28.120> themselves<00:04:28.870> it's<00:04:29.260> not<00:04:29.410> stuff

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
the consoles themselves it's not stuff

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.380 
the consoles themselves it's not stuff
it's<00:04:30.130> not<00:04:30.250> something<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.640> Rockstar<00:04:31.150> really

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
it's not something that Rockstar really

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.660 
it's not something that Rockstar really
can<00:04:31.660> control<00:04:32.050> but<00:04:32.740> just<00:04:32.980> know<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.190> if<00:04:33.640> you

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
can control but just know that if you

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.090 
can control but just know that if you
did<00:04:34.000> spend<00:04:34.300> money<00:04:34.690> on<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.110> shark<00:04:35.470> card<00:04:35.740> that

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
did spend money on a shark card that

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.010 
did spend money on a shark card that
unless<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:36.940> were<00:04:37.030> transferring<00:04:37.630> in<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.840> same

unless you were transferring in the same
console<00:04:38.440> family<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.010> either<00:04:39.220> from<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.550> 360<00:04:40.000> to

an xbox one or ps3 to ps4 it's not going

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
actually mentioned that when he got into

a<00:05:06.880> helicopter<00:05:07.600> he<00:05:08.350> put<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.950> pilots<00:05:09.430> helmet

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
a helicopter he put on the pilots helmet

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.090 
a helicopter he put on the pilots helmet
and<00:05:09.910> it<00:05:10.720> actually<00:05:10.990> sort<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.620> tinted<00:05:12.070> the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
and it actually sort of tinted the

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.330 
and it actually sort of tinted the
screen<00:05:12.550> so<00:05:13.140> going<00:05:14.140> by<00:05:14.260> what<00:05:14.410> he's<00:05:14.620> saying<00:05:14.890> it

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
screen so going by what he's saying it

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.400 
screen so going by what he's saying it
looks<00:05:15.700> like<00:05:15.790> slang<00:05:16.150> glasses<00:05:16.540> may<00:05:16.750> actually<00:05:17.020> be

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
looks like slang glasses may actually be

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.310 
looks like slang glasses may actually be
beneficial<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:18.340> an<00:05:18.880> extent<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:19.480> guess<00:05:19.720> if<00:05:20.020> you

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
beneficial to an extent I guess if you

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.620 
beneficial to an extent I guess if you
really<00:05:20.350> look<00:05:20.920> into<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.220> Sun<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.430> lot<00:05:21.610> but<00:05:21.910> they

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
really look into the Sun a lot but they

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.940 
really look into the Sun a lot but they
will<00:05:22.780> actually<00:05:22.990> work<00:05:23.410> like<00:05:23.710> sunglasses

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
will actually work like sunglasses

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.980 
will actually work like sunglasses
should<00:05:24.430> now<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.610> only<00:05:24.760> problem<00:05:24.960> not<00:05:25.960> with

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
should now the only problem not with

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.340 
should now the only problem not with
sunglasses<00:05:26.560> but<00:05:26.860> with<00:05:27.010> mess<00:05:27.340> I<00:05:27.700> wonder<00:05:28.120> if

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
sunglasses but with mess I wonder if

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.870 
sunglasses but with mess I wonder if
masks<00:05:29.350> are<00:05:29.620> gonna<00:05:29.710> be<00:05:29.980> like<00:05:30.430> covering<00:05:30.730> up<00:05:30.850> your

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
masks are gonna be like covering up your

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.520 
masks are gonna be like covering up your
whole<00:05:31.090> face<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:31.570> you<00:05:31.630> can<00:05:31.780> only<00:05:31.870> see<00:05:32.140> I'd<00:05:32.290> like

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
whole face and you can only see I'd like

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.800 
whole face and you can only see I'd like
to<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:33.550> know<00:05:33.580> where<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:33.970> eyes<00:05:34.210> are<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.780> I

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
to you know where the eyes are so I

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.150 
to you know where the eyes are so I
don't<00:05:35.350> know<00:05:35.410> that's<00:05:35.500> gonna<00:05:35.740> be<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:35.919> little<00:05:36.040> bit

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
don't know that's gonna be a little bit

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.790 
don't know that's gonna be a little bit
odd<00:05:36.430> if<00:05:36.880> that<00:05:37.510> is<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.990> case<00:05:38.020> in<00:05:38.380> first<00:05:38.590> person

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
odd if that is the case in first person

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.640 
odd if that is the case in first person
but<00:05:39.700> at<00:05:40.060> least<00:05:40.480> for<00:05:40.720> sunglasses<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.440> looks

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
but at least for sunglasses it looks

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.530 
but at least for sunglasses it looks
like<00:05:41.860> they<00:05:42.160> will<00:05:42.310> actually<00:05:42.850> work<00:05:43.180> a<00:05:43.419> little

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
like they will actually work a little

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.420 
like they will actually work a little
