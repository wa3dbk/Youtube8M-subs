 the movement at dawn during an approach in thick mato 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.429
 but the pace of the 2010/11 harvest 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.839
 requested 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.679
 is still behind schedule compared to the same period last year 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.589
 according to the rural agency 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.420
 until Friday that February 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.880
 only 13% of the area was already harvested 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
 with 3 32% registered in 2010 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.130
 forwarded 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.830
 largest soybean producer in the country 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.720
 and with an area calculated by the IBR of 610 thousand hectares 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.280
 is no different 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.560
 in tok hun shop 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.020
 showed 3% of the area harvested last year was to see 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.330
 an average of 20% I collected from last year 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.880
 we are a little late in relation to what was last year but 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 we have to take into account that last year 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.850
 the delay in the percentage harvested in the region so far 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640
 is a direct consequence 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.640
 the delay in the beginning of the planting of the oilseed 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.340
 the coach has chosen to save for the ready to be harvested 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.280
 walking along the beach of victory we can see that most of the crops 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 is in the final stage of grain filling 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.150
 This year it was the way it is on the planet. 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.630
 nadinha 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.659
 I started planting October 6 and 7, this fall is quite sunny. 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.130
 da and we were day to be deployed in the field between 17 and 20 onwards 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.980
 for now adjust 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.230
 since then 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.990
 in 12 right without major problems we are having 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.760
 there was no rainfall interspersed in ways that would evolve 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:05.610
 like this 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.680
 we just are not going and we are not more advanced because we do not have crops 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.679
 ready to harvest messi could not be well no use 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.440
 the purchase can be highlighted 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.109
 the forecast is that the rains of February 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.559
 so far time has collaborated with the product 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:24.069
 I could try to talk 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.989
 for giovana measure affects 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.989
 and cozy to fix the problem 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:31.950
 but since the transmission 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.359
 lucas learning mato 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.359
 all the problems that producers could bring 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.009
 given in favor of the opening are being collected in the state 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.879
 up until this month 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.739
 even the most optimistic 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.130
 if everything goes well 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.639
 until the end of the harvest 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:49.999
 The expectation 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.409
 is that the average yield of crops 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.689
 the last step 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.289
 we left the fields at 50 sacks per hectare 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.809
 according to the rural agency 

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 It is estimated that in the 2010/11 harvest the productivity is about 53 bags per 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:07.779
 hectare area 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.999
 with an output of 20 million tonnes, which is already registered in the 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.599
 state history 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.910
 today it started from the first crops harvested with 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.679
 some productivity and excellent 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.489
 searches collected in the next period they have a larger agenda one 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.879
 higher productivity 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.900
 then our expectation is without a doubt if we do not have 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.460
 climate problems 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.460
 from here onwards 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.479
 the productivity numbers achieved so far 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.199
 according to the first oral route 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:55.309
 since August last year already showed record production growth 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:57.689
 history for mato grosso 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.889
 beyond the perspective of high productivity 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.639
 prices vary among producers who have lost most of the 14 items 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.549
 this year 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.949
 I sold more 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.059
 the avid the daad farmer 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:17.109
 this year was the record of early sale 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.400
 I sold more than 50% 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.350
 the delay in sowing the harvest did not affect crop productivity 

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:28.309
 maria do pilar corn planting window 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.620
 the late harvest 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.300
 also had a burn victim of the cereal 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.039
 until Wednesday 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.229
 9 of February 8% of the deputy was sown 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.210
 another 43% in the same period of 2010 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:46.499
 Meanwhile 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.889
 the percentage planted was after a statement 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.240
 well below what he 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.689
 70% of last year 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.899
 with that osmar cabral time should be denied 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.770
 liverpool lost 8 million hectares 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.219
 so why not 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.059
 comma 5% and lower 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.149

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.919
 what we programmed and planted 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.029
 the amount we planted last year 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:21.359
 I have a very significant difference at the end of the 

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:24.359
 planting of sugarcane corn last year last year 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.020
 even if it was not the day of yesterday and today day 8 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.050
 could be 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.199
 since February the planting plant giving maize last year last year 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.409
 this year 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.450

 the military police can not lose a little sand for the minino 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.870
 according to the estimate of the rural union 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.840
 dreaming producers of the region must plant 240 thousand hectares' 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:55.129
 looking to have 50,000 members in 2010 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.960
 excited by the prospect of good profit margin in the 2011 season 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.230
 which can reach 400 hectares to collect 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.629
 many farmers are going to provoke the planting of corn in addition to the 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:09.160
 Christmas 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.270
 that goes up to 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.539
 February 5th

 by the left and only field 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.969
 by the predictions of chain growth ahead we must point out 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:20.650
 on here 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.770
 I with the producer this year because of the harvest is later it goes 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.770
 run a little more risk
