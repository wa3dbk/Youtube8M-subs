00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello everyone is welcome 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.400
 for a new supply opening 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.690
 drop on call of duty advance see do 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.849
 today we left for a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.610
 new tour to a small tour 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 friendly i hope and where are we going 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.700
 maybe possibly have a good 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.609
 weapon then more is that I had 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.279
 already the ball of the gun steed because 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.140
 that they solved the bug eric 160 is 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 hot damage because they solved 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.730
 the bug precisely in bad passage to the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.650
 prestige masters to him already pushed that of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.060
 won I had also the goliath but my 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.980
 pride is triple jelly now 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.759
 so it starts to hurt and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.930
 I would like them to wet the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.579
 third I just had but 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.290
 inevitably as usual this bug so 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.610
 I think I'll come back in two 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.160
 minutes history of arranging that good 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 that's normally it should work 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.469
 this is rwf zeno and that's all 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.480
 against that looks really nice 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.770
 would announce on their w1 the bonus of 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.539
 damage just wonders the penetration 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.860
 balls of the blow it's not necessarily 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.120
 the most interesting is a pity 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.219
 since both of us guys do not see 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 that very often they eric 160 and 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.340
 things over to wear under 15 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.350
 I think the monk cadence and a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.000
 little bit too violent at the mill where I 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.380
 think it's not too it preferred 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.250
 to have the role painter but hey we can 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.729
 always dreaming 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.600
 Come on I hope this time we 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.290
 will finally see something 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 of interesting and it's a mp4 five 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.040
 big Greek banks h one who got me 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.409
 looks really bad but violent 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.119
 at mk 14 deaths craitor I think that if 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.320
 I did not have it yet I'm not going to 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.450
 see her coming in ben ahmed replan 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.799
 five times do not know we'll see after 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.509
 frankly when I will have more room 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.549
 we will see how much june first moquera 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.390
 finally how I would have but 14 ladies 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.549
 I think it's going to be pretty 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.020
 impressive good bah it was not very 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.829
 fruitful these three really not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.600
 big thing in 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.110
 I hope we will see a little better in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.850
 the following are we going on our 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.310
 launched 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 with three new splice drop amelie 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.610
 swift hull and amelie we start to be 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.009
 accustomed also anyway I think 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.850
 that the m14 amelie amerlocks and the three 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.229
 luckiest one will say anything on 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.530
 which we are most likely to have 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.490
 when I speak more French in fact of 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.049
 mayotte this sentence that I just 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.509
 you go out 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.280
 it was a violent thing still a 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.739
 air find a niche xmg black and 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.569
 white in the summer but it's not used to 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.530
 great thing also she and she is 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.709
 not bad I can say she is not bad 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.150
 but well it's not worth an elite of any 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.860
 way well we had a lot of weapons 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.120
 but we had especially pretty lady who 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.920
 serve for nothing the xenon I believe 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.050
 that I had the last time in addition to the 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.600
 n to 4 n to 45 which is not very useful 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.910
 the s12 revenge it is not used to big 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.670
 no more thing and there amÃ©lie swift down 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.620
 so I already have there and already aiming both 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.040
 the two elites so that's not synonymous 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.480
 big thing 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.110
 alright will be able however the three 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.630
 following were still three top line 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.709
 up pasqua well be able to have in 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.200
 wayne 14th r9 age at the esa we 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.890
 increase our collection all this again 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.079
 shit and for the third go 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.100
 go she still has good shit ben 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:00.410
 we will see what we will see in the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.519
 last three good + 3 for today 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.420
 go on we believe it we believe we start 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.660
 do you think of middle go to the elites 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.100
 week we hear the rhythm and have in 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.109
 does not actually it's just a double 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.489
 xp yeah it'll be useful to me 41 minutes 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.459
 double xp with more I'm going to spend 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:21.510
 the prestige there just right here so 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.790
 my first elite of lynx it is useless 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.230
 but it's nice it's added to the 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.239
 collection but it serves strictly to 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.940
 nothing the cow less precision less 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.200
 damage just to have something 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.820
 what's the name of the detector 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.430
 silent there I do not know how he 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.690
 is called the machine but hey that's 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.340
 yeah that's added to the collection 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.500
 it's really because that's because 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.359
 I did not have and still elite 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.670
 gentlemen stop with these elite stuff 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.560
 stopped good go while you're 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.150
 there we will pass the prestige between m 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.280
 master go-to-fire thing 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.690
 what did I do what I did 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.209
 need to unlock I'm going to unlock 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.000
 sniper I'm going to unlock a messenger 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.989
 ladjadj from the pokemon to 45 since I'm going 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.909
 soon need to do the focus 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.500
 and that anyway I need to 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.819
 nothing special since I can not 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.629
 unlock the strict rescue bonuses 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:12.250
 for example up master prestige 3 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.019
 prestige 18th march silver bullet 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.150
 so here's the little piece of dumpling 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.989
 it's not bad then that's what it is 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.949
 what really unlocked it 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.690
 normally it should work 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.639
 now but I can not select 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.620
 the piece not really know but I 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.030
 guess that normally but that's it me 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.800
 will unlock it works well at 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.160
 just painful quickly know enough 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.660
 quickly 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.060
 he is pretty he does not serve much 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.560
 but finally let's say there is a style 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.150
 very particular game but the pretty 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.410
 so it's cool good here on this 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.180
 I hope this little opening you 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.620
 It will have been better to have had at least a 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.880
 little army lite a little lynx that 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.830
 not serve much but we had 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.750
 a nice enough weapon anyway and 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.919
 we are of course passing prestige 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.360
 the silver bullet morse which is pretty 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.440
 simple here on this I leave you and there 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.610
 above I wish you a good 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.139
 day and a good evening and then we 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.440
 will end up next time go 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.440
 ciao
