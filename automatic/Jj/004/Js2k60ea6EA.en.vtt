this is an amazing innovation for the
Apache<00:00:42.150> and<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> intention<00:00:42.839> did<00:00:42.960> really<00:00:43.140> good

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
Apache and I intention did really good

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.750 
Apache and I intention did really good
for<00:00:43.620> us<00:00:43.710> over<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> last<00:00:44.129> couple<00:00:44.309> years<00:00:44.489> we

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
for us over the last couple years we

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
for us over the last couple years we
started<00:00:45.089> with<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.269> standard<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:45.930> went<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
started with the standard one went to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.500 
started with the standard one went to
the<00:00:46.680> micro<00:00:47.010> version<00:00:47.370> last<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.150> big<00:00:48.329> hit

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510

when<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> draw<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.890> arrow<00:01:20.100> back<00:01:20.430> you're

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
when you draw that arrow back you're

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
when you draw that arrow back you're
drawing<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.420> against<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> felt<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.619> when

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
drawing it against the felt when it when

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.209 
drawing it against the felt when it when
it<00:01:23.100> comes<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.380> will<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.619> hear<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
it comes up so I do will not hear that

depending on the carbon arrow you have
some<00:01:28.109> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.289> recipe<00:01:28.619> next<00:01:28.859> you<00:01:28.920> make<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
some of the recipe next you make a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.610 
some of the recipe next you make a
little<00:01:29.280> bit<00:01:29.460> noise<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:29.880> you're<00:01:29.939> drawing

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
little bit noise when you're drawing

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.890 
little bit noise when you're drawing
that<00:01:30.980> doesn't<00:01:31.340> happen<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:31.730> this<00:01:31.850> rest<00:01:32.120> easy<00:01:32.600> to

I recommend people to do to set this up

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.720 
I recommend people to do to set this up
is<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.110> loosen<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.710> set<00:01:48.950> screw<00:01:49.100> just<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.580> bit

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
is to loosen that set screw just a bit

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.940 
is to loosen that set screw just a bit
after<00:01:50.150> you<00:01:50.180> serve<00:01:50.510> this<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.680> enough

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
after you serve this and just enough

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.590 
after you serve this and just enough
that<00:01:51.980> if<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.340> pulled<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.790> rest<00:01:52.970> goes<00:01:53.240> up<00:01:53.390> and

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
that if I pulled the rest goes up and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.090 
that if I pulled the rest goes up and
then<00:01:53.720> you<00:01:53.960> can<00:01:54.110> start<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.470> slides<00:01:54.770> through

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
then you can start the slides through

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.220 
then you can start the slides through

these up yourself the great thing that
what<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.800> recommend<00:02:04.400> and<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:04.850> can<00:02:05.030> show<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.240> in

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
what I recommend and I can show you in

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.940 
what I recommend and I can show you in
some<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.660> my<00:02:05.720> other<00:02:05.840> videos<00:02:05.930> if<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:06.920> don't

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
some of my other videos if you don't

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.480 
some of my other videos if you don't
understand<00:02:07.550> how<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.760> do<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.179> but<00:02:08.990> tie<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.260> on

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
understand how to do it but tie this on

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.250 
understand how to do it but tie this on
I'd<00:02:10.790> recommend<00:02:11.120> tying<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.720> on<00:02:11.840> instead<00:02:12.200> of

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
I'd recommend tying it on instead of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.020 
I'd recommend tying it on instead of
serving<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:12.770> or<00:02:13.100> putting<00:02:13.460> it<00:02:13.700> through<00:02:13.850> your

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
serving in or putting it through your

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.670 
serving in or putting it through your
string<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.720> case<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.020> ever<00:02:15.140> got<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.470> change

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
string in case you ever got to change

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.560 
string in case you ever got to change
your<00:02:15.830> timing<00:02:16.250> twist<00:02:16.790> your<00:02:16.940> cable<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.300> little

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
your timing twist your cable a little

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.510 
your timing twist your cable a little
bit<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.050> get<00:02:18.410> your<00:02:18.530> campuses<00:02:18.980> seen<00:02:19.190> where<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
bit I get your campuses seen where you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.610 
bit I get your campuses seen where you
need<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.330> tie<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.600> on<00:02:20.840> then<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.470> can

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
need it if you tie it on then you can

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.890 
need it if you tie it on then you can
spin<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:22.190> down<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.610> road<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.690> only
