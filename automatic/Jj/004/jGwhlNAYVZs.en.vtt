00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
beat I'll only show course one because

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.180 
beat I'll only show course one because
it's<00:00:59.510> pretty<00:00:59.720> much<00:01:00.019> all<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.500> same<00:01:00.680> thing<00:01:01.010> over

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
it's pretty much all the same thing over

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.840 
it's pretty much all the same thing over
and<00:01:01.370> over<00:01:01.519> again<00:01:02.320> three<00:01:03.320> laps<00:01:03.589> it's<00:01:04.519> pretty

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
and over again three laps it's pretty

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.900 
and over again three laps it's pretty
fun<00:01:05.059> challenge

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.760 

now<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:13.970> reason<00:01:14.450> I'm<00:01:14.570> only<00:01:14.780> doing<00:01:15.170> course<00:01:15.440> one

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
now the reason I'm only doing course one

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.880 
now the reason I'm only doing course one
is<00:01:15.800> because<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:17.600> other<00:01:17.720> nine<00:01:17.990> courses<00:01:18.440> you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
is because the other nine courses you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.740 
is because the other nine courses you
know<00:01:19.010> it's<00:01:19.250> yeah<00:01:19.970> they're<00:01:20.150> different<00:01:20.390> but

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
know it's yeah they're different but

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.750 
know it's yeah they're different but
it's<00:01:21.140> pretty<00:01:21.350> much<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.620> same<00:01:21.770> thing<00:01:22.250> it's

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
it's pretty much the same thing it's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.000 
it's pretty much the same thing it's
pure<00:01:23.090> trial<00:01:23.450> error<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:26.530> just<00:01:27.530> have<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.710> little

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
pure trial error so just have a little

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.920 
pure trial error so just have a little
bit<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.130> patience<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:28.970> figure<00:01:29.360> out<00:01:29.390> every

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
bit of patience and figure out every

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.970 
bit of patience and figure out every
course<00:01:30.230> and<00:01:30.680> then<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:32.410> should<00:01:33.410> be<00:01:33.560> able<00:01:33.830> to

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
course and then you should be able to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.180 
course and then you should be able to
beat<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.460> challenge<00:01:34.520> in<00:01:35.560> maybe<00:01:36.560> even<00:01:36.680> in<00:01:37.010> one

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
beat this challenge in maybe even in one

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:48.820 
beat this challenge in maybe even in one
run<00:01:39.070> if<00:01:40.070> you're<00:01:40.250> patient<00:01:40.490> enough

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.650 

and<00:01:49.830> this<00:01:49.980> one<00:01:50.160> is<00:01:50.280> very<00:01:50.490> easy<00:01:50.700> compared<00:01:51.480> to

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
and this one is very easy compared to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.480 
and this one is very easy compared to
the<00:01:51.780> other<00:01:51.900> ones<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.440> guess<00:01:53.270> but<00:01:54.270> I'll<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.600> doing

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
the other ones I guess but I'll be doing

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.010 
the other ones I guess but I'll be doing
the<00:01:56.490> other<00:01:56.610> ones<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.060> well<00:01:57.240> right<00:01:57.540> after<00:01:57.720> this
