00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
like my slayer series every time i got a

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.580

task i would write down my drops and it

HP experience was like 385 K like an
hour<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.489> probably<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> little<00:00:36.090> bit

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
hour you can probably get a little bit

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.670 
hour you can probably get a little bit
faster<00:00:36.360> maybe<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.840> little<00:00:37.020> bit<00:00:37.200> higher<00:00:37.410> than

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
faster maybe a little bit higher than

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.560 
faster maybe a little bit higher than
like<00:00:37.890> 400<00:00:38.340> K<00:00:38.460> an<00:00:38.579> hour<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.059> really<00:00:39.329> try<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
like 400 K an hour if you really try and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
like 400 K an hour if you really try and
stuff<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.230> those<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.340> rates<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
stuff but those are my rates with the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.549 
stuff but those are my rates with the
noxious<00:00:42.300> staff<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.809> know<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.379> going

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
noxious staff you know not really going

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.440 
noxious staff you know not really going
100%<00:00:44.100> hardcore<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:44.910> yeah<00:00:45.030> that's<00:00:45.239> really

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
100% hardcore but yeah that's really

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.420 
100% hardcore but yeah that's really
good<00:00:45.660> that's<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:45.989> 300<00:00:46.230> K<00:00:46.590> magic<00:00:47.160> per<00:00:47.309> hour

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
good that's like 300 K magic per hour

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.029 
good that's like 300 K magic per hour
and<00:00:47.730> then<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.110> Slayer<00:00:49.410> experience

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and then as for like Slayer experience

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.639 
and then as for like Slayer experience
per<00:00:50.129> hour<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.370> believe<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:50.940> 150<00:00:51.750> K<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
per hour I believe it's like 150 K so

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
per hour I believe it's like 150 K so
that<00:00:52.980> right<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> also<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.820> very<00:00:54.329> good

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
that right there is also a very good

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.810 
that right there is also a very good
task<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.110> terms<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:55.920> experience<00:00:56.370> but

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
task in terms of you know experience but

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
task in terms of you know experience but
um<00:00:57.059> Ganoderma<00:00:57.750> beasts<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.170> very<00:00:58.530> like

based<00:01:01.859> at<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> same<00:01:02.250> time<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
based at the same time because you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.759 
based at the same time because you
obviously<00:01:03.780> make<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> money<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
flakes like the Ganoderma flakes and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.539 
flakes like the Ganoderma flakes and
then<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.650> know<00:01:07.770> random<00:01:08.130> other<00:01:08.220> items

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
then just you know random other items

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.000 
then just you know random other items
that<00:01:08.610> stack<00:01:09.110> but<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.140> also<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> chance<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that stack but you also have a chance of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
that stack but you also have a chance of
getting<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.729> seeds<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.270> magic

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
getting the you seeds and the magic

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.359 
getting the you seeds and the magic
seeds<00:01:12.810> which<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.290> add<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.860> money<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
seeds which do add a lot of money to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
seeds which do add a lot of money to
your<00:01:14.490> price<00:01:14.700> check<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.810> know<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.110> task

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
your price check and you know your task

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.170 
your price check and you know your task
in<00:01:16.530> general<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.070> felt<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> didn't<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:17.970> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
in general I felt like I didn't get that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.899 
in general I felt like I didn't get that
many<00:01:18.450> magic<00:01:18.900> seeds<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.040> seeds<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.729> from

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
many magic seeds and you seeds like from

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490 
many magic seeds and you seeds like from
what<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.030> remember<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.570> used<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.320> many

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
what I remember you used to get so many

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.560 
what I remember you used to get so many
but<00:01:22.770> maybe<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.040> was<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.390> overestimating<00:01:24.390> how

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
but maybe I was just overestimating how

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
but maybe I was just overestimating how
much<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> could<00:01:25.020> actually<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.159> know

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
much you could actually get but you know

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.370 
much you could actually get but you know
still<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> lot<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.540> money<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:27.960> from

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
still it was a lot of money just from

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.530 
still it was a lot of money just from

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
other than the polypore stick which is

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
other than the polypore stick which is
like<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> unique<00:01:34.740> drop<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.790> used<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> lot

some like that but it's still kind of a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.270

doesn't degrade and as a decent DPS
boost<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.819> mean<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.390> they're<00:02:42.690> really

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
boost but I mean really they're really

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.680 
boost but I mean really they're really
easy<00:02:43.349> they<00:02:43.739> are<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.940> easy<00:02:45.060> for<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.450> ninety

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
easy they are really easy for a ninety

five<00:02:45.720> Slayer<00:02:46.110> requirement<00:02:46.769> monster<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:47.670> yeah

five Slayer requirement monster but yeah

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.070 
five Slayer requirement monster but yeah

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.840 
I think that explains everything you
need<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.350> know<00:02:49.500> about<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:50.100> Ganoderma<00:02:50.430> beasts

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
need to know about the Ganoderma beasts
