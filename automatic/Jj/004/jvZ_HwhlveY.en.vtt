pan<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.289> see<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.130> I'm<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.490> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
pan as you can see to this I'm going to

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.449 
pan as you can see to this I'm going to
add<00:02:02.729> some<00:02:03.000> oil<00:02:03.209> and<00:02:03.799> allow<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:04.979> heat<00:02:05.429> up

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
add some oil and allow it to heat up

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.639 
add some oil and allow it to heat up
when<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.209> dish<00:02:06.509> has<00:02:06.720> some<00:02:06.899> Taraka<00:02:07.349> it<00:02:07.530> will

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
when a dish has some Taraka it will

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.469 
when a dish has some Taraka it will
always<00:02:07.950> tastes<00:02:08.220> much<00:02:08.399> better<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.360> are

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
always tastes much better so we are

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.020 
always tastes much better so we are
doing<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.929> tempering<00:02:10.380> for<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.709> reason<00:02:11.220> too

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
doing this tempering for that reason too

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.460 
doing this tempering for that reason too
this<00:02:12.209> will<00:02:12.360> add<00:02:12.569> some<00:02:12.599> mustard<00:02:13.260> seeds<00:02:13.880> and
