00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
get a really good overview of the full I

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:50.880 
get a really good overview of the full I
had<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.340> violent

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.130 

all<00:02:51.890> right<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.160> that's<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.520> bridge<00:02:52.870> just<00:02:53.870> as

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
all right so that's a bridge just as

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.750 
all right so that's a bridge just as
seen<00:02:54.620> in<00:02:54.920> we<00:02:55.670> fit<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.240> racing<00:02:56.990> run<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.580> that's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
seen in we fit in racing run so that's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.970 
seen in we fit in racing run so that's
the<00:02:58.910> same<00:02:59.150> bridge<00:02:59.830> same<00:03:00.830> red<00:03:01.190> iron<00:03:01.790> bridge

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.450 

it's<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.160> same<00:03:07.580> bridge<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.350> basically<00:03:09.770> the

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
it's the same bridge so basically the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.830 
it's the same bridge so basically the
basic<00:03:11.390> run<00:03:11.720> actively<00:03:12.710> in<00:03:12.890> we<00:03:13.190> fake<00:03:13.580> it<00:03:13.850> starts

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
basic run actively in we fake it starts

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.760 
basic run actively in we fake it starts
off<00:03:15.080> here<00:03:16.270> in<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.470> central<00:03:19.010> area<00:03:19.480> then<00:03:20.770> it

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
off here in the central area then it

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:36.390 
off here in the central area then it
goes<00:03:22.010> off<00:03:23.170> here<00:03:24.430> all<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.910> way<00:03:26.890> here<00:03:33.760> bowling

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
goes off here all the way here bowling

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.740 
goes off here all the way here bowling
so<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:38.000> just<00:03:38.240> see<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.540> waterfall<00:03:40.209> but<00:03:41.209> it's

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
so you just see the waterfall but it's

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.370 
so you just see the waterfall but it's
pretty<00:03:42.020> similar<00:03:42.530> actually<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.670> think<00:03:43.970> it's<00:03:44.390> we

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
pretty similar actually I think it's we

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.820 
pretty similar actually I think it's we
fit<00:03:45.680> you're<00:03:46.250> actually<00:03:46.820> in<00:03:47.060> violent<00:03:47.900> but<00:03:48.620> you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
fit you're actually in violent but you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:56.940 
fit you're actually in violent but you
smile<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:52.340> singing<00:03:53.209> plates<00:03:53.510> basically

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.400 

there's<00:03:57.950> that<00:03:58.190> same<00:03:58.730> waterfall<00:03:59.570> that<00:04:00.110> we've

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
there's that same waterfall that we've

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.280 
there's that same waterfall that we've
seen<00:04:01.600> in<00:04:02.600> we<00:04:03.200> think<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:05.060> I<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.690> just<00:04:05.720> think

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
seen in we think so I so I just think

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.090 
seen in we think so I so I just think
that<00:04:06.500> they<00:04:07.220> already<00:04:07.850> had<00:04:08.330> plans<00:04:08.810> making<00:04:09.290> Wii

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
that they already had plans making Wii

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.990 
that they already had plans making Wii
Sports<00:04:10.280> Resort<00:04:10.610> when<00:04:11.480> they<00:04:11.690> made<00:04:11.900> me<00:04:12.140> think<00:04:12.500> I

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
Sports Resort when they made me think I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.900 
Sports Resort when they made me think I
think<00:04:14.000> that's<00:04:14.209> what<00:04:14.360> basically<00:04:15.050> just<00:04:15.290> happen

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
think that's what basically just happen

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.580 
think that's what basically just happen
and<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.209> guess<00:04:17.630> they<00:04:17.780> had<00:04:17.959> already<00:04:18.229> had<00:04:18.560> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
and I guess they had already had the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.280 
and I guess they had already had the
game<00:04:18.859> but<00:04:19.040> yeah<00:04:19.430> they<00:04:19.970> haven't<00:04:20.269> made<00:04:20.600> motion

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
game but yeah they haven't made motion

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.100 
game but yeah they haven't made motion
quest<00:04:21.590> yet<00:04:21.830> so<00:04:22.669> they're<00:04:23.210> really<00:04:23.450> stateless

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
quest yet so they're really stateless

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.330 
quest yet so they're really stateless
