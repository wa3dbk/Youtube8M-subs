00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
look at water hammer if you get a noise

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.759 
look at water hammer if you get a noise
in<00:00:07.379> your<00:00:07.410> pipes<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:09.240> usual<00:00:09.660> bang<00:00:10.019> when<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
in your pipes the usual bang when the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.870 
in your pipes the usual bang when the
tap<00:00:10.950> goes<00:00:11.250> off<00:00:11.490> or<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.389> banging<00:00:13.110> loft<00:00:13.880> we're

tap goes off or a banging loft we're
going<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.089> go<00:00:15.210> what<00:00:15.660> causes<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.710> how<00:00:16.949> you

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
going to go what causes that and how you

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.460 
going to go what causes that and how you
can<00:00:17.279> cure<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.699> quite<00:00:18.150> easily<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:19.020> too

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
can cure it quite easily it's not too

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.590 
can cure it quite easily it's not too
bad<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> problem<00:00:19.980> believe<00:00:20.460> me<00:00:20.490> okay<00:00:21.240> one<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
bad a problem believe me okay one of the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840 
bad a problem believe me okay one of the
first<00:00:21.630> we're<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> look<00:00:22.590> at<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
first we're going to look at really is

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.009 
first we're going to look at really is
if<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.070> have<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> noise<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.480> find

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
if you have got a noise and you find

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.750 
if you have got a noise and you find
that<00:00:28.349> you're<00:00:28.859> getting<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.189> banging<00:00:29.550> all<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
that you're getting a banging all the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939 
that you're getting a banging all the
time<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.210> lot<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.480> times<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.619> be<00:00:31.740> cured

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
time a lot of times it can be cured

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.770 
time a lot of times it can be cured
simply<00:00:32.550> by<00:00:32.730> turning<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> mains<00:00:33.540> water

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
simply by turning the mains water

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.620 
simply by turning the mains water
pressure<00:00:34.200> down<00:00:34.550> okay<00:00:35.579> literally<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.390> go<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
pressure down okay literally just go to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.479 
pressure down okay literally just go to
your<00:00:36.870> main<00:00:37.050> stop<00:00:37.710> wherever<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.250> might<00:00:38.430> be

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
your main stop wherever it might be

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.500 
your main stop wherever it might be
and<00:00:39.260> just<00:00:40.260> shut<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> right<00:00:41.100> off<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.360> all

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and just shut it right off first of all

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.110 
and just shut it right off first of all
open<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.559> kitchen<00:00:43.860> cold<00:00:44.129> tap<00:00:44.460> above<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
open your kitchen cold tap above and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.080 
open your kitchen cold tap above and
gradually<00:00:46.110> turn<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> stopcock<00:00:46.680> back<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
gradually turn the stopcock back on and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 
gradually turn the stopcock back on and
when<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> gets<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> speed<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.500> just

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
when it gets to a speed that is just

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.709 
when it gets to a speed that is just
right<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.340> not<00:00:50.460> splashing<00:00:51.239> everywhere<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
right it's not splashing everywhere and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.709 
right it's not splashing everywhere and
it's<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.260> berserk<00:00:53.120> that's<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.480> for

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it's not going berserk that's right for

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.380 
it's not going berserk that's right for
you<00:00:55.219> then<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.489> generally<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> right

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you then that is generally the right

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.860 
you then that is generally the right
type<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.840> pressure<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.530> want<00:00:59.359> now<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
type of pressure that you want now this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
type of pressure that you want now this
thing<00:01:01.050> sort<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> slows<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> pressure<00:01:02.070> down<00:01:02.340> in

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
thing sort of slows the pressure down in

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.399 
thing sort of slows the pressure down in
reality<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> does<00:01:03.300> usually<00:01:03.719> cure<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> lot

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
reality but it does usually cure a lot

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.469 
reality but it does usually cure a lot
of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> banging<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> hammering<00:01:05.479> problems

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
of the banging and hammering problems

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.920 
of the banging and hammering problems
now<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:08.490> find<00:01:08.760> you're<00:01:09.630> getting

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
now if you still find you're getting

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560 
now if you still find you're getting
bitten<00:01:10.439> ways<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.700> look<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.939> other<00:01:12.060> aspects

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
bitten ways we can look at other aspects

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.289 
bitten ways we can look at other aspects
now<00:01:13.280> one<00:01:14.280> thing<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> look<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.150> you've

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
now one thing to look at is if you've

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
now one thing to look at is if you've
had<00:01:15.479> any<00:01:15.720> work<00:01:15.930> done<00:01:15.960> recently<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.920> you've<00:01:17.040> had

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
had any work done recently if you've had

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.310 
had any work done recently if you've had
a<00:01:17.220> new<00:01:17.430> pair<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> sink<00:01:18.210> taps<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.020> receive

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
a new pair of sink taps to receive

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
a new pair of sink taps to receive
fitting<00:01:19.740> mono<00:01:19.950> block<00:01:20.100> mixers<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.759> mean<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.390> take

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
fitting mono block mixers I mean we take

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.700 
fitting mono block mixers I mean we take
a<00:01:21.600> look<00:01:21.780> at<00:01:21.930> these<00:01:22.049> I've<00:01:22.290> drawn<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> little

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
a look at these I've drawn a little

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.140 
a look at these I've drawn a little
drawing<00:01:23.100> here

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
drawing here

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.230 
drawing here
and<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.659> can<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:25.049> now<00:01:25.790> there's<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.000> mix

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and you can see now there's a mix

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
and you can see now there's a mix
attached<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> sink<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.259> there's<00:01:28.409> our<00:01:28.560> pipes

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
attached to a sink and there's our pipes

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.640 
attached to a sink and there's our pipes
coming<00:01:29.189> down<00:01:29.430> somehow<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.479> mixer<00:01:31.320> taps<00:01:31.530> you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
coming down somehow the mixer taps you

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
coming down somehow the mixer taps you
get<00:01:31.799> these<00:01:31.920> days<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.369> hard<00:01:32.579> pipes<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.329> or

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
get these days are hard pipes in or

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.109 
get these days are hard pipes in or
they're<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.259> flex<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.920> they're<00:01:35.159> hard<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
they're not flex is they're hard and you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
they're not flex is they're hard and you
have<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> have<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.450> cup<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:37.579> well

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
have to have a cup in here in here well

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.280 
have to have a cup in here in here well
they<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.880> often<00:01:39.030> tap<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.659> these<00:01:39.780> pipes<00:01:40.079> can

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
they can often tap so these pipes can

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.660 
they can often tap so these pipes can
touch<00:01:40.470> together<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.950> when<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.159> open<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.430> tap

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
touch together so when you open the tap

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.510 
touch together so when you open the tap
and<00:01:41.880> shut<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.810> bang<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.070> find<00:01:44.399> that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and shut it they bang and you find that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
and shut it they bang and you find that
no<00:01:44.759> Clips<00:01:45.149> underneath<00:01:45.509> because<00:01:46.079> they're

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
no Clips underneath because they're

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.319 
no Clips underneath because they're
coming<00:01:46.380> through<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> sink<00:01:46.920> unit<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:48.060> quite

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
coming through a sink unit and quite

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.940 
coming through a sink unit and quite
often<00:01:48.540> you'll<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> bang<00:01:49.320> where<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.680> shut

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
often you'll get a bang where you shut

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.710 
often you'll get a bang where you shut
the<00:01:50.040> cold<00:01:50.280> water<00:01:50.490> off<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.030> maybe<00:01:51.299> if<00:01:51.570> you've

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the cold water off and maybe if you've

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.240 
the cold water off and maybe if you've
got<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> combi<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.259> well<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> hot<00:01:52.680> one<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.040> well

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
got a combi as well the hot one as well

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.460 
got a combi as well the hot one as well
so<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.570> quite<00:01:54.840> simply<00:01:55.229> pure

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
so that going to be quite simply pure

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.560 
so that going to be quite simply pure
pure<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.369> by<00:01:56.490> pulling<00:01:56.850> apart<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.479> little

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
pure just by pulling apart a little

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
pure just by pulling apart a little
piece<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.079> get<00:01:58.290> your<00:01:58.380> hands<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.710> each<00:01:58.860> one

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
piece just get your hands on each one

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.520 
piece just get your hands on each one
just<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.729> put<00:01:59.909> them<00:02:00.000> apart<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.420> fraction<00:02:00.930> and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
just just put them apart a fraction and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.780 
just just put them apart a fraction and
if<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.829> still<00:02:01.890> getting<00:02:02.250> anything<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.700> you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
if it's still getting anything if you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.130 
if it's still getting anything if you
can<00:02:02.939> find<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.240> way<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> clipping<00:02:03.840> any<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
can find a way of clipping any of the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.770 
can find a way of clipping any of the
pipes<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.040> coming<00:02:05.610> away<00:02:05.700> from<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.360> also

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
pipes and coming away from it that also

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.559 
pipes and coming away from it that also
will<00:02:07.140> cure<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.970> brings<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.300> start

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
will cure it and that brings a start

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.309 
will cure it and that brings a start

you<00:02:30.069> will<00:02:30.219> need<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.430> purchase<00:02:30.879> some<00:02:31.540> pipe

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
you will need to purchase some pipe

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.830 
you will need to purchase some pipe
clips<00:02:32.139> and<00:02:32.349> clip<00:02:32.409> those<00:02:33.250> pipes<00:02:33.639> back<00:02:34.000> once<00:02:34.629> it

clips and clip those pipes back once it
clip<00:02:35.079> back<00:02:35.340> usually<00:02:36.340> does<00:02:36.700> cure<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.120> problem

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
clip back usually does cure the problem

under the floor for instance it could be

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.520 
under the floor for instance it could be
that<00:02:55.120> there's<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.900> cut<00:02:56.169> through<00:02:56.409> the

and<00:03:01.449> again<00:03:01.780> they<00:03:02.620> will<00:03:02.799> bang<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.730> if<00:03:03.909> they're

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
and again they will bang and if they're

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.729 
and again they will bang and if they're
very<00:03:04.239> touching<00:03:04.930> when<00:03:05.079> a<00:03:05.109> wall<00:03:05.290> goes<00:03:05.530> off

very touching when a wall goes off

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.860 
very touching when a wall goes off
there's<00:03:05.919> a<00:03:05.980> shot<00:03:06.280> through<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.579> pipes<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:07.299> the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
there's a shot through the pipes and the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
pipes touch together and bang so if you

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.189 
pipes touch together and bang so if you
know<00:03:10.180> you've<00:03:10.329> anything<00:03:10.540> done<00:03:10.840> on<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.019> floor

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.199 
know you've anything done on the floor
it<00:03:11.319> might<00:03:11.469> be<00:03:11.620> worth<00:03:11.829> lifting<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.669> ball<00:03:12.849> what's

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
it might be worth lifting a ball what's

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.699 
it might be worth lifting a ball what's
been<00:03:13.449> done<00:03:13.659> and<00:03:13.840> just<00:03:14.049> checking<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.530> see<00:03:14.680> if

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
been done and just checking to see if

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.770 
been done and just checking to see if
there's<00:03:14.889> a<00:03:14.949> gap<00:03:15.129> between<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.609> two<00:03:15.639> pipes<00:03:16.060> if

there's a gap between the two pipes if

there's a gap between the two pipes if
there<00:03:17.049> isn't<00:03:17.199> then<00:03:17.859> you<00:03:18.459> may<00:03:18.579> have<00:03:18.609> to<00:03:18.759> cut<00:03:18.939> a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
there isn't then you may have to cut a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.280 
there isn't then you may have to cut a
little<00:03:19.090> bit<00:03:19.180> more<00:03:19.299> than<00:03:19.599> knockings<00:03:19.900> out<00:03:20.079> and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
little bit more than knockings out and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.589 
little bit more than knockings out and
