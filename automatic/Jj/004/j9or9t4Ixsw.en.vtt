00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
downloaded and installed right there but

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
downloaded and installed right there but
it's<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.430> than<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.820> piece<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.149> software

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
whenever they first started making like

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.299 
whenever they first started making like
Nintendo<00:00:56.010> games<00:00:56.750> say<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> person<00:00:58.350> who<00:00:58.379> was

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
could jump run left and right and hop on

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.100 
could jump run left and right and hop on
monsters<00:01:07.680> well<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:08.640> another<00:01:09.360> guy<00:01:09.689> who<00:01:09.990> was

where<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.900> dude<00:01:13.229> could<00:01:13.500> jump<00:01:13.799> run<00:01:14.220> left<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
where the dude could jump run left and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.609 
where the dude could jump run left and
right<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.030> jump<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.330> monsters<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> people

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
right and jump on monsters and people

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
right and jump on monsters and people
kept<00:01:16.830> doing<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.250> over<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.820> over<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> you're

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
kept doing this over and over and you're

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.080 
kept doing this over and over and you're
like<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.930> know<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.130> maybe<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.520> should<00:01:20.729> stop

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
like you know what maybe we should stop

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.929 
like you know what maybe we should stop
coding<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> basic<00:01:22.619> crap<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.670> over<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
coding the basic crap over and over and

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.179 
coding the basic crap over and over and
over<00:01:24.180> again<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:25.140> save<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.830> one

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
over again and just save it in one

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340 
over again and just save it in one
specific<00:01:27.119> file<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.900> reuse<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
specific file so we can reuse it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
specific file so we can reuse it
wherever<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:29.970> concentrate<00:01:30.360> on

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
wherever and then we can concentrate on

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.390 
wherever and then we can concentrate on
you<00:01:30.900> know<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> good<00:01:31.350> stuff<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> game<00:01:32.189> like

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
you know the good stuff of the game like

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
you know the good stuff of the game like
the<00:01:32.520> graphics<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.750> logic<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.860> story<00:01:35.700> cool

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the graphics the logic the story cool

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.390 
the graphics the logic the story cool
stuff<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.680> what<00:01:37.920> construct

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
stuff like that so that's what construct

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.690 
stuff like that so that's what construct
2<00:01:38.549> allows<00:01:39.000> us<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.159> first<00:01:41.400> thing

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
2 allows us to do so the first thing

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.819 
2 allows us to do so the first thing
that<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:41.970> need<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:43.020> course<00:01:43.049> download

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that we need to do is of course download

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.310 
that we need to do is of course download
