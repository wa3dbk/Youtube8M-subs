00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.559
 historic buildings and also masonry subsequently sealed horizontally 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.390
 have often been exposed to high levels of salt and moisture stress 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.989
 in the continuous evaporation of moisture on the wall surface 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.589
 salts remain in the masonry and puts back and crystallize there 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.960
 This crystallization point not only leads to questions about whether tables damage 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.789
 on facades 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.020
 but in the long term results in a sustainable destruction of the building materials 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 Köster Policy MPP 500 is a primer that the underground 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.790
 solidified to reduce the mobility of Zeitz molecules 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.930
 Köster was to be tumbled here especially for the repair of masonry 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.160
 developed with high salt and moisture content 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.160
 they help with the drying of the wall and with the absorption of the salts 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.220
 Crystallize drying process 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.210
 KÃ¼ster rehabilitated short are resistant even in humid environments since they neither 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.750
 sick still contain gypsum 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.590
 they are vapor permeable and help in creating a vapor 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.760
 pleasant living climate from them are insensitive to Poland Seitz 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.990
 held and prevent salts from penetrating to the surface 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.110
 next year old victims briefly completely down to the masonry 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.520
 cut off 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.030
 Loose ingredients are removed 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.250
 In this case, a supplementary horizontal heavy was added 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.400
 Küster Kresin 76 installed 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.510
 The lower area of ​​the wall was protected against water penetration by the Köster 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 the 1 is just sealed 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.460
 Existing salts become the 500 in the underground by means of a polysilicon probe 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.180
 bound 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.980
 and the masonry for a subsequent repair with Küster rehabilitated pulse 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
 solidified 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.229
 for a consistent and solid ground for the following 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.690
 Order from Samir cleans up to be holes and bigger flaws 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.599
 repaired in masonry with Küster sperm for fix source sweeps 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:27.579
 after evaluation of the star Opel can the jaunt yard from crystal redeveloped plaster 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.579
 be applied 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.049
 The Jaunt Litter serves as an intermediary between underground and 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.049
 later his process 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.819
 After about 24 hours of waiting, Coast can rehabilitate putts on the shore 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.899
 Hardened jettison litter can be applied 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:07.259
 in this case, it is a decorative interior design for what 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.629
 the use of Köster rehabilitated briefly achieved two white 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.009
 The plastering takes place with a minimum target pieces of two centimeters 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:39.909
 while the pulse is manually or with a suitable feed pump 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.229
 applied 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.630
 after peeling off the saline process 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.180
 leaves surface after about 60 minutes of waiting time assigned 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:53.849
 After an evaluation time of about 24 hours, he already has his IPO 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.919
 natural white color accepted 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.810
 and can even serve as a decorative interior plaster without painting 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:04.129
 Kösters to iPods is insensitive to moisture and therefore can 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:07.799
 can be used both indoors and outdoors 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.479
 it contains no lime and no gypsum 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.099
 due to its hardness and pore structure 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.409
 In addition, they can not be harmed for a short time 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.829
 Salt efflorescence is stopped 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.019
 due to its vaporized vapor permeable surface 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.199
 Köster will be happy to use his IPO 2 as a decorative alternative 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.830
