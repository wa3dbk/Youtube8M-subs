00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.629
 It was personal, all right. 

00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:05.100
 today our tip will be suspended at sea the terms of a progression 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.380
 arithmetic 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.130
 the expression known to people easily proven rogÃ©rio also 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.679
 suspected sum 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.899
 to map with him had 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.809
 cid behind something even more 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.849
 companies where the 1 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.179
 is the first time was not the issue in question 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:23.800
 en is the number of inmates 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.850
 what happens is that people if they have some with much origin is spoken more 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.100
 there is a very cool Swiss story about the German called 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.350
 gauchos 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.350
 when he was very small he was asked if the college 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.650
 about the separation here was too much and it was teacher ready to get them 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.770
 but here for me fire with suit + 2 + 3g + blah blah blah blah blah 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.310
 more than 98 but 99% 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040
 and he was very small so the teacher did not expect it here 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.060
 that was answered with such ease 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.640
 he used 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.860
 this format a little bit differently 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.020
 after a few seconds young woman chose teacher soraya sport 5050 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.950
 amazed deborah secco 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.200
 klaus how did you do it 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.290
 Yes the teachers I did the following 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.990
 look first day 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.380
 look at last let's add forget first time in that last paragraph 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.990
 but I know 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.370
 after choosing the city 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.890
 also pressed we will centralize 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.150
 when does it give 2 more than 99 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.270
 our tent of the 101 also 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 let's wait a little bit with him three more 98 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.480
 but it is true also 3 48 also of 101 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.860
 he could stop if we make that sum 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.690
 from the outside in 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.960
 It's always going to be the same. 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.540
 the team that much of the terms and may be in testing 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.430
 those who in practice are very simple 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.840
 if you apply 4 to 1 in pacaembu 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 and if you want to do our part without having a company and almost 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.550
 but the answer five months nothing 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.380
 he used repair time I will always have sum 101 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.890
 now I will have that sum 101 how many times where it is adding in doubles 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.299
 while we are on the ground the proposal is insensitive 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:21.279
 if we have been engaged in the pre-salt hussain accounts divided by 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.069
 It's different come to this, I do not think 101 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.389
 in every rural show 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.989
 and how many times his cassation happens without dividing by two the number 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.329
 of doubles reaching 101 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.139
 resulting in 5 thousand and 50 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.349
 bad or good was what he did what they would do what is your first time 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.869
 there 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.519
 who's the hundredth we've done here decayed with over 6 101 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.219
 Who is not even a number of trips to India? 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.619
 with 116 runners 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.919
 before the sao paulo 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.779
 we can remember this house from frant simplify that remember our way 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.379
 so I hope I have helped 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.409
 exposed works
