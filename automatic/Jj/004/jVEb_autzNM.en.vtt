00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
another thing I got was um a little iffy

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.539 
another thing I got was um a little iffy
about<00:03:54.510> getting<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.140> but<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.950> just<00:03:56.430> thought

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
about getting this but I just thought

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.720 
about getting this but I just thought
why<00:03:56.730> not<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.180> was<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.420> dollar<00:03:57.690> too<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.230> think

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
why not it was like a dollar too I think

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.620 
why not it was like a dollar too I think
this<00:03:59.730> little<00:03:59.989> velvet<00:04:01.790> leopard<00:04:02.790> corset<00:04:03.390> top

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
this little velvet leopard corset top

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.380 
this little velvet leopard corset top
and<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.680> just<00:04:04.920> thought<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.760> would<00:04:06.000> be<00:04:06.120> nice<00:04:06.359> to

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
and I just thought it would be nice to

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.280 
and I just thought it would be nice to
pair<00:04:07.320> with<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.709> high-waisted<00:04:08.280> skirt<00:04:08.640> and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
pair with the high-waisted skirt and

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.380 
pair with the high-waisted skirt and
again<00:04:09.469> I<00:04:09.709> definitely<00:04:09.920> wouldn't<00:04:10.489> wear<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.360> just

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
again I definitely wouldn't wear it just

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.640 
again I definitely wouldn't wear it just
alone<00:04:12.170> I<00:04:13.159> like<00:04:13.780> wearing<00:04:14.780> like<00:04:14.930> tight<00:04:15.319> fitted

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.800 
alone I like wearing like tight fitted
pieces<00:04:16.100> with<00:04:16.400> like<00:04:16.579> cute<00:04:16.910> little<00:04:17.060> skirts<00:04:17.600> an
