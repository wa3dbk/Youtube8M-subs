00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
four options so that's going to be

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.380 
four options so that's going to be

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
let's try that one out so let's just do

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.980 
let's try that one out so let's just do
Google<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:26.000> then<00:01:27.000> we'll<00:01:27.119> title<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.479> Google

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.010 

and<00:01:30.320> then<00:01:30.799> choose<00:01:31.130> dun<00:01:31.460> dun<00:01:32.149> and<00:01:32.479> if<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:32.899> open

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
and then choose dun dun and if we open

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.330 
and then choose dun dun and if we open
up<00:01:33.170> Notification<00:01:33.799> Center<00:01:33.829> you're<00:01:34.130> going<00:01:34.250> to

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
up Notification Center you're going to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.700 
up Notification Center you're going to
see<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.670> new<00:01:35.259> entry<00:01:36.259> that<00:01:36.380> I've<00:01:36.500> just

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
see that new entry that I've just

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.289 
see that new entry that I've just
created<00:01:36.860> right<00:01:37.250> there<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:37.670> if<00:01:37.759> we<00:01:37.880> select<00:01:38.030> it

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
created right there so if we select it

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.700 
created right there so if we select it
it's<00:01:38.659> going<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.840> bring<00:01:38.930> me<00:01:39.080> right<00:01:39.200> into<00:01:39.320> Safari

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
it's going to bring me right into Safari

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.370 
it's going to bring me right into Safari
to<00:01:40.040> google<00:01:40.399> com<00:01:40.990> next<00:01:41.990> we'll<00:01:42.110> talk<00:01:42.259> about

to google com next we'll talk about

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.380 
to google com next we'll talk about
manual<00:01:42.890> entries<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:43.610> with<00:01:43.700> manual<00:01:44.090> entries

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
manual entries so with manual entries

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.550 
manual entries so with manual entries
you're<00:01:44.509> going<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.689> have<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.840> lot<00:01:45.079> more<00:01:45.140> power

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
you're going to have a lot more power

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.980 
you're going to have a lot more power
than<00:01:45.740> what<00:01:45.920> you'll<00:01:46.070> find<00:01:46.250> with<00:01:46.460> composure<00:01:47.000> but

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
copy and paste that code into a note on

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.620 
copy and paste that code into a note on
your<00:02:19.400> device<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.060> always<00:02:20.269> have<00:02:20.420> access

your device you can always have access

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.300 
your device you can always have access
to<00:02:21.019> it<00:02:21.140> if<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.620> want<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.830> add<00:02:21.950> some<00:02:22.160> new

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
to it if you want to add some new

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.550 
to it if you want to add some new
entries<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.180> let's<00:02:23.360> head<00:02:23.660> into<00:02:23.870> my<00:02:24.290> notes

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
entries so let's head into my notes

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.650 
entries so let's head into my notes
application<00:02:24.799> right<00:02:25.400> here<00:02:25.700> you'll<00:02:26.180> see<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.390> have

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
application right here you'll see I have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.750 
application right here you'll see I have
all<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.959> entries<00:02:27.260> already<00:02:27.530> pasted<00:02:28.430> in<00:02:28.549> here

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
all the entries already pasted in here

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.370 
all the entries already pasted in here
for<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.060> different<00:02:29.390> preference<00:02:29.870> shortcuts

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
for the different preference shortcuts

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.259 
for the different preference shortcuts
so<00:02:31.069> I'm<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.400> going<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.580> show<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.819> guys<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
so I'm just going to show you guys the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.420 
so I'm just going to show you guys the
brightness<00:02:32.660> 1<00:02:32.840> i've<00:02:32.959> already<00:02:33.110> copied<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:34.250> over

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
brightness 1 i've already copied it over

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.849 
brightness 1 i've already copied it over
so<00:02:35.269> let's<00:02:35.600> go<00:02:35.810> ahead<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.109> just<00:02:36.470> title<00:02:36.769> this

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
so let's go ahead and just title this

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.979 
so let's go ahead and just title this
brightness<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:40.209> then<00:02:41.209> we'll<00:02:41.450> paste<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.959> the

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
brightness and then we'll paste in the

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.650 
brightness and then we'll paste in the
code<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.340> is<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.549> code<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:43.760> brightness

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
code so this is the code for brightness

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.590 
code so this is the code for brightness
and<00:02:44.870> settings<00:02:45.170> choose<00:02:45.530> done<00:02:45.859> and<00:02:46.480> then<00:02:47.480> if<00:02:47.540> we

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
and settings choose done and then if we

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.940 
and settings choose done and then if we
open<00:02:47.720> up<00:02:47.870> notification<00:02:48.440> center<00:02:48.650> you'll<00:02:48.799> see

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
open up notification center you'll see

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.080 
open up notification center you'll see
the<00:02:49.040> brightness<00:02:49.280> entry<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.790> I've<00:02:49.940> created

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
the brightness entry that I've created

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.880 
the brightness entry that I've created
if<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.870> select<00:02:51.049> it<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:51.500> going<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.680> bring<00:02:51.769> me

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
if I select it it's going to bring me

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.860 
if I select it it's going to bring me
right<00:02:52.040> into<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.340> brightness<00:02:52.730> set<00:02:53.000> section

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
right into the brightness set section

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.599 
right into the brightness set section
four<00:02:54.170> settings<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.769> once<00:02:55.190> again<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.400> can

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
four settings so once again you can

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.970 
four settings so once again you can
pretty<00:02:55.760> much<00:02:55.850> do<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.299> with<00:02:56.450> any<00:02:56.660> settings<00:02:57.200> or

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
pretty much do this with any settings or

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.349 
pretty much do this with any settings or
any<00:02:58.250> section<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.730> settings<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.180> would

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
any section of settings that you would

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.240 
any section of settings that you would
