as well it's almost identical except for

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.980 
as well it's almost identical except for
the<00:01:04.439> engraving<00:01:05.090> even<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> quality<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
want to show you another key this is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
want to show you another key this is
exactly<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> same<00:01:32.220> key<00:01:32.460> except<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.939> filed<00:01:33.329> off

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
exactly the same key except I filed off

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.760 
exactly the same key except I filed off
the<00:01:33.659> end<00:01:34.079> bit<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> absolute<00:01:35.189> lowest<00:01:35.490> level

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
the end bit to the absolute lowest level

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.929 
the end bit to the absolute lowest level
compared<00:01:37.770> I'll<00:01:38.070> hold<00:01:38.220> I'll<00:01:38.430> hold<00:01:38.610> them<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.820> so

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
compared I'll hold I'll hold them up so

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.190 
compared I'll hold I'll hold them up so
you<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.119> see<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.479> talking<00:01:39.780> about<00:01:39.840> here

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you can see what I'm talking about here

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.039 
you can see what I'm talking about here
I<00:01:40.670> filed<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.909> tip<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.329> all<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:42.840> down

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
I filed the tip of it all the way down

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.210 
I filed the tip of it all the way down
to<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:44.220> deepest<00:01:44.759> possible<00:01:45.149> bidding<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:47.100> I'll

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
to the deepest possible bidding and I'll

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.069 
to the deepest possible bidding and I'll
take<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.670> key<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:49.590> key<00:01:50.299> works<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.570> well

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
take that key and this key works as well

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.410 
take that key and this key works as well
so<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.890> should<00:01:53.340> give<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.640> some<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> idea

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
so this should give you some of the idea

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.069 
so this should give you some of the idea
of<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> precision<00:01:55.369> now<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.180> full<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.509> Sandy

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
of the precision now it is full of Sandy

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.200 
of the precision now it is full of Sandy
like<00:01:58.409> material<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> casting<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
like material from the casting the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.780 
like material from the casting the
quality<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:01.530> let<00:02:02.430> me<00:02:02.520> try<00:02:02.700> to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
quality is not so good but let me try to

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.810 
quality is not so good but let me try to
get<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.390> thing<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.750> rake<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
get this thing to rake you don't have to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.850 
get this thing to rake you don't have to
rake<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.329> full<00:02:06.600> depth<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.619> last

so<00:02:13.200> let's<00:02:13.560> see<00:02:13.650> if<00:02:13.710> we<00:02:13.770> can<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.220> to

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
so let's see if we can just get it to

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.920 
so let's see if we can just get it to
happen<00:02:14.730> here<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.680> thing<00:02:16.890> does<00:02:17.160> get<00:02:17.430> caught

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
happen here this thing does get caught

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.560 
happen here this thing does get caught
occasionally<00:02:18.930> there's<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.830> little<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.570> don't
