00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.480
 I want so much for all the blondes 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.540
 nerve and today I came back here on guana 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.869
 to review naval strike the new dlc 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.789
 of battlefield 4 released March 25 for 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.350
 premium users and that eight will be released 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.230
 April for all other users 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.869
 this dlc is undoubtedly the most 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.750
 expected of all the dlc released so far 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.180
 because well it was first 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.330
 reintroduced a historical modality of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.060
 battlefield 2142 the assault on the 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.890
 carriers to the times called titan mod 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.900
 in this mode the two teams will 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.760
 will battle they face each other for 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.290
 destroy before the enemy 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.210
 enemy aircraft carrier 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.730
 the other strong point of this dlc are 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.400
 the maps in my opinion the most beautiful ever 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.360
 create for a dlc but let's discover them 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.640
 a little more in detail 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.530
 let's start with lost islands a map that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.090
 extends in the form of an archipelago with 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.750
 islands more or less large than the 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.240
 make up 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.250
 the very tropical setting is at 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.020
 center of the map we will find the remains of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.240
 an airplane crashed into a past 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.490
 not far away 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.980
 let's move on to the attack- to-born map 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.700
 the largest water map ever created 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.980
 from the dies 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.020
 in addition to the great presence of the sea 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.300
 we could in fact also fight on 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.130
 mainland between huts and some passages 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.470
 dug into the rock 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.510
 but here we are at the last two maps 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.910
 those that I think are the maps 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.370
 more elaborate and fun to play 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.770
 let's start with the breakwater map that 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.140
 we can play both outdoors in the sea and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.600
 on the islands that is closed inside 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.100
 of a giant hangar with submarine 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.050
 nuclear annex 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.540
 the peculiarity of this map is the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.240
 presence of some huge shutters 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.760
 that if closed they will prevent access to 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.979
 boats inside the hangar 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.750
 finally we find a mortar operation 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.900
 beautiful map played in a resort 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.210
 abandoned this perfect night below 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.560
 all points of view there is everything 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.840
 a player can dream 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.630
 from the elegant bungalows to the view 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.909
 breathtaking to the secret passages under the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.220
 hill where it is not uncommon to get lost at 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.930
 castle that looms over the island 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.790
 to signal the presence of real e 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.530
 own medieval canons that we could 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.540
 obviously use 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.790
 in short we say that this map is more 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 suitable for a relaxing holiday 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.489
 rather than having violent e 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.630
 bloody battles as in every dlc 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.819
 who respects himself 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.769
 obviously they could not miss the new ones 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.209
 weapons we will find the rifle indeed 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:37.489
 assault on r160 the machine gun sr2 il 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.580
 mit reason heavy av ssr 338 and the sv 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.920
 40 a sort of shrunken magnum that 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.890
 looks like it just came out of the washing machine 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.080
 other novelty the mythical half over between 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.209
 a hybrid boat that will go up 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.900
 even on the walls better than the panda 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.630
 4x4 I almost forgot ah too 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.630
 introduced anti-helicopter mines 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.880
 already as always I want to give you mine 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.040
 personal opinion on this dlc so from 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.810
 can you compare with me below 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.900

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.410
 information and opinions on this dlc a 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.739
 my naval strike warning for now is the dlc 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.690
 of more innovative and more battlefield 4 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.640
 fun to play and of course 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.310
 recommended for all lovers of 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.630
 wars on boats but also 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.430
 traditionalists like mass are there 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.340
 really passing the hours you are 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.569
 having a lot of fun assuming dlc too 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.639

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.380
