kV<00:00:21.930> neon<00:00:22.529> sign<00:00:22.800> transformer<00:00:23.779> which<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.930> just

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
kV neon sign transformer which is just

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.880 
kV neon sign transformer which is just
wired<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> main<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.730> switch<00:00:27.890> not

wired to the main on switch not

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.230 
wired to the main on switch not
particularly<00:00:29.189> safe<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.000> fully

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
particularly safe but it is fully

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
particularly safe but it is fully

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
was expecting a few pops and bangs

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.179 
was expecting a few pops and bangs
before<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.230> started<00:02:52.889> but<00:02:53.069> hmm<00:02:54.590> bottle<00:02:55.590> bottle

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
before I started but hmm bottle bottle

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.039 
before I started but hmm bottle bottle
hasn't<00:02:56.430> even<00:02:56.519> started<00:02:56.999> to<00:02:57.120> order<00:02:57.299> refrigerate

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
hasn't even started to order refrigerate

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.020 
hasn't even started to order refrigerate
a<00:02:58.260> lot<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.159> time<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.519> dump<00:02:59.700> so<00:02:59.879> much

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
a lot of the time you dump so much

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.610 
a lot of the time you dump so much
pressure<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.569> starts<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.959> freeze<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.439> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
pressure that starts to freeze up and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.099 
pressure that starts to freeze up and
lose<00:03:01.739> pressure<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:03.780> pretty<00:03:04.019> good

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
lose pressure that's pretty good

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:05.509 
lose pressure that's pretty good
consuming<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> never<00:03:04.739> refilled<00:03:05.219> the<00:03:05.340> damn
