 you go pretty round at first 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.229
 in fact it's a folder 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.129
 you will make a new file 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.529

 of the backup able to go 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.069
 returned to this folder you will be loaded 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.369
 and you took over the zip file that represents the backup you 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:43.659
 found on the net 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.659
