00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:08.149 
continental method for this method

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.850 
continental method for this method
you're<00:00:08.870> going<00:00:08.900> to<00:00:09.139> have<00:00:09.260> your<00:00:09.379> working<00:00:09.590> yarn

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
you're going to have your working yarn

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.100 
you're going to have your working yarn
in<00:00:10.010> your<00:00:10.039> left<00:00:10.190> hand

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 
in your left hand

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.629 
in your left hand
this<00:00:12.110> meth<00:00:12.260> is<00:00:12.410> actually<00:00:12.949> considered<00:00:13.430> to<00:00:13.459> be

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
this meth is actually considered to be

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.779 
this meth is actually considered to be
the<00:00:13.850> the<00:00:14.510> most<00:00:14.690> efficient<00:00:15.379> and<00:00:15.680> is<00:00:16.340> really

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
the the most efficient and is really

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.580 
the the most efficient and is really
great<00:00:16.970> for<00:00:17.000> left-handers<00:00:17.780> as<00:00:17.960> well<00:00:18.200> because

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
great for left-handers as well because

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.080 
great for left-handers as well because
the<00:00:18.770> majority<00:00:19.250> of<00:00:19.280> the<00:00:19.430> work<00:00:19.580> is<00:00:19.760> done<00:00:19.790> with

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
the majority of the work is done with

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.900 
the majority of the work is done with
the<00:00:20.210> left<00:00:20.420> hand<00:00:21.310> that's<00:00:22.310> neither<00:00:22.580> here<00:00:22.730> nor

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
the left hand that's neither here nor

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.670 
the left hand that's neither here nor
there<00:00:23.060> really<00:00:23.540> because<00:00:23.750> it's<00:00:23.900> you<00:00:24.260> use<00:00:24.440> both

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
there really because it's you use both

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.710 
there really because it's you use both
hands<00:00:24.950> to<00:00:25.130> knit<00:00:25.400> but<00:00:25.610> there's<00:00:26.270> just<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.510> little

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
hands to knit but there's just a little

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.930

this angle so that you can see how the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.620 
this angle so that you can see how the
scoop<00:03:37.329> goes<00:03:37.359> so<00:03:37.900> I've<00:03:38.440> come<00:03:38.709> down<00:03:41.820> around<00:03:42.820> that
