Mace Windu's in his Starfighter which is

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.600 
Mace Windu's in his Starfighter which is
shot<00:01:48.509> down<00:01:48.829> that<00:01:49.829> he<00:01:49.920> manages<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.579> of

shot down that he manages to get out of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.020 
shot down that he manages to get out of
so<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.360> assume<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.799> r4<00:01:53.280> m6<00:01:53.790> was

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
so all we can assume is the r4 m6 was

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
so all we can assume is the r4 m6 was
destroyed<00:01:54.600> when<00:01:54.630> he<00:01:54.930> spider<00:01:55.229> came<00:01:55.619> down<00:01:57.590> so

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
destroyed when he spider came down so

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.190 
destroyed when he spider came down so
that<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:59.009> an<00:01:59.130> unfortunate<00:01:59.219> end<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.960> his

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
that was an unfortunate end to his

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.880 
that was an unfortunate end to his
little<00:02:01.439> career<00:02:03.020> if<00:02:04.020> he<00:02:04.170> did<00:02:04.350> survive<00:02:04.530> have

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
little career if he did survive have

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.410 
little career if he did survive have
just<00:02:05.070> been<00:02:05.219> folded<00:02:05.670> into<00:02:05.850> Imperial
