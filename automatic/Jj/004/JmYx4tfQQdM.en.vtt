about<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.250> lot<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.640> vegans<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.210> this

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
about this is a lot of vegans have this

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
about this is a lot of vegans have this
mentality<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.170> shouldn't<00:00:22.560> exploit

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
mentality that we shouldn't exploit

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.859 
mentality that we shouldn't exploit
animals<00:00:23.510> to<00:00:24.510> eat<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.430> that<00:00:26.430> basically<00:00:26.910> for

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
animals to eat and that basically for

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
animals to eat and that basically for
some<00:00:28.109> vegans<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.880> you<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.300> you're<00:00:31.550> cruel

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
some vegans if you do that you're cruel

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.380 
some vegans if you do that you're cruel
in<00:00:32.820> some<00:00:33.390> sense<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:35.270> disrespecting<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
in some sense or disrespecting the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.910 
in some sense or disrespecting the
animals<00:00:36.750> by<00:00:37.020> using<00:00:37.260> them<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.860> matter

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
animals by using them for that matter

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.310 
animals by using them for that matter
and<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.850> course<00:00:39.090> they<00:00:39.270> would<00:00:39.420> never<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.899> such<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
and of course they would never do such a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.630 
and of course they would never do such a
thing

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
thing

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.060 
thing
problem<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.719> they<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.020> doing<00:00:43.829> such<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
problem is that they are doing such a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.250 
problem is that they are doing such a
thing<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.640> they're<00:00:45.149> purchasing<00:00:45.930> from

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
thing if they're purchasing from

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.360 
thing if they're purchasing from
commercial<00:00:46.890> distributors<00:00:48.829> which<00:00:49.829> brings<00:00:50.190> us

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
commercial distributors which brings us

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
commercial distributors which brings us
all<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.059> certain<00:00:51.149> problem<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:52.620> course<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
all at a certain problem of course you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.069 
all at a certain problem of course you
could<00:00:53.160> argue<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> necessity

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
could argue you know this is necessity

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.770 
could argue you know this is necessity
we<00:00:56.010> can't<00:00:56.219> survive<00:00:56.520> without<00:00:56.850> doing<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
we can't survive without doing this and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.010 
we can't survive without doing this and
that<00:00:58.410> completely<00:00:58.800> makes<00:00:58.920> sense<00:00:59.840> but<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.899> think

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that completely makes sense but I think

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.290 
that completely makes sense but I think
it's<00:01:01.350> better<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:02.160> look<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.059> situation

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it's better to look at this situation

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.109 
it's better to look at this situation
and<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.739> necessarily<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
and not necessarily go out there and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.280 
and not necessarily go out there and
consume<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> honey<00:01:06.900> because

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
consume them all the honey because

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
consume them all the honey because
inevitably<00:01:07.500> you're<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.729> funding

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
inevitably you're going to be funding

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.120 
inevitably you're going to be funding
that<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.930> farmers<00:01:10.650> either<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:12.830> but<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.010> at

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that the farmers either way but to at

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
that the farmers either way but to at
least<00:01:14.310> give<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> people<00:01:15.119> who<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.630> consume

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
least give the people who do consume

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.580 
least give the people who do consume
honey<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.130> break<00:01:17.750> because<00:01:18.750> honestly<00:01:19.380> you're

they have absolutely zero vegan options
zero<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:14.820> have<00:02:15.000> vegetarian<00:02:15.840> options

zero but they have vegetarian options

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.840 
zero but they have vegetarian options
should<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.330> starve<00:02:18.690> myself<00:02:19.670> because<00:02:20.670> I'm<00:02:20.820> a

and go hungry because I have this idea

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.140 
and go hungry because I have this idea
that<00:02:29.450> by<00:02:30.450> me<00:02:30.960> not<00:02:31.410> consuming<00:02:32.370> dairy<00:02:32.610> products

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
that by me not consuming dairy products

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.520 
that by me not consuming dairy products
I'm<00:02:33.270> somehow<00:02:33.600> helping<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.560> environment<00:02:36.530> or

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
I'm somehow helping the environment or

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.110 
I'm somehow helping the environment or
should<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.860> just<00:02:37.890> say<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.370> know<00:02:38.670> what<00:02:38.850> I'll

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
should I just say you know what I'll

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.020 
should I just say you know what I'll
consume<00:02:39.570> this<00:02:40.440> vegetarian<00:02:41.010> food<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.970> time

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
consume this vegetarian food this time

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.720 
consume this vegetarian food this time
around<00:02:42.740> because<00:02:43.740> there<00:02:44.160> are<00:02:44.310> no<00:02:44.550> alternatives

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
around because there are no alternatives

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.120 
around because there are no alternatives
and<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:45.900> becoming<00:02:46.260> necessity

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
and it's becoming necessity

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.590 
and it's becoming necessity
unless<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.240> course<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.570> wish<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.930> go<00:02:49.020> hungry

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600

unless of course I wish to go hungry
it's<00:02:51.600> something<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.140> about<00:02:53.600> because

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
it's something to think about because

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's something to think about because
when<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.930> comes<00:02:55.020> to<00:02:55.260> veganism<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.950> me<00:02:56.130> yeah<00:02:56.459> my

going<00:03:05.820> 100%<00:03:06.590> when<00:03:07.590> there<00:03:07.770> are<00:03:07.920> all<00:03:08.100> these

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
going 100% when there are all these

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.270 
going 100% when there are all these
variables<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.570> almost<00:03:10.110> guarantee<00:03:10.800> my

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
variables that almost guarantee my

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.300 
variables that almost guarantee my
suffering<00:03:11.970> my<00:03:12.360> needless<00:03:12.750> suffering<00:03:13.290> for<00:03:14.220> the

suffering my needless suffering for the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.670 
suffering my needless suffering for the
sake<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.730> something<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.540> really<00:03:16.200> won't<00:03:16.440> make

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
sake of something that really won't make

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.830

a<00:03:16.740> difference<00:03:17.040> whatsoever<00:03:18.320> or<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.800> seems<00:03:20.130> I

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
a difference whatsoever or so it seems I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.930 
a difference whatsoever or so it seems I
would<00:03:21.840> rather<00:03:21.989> starve<00:03:22.380> than<00:03:22.890> consume<00:03:23.400> meat<00:03:23.700> I

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
would rather starve than consume meat I

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.050 
would rather starve than consume meat I
mean<00:03:24.780> that's<00:03:24.959> just<00:03:25.140> how<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.290> feel<00:03:25.590> because

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
mean that's just how I feel because

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.500 
mean that's just how I feel because
you're<00:03:27.060> inevitably<00:03:28.130> undeniably

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
you're inevitably undeniably

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.790 
you're inevitably undeniably
contributing<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.810> death<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.410> animal

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
contributing to the death of that animal

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.170 
contributing to the death of that animal
assuming<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.340> didn't<00:03:32.610> die<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:33.030> natural<00:03:33.420> causes

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
assuming it didn't die of natural causes

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.240 
assuming it didn't die of natural causes
but<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.330> dairy<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.590> little<00:03:37.980> bit<00:03:38.070> more

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
but with dairy it's a little bit more

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.060 
but with dairy it's a little bit more
complicated<00:03:38.610> than<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.680> you're<00:03:40.680> not<00:03:40.709> eating

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
complicated than that you're not eating

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.830 
complicated than that you're not eating
a<00:03:41.280> piece<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.670> an<00:03:41.790> animal<00:03:42.150> you're<00:03:42.540> only<00:03:42.720> eating

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
a piece of an animal you're only eating

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.410 
a piece of an animal you're only eating
what<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.410> naturally<00:03:44.040> produces<00:03:44.730> without
