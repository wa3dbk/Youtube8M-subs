 [Music] 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.699
 and that's where all these people messy mane 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.990
 comment go get me that's great 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.449
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.760
 triple bombs on the retreat mode in 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.320
 2000 ensures 6 v6 with the ball 27 lo 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.790
 with a sense that he has where I will do it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.320
 my class on the screen 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.880
 today I was told about a low subject 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.700
 which is pretty interesting of sandblasted 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.770
 because it touches youtube 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.680
 so you'll see afterwards before 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.820
 that I reproduce the subject finally the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.309
 nobody to talk to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 I would like to start by talking about 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.320
 contrary statistics that's 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.550
 really annual earnings estimates 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.719
 from youtube hours you know 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.860
 certainly his ranks of the big 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.000
 estimates maybe win 100 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.559
 miles since maybe how much he 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.640
 asked that they are no longer brief 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.640
 it's to make a little idea 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 so sir the annual v12 monge he 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.119
 earns around 20000 euros 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.820
 twenty thousand euros squeeze annually 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.979
 equal three hundred thousand euros months yet 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.250
 an estimate about so taken a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.229
 also three hundred thousand 5000 euros 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.330
 annuals - and then there still his chain 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.380
 on a gaming again and then dubai who 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.280
 is the person who has the most subscribers 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 on youtube we win I believe 3 million 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.040
 per year 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.080
 first talk about the facts it's huge 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.850
 and he also has up to more subscribers a 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.350
 to thirty million subscribers I 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.060
 still believe more I'm not sure 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.009
 finally he has a lot of subscribers you 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.560
 certainly know him both 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.200
 have in any case but that today we 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.040
 is going to talk about sailing it's lucas more 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.079
 subscribers but it's not him who wins 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.880
 the more one lends I had 2 the chain that 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.880
 makes the most water views that win 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.159
 more money on youtube so that's it 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.960
 as I was able to exceed 380 million 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.579
 views by month and the chain that I you 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.159
 presentais ie make a thesis 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.590
 collector powerpoint is collector that's 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.500
 the chain that makes the most views that 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.740
 makes the most money simply 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.380
 last year she made herself 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.780
 has made 5 million in 2014 and it was 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.489
 $ 5 million or euros at 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.080
 more than seven other cases brief essay 5 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.930
 millions you say no we made 3 million 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.060
 at 5 million guys 5 million for 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.709
 little comparison more than ipad does 380 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.450
 million jute a month she actually 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.319
 440 million views and that's it 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.989
 just huge 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.310
 the 4 million subscribers so here we go 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.680
 what is she doing on her channel 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.540
 you do his chain is to open 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.390
 toy cartons to unpack 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.030
 toys and then to say what's in it 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.730
 and put them in place 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.739
 that's how she earns 5 million a year on 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.040
 we see toy boxes needed 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.720
 do it 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.900
 damn i'm not sure i''re not me 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.040
 a kerecki we are on the ass it's not 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.079
 the numbers are not the views 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.730
 who is with us is really 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.219
 what she does whatever they do 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.989
 so many views for that it's quite 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:04.030
 one understands too but hey that's it 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.079
 the line to 7 yen more money for 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.579
 simply and well here she is pointing in 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.650
 the more she misses about 100 million 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.030
 of views she prefers instead of doing 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.709
 440 million views per month they 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.659
 will be able to make 500 million because the 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.920
 problem is that she shares it has 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.599
 blocked the ability to put a gm or 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.680
 so just comment on the 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.069
 video ie we can not the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.359
 share 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.709
 people can not share his 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.629
 video and that makes you lose sight of 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.280
 when usually someone tweets 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.720
 one of the videos he liked it passes on 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.250
 twitter you will click and you if you 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.989
 appliques is off and it brings back a 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.489
 like a person who loves a video that 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.079
 bring him back three that brings back three more 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.489
 Players stuff like that then there it 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.709
 could bring back a mass of viewer 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.879
 huge I do not know why doing it 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.319
 you can make a lot more money 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.629
 but good 5 million due to toxins from 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.939
 short game I'll put his kids his 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.269
 most well known video finally qualiplus 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:57.010
 market made 220 fucking millions of 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.090
 views and she dates from only there are 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.440
 eight months is not a video that dates 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.079
 from three years ago and in order to be done 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.090
 see and its 220 million views ago 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.129
 eight months if I do not know how many times 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.299
 France and it's quite huge 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.930
 she simply opened 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:13.870
 barbies l have and not princesses 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.190
 disney with some modeling clay I know 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.389
 not what basically there is a castle with 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.889
 modeling clay will make little ones 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.090
 cakes with princes is she 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.520
 was 220 million views that's all 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.400
 to make huge power to dramatically play 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.260
 next on the ass with his spas and 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.250
 it's really not the worst is not 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.500
 the worst just they look 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.820
 you are going to hallucinate simply 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.500
 not obviously that you are the most paying 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.900
 people are interested in you and 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.229
 your identity and i martin recently 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.030
 acuity by his identity in fact and that's 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.760
 true actually it turns out true lack clc 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.930
 are said summer so if you know her 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.340
 already it's just that you 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.289
 often find yourself alone with yourself 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.020
 a pack of tissues and a bottle 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.800
 of cream simply because it's 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.389
 a porn actress fell on two 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.979
 video I did not look at one moreover 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.470
 before scientific title 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.430
 I put the name right here on the screen 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.680
 play the exact name 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.770
 here it is said his mother I leave you 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.509
 go I'll let you go get to 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.300
 scientific network obviously on 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.710
 internet one of his videos for you 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.879
 see what she was doing before 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.039
 make videos of new styles 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:27.310
 disney again a title 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.569
 scientist a step for something else and 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.560
 I also show you the image of what he 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.060
 looks so you will stay that she is 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.349
 good anyway if we prefer writing this 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.650
 prono is on a good track if 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:37.870
 porn actress pew you toys for 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.310
 deep down I do not know if you're going 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.599
 it's a sick thing 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.930
 and those who earn more in the 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.840
 South 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.780
 finally this story I often see a 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.819
 kind of seal on the stuff you 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.259
 do not wait what's wrong here 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.659
 in poorer toys she wins 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.650
 tone and I believe how it was 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.199
 recognize I believe it's his neighbor 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.449
 who recognized his voice but that the bench 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.710
 after that he has composed and that is that 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.099
 that is known as that is good after 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.000
 obviously she said he got ground 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.699
 but it's true that it's pretty weird 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.810
 I let you go see his videos of 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.669
 his chain serials this collector and 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.430
 also to his videos of his old 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.630
 profession so high school damage do not hesitate 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.430
 not to comment on what you 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.080
 what do you think about this little 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.169
 story his parents a story that's 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.150
 in fact of actuality and that is not to say 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.300
 what you think about sharing etc 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.560

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.340
 looked at him tonight I also advise 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:34.750
 to look at it that sounds cool 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.849
 this geographical grid year 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.719

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.889
 so here's the guys I get lost a little 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:40.150
 in this subject I hope that at the idea you 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.319
 could not have been there chanac if we 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.550
 could reach 300 embarrassment for 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.779
 this video would be really great 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.129

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:48.430

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:50.409
 the subject is really nice p13 really 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.490
 of something when we are all on 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.389
 youtube and his voice retired from the 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.340
 nobody to make more money on 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.229
 youtube and it's really abused 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.669
