one thing I noticed mostly about Groton
wellness<00:01:36.690> is<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.130> focus<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.760> so<00:01:39.000> much<00:01:39.030> on

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
wellness is that the focus is so much on

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.990 
wellness is that the focus is so much on
the<00:01:39.480> patient<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.440> not<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.250> their<00:01:41.460> teeth<00:01:41.760> or

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the patient and not just their teeth or

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
the patient and not just their teeth or
their<00:01:42.090> mouth<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.750> how<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> whole

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so we have the grounding that started

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.540 
so we have the grounding that started
this<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:48.120> was<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.930> dental<00:01:49.620> practice<00:01:49.800> being
