on this kit I've been realizing all the
little<00:00:56.430> clips<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.059> go<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.480> between<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> arms

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
little clips that go in between the arms

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.930 
little clips that go in between the arms
here<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.109> adjust<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.670> case

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
just the way it's been engineered the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.460 
just the way it's been engineered the
way<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.509> parts<00:01:48.860> fit<00:01:49.860> together<00:01:51.049> there's<00:01:52.049> just

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
way the parts fit together there's just

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.080 
way the parts fit together there's just
absolutely<00:01:52.850> no<00:01:53.850> slop<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.689> anything<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
absolutely no slop in anything and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.260 
absolutely no slop in anything and
nothing<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:58.979> tight<00:02:01.219> these<00:02:02.219> balls<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
pillow balls here in the front knuckles

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.819 
pillow balls here in the front knuckles
I<00:02:05.189> wasn't<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.850> big<00:02:06.090> fan<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:06.960> first<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
I wasn't a big fan of it at first you

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.449 
I wasn't a big fan of it at first you
can't<00:02:08.129> adjust<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.849> camber<00:02:09.119> easily

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
can't adjust the camber easily

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.920 
can't adjust the camber easily
especially<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.940> you're<00:02:12.150> using<00:02:12.300> dish

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.530 

but<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:20.170> are<00:02:20.200> ways<00:02:20.380> around<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:21.300> they<00:02:22.300> are

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
but there are ways around that they are

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.840 
but there are ways around that they are
they're<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.200> tight<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.590> i<00:02:23.830> don't<00:02:24.490> think<00:02:24.700> i'll

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
they're so tight that i don't think i'll

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.480 
they're so tight that i don't think i'll
have<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.120> addressed<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.720> camber<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:27.070> much

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
have to be addressed in camber that much

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.970 
have to be addressed in camber that much
unless<00:02:27.880> i'm<00:02:28.870> tweaking<00:02:29.350> my<00:02:29.380> setup<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.770> a

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
unless i'm tweaking my setup but it's a

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.630 
unless i'm tweaking my setup but it's a
it's<00:02:33.310> an<00:02:33.580> awesome<00:02:33.730> kit<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.330> realized<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it's an awesome kit I realized that you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.340 
it's an awesome kit I realized that you
go<00:02:36.820> through<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.180> super<00:02:37.540> grease<00:02:37.750> really<00:02:38.080> fast

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
go through the super grease really fast

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.290 
go through the super grease really fast
I<00:02:38.710> don't<00:02:39.070> think<00:02:39.130> moving<00:02:39.520> gives<00:02:39.850> enough<00:02:40.120> of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
I don't think moving gives enough of

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.720 
I don't think moving gives enough of
that<00:02:41.400> hold<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.550> one<00:02:42.730> second<00:02:44.190> it's<00:02:45.190> called<00:02:45.520> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
that hold on one second it's called the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.990 
that hold on one second it's called the
super<00:02:46.060> joint<00:02:46.480> grease<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:47.430> had<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.520> go<00:02:48.640> buy<00:02:48.790> more

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
super joint grease I had to go buy more

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.610 
super joint grease I had to go buy more
from<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.300> local<00:02:49.600> hobby<00:02:49.750> shop<00:02:49.900> it's<00:02:50.410> eight

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
from the local hobby shop it's eight

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.700 
from the local hobby shop it's eight
