somewhere<00:02:45.800> I'm<00:02:46.800> going<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> check<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.310> out<00:02:47.430> and

somewhere I'm going to check it out and

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.300 
somewhere I'm going to check it out and
see<00:02:47.610> how<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.850> goes<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:49.440> factory<00:02:49.860> edge<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.160> the

it's<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.400> good<00:02:53.580> surface<00:02:53.910> edge<00:02:54.270> but<00:02:55.020> I

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
it's a good surface edge but I

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.650 
it's a good surface edge but I
definitely<00:02:55.350> would<00:02:55.739> not<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.340> with<00:02:56.610> my<00:02:56.660> sog

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660

it is also a finger release rather than

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.270 
it is also a finger release rather than
a<00:03:47.940> thumb<00:03:48.120> release<00:03:48.390> now<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.049> prefer<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.769> thumb

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
a thumb release now I prefer a thumb

something<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:55.799> could<00:03:56.070> be<00:03:56.160> awkward<00:03:56.370> for

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
something that could be awkward for

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:09.850 
something that could be awkward for
someone<00:03:57.269> who's<00:03:57.420> used<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.989> thumb<00:03:58.260> release

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860

this<00:04:10.430> knifes<00:04:10.670> which<00:04:10.940> is<00:04:11.090> very<00:04:11.300> easily<00:04:11.540> from

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
this knifes which is very easily from

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.320 
this knifes which is very easily from
right-hander<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.890> left-hander<00:04:13.400> one<00:04:14.060> thing<00:04:14.240> I

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
right-hander to left-hander one thing I

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.060 
right-hander to left-hander one thing I
did<00:04:14.480> notice<00:04:14.510> is<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.990> you<00:04:15.350> cannot<00:04:15.620> mount<00:04:15.860> it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
did notice is that you cannot mount it

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.800 
did notice is that you cannot mount it
higher<00:04:16.400> or<00:04:16.989> lower<00:04:17.989> on<00:04:18.920> the<00:04:19.370> handle<00:04:19.730> because<00:04:20.570> it

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
higher or lower on the handle because it

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.760 
higher or lower on the handle because it
simply<00:04:21.140> will<00:04:21.260> not<00:04:21.320> work<00:04:21.680> on<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.370> catch<00:04:22.580> point

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
simply will not work on the catch point

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.650 
simply will not work on the catch point
but<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:26.410> may<00:04:27.410> try<00:04:27.770> using<00:04:28.400> this<00:04:28.760> as<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.060> chest

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
but I may try using this as a chest

but I may try using this as a chest
mount<00:04:30.370> having<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.520> knife<00:04:31.700> hung<00:04:32.180> upside<00:04:32.570> down

but<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.080> have<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.350> find<00:04:33.500> another<00:04:33.790> piece<00:04:34.790> like

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
but I have to find another piece like

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.780 
but I have to find another piece like
this<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:36.500> that<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.800> secure<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.640> knife

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
this so that I can secure the knife

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.220 
this so that I can secure the knife
handle<00:04:38.120> even<00:04:38.270> though<00:04:38.450> it<00:04:38.630> stays<00:04:38.960> in<00:04:38.990> the

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
handle even though it stays in the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.670 
handle even though it stays in the
sheath<00:04:39.440> quite<00:04:39.830> well<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.300> do<00:04:41.300> want<00:04:41.630> another<00:04:41.960> snap

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
sheath quite well I do want another snap

catch<00:04:42.980> for<00:04:43.220> the<00:04:43.250> knife<00:04:43.460> if<00:04:43.640> I'm<00:04:43.760> going<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.000> have

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
catch for the knife if I'm going to have

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.960 
catch for the knife if I'm going to have
it<00:04:44.120> hanging<00:04:44.450> upside<00:04:44.930> down<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:46.370> sheath<00:04:46.610> also

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
it hanging upside down the sheath also

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.790 
it hanging upside down the sheath also
has<00:04:47.150> plenty<00:04:47.450> of<00:04:47.480> holes<00:04:47.690> for<00:04:48.020> lanyards<00:04:48.470> four

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.159 
has plenty of holes for lanyards four
straps<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:50.090> I'm<00:04:50.270> going<00:04:50.390> to<00:04:50.419> come<00:04:50.600> up<00:04:50.720> with<00:04:50.870> some

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
straps so I'm going to come up with some

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.380 
straps so I'm going to come up with some
other<00:04:51.230> way<00:04:51.440> of<00:04:51.620> making<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.400> chest<00:04:52.700> mount<00:04:52.880> for

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
other way of making a chest mount for

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.090 
other way of making a chest mount for
this<00:04:53.980> so<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.100> cold<00:04:55.340> steel<00:04:55.550> srk<00:04:56.590> any<00:04:57.590> about<00:04:57.800> six

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
this so the cold steel srk any about six

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.440 
this so the cold steel srk any about six
months<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.520> i'll<00:04:58.580> put<00:04:58.730> out<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:58.970> follow<00:04:59.360> up

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
months and i'll put out a follow up

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.720 
months and i'll put out a follow up
