00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello to all I give you the answers 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.710
 of the competition organized last weekend 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.720
 in partnership with six points like 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.040
 in episode 9 of brick fans he 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.080
 needed to find three intruders who 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.400
 had hidden in the video as 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.019
 last time there are a lot of answers 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.549
 atypical that caught our attention 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.299
 and I think a little focus 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.520
 is needed 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.310
 the three intruders were a family of 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.830
 badgers playmobil the proud gimli son 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.189
 of glo id as well as the troll in harry 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.510
 potter 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.099
 overall intruders are almost 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.480
 always figurines or critters 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.519
 that have nothing to do with the universe of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.990
 star wars and that appears to be little of 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.579
 time on the screen be the senses very well 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.800
 concealed in matches are therefore 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.480
 nor false connections or texts so 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.399
 badger mum and her little ones were 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.860
 hidden under the tree of 7 and wac attack 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.690
 a minute 53 that he had taken the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.360
 place widgets on the battle box 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.590
 of enders at 7 minutes 09 and finally the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.899
 harry potter troll was hidden in 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.910
 the legal window shop at minutes 20 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.170
 in the middle of the set battle of hand I 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.219
 noticed that some nigaud had 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 given answers in the comments 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.789
 youtube that I allowed myself to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.079
 delete next time it would 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.649
 cool to avoid doing that and this for 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.329
 three reasons 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.500
 already it is useless if you wanted 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.510
 to participate in the competition 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.470
 send your answers to an email address 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.030
 who you are and communicated on 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.920
 rodrigues dot com or on the page 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.060
 brick facebook fans then it can 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.140
 spoil the surprise for those who 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.340
 wanted to find the one thing by 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.900
 themselves and finally it can you 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.070
 disadvantaged because know that on the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.030
 answers select the three winners 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.830
 will be drawn 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 which means that if a little guy has 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.520
 copied your answers he can win the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.080
 contest and not you so think about it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 next time the three winners are 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.619
 so hosts and tee is created 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.540
 Swiss 11 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.490
 congratulations to you guys it was good 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.810
 and now the bad tracks 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.250
 the intruders of this time were 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.180
 not the same as those of the episode on 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.380
 fighter sizes 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.270
 so it's not worth it 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.829
 bob the hedgehog even though he actually 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.299
 was stashed on the set and the world 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.200
 for stone was not an intruder even though 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.490
 it is true that he could have done the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.689
 firm and recognize that it was when 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.189
 even far too much put forward 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.299
 it was just that when I was little 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.030
 I wanted to one day replace 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.380
 chewbacca by a hip hop pilot and the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.119
 figurine did not exist at the time 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 suddenly among the goths the only 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.720
 character who looked the most 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.990
 it was this little firefighter that was it 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.369
 a tribute to my infantile stupidity the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.200
 fij the great legal adventure was 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.310
 not an intruder either it was just 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.320
 to use the clip codes of 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.939
 michael jackson billie jean or amandine 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 big posters and presents on screen 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.569
 and that's also why I put some 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.039
 manceaux of kleenex and not pq on 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.140
 the ground to remind the leaves of 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.730
 flying newspapers that 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.290
 whose clip my imitation of the 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.510
 quadripods obviously did not 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.280
 convinced everyone since some 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.280
 thought I had to imitate the dog 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.590
 others the antelope or the king 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.340
 lion the lion king finally it's 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.340
 completely ridiculous 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.720
 and for the record, know that the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.780
 Quadripod approach is inspired by the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.670
 elephant walk a person 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.819
 says oberrhein martel was perched on 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.959
 the spyder bikes at first it's funny 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.680
 because in fact it's a reference to 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.780
 an episode of game over and the ring 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.640
 of a formidable legal maj was neither 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.130
 an obi figurine wan a figurine of 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.020
 jar jar binks but well tc4 the droid of 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.130
 palpatine protocol at the base of that 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.959
 had to be one of the three intruders 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.970
 main but as he is already gone 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.050
 from the star wars universe we preferred the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.530
 do something else to avoid 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.730
 confusion 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.170
 as to who asserts that 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.430
 it's gerard jugnot under the hood 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.709
 seriously and as for the brick of 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.980
 lead on the table and well it was just 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.930
 a brick of the lot on the table the bipod 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.910
 collector was actually inlaid 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.709
 since nobody could lend me this 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.420
 lego I'll be improving it but effects 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.860

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.780
