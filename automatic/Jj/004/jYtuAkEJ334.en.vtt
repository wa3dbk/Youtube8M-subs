00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.120
 playstation 4 or xbox when which 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.280
 console makes the next generation race 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.040
 no question concerns the video players 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.539
 community currently more than this we 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.219
 make that quite sober 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.020
 direct comparison and leave the consoles 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.740
 from microsoft and sony against each other 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.350
 compete 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.020
 based on the king categories hardware and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.570
 Technology controller multimedia online 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 features games as well as prize and release 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.680
 date we will make the next generation 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.170
 check on the paper they are for both 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.059
 Consoles very similar to both microsoft 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.980
 as well as sony put up with the processor 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.499
 8 cores populate their crates 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.269
 each 8 gb of memory a blu 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.909
 ray drive and a 500 gigabyte 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.249
 hard disk, however, are technology 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.409
 Experts and developers agree on the ps4 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:52.399
 still has a tick more hardware power 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.319
 that's because in the sony console 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.139
 gddr5 memory is installed the 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:01:00.989
 again a bandwidth of 176 gigabits 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:03.780
 per second, the xbox team delivers 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 since only 68 gb is also the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.829
 Graphics chip of the ps4 with its 18 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.860
 control units theoretically fixer than 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.689
 an xbox postage oh yes, the hard drive of the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.070
 ps4 is in contrast to the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.399
 Exchange xbox one 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.580
 you can expand the capacity so 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.700
 That's why this point is approaching 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.720
 the ps4 the gamepads of the two 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.370
 upcoming consoles are 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.770
 developments of their famous 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.450
 predecessor microsoft relies on the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.310
 the 360 ​​known design 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.650
 However, the school are now with 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.510
 a cool vibration function 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.310
 equipped Sony's dual shock 4 is coming 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.320
 same with several innovations therefore 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.240
 located on the front of the pads 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.740
 a small touch surface on 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.330
 the back side is a lightbar 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.130
 medium of his coloring for example 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.310
 the life energy of your pawn to 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.910
 also shows the famous sixaxis 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.440
 Motion sensors are back on with 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.479
 shelf 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.700
 apropos movement kinect is more central 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.800
 ingredient of the xbox one without the camera 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.410
 goes to the microsoft console even 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.090
 not all menus and just as well 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.190
 some games can be done by gestures and 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.869
 voice commands are controlled 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.720
 hopefully works better than it does 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.610
 with the xbox 360 sony stops 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.010
 playstation move offers the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.360
 appropriate hardware but optional 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.190
 Finally, the choice is the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.230
 controllers still a matter of taste 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.510
 So we will consider this category as one 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.510
 deserved draw 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.750
 after the pr disaster on the e3 has 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.560
 Microsoft will be online again 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.019
 given up 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.579
 So the xbox does not have to be all 24 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.680
 hours once with the internet 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.450
 be connected and used bought 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.620
 should play and suddenly without 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.049
 be usable fee 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.150
 The same applies to the ps4, too 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.230
 works old fashioned offline 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.730
 but of course you can 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.709
 not all the great internet 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.269
 knickknack use both sony as 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.700
 also microsoft put on an abo 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.040
 service xbox live and playstation bare 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.200
 will cost just under 50 euros a year and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.909
 in addition to the usual online gaming some 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.470
 offer cool additional functions 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.939
 on both consoles you can 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.650
 for example, your best game scenes 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.689
 Record and share them online with yours 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.549
 friends or the whole world 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.409
 Of course, both consoles blu 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.810
 ray films and music play and 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.609
 show pictures a big difference 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.470
 However, the xbox one is in the 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.930
 contrary to ps4 on tv channels 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.859
 streams total end of this category 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.859
 thus with one 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.320
 undecided for both nextgen consoles 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.750
 have already been numerous exclusive 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.790
 games announced during sony with cheese 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.360
 and shadow of all drive works deep down 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.900
 the order tsx and information office 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.440
 Microsoft wants to score points on 5453 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.120
 scranton break and dead rising 3 as well 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.890
 the support from the publisher 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.050
 and the indie developer at both 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.550
 consoles is equally big and 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.650
 Microsoft's regional lock 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.180
 has given up now also ends 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:58.860
 This comparison with a brief but 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:00.690
 drew undecided because the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.880
 Consoles are said to still exist in this world 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.570
 probably in november on the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.959
 market come 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.330
 however, the ps4 will be 399 euros and 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.490
 100 euros less than the xbox one 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.709
 cost and synonymous with sony 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:19.680
 Camera still needs to be bought separately 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:20.669
 this point clearly to the ps4 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.560
 So we together 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.810
 the playstation 4 wins in the rubric 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.520
 hardware and technology as well as the price 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.530
 at the controller and the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.030
 control options and at the 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.280
 play and the multimedia features 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.150
 fights the xbox whereas one 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.770
 draw 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.690
 Thus , the winner in ours 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.780
 nextgen consoles comparison despite 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.260
 microsoft changed online politics 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.510
 playstation 4 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.520
 Let's see if microsoft this residue 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.270
 until the release of the two consoles yet 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.270
 can catch up
