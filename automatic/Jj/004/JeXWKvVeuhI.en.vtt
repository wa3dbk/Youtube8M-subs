00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the pros of these headphones are the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.650 
the pros of these headphones are the
fact<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.529> block<00:00:31.980> noise<00:00:32.219> oh<00:00:32.450> now<00:00:33.450> they

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
fact that they block noise oh now they

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.100 
fact that they block noise oh now they
do<00:00:33.719> use<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> battery<00:00:35.420> when<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> turn<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:37.020> you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
do use a battery when you turn when you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.770 
do use a battery when you turn when you
charge<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> battery<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.739> turn<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.190> it

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
charge the battery and turn it on it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.080 
charge the battery and turn it on it
blocks<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.989> pretty<00:00:40.290> much<00:00:40.379> every<00:00:40.920> noise<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
blocks out pretty much every noise that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.959 
blocks out pretty much every noise that
you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:43.370> when<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.460> lifting<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you can think of when I'm lifting in the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.600 
you can think of when I'm lifting in the
gym<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.379> can't<00:00:46.649> hear<00:00:46.860> anything<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.489> I'm

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
gym like I can't hear anything like I'm

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.209 
gym like I can't hear anything like I'm
completely<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.379> own<00:00:49.530> world<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:50.100> own

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
completely just in my own world my own

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.610 
completely just in my own world my own
element<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:51.420> you're<00:00:51.719> thinking<00:00:52.110> what<00:00:52.320> happens

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
element now you're thinking what happens

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.619 
element now you're thinking what happens
when<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.770> battery<00:00:52.920> runs<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> well<00:00:54.239> when<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
when the battery runs it well when the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.500 
when the battery runs it well when the
battery<00:00:54.899> runs<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:57.090> earbuds

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
battery runs out that the earbuds

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.779 
battery runs out that the earbuds
themselves<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.789> self

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
themselves are actually self

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
themselves are actually self
noise-canceling<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:01.260> they're<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
noise-canceling now they're not going to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.240 
noise-canceling now they're not going to
be<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.359> noise<00:01:03.359> cancelling<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.129> with<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
be as noise cancelling as with the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.080 
be as noise cancelling as with the
battery<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.909> it's<00:01:06.479> still<00:01:06.840> noise<00:01:07.680> cancelling

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
battery but it's still noise cancelling

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.609 
battery but it's still noise cancelling
so<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.240> work<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> without<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so they do work with and without the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.560 
so they do work with and without the
battery<00:01:10.799> another<00:01:11.369> pro<00:01:11.670> would<00:01:11.850> definitely<00:01:12.299> be

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
battery another pro would definitely be

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.200 
battery another pro would definitely be
the<00:01:12.840> quality<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> cord<00:01:13.790> first<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:15.000> old

the quality of the cord first my old

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.990 
the quality of the cord first my old
headphones<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> 20s<00:01:16.460> but<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.700> cord

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
headphones are a 20s but the cord

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.480 
headphones are a 20s but the cord
quality<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.320> big<00:01:19.560> improvement<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
quality is a big improvement it's a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.990 
quality is a big improvement it's a
little<00:01:20.729> stiffer<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.490> feels

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
little stiffer but like it's it's feels

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.560 
little stiffer but like it's it's feels
much<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:25.520> stronger<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.970> number<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.360> thing

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

apple headphones probably hidden another

thing<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.760> really<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.120> about<00:02:56.150> these

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
thing I really like about these

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.520 
thing I really like about these
headphones<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:56.959> fact<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.380> comes

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
headphones is the fact that it comes

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.890 
headphones is the fact that it comes
with<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.709> remote<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.280> being<00:02:58.519> said<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.390> really

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
with a remote that being said it really

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.240 
with a remote that being said it really
makes<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.230> difference<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.890> fact<00:03:01.100> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
makes a difference for the fact that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.180 
makes a difference for the fact that
these<00:03:01.730> headphones<00:03:02.360> come<00:03:02.900> with<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.049> battery<00:03:03.440> so

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
these headphones come with a battery so

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.070 
these headphones come with a battery so
like<00:03:04.640> instead<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.239> carrying<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.750> battery

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
like instead of carrying the battery

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.830 
like instead of carrying the battery
around<00:03:06.350> let<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.709> dangle<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:08.480> stick<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:08.750> your

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
around let it dangle just stick in your

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.600 
around let it dangle just stick in your
pocket<00:03:08.900> user<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.500> moment<00:03:09.860> I'd<00:03:10.010> say<00:03:10.250> for<00:03:10.489> me

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
pocket user a moment I'd say for me

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.560 
pocket user a moment I'd say for me
that's<00:03:10.790> probably<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.209> biggest<00:03:11.390> difference

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
that's probably the biggest difference

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.470 
that's probably the biggest difference
in<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.650> gym<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.640> fact<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.000> has<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.209> remote

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
in the gym is the fact that has a remote

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
on where you go I do think that they are

on where you go I do think that they are
worth<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.739> price<00:04:11.950> after<00:04:12.340> trying<00:04:12.580> them<00:04:12.849> like<00:04:13.569> I

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
worth the price after trying them like I

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.150 
worth the price after trying them like I
said<00:04:13.840> in<00:04:13.930> my<00:04:14.019> previous<00:04:14.440> video<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.069> high

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
said in my previous video in the high

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.870 
said in my previous video in the high
twenties<00:04:15.700> uh

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
twenties uh

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.300 
twenties uh
like<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.479> said<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.530> was<00:04:17.650> never<00:04:17.769> gonna<00:04:17.950> get<00:04:18.130> them

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
like I said I was never gonna get them

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.879 
like I said I was never gonna get them
but<00:04:18.579> after<00:04:19.049> getting<00:04:20.049> them<00:04:20.169> and<00:04:20.290> hearing<00:04:20.769> them

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
but after getting them and hearing them

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.800 
but after getting them and hearing them
I<00:04:21.070> do<00:04:21.370> think<00:04:21.639> they<00:04:21.760> are<00:04:21.880> worth<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.150> price<00:04:22.270> I

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
I do think they are worth the price I

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.629 
I do think they are worth the price I
mean<00:04:23.260> if<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.500> guys<00:04:23.590> are<00:04:23.770> on<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:23.860> budget<00:04:24.100> like

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
mean if you guys are on a budget like

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.400 
mean if you guys are on a budget like
the<00:04:25.090> high<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:25.270> twenties<00:04:25.750> are<00:04:26.050> almost

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
the high you twenties are almost

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.940 
the high you twenties are almost
identical<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:27.389> sound<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:29.500> these<00:04:29.710> headphones

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
identical in sound to these headphones

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.800 
identical in sound to these headphones
what's<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.000> difference<00:04:31.300> between<00:04:31.419> these<00:04:31.660> and

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
what's the difference between these and

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.200 
what's the difference between these and
the<00:04:31.870> IE<00:04:32.050> twenties<00:04:32.530> I<00:04:32.919> would<00:04:33.490> say<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.970> biggest

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
the IE twenties I would say the biggest

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.659 
the IE twenties I would say the biggest
difference<00:04:34.389> between<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.710> two<00:04:35.950> headphones<00:04:36.460> is

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
difference between the two headphones is

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.250 
difference between the two headphones is
the<00:04:37.360> fact<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:37.660> these<00:04:37.810> have<00:04:38.020> noise

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
the fact that these have noise

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.820 
the fact that these have noise

cancelling this specific model has the

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.000 
cancelling this specific model has the
remote<00:04:42.669> now<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.000> can<00:04:43.419> get<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:44.110> remote<00:04:44.680> on<00:04:44.889> my

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
remote now you can get a remote on my

remote now you can get a remote on my
e5e<00:04:45.490> funds<00:04:45.940> also<00:04:46.660> affect<00:04:47.139> the<00:04:47.260> cord<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.710> cord

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
e5e funds also affect the cord the cord

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.700 
e5e funds also affect the cord the cord
is<00:04:48.160> probably<00:04:49.120> dramatically<00:04:49.870> thicker<00:04:50.200> on<00:04:50.470> this

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
is probably dramatically thicker on this

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.680 
is probably dramatically thicker on this
version<00:04:50.979> it's<00:04:51.400> it's<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.880> little<00:04:52.090> stiff<00:04:52.419> so<00:04:52.630> I'll

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
version it's it's a little stiff so I'll

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.850 
version it's it's a little stiff so I'll
take<00:04:52.810> a<00:04:52.870> little<00:04:52.990> while<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.289> get<00:04:53.590> used<00:04:53.800> to

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
take a little while to get used to

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.779 
take a little while to get used to
whereas<00:04:54.729> my<00:04:55.020> 20s<00:04:56.020> it<00:04:56.590> was<00:04:56.620> just<00:04:57.250> blue

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
whereas my 20s it was just blue

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.270 
whereas my 20s it was just blue
would<00:04:58.030> I<00:04:58.060> recommend<00:04:58.240> these<00:04:58.570> headphones<00:04:59.280> price
