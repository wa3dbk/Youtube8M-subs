we're going to establish a smooth seat

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.479 
we're going to establish a smooth seat
and<00:00:38.410> all<00:00:38.530> we're<00:00:38.650> going<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.800> do<00:00:38.950> is<00:00:39.100> drive<00:00:39.340> it

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
and all we're going to do is drive it

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.620 
and all we're going to do is drive it
against<00:00:39.700> this<00:00:39.850> wheel<00:00:40.090> and<00:00:40.120> spin<00:00:40.570> it<00:00:40.690> around

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.369 

that's<00:00:44.050> all<00:00:44.200> you<00:00:44.320> need

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
and then we're going to look at the top

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.340 
and then we're going to look at the top
of<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.879> valve<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:47.420> make<00:00:47.870> sure<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:48.230> the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
of the valve and make sure that the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.920 
of the valve and make sure that the
grind<00:00:48.680> hash<00:00:48.980> marks<00:00:49.460> are<00:00:49.760> across<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.570> whole

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
grind hash marks are across the whole

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.509 
grind hash marks are across the whole
top<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.320> valve<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:51.890> this<00:00:52.039> thing<00:00:52.280> looks

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
top of the valve so this thing looks

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.319 
top of the valve so this thing looks
pretty<00:00:52.760> smooth<00:00:54.640> we're<00:00:55.640> going<00:00:55.789> to<00:00:55.850> do<00:00:55.969> here<00:00:56.180> is

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
pretty smooth we're going to do here is

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.880 
pretty smooth we're going to do here is
we're<00:00:56.600> just<00:00:56.629> gonna<00:00:56.839> stick<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:57.260> valve<00:00:57.469> in<00:00:57.739> our

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
we're just gonna stick the valve in our

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.639 
we're just gonna stick the valve in our
little<00:00:58.159> device<00:00:58.489> here<00:00:59.329> with<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.600> rubber<00:00:59.899> boot<00:01:00.140> to

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
little device here with a rubber boot to

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:01.930 
little device here with a rubber boot to
make<00:01:00.800> sure<00:01:00.949> that<00:01:01.070> none<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.370> grit<00:01:01.579> gets<00:01:01.790> in

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
make sure that none of the grit gets in

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.889 
make sure that none of the grit gets in
there<00:01:02.089> okay

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
there okay

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.330 
there okay
we're<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> tighten<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.890> down

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.620 

we're<00:01:09.760> going<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:09.940> take<00:01:10.090> our<00:01:10.240> little<00:01:10.360> oil

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
we're going to take our little oil

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.150 
we're going to take our little oil
squirter<00:01:10.990> here<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.530> make<00:01:11.770> sure<00:01:11.800> that<00:01:12.040> it's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
squirter here and make sure that it's

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.970 
squirter here and make sure that it's
actually<00:01:12.570> gonna<00:01:13.570> hit<00:01:14.260> the<00:01:14.380> valve<00:01:14.620> we're<00:01:14.890> gonna

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
actually gonna hit the valve we're gonna

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.330 
actually gonna hit the valve we're gonna
bring<00:01:15.220> our<00:01:15.370> machine<00:01:15.700> in

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
bring our machine in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.630 
bring our machine in
and<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:18.030> kind<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> set<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:20.369> where<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
and just kind of set it up to where the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.530 
and just kind of set it up to where the
valve<00:01:20.880> will<00:01:21.210> barely<00:01:21.770> what<00:01:22.770> kind<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.040> okay<00:01:23.790> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
valve will barely what kind of okay so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600 
valve will barely what kind of okay so
that<00:01:24.689> when<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.960> comes<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.439> we've<00:01:26.220> got<00:01:26.250> room

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that when this comes up we've got room

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.830 
that when this comes up we've got room
to<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.880> back<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> forth

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.819 

so<00:01:32.350> we're<00:01:32.440> gonna<00:01:32.530> bring<00:01:32.770> it<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.010> kinda<00:01:33.460> close

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.440 

somewhat<00:01:36.549> close<00:01:36.759> we're<00:01:36.969> going<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.149> turn<00:01:37.270> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
somewhat close we're going to turn the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.149 
somewhat close we're going to turn the
machine<00:01:37.539> on<00:01:37.799> we're<00:01:38.799> going<00:01:38.920> to<00:01:38.979> turn<00:01:39.070> our

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
machine on we're going to turn our

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.480 
machine on we're going to turn our
cutting<00:01:39.460> wheel<00:01:39.609> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
cutting wheel on

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.130 
cutting wheel on
then<00:01:41.850> we're<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> turn<00:01:42.270> our<00:01:42.329> oil<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.900> and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
then we're going to turn our oil on and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.410 
then we're going to turn our oil on and
make<00:01:43.290> sure<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.530> want<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> oil

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.970 

we're<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.780> bring<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.260 

and<00:01:52.100> we're<00:01:52.250> going<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:52.430> slowly<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.210> surely

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
and we're going to slowly but surely

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.390 
and we're going to slowly but surely
bring<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.050> cutting<00:01:54.380> wheel<00:01:54.530> in<00:01:54.770> closer<00:01:55.130> and

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
bring the cutting wheel in closer and

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.990 
bring the cutting wheel in closer and
closer<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.470> we<00:01:57.620> establish<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.460> time<00:01:58.730> and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
closer and so we establish a time and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.030 
closer and so we establish a time and
when<00:01:59.210> we<00:01:59.300> start<00:01:59.570> hearing<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.990> cut<00:02:00.200> you're

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
when we start hearing the cut you're

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.510 
when we start hearing the cut you're
going<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.280> move<00:02:01.400> the<00:02:01.550> machine

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
going to move the machine

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.529 
going to move the machine
you<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.820> want<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.030> take<00:02:03.149> off<00:02:03.329> too<00:02:03.509> much

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
you don't want to take off too much

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.690 
you don't want to take off too much
material

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.240 

so<00:02:08.330> we're<00:02:08.599> touching<00:02:08.840> now

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.100 

now<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:15.910> valve<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.360> little<00:02:16.600> wobbly<00:02:16.810> you

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
now this valve is a little wobbly you

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.300 
now this valve is a little wobbly you
can<00:02:17.260> hear<00:02:17.440> by<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.590> cut<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.040> we're<00:02:18.130> going<00:02:18.250> to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
can hear by the cut so we're going to

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.290 
can hear by the cut so we're going to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
clean the valve off and we want to check

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.630 
clean the valve off and we want to check
for<00:02:44.560> any<00:02:45.360> scratch<00:02:46.360> marks<00:02:46.900> its<00:02:47.500> cuts<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.549> heap

so we're gonna go ahead and do this to
all<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.379> valves<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.280> she<00:02:57.790> wants<00:02:58.030> after

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
all the valves and she wants after

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.780 
all the valves and she wants after
grinding<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> valve<00:02:59.290> you<00:03:00.130> do<00:03:00.370> want<00:03:00.579> to<00:03:00.640> make

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
grinding the valve you do want to make

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.910 
grinding the valve you do want to make
sure<00:03:00.849> that<00:03:01.269> as<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.810> can<00:03:01.900> see<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.170> don't<00:03:02.739> know

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
right there there's a little margin the

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.729 
right there there's a little margin the
area<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.510> right<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.959> where<00:03:10.110> we've<00:03:10.319> grinded

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
area to the right of where we've grinded

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.610 
area to the right of where we've grinded
where<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.610> valve<00:03:11.849> has<00:03:12.120> another<00:03:12.480> angle<00:03:12.989> see

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
where the valve has another angle see

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.729 
where the valve has another angle see
that<00:03:13.799> 30<00:03:14.069> degree<00:03:14.400> angle<00:03:14.700> then<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.299> 45<00:03:15.810> then<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> 60

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
that 30 degree angle then a 45 then a 60

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.100 
that 30 degree angle then a 45 then a 60
degree<00:03:16.829> there's<00:03:17.430> three<00:03:17.730> angles<00:03:18.090> there<00:03:18.269> so

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
degree there's three angles there so

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.050 
degree there's three angles there so
this<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.500> good<00:03:19.709> cut<00:03:19.980> this<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.519> clean<00:03:20.790> cut

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060

you

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
you

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.930 
you
focus<00:03:35.280> in<00:03:35.519> on<00:03:35.700> it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
as you can see all we have is our sixty

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.480 
as you can see all we have is our sixty
degree<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:42.060> our<00:03:42.180> 45<00:03:42.690> degree<00:03:43.050> but<00:03:44.040> we<00:03:44.130> have<00:03:44.310> no

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
degree and our 45 degree but we have no

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.610 
degree and our 45 degree but we have no
margin<00:03:44.730> left<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.240> the<00:03:45.360> valve<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:46.080> this<00:03:46.320> valve

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
margin left on the valve so this valve

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.550 
margin left on the valve so this valve
is<00:03:46.890> toast

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
is toast

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.100 
is toast
you<00:03:49.560> cannot<00:03:49.890> reuse<00:03:50.100> this<00:03:50.580> valve<00:03:50.990> all<00:03:51.990> right

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
you cannot reuse this valve all right

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.360 
you cannot reuse this valve all right
it's<00:03:52.380> just<00:03:52.440> one<00:03:52.650> thing<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:52.860> wanted<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.100> show<00:03:53.310> you

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
that after we going to your valves you

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.360 
that after we going to your valves you
just<00:03:55.410> want<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.620> make<00:03:55.740> sure<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.280> don't

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
that you do have a margin left on the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.350 
that you do have a margin left on the
other<00:04:01.380> side<00:04:01.740> because<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.160> is<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:03.300> is

necessary for the doll to work properly

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.250 
necessary for the doll to work properly
and<00:04:05.730> also<00:04:06.270> make<00:04:06.420> sure<00:04:06.450> not<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.810> cut<00:04:06.930> too<00:04:07.230> much
