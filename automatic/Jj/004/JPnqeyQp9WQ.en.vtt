System is nice and I recommend a in

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.890 
System is nice and I recommend a in

annual Park pass for these state parks
like<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.109> one<00:02:26.230> I'm<00:02:26.349> in<00:02:26.499> here<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.829> Birch<00:02:27.040> Bay

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
like the one I'm in here in Birch Bay

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.890 
like the one I'm in here in Birch Bay
because<00:02:28.120> if<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
because if you

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.490 
because if you
by<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.140> day<00:02:29.500> ten<00:02:30.459> bucks<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.819> day<00:02:31.030> or<00:02:31.500> thirty

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
by the day ten bucks a day or thirty

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.140 
by the day ten bucks a day or thirty
bucks<00:02:32.739> for<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> whole<00:02:33.220> year<00:02:33.250> which<00:02:33.700> i<00:02:33.849> think<00:02:33.909> is

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
bucks for a whole year which i think is

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.059 
bucks for a whole year which i think is
a<00:02:34.180> lot<00:02:34.330> more<00:02:34.480> sensible<00:02:34.959> considering<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.709> our

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
a lot more sensible considering that our

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.470 
a lot more sensible considering that our
viewers<00:02:36.340> are<00:02:36.459> always<00:02:36.819> popping<00:02:37.060> into<00:02:37.360> these

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
viewers are always popping into these

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.360 
viewers are always popping into these
places<00:02:37.659> all<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.080> time<00:02:38.110> but<00:02:38.830> it's<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.129> the<00:02:39.220> day

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
places all the time but it's for the day

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.420 
places all the time but it's for the day
or<00:02:39.760> or<00:02:40.569> uh<00:02:40.599> or<00:02:40.989> whatnot<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.980> course<00:02:42.190> there's<00:02:42.340> a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
or or uh or whatnot of course there's a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.550 
or or uh or whatnot of course there's a
overnight<00:02:43.239> fee<00:02:43.690> that's<00:02:43.900> separate<00:02:44.379> for

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
overnight fee that's separate for

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.710 
overnight fee that's separate for
camping<00:02:44.980> which<00:02:45.159> this<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.970> very<00:02:46.329> very

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
camping which this is very very

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.190 
camping which this is very very
inundated<00:02:47.409> by<00:02:47.440> Canadian<00:02:48.069> RVs<00:02:48.549> which<00:02:49.200> makes

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
inundated by Canadian RVs which makes

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.770 
inundated by Canadian RVs which makes
sense<00:02:50.379> because<00:02:50.530> we're<00:02:50.799> probably<00:02:51.579> about<00:02:51.819> five

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
sense because we're probably about five

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.809 
sense because we're probably about five
miles<00:02:53.019> from<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.530> Canadian<00:02:53.799> border<00:02:54.220> right<00:02:54.790> now

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
miles from the Canadian border right now

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.360 
miles from the Canadian border right now
so<00:02:55.569> keep<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:55.959> mind<00:02:56.079> how<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.470> popular

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
so keep that in mind how the popular

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.970 
so keep that in mind how the popular
these<00:02:57.519> border<00:02:58.000> parks<00:02:58.930> are<00:02:59.170> if<00:02:59.650> you're<00:02:59.860> gonna

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
these border parks are if you're gonna

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.369
