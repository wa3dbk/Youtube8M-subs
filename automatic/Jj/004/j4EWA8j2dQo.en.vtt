00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.629 

okay<00:00:00.930> here's<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.290> tutorial<00:00:01.439> on<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.340> molecule

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
okay here's the tutorial on the molecule

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.050 
okay here's the tutorial on the molecule
crack<00:00:03.319> that's<00:00:04.319> what<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.650> looks<00:00:04.830> like<00:00:05.060> it's

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
crack that's what that looks like it's

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.730 
crack that's what that looks like it's
definitely<00:00:06.509> one<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.899> more<00:00:07.259> advanced

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
definitely one of the more advanced

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.180 
definitely one of the more advanced
false<00:00:08.130> cuts<00:00:08.460> but<00:00:09.800> it's<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.920> really

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
false cuts but it's a really

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.879 
false cuts but it's a really
good-looking<00:00:11.370> one<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.929> prerequisite<00:00:13.769> to

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
good-looking one so a prerequisite to

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.279 
good-looking one so a prerequisite to
this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.400> knowing<00:00:14.730> how<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.540> deck<00:00:16.020> flip

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
this is knowing how to do the deck flip

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.820 
this is knowing how to do the deck flip
so<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.670> made<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> video<00:00:18.300> teaching<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.230> while

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
so I made a video teaching that a while

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.320 
so I made a video teaching that a while
back<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.340> can<00:00:20.430> check<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> link<00:00:20.970> here<00:00:21.150> I

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
back so you can check the link here I

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.900 
back so you can check the link here I
also<00:00:22.020> put<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> link<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.740> description<00:00:22.910> so

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
also put a link in the description so

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.540 
also put a link in the description so
you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.060> check<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.330> whenever<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.840> want<00:00:24.990> so

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
you can check that whenever you want so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.620 
you can check that whenever you want so
okay<00:00:26.550> let's<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.150> before<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
okay let's get into this before the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.870 
okay let's get into this before the
first<00:00:27.840> part<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.380> doing<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.010> move<00:00:30.439> okay<00:00:31.880> it's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
first part is doing this move okay it's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.979 
first part is doing this move okay it's
kind<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> Sybil<00:00:35.719> if<00:00:36.719> it

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
kind of it's a lot like a Sybil if it

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.930 
kind of it's a lot like a Sybil if it
feels<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> Sybil<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.760> kind

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
feels a lot like a Sybil but it's kind

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.150 
feels a lot like a Sybil but it's kind
of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> reverse<00:00:39.570> motion<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.129> doing

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
of the reverse motion so what I'm doing

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
of the reverse motion so what I'm doing
is<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> break<00:00:42.890> above<00:00:44.390> maybe<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> bottom

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
is I get a break above maybe the bottom

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.470 
is I get a break above maybe the bottom
third<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.590> deck<00:00:47.180> something<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
third of the deck something like that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
third of the deck something like that
and<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.950> first<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.730> is

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and the first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.750 
and the first thing I'm going to do is
whoops<00:00:51.449> my<00:00:51.809> camera<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.350> shifted<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.550> first

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
whoops my camera just shifted the first

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.840 
whoops my camera just shifted the first
thing<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:53.969> I'm<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.920> Z

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
thing that I'm going to do is get this Z

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.729 
thing that I'm going to do is get this Z
formation<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> what<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.809> call<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> okay<00:00:58.680> so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
formation is what they call it okay so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.209 
formation is what they call it okay so
it<00:00:58.859> looks<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.750> now<00:01:00.750> normally<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.890> do

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
it looks like this now normally you do

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.100 
it looks like this now normally you do
the<00:01:02.340> Z<00:01:02.489> formation<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> Sybil<00:01:03.510> cut<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the Z formation for the Sybil cut and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
the Z formation for the Sybil cut and
when<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.350> do<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.700> this<00:01:05.700> milla<00:01:06.000> pack<00:01:06.270> is

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
when you do that this milla pack is

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.880 
when you do that this milla pack is
gripped<00:01:06.780> between<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.229> thumb<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> back

middle finger comes into play and this
is<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> come<00:01:47.310> down<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.820> break<00:01:48.180> off<00:01:48.390> half

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
is going to come down and break off half

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840 
is going to come down and break off half
of<00:01:48.780> those<00:01:48.869> cards<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:50.130> half<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.369> those<00:01:50.520> cards

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
of those cards about half of those cards

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.289 
of those cards about half of those cards
so<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.840> end<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.619> Z<00:01:53.270> right<00:01:56.210> okay<00:01:57.210> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
so you end up with a Z right okay so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.319 
so you end up with a Z right okay so
after<00:01:57.509> you've<00:01:57.780> done<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.670> your<00:01:59.670> left<00:01:59.969> first

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
after you've done that your left first

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.060 
after you've done that your left first
finger<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.750> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.930> contact<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.530> bottom<00:02:01.920> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
finger is going to contact the bottom of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.760 
finger is going to contact the bottom of
the<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.369> bottom<00:02:02.759> packet<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the very bottom packet and it's going to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.339 
the very bottom packet and it's going to
start<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.960> slide<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.140> up<00:02:08.479> okay

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
start to slide it up okay

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.860 
start to slide it up okay
and<00:02:11.249> once<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.640> clears<00:02:11.969> the<00:02:12.180> middle<00:02:12.450> packet

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and once it clears the middle packet

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.809 
and once it clears the middle packet
you're<00:02:13.499> going<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.739> lower<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.159> middle<00:02:14.310> packet

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
you're going to lower the middle packet

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.780 
you're going to lower the middle packet
and<00:02:14.999> then<00:02:15.959> let<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.560> packet<00:02:17.069> fall<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.549> top<00:02:17.730> of

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
and then let this packet fall on top of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.649 
and then let this packet fall on top of
it<00:02:18.090> out<00:02:18.780> Rock<00:02:19.430> okay

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
it out Rock okay

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.839 
it out Rock okay
then<00:02:21.659> with<00:02:22.049> these<00:02:22.439> cards<00:02:22.709> right<00:02:22.889> here<00:02:23.159> you're

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
then with these cards right here you're

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.270 
then with these cards right here you're
going<00:02:23.969> to<00:02:24.030> flip<00:02:24.239> them<00:02:24.450> over<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:24.989> I

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
going to flip them over like this I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.289 
going to flip them over like this I
don't<00:02:26.280> know<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.579> need<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.819> explain<00:02:27.120> that

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
don't know if I need to explain that

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.569 
don't know if I need to explain that
you're<00:02:27.719> kind<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.170> flipping<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.219> over<00:02:29.340> in

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
you're kind of just flipping it over in

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.759 
you're kind of just flipping it over in
this<00:02:29.700> direction<00:02:31.129> and<00:02:32.840> then<00:02:33.840> you're<00:02:34.379> letting

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
this direction and then you're letting

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.190 
this direction and then you're letting
them<00:02:35.189> flip<00:02:35.579> right<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.419> top<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.810> deck<00:02:36.989> so

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
them flip right on top of the deck so

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.349 
them flip right on top of the deck so
you<00:02:37.620> end<00:02:37.859> up<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.129> that<00:02:38.219> middle<00:02:38.400> packet<00:02:38.909> out

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
you end up with that middle packet out

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.959 
you end up with that middle packet out
dropped<00:02:40.129> then<00:02:41.129> your<00:02:41.310> right<00:02:41.459> hand<00:02:41.609> comes<00:02:41.819> over

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
dropped then your right hand comes over

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:43.819 
dropped then your right hand comes over
and<00:02:42.389> it's<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:42.689> going<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.900> pivot<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.530> middle

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
and it's just going to pivot this middle

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.330 
and it's just going to pivot this middle
packet<00:02:44.159> out<00:02:44.359> so<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.540> right<00:02:45.750> middle<00:02:46.049> finger

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
packet out so the right middle finger

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.649 
packet out so the right middle finger
contacts<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.400> left<00:02:47.609> edge<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.909> cards<00:02:48.239> and

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
contacts the left edge of the cards and

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.649 
contacts the left edge of the cards and
the<00:02:49.019> cards<00:02:49.319> will<00:02:49.530> pivot<00:02:49.829> around<00:02:50.389> the<00:02:51.389> left

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
the cards will pivot around the left

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.539 
the cards will pivot around the left
middle<00:02:51.870> finger<00:02:53.689> okay<00:02:55.189> once<00:02:56.189> they<00:02:56.340> clear

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
middle finger okay once they clear

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.830 
middle finger okay once they clear
you're<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.909> to<00:02:56.969> bring<00:02:57.150> these<00:02:57.329> cards<00:02:57.659> out

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
you're going to bring these cards out

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.709 
you're going to bring these cards out
and<00:02:58.099> what<00:02:59.099> I<00:02:59.129> do<00:02:59.219> is<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.489> just<00:02:59.519> tap<00:03:00.239> two<00:03:00.419> carts

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:00.719 
and what I do is I just tap two carts

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.020 
and what I do is I just tap two carts
because<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.590> tap<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:02.189> left<00:03:02.400> edge<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:02.730> cards

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
because I tap the left edge of the cards

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.770 
because I tap the left edge of the cards
just<00:03:03.629> across<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.109> center<00:03:04.409> of<00:03:04.859> this<00:03:05.549> packet<00:03:05.939> it

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
just across the center of this packet it

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.539 
just across the center of this packet it
just<00:03:06.989> kind<00:03:07.199> of<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.739> gives<00:03:07.889> that<00:03:07.980> flourish<00:03:08.430> a

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
just kind of it gives that flourish a

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.720 
just kind of it gives that flourish a
good<00:03:08.730> feel<00:03:08.909> to<00:03:08.939> it<00:03:09.980> after<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.010> do<00:03:11.099> that<00:03:11.459> tap

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
good feel to it after I do that tap

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.780 
good feel to it after I do that tap
that's<00:03:12.689> when<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.230> deck<00:03:13.439> flip<00:03:13.699> so<00:03:14.699> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
that's when I do the deck flip so the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.149 
that's when I do the deck flip so the
deck<00:03:15.000> flip<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.479> it's<00:03:15.989> going<00:03:16.199> to<00:03:16.259> flip<00:03:17.040> around

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
deck flip is it's going to flip around

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.059 
deck flip is it's going to flip around
flip<00:03:17.729> around<00:03:18.030> flip<00:03:18.329> around<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.799> it's<00:03:19.979> going

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
flip around flip around and it's going

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.129 
flip around flip around and it's going
to<00:03:20.129> land<00:03:20.569> right<00:03:21.569> on<00:03:21.629> top<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.049> these<00:03:22.259> cards<00:03:24.139> okay

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
to land right on top of these cards okay

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.610 
to land right on top of these cards okay
so<00:03:25.979> when<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.879> do<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> deck<00:03:27.329> flip<00:03:27.569> you<00:03:27.959> need<00:03:28.500> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
so when you do the deck flip you need to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.149 
so when you do the deck flip you need to
make<00:03:28.769> sure<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:29.189> raise<00:03:30.060> your<00:03:30.389> right<00:03:30.780> thumb<00:03:31.109> to

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
make sure to raise your right thumb to

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.710 
make sure to raise your right thumb to
give<00:03:32.159> clearance<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.879> these<00:03:33.030> cards<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.540> land

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
give clearance to these cards to land

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.330 
give clearance to these cards to land
right<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:33.930> top<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:36.019> that's<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.379> molecule<00:03:37.919> cut<00:03:38.129> I

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
right on top and that's a molecule cut I

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.760 
right on top and that's a molecule cut I
hope<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.120> guys<00:03:39.239> like<00:03:39.449> that<00:03:39.599> bye
