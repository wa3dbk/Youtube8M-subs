00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.859
 Hi people 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.330
 today I will be teaching for you in 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.210
 It's true, it's a joke. 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.210
 the game of the 21 as well as a game of 21 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:27.470
 that do not repeat each letter is unique and 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.470
 different 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.620
 so I'll guess by playing with 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 another person the letter she chose 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.710
 mentally like that 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.370
 Come on, you're going to make three piles of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.370
 priest 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.360
 in loads 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.260
 I have to record and make the game more 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.260
 committed 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:41.039
 even before choosing and choosing 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:13.950
 because the secret in this is the letter 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.950
 chosen you will leave none 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.110
 two more times 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.400
 the person is not going to tell you what the letter is 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:03:07.160
 will tell you which column the letter is 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:07.160
 is at first will not tell you with the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:25.820
 which is the end of the column the first time 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.820
 Monday 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:07.440
 very fun play can 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.330
 play with whoever you want to leave 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:27.290
 crazy to know the secret of 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:27.290
 low game 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:05:12.430
 ready made 13 now I'll count from one to 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:05:17.919
 today at 11 you look closer 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:21.690
 always remembering that it does not let you 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.690
 go get the column
