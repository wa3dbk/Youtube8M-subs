00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.849
 first we need to make a cake 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.920
 of vanilla and other chocolate 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.400
 we will start preparing the mixture of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.400
 vanilla 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.270
 using piro king products 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 we incorporate the flour 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:30.339
 a cup of water 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.339
 eggs and finally butter 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.030
 now friends we mix the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 ingredients until they remain 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.190
 perfectly incorporated 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.969
 later we prepare of equal 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.969
 way our chocolate mix 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.440
 Now it's time to empty our 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.810
 mixtures in a refractory mold 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.610
 previously greased to save 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.410
 time and facilitate your work you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.940
 We recommend using this practice 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.340
 where the rectangular but king with 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.200
 division which allows you to bake two 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.200
 different dishes at the same time 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.030
 We take the refractory to the oven to a 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.410
 temperature of 180 degrees for a time 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.410
 Approximate 30 minutes 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 Once the cakes are ready, we leave them 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.800
 cool and cut them into boxes 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.830
 little ones 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.660
 now we fit in a candy store the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.660
 Pieces of cake forming a layer 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.990
 later we incorporate a layer of 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.350
 mousse our squares of 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.350
 cake 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.470
 now we add a layer of fruit of your 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.990
 How are these delicious strawberries? 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.360
 We recommend you use fresh fruit from 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.620
 season since it is usually the most 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.620
 sweet and also economic 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.489
 it is important to accommodate the fruit and 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.580
 whipped cream on the edges of 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.769
 transparency glass container 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.500
 I love the glass 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.420
 visual very nice and elegant 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.430
 Glass containers are ideal for 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.650
 these recipes since they do not transfer 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.480
 flavor to the food we continue the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.050
 process until you get to the top 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.960
 from your container 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.840
 and we have finished our dessert 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.700
