00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.910
 the first point nl is the digital platform for the waste sector of one 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.889
 exchange information easily and cheaply with other organizations 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.889
 in the chain 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.509
 the waste industry produces tens of millions of paper documents every year 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.560
 so on the day it was unclear how to list these legal transport documents 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.649
 receipts and invoices 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.420
 many of these documents for me thick in port for the administrative process 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.329
 from their own but also from other organizations in the chain 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 8 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.350
 handling the paper flow and then moderate data entry into the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.990
 systems is a few match intensive 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.220
 sensitive and often leads to a delay in the administrative process 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.050
 loss of data and up to longer waiting times 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.060
 for example at these locations 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.280
 Due to the manual process, administration costs for companies run high 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.000
 on 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.600
 invoices can only be sent much later 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 and are therefore paid later 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.760
 until recently, the paper shop was strictly necessary for administrative purposes 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.930
 process 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.750
 but also environmental legislation 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.480
 and enforcement on waste shipments required until recently a paper 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.370
 administration 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.550
 With the introduction of Bing Sterren.nl it is paper exchange and it 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.550
 manual transfer of data in the past 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.450
 Your software system is connected to that of the collectors carriers 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.979
 the brake on strokes and end users 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.090
 with that, who cares in a simple, reliable and inexpensive way 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.629
 way for the digitization and exchange of paperwork 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.449
 of course knows a partners 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.589
 that's how it works 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.589
 a waste shipment is made known to animals 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.839
 unique ai issued for every direction the netherlands fortuna 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.509
 has made a profit on cambuur in enforcement 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.509
 do what without driving a bellemare document 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.839
 the ride is then announced in the destination system 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:43.369
 in this way, a final processing will gain insight into which transport company will go when 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:44.789
 arrive 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.989
 Because all data is already known, the weighing can be performed immediately 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.579
 the software sends from the end has processed 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.729
 the ways to get to revenue automatically 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:01.119
 by the unique ai that will profit on the road comes automatically to the right ride 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.849
 to link 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.849
 and create in the system of the relevant collection 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.180
 on the invoice takes a moment but it is a way to the system 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.609
 collectors 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 there is processed automatically 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.389
 I knew there is a standard integration platform for sharing 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.099
 of data 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.129
 publishing information it is free of charge 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.139
 you do not have to invest in the development of expensive links 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.809
 you do not pay any subscription costs 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.459
 You only pay a small fee per transaction for information you provide 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.439
 actually used and saved money 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.359
 knew it has links with all common systems 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.439
 like waste race very beautiful 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:48.909
 neither and notes 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.620
 regularly it will develop new services that offer new opportunities 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.759
