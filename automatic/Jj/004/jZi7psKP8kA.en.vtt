00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.120
 in front of me is the brand new appliances the machine and chocolate milk 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.049
 to make 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.070
 the powerhouses you can handle no fewer than 28 different flavors and from 100 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 euro you already have a house 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.689
 especially now that we are 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.439
 the proud box of blues tel uses a fairly large herd 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.419
 capsules 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.419
 that for you in this way in the device 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.780
 of course you have to fill the water reservoir with water and then you can the moon 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.390
 put down 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.290
 to blink in it 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.090
 that indicates 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.720
 they are the warming substances not what the elements of warming up 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.210
 is 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.760
 this takes around 29 seconds 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.550
 bm ready but also not entirely 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.420
 you first have to set how much water the trick has for the press 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.110
 to become 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.560
 you have to do this with the spinning world 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.550
 and the amount is then indicated by the number of dashes on 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.700
 the device 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.150
 so the first question that comes up is how did edine ouail feel 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.690
 employ on wall street 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.640
 waalwijk each election council indicated as normal although complete water is ideal 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.630
 of course you can deviate from it to your own taste 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.360
 then you are ready to switch on 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.590
 by pressing the button on top 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.640
 it stands for hot water 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.750
 making coffee takes approximately 22 seconds 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.149
 it is a pity that it is quite a long time after the robot has been on this for almost a minute 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.040
 ready and then you get a cup of espresso and that is fine, it is almost 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.130
 indistinguishable from the heads special made from fresh beans 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.000
 if you want a cappuccino or a team for example 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.490
 and I not one but 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.840
 two clubs needed 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 each but its own government water 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.950
 that is nice for the taste not with such a beautiful rich 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.620
 but a little less pleasant for your wallet 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.520
 for sixteen clubs a tough online 5 euro that is 31 cents per cup of coffee 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.040
 for cappuccino or for a time that you leave you need two choices and 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.670
 that means you sneeze be 60 percent 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.630
 lost your head 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.380
 his total of 28 differences cup is for sale from an espresso to the ice cream part 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.269
 from chocolate milk to a sulking sinouh 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.900
 those clubs that aren't all in every store obtain it 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.900
 the easiest way is to order our online 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.799
 a disadvantage of the device is the water reservoir i can but it still with 6 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.969
 liters in ardoo constant water are topping up 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.109
 must say cleaning is very easy 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.419
 all parts are easy to remove and rinse with water 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.279
 flushing is also a bit off 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:42.629
 the whole experience of the device is very clean anyway ii would never be coffee 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.389
 on your hands on on the floor 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:48.859
 You live in a large family with people who all like it more often 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.609
 make a cup of coffee per day 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 then you better ignore this device because you already gave 5 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.019
 euros per day to cups 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.039
 conclusion 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.119
 four stars 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.790
 and me too
