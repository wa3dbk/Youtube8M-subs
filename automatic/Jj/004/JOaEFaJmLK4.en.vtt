00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi guys Nathan here today I'm going to

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.450 
hi guys Nathan here today I'm going to
be<00:00:03.240> talking<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.810> bit<00:00:03.840> about<00:00:04.140> linear<00:00:04.680> groups<00:00:05.130> and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
be talking a bit about linear groups and

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.639 
be talking a bit about linear groups and
one<00:00:06.029> in<00:00:06.120> particular<00:00:06.240> one<00:00:06.930> that<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> tend<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.500> use

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
one in particular one that I tend to use

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.160 
one in particular one that I tend to use
pretty<00:00:07.859> often<00:00:08.630> some<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.780> may<00:00:09.870> be<00:00:09.900> asking

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
pretty often some of you may be asking

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.020 
pretty often some of you may be asking
what<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.070> linear<00:00:11.280> group<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.820> what<00:00:11.910> are<00:00:11.969> you

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
what is a linear group like what are you

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.900 
what is a linear group like what are you
talking<00:00:12.330> about<00:00:12.450> what's<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.960> word<00:00:13.110> even<00:00:13.290> mean

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
talking about what's that word even mean

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.240 
talking about what's that word even mean
to<00:00:14.910> play<00:00:15.150> linear<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.839> simply<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.590> group<00:00:17.010> notes

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
to play linear is simply to group notes

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.730 
to play linear is simply to group notes
together<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.210> no<00:00:18.510> strokes<00:00:18.990> little<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.619> no

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
together so that no strokes little to no

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.090 
together so that no strokes little to no
strokes<00:00:20.130> overlap<00:00:21.140> so<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.470> trick<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.740> playing

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
strokes overlap so the trick to playing

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.580 
strokes overlap so the trick to playing
linear<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.689> make<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.990> linear<00:00:25.230> groove

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
linear and to make a linear groove

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.769 
linear and to make a linear groove
really<00:00:25.980> sound<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:26.939> grooving<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.660> lick

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
really sound like it's grooving and lick

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.750 
really sound like it's grooving and lick
it<00:00:27.810> back<00:00:28.019> actually<00:00:28.320> sound<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.099> usable

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
it back actually sound like it's usable

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.569 
it back actually sound like it's usable
in<00:00:29.910> context<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.529> trick<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.399> stay

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
in context the trick is really to stay

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.440 
in context the trick is really to stay
on<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> relevant<00:00:33.239> backbeat<00:00:33.829> which<00:00:34.829> means<00:00:35.450> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
on the relevant backbeat which means to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
on the relevant backbeat which means to
make<00:00:36.600> sure<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> snare<00:00:37.170> lands<00:00:37.649> within<00:00:37.890> its

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
make sure the snare lands within its

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.030 
make sure the snare lands within its
respective<00:00:38.760> pattern<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.770> playing

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
respective pattern so if you're playing

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.990 
respective pattern so if you're playing
standard<00:00:41.850> time<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> snare<00:00:44.129> lands<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.489> 2<00:00:44.640> &amp;<00:00:44.820> 4

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
standard time the snare lands on 2 &amp; 4

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
standard time the snare lands on 2 &amp; 4
of<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.329> bar<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.230> let's<00:00:46.649> work<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.070> setting

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
of the bar so let's work in this setting

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
of the bar so let's work in this setting
because<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.789> most<00:00:47.910> common<00:00:48.440> essentially

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
because this is most common essentially

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.080 
because this is most common essentially
we're<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.739> emulate<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.430> sixteenth<00:00:51.000> note

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
we're going to emulate a sixteenth note

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:06.350 
we're going to emulate a sixteenth note
hi-hat<00:00:51.600> groove<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.230> this<00:01:04.820> however<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.180> order

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
hi-hat groove like this however in order

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
hi-hat groove like this however in order
to<00:01:06.510> play<00:01:06.630> linear<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.799> break<00:01:07.979> up<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
to play linear we have to break up the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.920 
to play linear we have to break up the
limbs<00:01:08.460> which<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> easiest<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:09.689> sort<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
limbs which is easiest in some sort of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.200 
limbs which is easiest in some sort of
pattern<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.530> chose<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> number<00:01:11.670> three<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
pattern I chose the number three and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.539 
pattern I chose the number three and
since<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.810> only<00:01:13.020> multiplied<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.830> 15

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
since it can be only multiplied into 15

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.300 
since it can be only multiplied into 15
we<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> add<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.840> note<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.590> round<00:01:17.070> out<00:01:17.280> our

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
we have to add one note to round out our

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.390 
we have to add one note to round out our
even<00:01:17.759> count<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.060> 16<00:01:18.509> sixteenth<00:01:19.200> notes<00:01:19.470> which

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
even count of 16 sixteenth notes which

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.179 
even count of 16 sixteenth notes which
is<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> wrote<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.290> 16<00:01:22.290> sixteenth<00:01:22.920> notes

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
is what I wrote here 16 sixteenth notes

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.490 
is what I wrote here 16 sixteenth notes
of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> pattern<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.630> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of the pattern that we're about to do so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.410 
of the pattern that we're about to do so
we're<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.710> play<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.070> pattern<00:01:26.420> simply

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
we're gonna play this pattern simply

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.460 
we're gonna play this pattern simply
with<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> kick<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> snare<00:01:27.990> interest<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
with the kick and the snare interest to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.109 
with the kick and the snare interest to
get<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> overall<00:01:28.979> feel

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
get the overall feel

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.420 
get the overall feel
Katy<00:01:30.810> represents<00:01:31.229> kick<00:01:31.470> our<00:01:31.740> represents

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
Katy represents kick our represents

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.999 
Katy represents kick our represents
right<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:33.119> hand<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> L<00:01:33.960> represents<00:01:34.409> left

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
right right hand and L represents left

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:47.780 
right right hand and L represents left
hand

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.860 

then<00:01:48.790> make<00:01:49.000> sure<00:01:49.150> you've<00:01:49.300> mapped<00:01:49.510> out<00:01:49.720> which

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
then make sure you've mapped out which

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.460 
then make sure you've mapped out which
hand<00:01:50.260> gets<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.070> play<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.250> snare<00:01:51.400> respectively

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
hand gets to play the snare respectively

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.720 
hand gets to play the snare respectively
you<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.620> do<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:53.890> easily<00:01:54.100> by<00:01:54.250> counting

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
you can do this easily by counting

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.040 
you can do this easily by counting
sixteenths<00:01:55.300> so<00:01:56.050> one<00:01:56.500> E<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:56.770> two<00:01:57.490> E<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.450> three

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
sixteenths so one E and two E and three

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.110 
sixteenths so one E and two E and three
E<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.680> four<00:02:00.220> E<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.990> you<00:02:02.050> have<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.670> two<00:02:03.880> and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
E and four E and so you have the two and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.330 
E and four E and so you have the two and
for<00:02:04.390> land<00:02:04.930> on<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.260> right<00:02:05.470> hand<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.010> first

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
for land on the right hand on the first

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.920 
for land on the right hand on the first
half<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.000> left<00:02:07.210> hand<00:02:07.420> on<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.540> second

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
half and the left hand on the second

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.170 
half and the left hand on the second
half<00:02:08.020> now<00:02:08.920> try<00:02:09.190> placing<00:02:09.430> your<00:02:09.670> hands<00:02:09.910> on<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
half now try placing your hands on the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.060 
half now try placing your hands on the
high<00:02:10.330> hats<00:02:10.600> around<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.320> back<00:02:11.500> beats<00:02:11.770> like

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
high hats around the back beats like

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:24.050 
high hats around the back beats like
this
