00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820

think<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.270> coolest<00:02:33.420> thing<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.230> has<00:02:34.410> a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
think is the coolest thing it has a

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.650 
think is the coolest thing it has a
really<00:02:34.980> amazing<00:02:35.280> touch<00:02:35.760> keyboard<00:02:36.240> which<00:02:36.420> can

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
really amazing touch keyboard which can

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.090 
really amazing touch keyboard which can
change<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.230> you're<00:02:37.380> an<00:02:37.410> exhale<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.920> can

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
change so if you're an exhale you can

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.950 
change so if you're an exhale you can
change<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.490> like<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> numbers<00:02:39.060> keyboard<00:02:39.510> with

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
change to like a numbers keyboard with

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.630 
change to like a numbers keyboard with
percentages<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.770> ratios<00:02:40.800> that's<00:02:41.370> really

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
percentages and ratios that's really

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.540 
percentages and ratios that's really
cool<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.200> that's<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.250> think<00:02:44.280> they

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
cool and that is that's I think they

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.370 
cool and that is that's I think they
need<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:44.790> thing<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.150> work<00:02:45.480> applications<00:02:46.170> run

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.830 
mean it seems like a pretty solid device
I<00:03:47.070> won't<00:03:47.610> be<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.820> first<00:03:48.000> one<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.300> get<00:03:48.480> my<00:03:48.600> hands

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
I won't be the first one to get my hands

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.390 
I won't be the first one to get my hands
on<00:03:48.989> one<00:03:49.140> because<00:03:49.470> I'm<00:03:49.650> not<00:03:49.860> really<00:03:50.070> sure<00:03:50.220> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
on one because I'm not really sure I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.310 
on one because I'm not really sure I
want<00:03:50.550> it<00:03:50.970> yet<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.360> mean<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:51.600> looks<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:51.989> cool

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
want it yet I mean it looks like a cool

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.680 
want it yet I mean it looks like a cool
idea<00:03:52.470> but<00:03:52.940> who<00:03:53.940> really<00:03:54.090> knows<00:03:54.239> what<00:03:54.570> it'll

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
idea but who really knows what it'll

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.979 
idea but who really knows what it'll
turn<00:03:54.900> out<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:56.090> it's<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.180> revolutionary<00:03:57.780> I

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
turn out like it's a revolutionary I

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.680 
turn out like it's a revolutionary I
don't<00:03:58.230> think<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:59.250> think<00:04:00.090> it's<00:04:00.209> really<00:04:00.450> cool

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
don't think so I think it's really cool

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.100 
don't think so I think it's really cool
and<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.769> may<00:04:01.950> revolutionize<00:04:02.480> tablets<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.930> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
and it may revolutionize tablets in the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.020 
and it may revolutionize tablets in the
future<00:04:04.440> but<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:05.370> not<00:04:05.610> as<00:04:05.790> nothing

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
future but it's not as nothing

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.910 
future but it's not as nothing
groundbreaking<00:04:06.720> like<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.320> iPhone<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.769> mean

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920
