a<00:04:26.490> player<00:04:26.880> on<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.570> offensive<00:04:28.050> side<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.620> get<00:04:29.250> it

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
a player on the offensive side I get it

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.610 
a player on the offensive side I get it
I<00:04:29.550> understand<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.180> but<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:31.170> game<00:04:31.410> we've

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
I understand it but the game we've

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.560 
I understand it but the game we've
learned<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.100> play<00:04:32.250> it's<00:04:32.970> been<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> grueling

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
learned to play it's been a grueling

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.720 
learned to play it's been a grueling
physical<00:04:35.390> it's<00:04:36.390> okay<00:04:36.750> it<00:04:37.070> really<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.220> is<00:04:38.520> one

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
physical it's okay it really is is one

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.010 
physical it's okay it really is is one
of<00:04:38.820> those<00:04:38.910> is<00:04:39.210> one<00:04:39.450> of<00:04:39.510> those<00:04:39.660> games<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:39.930> you

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
of those is one of those games that you

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.940 
of those is one of those games that you
really<00:04:40.380> can't

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
really can't

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.570 
really can't
you<00:04:41.220> really<00:04:41.460> can't<00:04:42.380> cage<00:04:43.380> right<00:04:43.920> so<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.220> speak

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.600 
I think they're doing a smart thing and
the<00:04:48.300> right<00:04:48.720> thing<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.290> think<00:04:49.610> eventually

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
the right thing and I think eventually

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.640 
the right thing and I think eventually
