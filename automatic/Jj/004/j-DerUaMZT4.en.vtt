00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so when you actually the ground-level

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.120 
so when you actually the ground-level
thing<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.110> actually<00:02:16.260> first<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.800> into<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
thing is actually first you into the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.920 
thing is actually first you into the
near<00:02:17.280> top<00:02:17.490> room<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.270> no<00:02:18.690> make<00:02:18.840> an

from wearing goes either way there's

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.890 
from wearing goes either way there's
just<00:02:23.430> lots<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:24.000> fun<00:02:24.060> possibilities<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.840> this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
these all without limbs the cave system

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.949 
these all without limbs the cave system
there<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.370> lava<00:03:50.760> cave<00:03:51.239> systems<00:03:51.600> down<00:03:51.780> there

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
there is a lava cave systems down there

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.509 
there is a lava cave systems down there
hope<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.320> find<00:03:52.440> more<00:03:52.680> diamonds<00:03:53.100> just<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.370> case

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
hope you find more diamonds just in case

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.580 
hope you find more diamonds just in case
this<00:03:53.640> were<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.880> looking<00:03:54.030> for<00:03:54.110> over<00:03:55.110> here<00:03:55.290> you

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
yourself a safe for diamonds just over

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.690 
yourself a safe for diamonds just over
here<00:04:00.660> as<00:04:01.320> well<00:04:01.500> as<00:04:01.590> if<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.769> follow<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:02.280> along

here as well as if you follow just along
the<00:04:02.820> pathway<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.239> can<00:04:03.480> see<00:04:03.630> another<00:04:03.810> two

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
the pathway you can see another two

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.170 
the pathway you can see another two
diamonds<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:04.500> another<00:04:04.680> six<00:04:04.920> diamonds<00:04:05.180> really

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
diamonds so another six diamonds really

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.790 
diamonds so another six diamonds really
great<00:04:06.450> hall<00:04:06.630> as<00:04:06.840> well<00:04:06.870> as<00:04:07.110> this<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.440> one<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
great hall as well as this is one of the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.350 
great hall as well as this is one of the
cave<00:04:07.950> systems<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.430> believe<00:04:08.670> they<00:04:08.880> accidentally

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
cave systems I believe they accidentally

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.320 
cave systems I believe they accidentally
just<00:04:09.570> burrowed<00:04:10.049> into<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.670> finally<00:04:11.670> at<00:04:12.090> these

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
just burrowed into and finally at these

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.940 
just burrowed into and finally at these
corners<00:04:12.720> over<00:04:12.870> here<00:04:13.110> at<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.320> final<00:04:13.620> glowstone

in<00:04:25.050> this<00:04:25.200> case<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.500> guess<00:04:25.680> as<00:04:26.430> well<00:04:26.610> as<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:26.970> two

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
in this case I guess as well as just two

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.410 
in this case I guess as well as just two
chests

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
chests

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.940 
chests
but<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.630> just<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.990> general<00:04:28.320> stuff<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.800> some

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
but of just the general stuff and some

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.950 
but of just the general stuff and some
iron<00:04:29.130> ingots<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.550> stuff<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:30.450> yeah<00:04:30.570> this<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.930> a

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
iron ingots and stuff so yeah this is a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.570 
iron ingots and stuff so yeah this is a
place<00:04:31.440> number<00:04:31.620> two<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:32.100> might<00:04:32.220> want<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:32.400> set

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
place number two you might want to set

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.430 
place number two you might want to set
up<00:04:32.700> there<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.540> third<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.900> fourth<00:04:34.050> place<00:04:34.290> of

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
up there is a third the fourth place of

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.820 
up there is a third the fourth place of
course

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
course

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.620 
course
so<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.430> third<00:04:35.610> place<00:04:35.790> is<00:04:36.000> again<00:04:36.300> very<00:04:36.330> very

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
so the third place is again very very

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.950 
so the third place is again very very
close<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.200> this<00:04:37.320> one<00:04:38.480> usually<00:04:39.480> link<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.780> two

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
close to this one usually link the two

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.240 
close to this one usually link the two
fingers<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.410> somehow<00:04:40.620> have<00:04:40.950> different

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
listen extreme hills biome which is

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.630 
listen extreme hills biome which is
they're<00:04:46.440> usually<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.770> little<00:04:46.830> crazy<00:04:47.250> but<00:04:47.550> this

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
they're usually a little crazy but this

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.430 
they're usually a little crazy but this
one's<00:04:47.910> especially<00:04:48.540> crazy<00:04:48.990> have<00:04:49.140> lots<00:04:49.320> of

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
one's especially crazy have lots of

one's especially crazy have lots of
overhangs<00:04:49.890> like<00:04:50.100> this<00:04:51.230> cool<00:04:52.230> idea<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.620> thought

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
overhangs like this cool idea I thought

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.940 
overhangs like this cool idea I thought
would<00:04:53.160> be<00:04:53.190> cool<00:04:53.520> is<00:04:53.700> if<00:04:53.730> you<00:04:54.620> use<00:04:55.620> this<00:04:55.770> little

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
would be cool is if you use this little

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.950 
would be cool is if you use this little
thing<00:04:56.160> here<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.490> then<00:04:57.240> built<00:04:57.480> into<00:04:57.720> a<00:04:57.750> house

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
thing here and then built into a house

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.660 
thing here and then built into a house
by<00:04:58.230> going<00:04:58.440> like<00:04:58.620> this<00:04:58.860> for<00:04:59.040> instance<00:04:59.070> and

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
by going like this for instance and

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.980 
by going like this for instance and
they're<00:04:59.790> making<00:04:59.940> yourself<00:05:00.390> a<00:05:00.570> house<00:05:00.750> out<00:05:00.960> here

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
they're making yourself a house out here

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.080 
they're making yourself a house out here
so<00:05:01.890> you're<00:05:02.040> almost<00:05:02.160> completely<00:05:02.670> protected

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
so you're almost completely protected

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.340 
so you're almost completely protected
from<00:05:03.150> everything<00:05:03.480> again<00:05:03.750> like<00:05:03.930> financial

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
from everything again like financial

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.630 
from everything again like financial
thing<00:05:04.470> except<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:04.920> time<00:05:05.100> you<00:05:05.250> can<00:05:05.400> see

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
the next final place is a little bit

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.570 
the next final place is a little bit
further<00:05:37.530> from<00:05:37.890> spawn<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.310> might<00:05:38.460> actually

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
further from spawn it might actually

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.580 
further from spawn it might actually
take<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:39.120> four<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.780> five<00:05:39.930> minutes<00:05:40.230> of<00:05:40.350> in-game

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
take you four to five minutes of in-game
