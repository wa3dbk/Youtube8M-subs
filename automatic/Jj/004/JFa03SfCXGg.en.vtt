00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.490
 realize that your day is in the ass 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.770
 wanted 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 Congratulation is a small price bump 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.420
 look at us tonight if you no 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.420
 say 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.869
 already when I saw the first time 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.590
 Ford I felt that it 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.179
 would work 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.070
 I love you but I have to love you 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.070
 as I am I am a woman 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.059
 should I torture myself with it now but 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.570
 I wonder if I'm a bad one 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.149
 mother i did not care i want to go back 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.829

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.120
 activity never free you as I need 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.680
 you appear 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.489
 and I can not get the goal is 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.489
 together through 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.720
 that's a shock 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.129
 that intervened 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.880
 That's after using our generation 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.610
 at the stage this three is called this 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.200
 featuring gestus first customer daddy 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 could surprise with the with comes with 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 classical commentary serve the am 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.789
 commonly attach that is specifically is 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.640
 So that's what I think that's special 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.049
 We had held that back first 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.490
 we did not want to leave her 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.270
 what is this a newspaper otto gaissert 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.810
 all right, we will no longer run long 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.000
 I stop you see, it was morning 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.020
 out of here because she just comes over 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.929
 it is important is not the feeling 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.140
 that I never feel that way through always 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.140
 first 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.590
 If I'm what you mean to my daughter 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.060
 nobody 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.900
 I decided in the body 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.910
 to grow old for a woman 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.380
 but also women are old but before 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.520
 very blooms 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.289
 Do you already have yours in yours ? 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.000
 bought back and have you ever had 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.250
 afraid that you collapsed on 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.250
 the street goes before the 16th
