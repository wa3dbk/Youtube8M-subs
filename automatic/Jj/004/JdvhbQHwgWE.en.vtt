00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.190
 Cross border is living with this song 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.629
 a I make the stage in Japan, but 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.629
 I would like to dig in on that too 

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.310
 From Yaguchi 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.320
 Original 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.310
 It was more than British child literature but it exceeded 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.789
 The sweetie bunkers Collina's unit went on to the tone 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.909
 But when writing names in the column 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.909
 Again, let's set the stage in Japan 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.290
 There are two reasons 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.360
 one 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 After all this work 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.490
 It means that you are a newcomer to supervise 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.760
 What does the first team oversee? 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.090
 There is also a volume of address work 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.680
 We want to reduce the burden based on inexperienced people 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.780
 Do you think 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.780
 It is an idea of â€‹â€‹planning 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 The third on the stage of technology is in Japan 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.850
 9th study 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.680
 Black result that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 It does not mean it is completely different 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.570
 We Japanese people 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.560
 The world 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.210
 I don't know if I don't know anything but I hardly know anything 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.870
 is not it 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.870
 What kind of life I am living in a very fast manner 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.450
 There is medium reality 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.560
 Is it life? 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.110
 If you have to study stupidly, after all 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.980
 so 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.070
 On site 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.930
 Not only during the period 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.580
 I want to live for a while 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.820
 There are many things I do not know 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.080
 After all 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.340
 In that it is impossible to ask the director of the priests 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.040
 If you set the stage in Japan, the burden on the surrounding area will be lightened 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 It would have been one way of thinking 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.150
 The second one is 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.310
 Although recent works of Studio Ghibli are the same 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.750
 Because we are Japanese 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.210
 After all, even if we accept the previous work to the Japanese on the stage of Japan 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 I have a desire to make a work 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.819
 Some people say that this has changed with Miyazaki 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.469
 Run but 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.349
 The most domestic ones 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.349
 I'm telling you that it leads to international 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:20.859
 After all their 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:22.299
 this 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.599
 The words were done properly 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.209
 That's why people in the world can also accept it 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.449
 It is called 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.649
 I think I can do Hollywood Film Department but 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:36.219
 After all, a movie set in Japan made with rice is 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.219
 Somewhere we have a sense of discomfort when Japanese people look 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.449
 I'm laughing without thinking that something is wrong 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:44.719
 Because it is 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.609
 I think it's coming out 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.049
 This is a post 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.469
 Create animation on the stage of overseas 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.729
 I get a sense of discomfort 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.069
 There will also be a sense of incongruity in the field 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.979
 Police car or something without power 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.659
 Are 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.809
 Also to say so 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.809
 That is what I mean 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.329
 I mean I want to avoid it 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.529
 That's right 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:10.199
 It was about pesticides 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.359
 Let's draw our lives properly 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.489
 I'm going to work on your Studio Ghibli 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:18.829
 Well this 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.589
 Also effective for two reasons 

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.549
 It is said that the tournament Japan
