00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.330
 let's go there guys and see a little more 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.330
 thoroughly this circuit 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.500
 what I like this circuit especially 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:21.910
 guys is the music they make and they 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.910
 follow is great and well let's go there 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.360
 very well 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.970
 There we are supporting another two more 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.020
 very well 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.360
 there we would be the turbos 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.290
 monedite 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.690
 we already have 10 so let's see if 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.690
 we can keep them 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 there is 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.489
 we have shocked a little bit does not happen 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.670
 nothing we carry a small comfortable advantage 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.710
 there I was deadly forward to hop 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.570
 making it nice and design and good 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.630
 they are out there in fact we get a 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 red runs runs runs runs runs not no 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.020
 He has given me time to cover me well 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.479
 I could have covered myself because it has 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.110
 it came out currency but well we have nine 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.049
 coins care that the wake carries a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 red charged being first another red 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.230
 my mother 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.370
 damn red tits let's go there let's say 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.630
 the turbos 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.770
 all right 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.120
 there are eight coins and we have three 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.710
 green I 'm going to save them a little 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 let's see 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.540
 it's gone the shell me action 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.000
 we tried seconds we chased it very very 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.540
 near 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.410

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.620
 done is an incredibly good object 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:18.200
 we will commit it was almost almost already leaves the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.620
 we tasted good the shell pulls me 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.970
 back 'almost true' 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.879

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.210
 there it is we cover ourselves with the shell 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.340
 green 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.340
 usually hit this version 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.319
 we adjust a little in the curve we have 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.799
 the two deadly coins for each mortal 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:57.299
