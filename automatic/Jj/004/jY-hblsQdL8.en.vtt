 world of Italian rallies e 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.690
 internationals are two very champions 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 experts with important background in 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.500
 peugeot and a particular sensitivity 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.500
 for little bad guys 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.140
 instead of a special test yes 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.649
 find themselves on the track to drive the 208 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.649
 gti and its ancestor the 205 gti 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:51.050

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.360

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.210
 rally

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.140
 renault 5 gt turbo 112 how many hours of 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.790
 work per day is not daily 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.860
 let's say weekly, the pilot whom you 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.470
 you're always inspired this Dario Ferraro 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.390
 the worst car you have with one 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.280
 form of the day and does not exist then there is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.259
 the one I had less luck with is 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.899
 was the subaru the best car with which 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.940
 you ran super 207 let's say I have two 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.280
 in the heart or at worst in the throws 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.570
 front or rear wheel drive 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.610
 posterior the anterior it makes itself the bones with 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.330
 the rear has fun for you e 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.069
 turbo round tour another sport practiced 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.319
 aside motor racing is a jet ski 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.720
 from Milan to Rome car, train or plane 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:43.069
 outlook and book you are reading a hundred 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.929
 pin formula 1 punctures you have us 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.819
 never thought no not seriously 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.700
 no, but I'd like to try the 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.599
 formula 1 from the box or the tv tv web or the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.119
 your cult movie 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:55.720
 once upon a time in america the preference 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.670
 particularly the greenhouse effect is a myth 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.819
 enough to drive to the garage 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.220
 peugeot 508 often never let you drive 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.899
 others rarely but seldom in cars 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.890
 the races are still interesting 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.989
 yes of course 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.000
 have you ever run against ghini verta mai mai 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.890
 course against andrew cip6 many times is 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.470
 true that it is faster than you were 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.849
 certainly some years was one of the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.790
 strongest in the world 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.620
 not always the toughest rally in Portugal 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.780
 made in 89 worldwide 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.430
 too much spatula the easier one for me 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.629
 log rally over the cast not 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.489
 there 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.220
 the defect that makes you more angry 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.989
 carelessness in other motorists 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.720
 especially when they go slow 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.909
 inattentive when giving precedence to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.140
 never driven with the hat than the hat 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.140
 the helmet yes 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.310
 in 2002 we won the drivers' title 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.870
 the Italian constructors title in addition e 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.930
 we won the absolute European title 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.680
 at 50 years still like young and old 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.810
 he didn't even have a wrinkle in 1959 when 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.209
 the first was presented to the public 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.709
 copy of a mini car destined to 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.709
 leave an indelible mark
