00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.050
 well here we have our lock 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.820
 digital brand is the model 49 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.800
 10 and also the model 49 20 is this are 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.619
 Similar registration instructions 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.160
 then the first thing we're going to see is 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 that is correctly installed and 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.610
 then let's open it 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.829
 then there we can see that it is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.500
 correctly closed 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.500
 already has its batteries 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 so 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 what are you 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.160
 to try to know is to register the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.600
 master footprint because right now our 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.430
 lock with any fingerprint you open and 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.170
 so here we can see that any 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.660
 footprint can open our lock 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.610
 initially yes then so this 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.920
 do not happen you have to register the footprint 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.420
 martel subsequently record footprints 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.890
 of user and our key then 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.580
 let's start with the first 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.830
 procedure this tutorial is so that 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.960
 know how to do it if I'm going 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.200
 guiding then the first one that we have 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.670
 what to do is press the zero button to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.530
 enable the reader 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.790
 just with my fingerprint 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 then pressed button 1 until 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.520
 then again, turn 1 and go to 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.360
 start reading my footprint again if we 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.360
 it's going to sound three times 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.409
 they are three times and the insurance goes off 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.609
 again to corroborate that the 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.770
 Master footprint is correctly 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.159
 registered then what are we going to do 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.280
 is to try to open with the other footprint 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.950
 which in which you register 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.540
 Well, I do not have any more, we already have a master 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.630
 here 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.560
 other trace my finger and it does not open itself 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.670
 then nothing else with my masterprint 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 I'm going to master 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.530
 the truth 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.819
 with this good we have to open that 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.819
 the locks again 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.240
 so 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.080
 we have our our first step 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.100
 which is a record of the masterprint 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.260
 Later we can register the 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.560
 traces of the members either of 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.990
 our house or office then what 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.090
 what we are going to do is follow the next 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.319
 process 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.319
 let's press the button 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.569
 but I put my fingerprint masters after 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.450
 press the button 1 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.790
 until it beeps and then I'm going to place 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.189
 the other fingerprint of either the other person 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.680
 and press button 2 and there you are reading 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:03:02.040
 my user footprint 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.189
 this other one I repeat three times and it was heard 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.709
 the latch motor 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.680
 now let's corroborate that our 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.010
 User footprint is correctly 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.860
 all the installed place a reader 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.860
 again it did not put me well omega brig 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.959
 although we are going to review our footprint 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.849
 user 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.849
 then we put it here in the reader 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.750
 and we see that it opened correctly not 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.490
 be very careful that our 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.160
 readers always be clean is that 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.430
 our hands are not too wet 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.890
 because afterwards there will be problems with 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:56.480
 the reader read the prints then now 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.250
 let's record our key if the key 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.959
 it has to be a combination of these 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.630
 four digits and do the 1 2 and the 3 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.920
 It must be at least 11 digits not 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.600
 can start with zero yes then for 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.280
 record our key we're going to follow the 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.150
 next procedure presses the 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.450
 zero button 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.650
 I put my footprint master 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:28.530
 then pressed button 3 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:32.910
 and we 're all going to put him 2013 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.910
 2013 burnett 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.949
 then there is already registered more 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:44.680
 back our key we will adapt from 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:47.129
 see with our key 2013 2013 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.409
 201 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.619
 and it is already 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:55.680
 and then we have our key be 

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:58.560
 registered now we are going to 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.620
 to see how to erase our masterprint 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.919
 if for example if we want to delete the 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.600
 master and created another person to another 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.400
 member of the family other same of the 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.970
 company let's follow the next 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.520
 procedure presses the zero button 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.560
 I put my footprint master 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.920
 then press button 2 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.930
 and then the button 1 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.930
 and other equally hermigua 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.530
 and we already removed the master when we removed 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.050
 the master again returns to his state 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.570
 initial where everyone can open the 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.880
 lock with your fingerprint then let's 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.070
 see let's try to open with the 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.610
 small fingerprint 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.610
 if he is sober then water and I never 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.770
 register it neither as a user nor as more 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.270
 then there we already removed our footprint 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.430
 master other thing than to repeat again 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.449
 no procedure to register 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.249
 our master footprint 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.490
 good is the tutorial for the registration of 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:04.550
 fingerprints master key members and delete 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.889
 the master of our lock of 49 10 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.629
 and 49 20 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.839
 the closer we have sale in smart 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:17.960
 home systems in tampico branch in the 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:26.089
 telephone 83 31 32 35 42 and the branch of 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:28.449
 querÃ©taro telephone 44 22 94 54 87 that 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:28.449
 that's it
