00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.809
 plus 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.280
 today I would like to talk about the cheetah a 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.000
 member of the feline family that 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.009
 it is considered the terrestrial animal more 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.369
 fast the world is able to reach 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:24.040
 Top speeds of 114 kilometers per 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.930
 hour reaches 70 kilometers per hour 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.570
 in just 2 seconds of acceleration its 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.510
 body is designed to be a body 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.790
 of race a competition body for 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.640
 so saying it is able to catch 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.250
 any prey because it is the animal 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.350
 terrestrial faster the only thing that 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.749
 you have to worry the leopard is 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.480
 capture your prey in a short time 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:53.679
 because he can only maintain 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.289
 these speeds in 400 or 500 meters do not 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.899
 there is no cardiovascular system capable 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.960
 to hold those speeds so 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.850
 extreme so I take it in a matter of 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.280
 a few seconds keeping that 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.800
 speed has to stop because no 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.300
 have enough oxygen to follow 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.880
 ahead 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.950
 even so the cheetahs have a system 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.850
 perfectly designed for the race 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.250
 otherwise they would not reach those speeds 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.010
 they have a heart twice as big as 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.650
 what it should be in your body is a 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.830
 gigantic heart that pumps blood to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.010
 an incredibly fast speed its 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.880
 nostrils are also very open and 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.700
 they capture a lot of oxygen 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.460
 What more data can I give you? 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.579
 see I do not usually start more than 40 to 65 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.770
 kilos weigh less than a person and are 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.979
 able still to capture prey 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.700
 quite large generally in the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.429
 female cheetahs usually hunt gazelles 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.780
 gazelles that have just been born but the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.569
 cheetahs that are males that 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.569
 They are generally stronger and more aggressive 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.329
 sometimes they are going to hunt prey more 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.550
 large but not always clear 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.400
 is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.120
 what is the difference between a lion and a 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.790
 cheetah then a lion of all the 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.270
 hunts that does it is calculated that so 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.120
 is only able to hunt 40 prisoners for 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.460
 year while a cheetah hunting a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.580
 300 per year which means that 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.130
 practically every day catches a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.860
 different prey which tells us that 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.440
 as a predator as a carnivore is one of 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.380
 those that have the most success rate at 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.810
 time to hunt 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.350
 The truth is that cheetahs despite 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.530
 of its reduced weight and size are a 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.570
 adversary to consider his great 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.330
 speed allows them to capture any 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.750
 kind of being alive go at the speed that 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.330
 go 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.430
 Today I bring you these curiosities about 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.130
 the cheetah for you to reflect and 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.530
 think about one of the animals 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.980
 most extraordinary that we have in the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.980
 planet Earth
