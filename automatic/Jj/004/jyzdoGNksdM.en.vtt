00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
this I was driving down I'm going to st.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.170 
this I was driving down I'm going to st.
Pete<00:00:13.110> one<00:00:13.349> day<00:00:13.820> on<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> highway<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.720> decided<00:00:16.260> to

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
Pete one day on the highway I decided to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.269 
Pete one day on the highway I decided to
do<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> theory<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:19.070> accelerating<00:00:20.070> really

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
do the theory of accelerating really

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.779 
do the theory of accelerating really
fast<00:00:20.550> maybe<00:00:20.880> at<00:00:21.060> 70<00:00:21.420> miles<00:00:21.600> an<00:00:21.779> hour<00:00:21.980> um<00:00:22.980> real

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
fast maybe at 70 miles an hour um real

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.230 
fast maybe at 70 miles an hour um real
fell<00:00:24.090> at<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.050> highway<00:00:25.440> and<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.240> will

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
fell at on the highway and that will

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.590 
fell at on the highway and that will
clean<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.720> my<00:00:27.750> fuel<00:00:28.680> injection<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.510> went<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
clean out my fuel injection I went to

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.860 
clean out my fuel injection I went to
try<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.019> out<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:32.070> was<00:00:32.520> doing<00:00:32.940> 20<00:00:33.480> miles<00:00:33.690> an

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
try that out so I was doing 20 miles an

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.130 
try that out so I was doing 20 miles an
hour<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.380> accelerated<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.690> basically<00:00:36.690> full

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
hour and I accelerated to basically full

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.120 
hour and I accelerated to basically full
throttle<00:00:38.540> on<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.780> highway<00:00:40.430> um<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:42.680> think<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.950> was

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
throttle on the highway um I think I was

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.470 
throttle on the highway um I think I was
pushing<00:00:44.520> maybe<00:00:46.190> 60<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.399> 70<00:00:47.879> miles<00:00:48.059> an<00:00:48.300> hour

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
pushing maybe 60 to 70 miles an hour

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.380 
pushing maybe 60 to 70 miles an hour
when<00:00:49.290> I<00:00:49.320> started<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.309> hill<00:00:50.579> um<00:00:50.820> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
little hill that crosses into i-75 as I

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.860 
little hill that crosses into i-75 as I
go<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.850> hill<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.270> heard<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> pop<00:00:58.640> um

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
go up the little hill I heard a pop um

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.540 
go up the little hill I heard a pop um
after<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.020> heard<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> pop<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.710> removed<00:01:02.100> my<00:01:02.309> feet

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
after I heard the pop I removed my feet

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.800 
after I heard the pop I removed my feet
off<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.229> acceleration<00:01:04.229> pedal<00:01:04.889> and<00:01:05.810> just

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
off the acceleration pedal and just

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.090 
off the acceleration pedal and just
started<00:01:07.139> driving<00:01:07.520> at<00:01:08.520> regular<00:01:09.149> rate<00:01:10.100> however

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
started driving at regular rate however

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.789 
started driving at regular rate however
the<00:01:11.279> car<00:01:11.459> was<00:01:11.639> driving<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.209> little<00:01:12.420> rough<00:01:12.749> as<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the car was driving a little rough as I

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.449 
the car was driving a little rough as I
got<00:01:14.069> to<00:01:14.219> the<00:01:14.340> skyway<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.719> doing<00:01:16.139> about<00:01:16.459> 75

00:01:17.449 --> 00:01:17.459 
got to the skyway I was doing about 75

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.559 
got to the skyway I was doing about 75
miles<00:01:17.729> an<00:01:17.939> hour<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:20.029> midway<00:01:21.029> through<00:01:21.389> the

um midway to the Skyway the st. P Skyway
Bridge<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:31.159> started<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> lose<00:01:32.520> momentum

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
Bridge I started to lose momentum

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:44.149 
Bridge I started to lose momentum
I<00:01:34.249> dropped<00:01:35.249> from<00:01:35.549> 75<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> 74<00:01:37.700> 73<00:01:39.169> 72<00:01:41.029> 71<00:01:42.859> 70<00:01:43.859> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
I dropped from 75 to 74 73 72 71 70 and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.269 
I dropped from 75 to 74 73 72 71 70 and
it<00:01:44.279> was<00:01:44.399> gradually<00:01:45.090> decreasing<00:01:45.749> one<00:01:46.529> mile<00:01:46.950> per

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:49.279 

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:54.349 

per<00:01:50.279> drop<00:01:50.579> um<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.279> made<00:01:53.609> it<00:01:53.639> over<00:01:54.029> the<00:01:54.149> top

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
per drop um but I made it over the top

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.839 
per drop um but I made it over the top
around<00:01:55.309> 69<00:01:57.590> 69<00:01:58.590> miles<00:01:58.829> an<00:01:58.950> hour<00:01:59.069> my<00:01:59.399> feet<00:01:59.639> was

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
around 69 69 miles an hour my feet was

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.629 
around 69 69 miles an hour my feet was
full<00:02:00.359> throughout<00:02:00.749> on<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.079> gas<00:02:01.259> pedal<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> I

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
full throughout on the gas pedal so I

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.069 
full throughout on the gas pedal so I
think<00:02:05.639> I'm<00:02:05.909> losing<00:02:06.119> torque<00:02:06.539> power<00:02:06.749> or

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
think I'm losing torque power or

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.080 
think I'm losing torque power or
something

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
something

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.539 
something
this<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.329> started<00:02:09.810> happening<00:02:10.019> after<00:02:10.439> the<00:02:11.129> pop

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
this all started happening after the pop

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.730 
this all started happening after the pop
before<00:02:11.939> that<00:02:12.689> never<00:02:12.900> happened

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
before that never happened

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.730 
before that never happened
I<00:02:13.770> would<00:02:13.950> hit<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.370> Skyway<00:02:14.970> Bridge<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.740> 75

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
I would hit the Skyway Bridge at 75

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.220 
I would hit the Skyway Bridge at 75
miles<00:02:17.010> an<00:02:17.160> hour<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.820> would<00:02:17.970> stay<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.210> 75<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
miles an hour and I would stay at 75 the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.570 
miles an hour and I would stay at 75 the
most<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.620> probably<00:02:19.860> drop<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.460> maybe<00:02:20.700> 70<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:22.580> 74

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
most I probably drop is maybe 70 to 74

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.470 
most I probably drop is maybe 70 to 74
you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.690> throughout<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.140> whole<00:02:25.470> process<00:02:26.480> so

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
you know throughout the whole process so

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.840 
you know throughout the whole process so
and<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.320> was<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.620> accelerate<00:02:29.220> any<00:02:29.460> faster

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
and it was not accelerate any faster

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.820 
and it was not accelerate any faster
limit<00:02:30.120> how<00:02:30.270> far<00:02:30.300> down<00:02:30.750> our<00:02:30.960> first<00:02:31.170> petal<00:02:31.500> pit

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
limit how far down our first petal pit

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.040 
limit how far down our first petal pit
but<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.190> gas<00:02:32.370> pedal<00:02:32.700> these<00:02:33.510> are<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> codes

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
but the gas pedal these are the codes

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.020 
but the gas pedal these are the codes
I've<00:02:34.290> been<00:02:34.560> getting<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.040> cleared<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.760> few<00:02:35.940> of
