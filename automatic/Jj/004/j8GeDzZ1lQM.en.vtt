the boss from the first chapter is

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.950 
the boss from the first chapter is
probably<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.760> best<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.240> bunch<00:03:20.420> as<00:03:20.810> it

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
probably the best of the bunch as it

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.660 
probably the best of the bunch as it
just<00:03:21.140> seemed<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.470> use<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.920> most<00:03:22.100> creativity

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
just seemed to use the most creativity

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.520

but<00:03:23.180> things<00:03:23.480> kind<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:23.780> just<00:03:23.840> wind<00:03:24.200> down<00:03:24.380> from

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530

but things kind of just wind down from
there<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:25.070> mean<00:03:25.430> one<00:03:25.730> boss<00:03:25.910> even<00:03:26.090> gets<00:03:26.360> reused

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
there I mean one boss even gets reused

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.180 
there I mean one boss even gets reused
