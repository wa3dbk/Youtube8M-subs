00:00:05.357 --> 00:00:05.557
Hello to everyone

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:07.040
Ok guys

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:10.355
I´m here to make videos

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:13.241
chapter by chapter about the book of Revelation.

00:00:13.717 --> 00:00:16.700
Today I want to talk about chapter two

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:19.525
that is about the church of Ephesus.

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.710
You will see on the screen

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:23.298
the letter to the church of Ephesus.

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:25.481
Ephesus means desirable.

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:28.010
Was the political

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:30.693
and economic metropolis of Asia minor.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.997
I am going to to show the historical background

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:35.529
of each of this churches of Asia.

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:37.243
It will be seven videos

00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:39.363
about this subject. Ok?

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.719
Ephesus was an maritime city,

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:45.525
It´s port was the most important of Asia

00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:46.559
for that reason

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:51.366
it was always in direct contact with people and cultures

00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:53.841
from many parts the world.

00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:57.838
It was also exposed to the influence of the world

00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:03.733
coming from the visitors received from many places.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:06.248
There were many pagan cults.

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:13.918
(Knowing this, you will have an understanding

00:01:14.327 --> 00:01:16.026
about the upcoming verses).

00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:18.567
Including from Artemis

00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:24.157
wich is a goddess attested in Acts 19:24 and 40,

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.808
Paul taught for 3 years in the town of Ephesus,

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.479
it is recorded in Acts 19:10; 20:31; and 20:27.

00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:37.742
He tought all the message,

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:39.376
plan and purposes of God.

00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:44.712
It was an city of the roman province of Asia minor,

00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:47.410
near the mouth of Cayster River,

00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:51.270
three miles to the eastcoast of Asia minor,

00:01:52.356 --> 00:01:54.431
across the island of Samos.

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:58.333
With a port with access to the biggest ships,

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.343
and rival to the port of Miletus.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.554
Ephesus was the city with the best access to asia,

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:07.292
by land and sea.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.998
A well localized city, let´s put it that way.

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:15.964
It´s location offered religious,

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.569
political and cultural growth.

00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:22.388
And offered a more advantageous field

00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:24.452
for the missionary work of Paul.

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:28.182
The city was on top of the sloping sides

00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:30.608
and bottom of two hills;

00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:33.782
those are Prions and Coressus.

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:38.487
A city well dignified!

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.543
Ephesus was more accessible

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.027
to the commercial center

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.660
and the cultural center of the goddess Diana.

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:49.536
And because of its wealth and situation

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.343
gradually became

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:54.304
the main city of the province.

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:57.830
The city of Ephesus was seven times

00:02:58.064 --> 00:03:00.145
destroyed by fire and rebuilt.

00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:03.946
(That is something that happened

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.083
and the good side of it,

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:08.381
was that, the people facing such disasters always tried to do

00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.517
something good for the city).

00:03:10.517 --> 00:03:12.858
each time with a bigger

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:14.836
and grander scale than before.

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:16.133
What did they do?

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:17.209
Each disaster:

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.406
they rebuilded the city

00:03:19.688 --> 00:03:21.548
and each time,

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:24.413
they made the city better than before.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.659
Better than the other city that got destroyed,

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.009
always improving.

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.358
Now let´s analize

00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:33.711
this church of Ephesus

00:03:34.134 --> 00:03:35.426
verse by verse.

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:37.586
I only showed  the historical background;

00:03:37.586 --> 00:03:40.988
now lets go to chapter two (of Revelation)

00:03:40.988 --> 00:03:43.182
from verse one to the last one.

00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:46.121
