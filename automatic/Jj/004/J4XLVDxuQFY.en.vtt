00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.420
 a transfer from theo janssen to ajax was noticed 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.719
 basketball starting cards 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.589
 naturally 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.819
 he is a sign that they have been removed as quickly as possible 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.819
 I feel good here 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.960
 yes, playing football can always find it better 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.109
 I think we still have to get used to the women just to play 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.849
 yes i expect it to 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.269
 that it will be okay 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.210
 with it there actually the best lessons we have so far against 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 twente was but then they have 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.190
 for that match against Twente for the Johan Cruijff scale 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.100
 the fox already asked me if its special to name player 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.820
 it is perhaps the specialist and not to pray in the field 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.540
 is that before they are against vitesse 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.280
 but I am not in any way unwilling to draft so neither against vitesse 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.840
 but 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.680
 it gives a more persecuted he I always have too much at vitesse 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.270
 to tell 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.490
 have played the first ten years in youth and it was before 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.430
 the choice of supporters 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.920
 we pay two buses per minute 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 yes that gives me more feeling but now we play at home so of course 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 I will hardly notice it 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.970
 adÃ¡n 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.310
 the piece 7 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.460
 the midfielder played more than 200 premier league matches for traffic and van 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.860
 purely a free copy of jansen was enough for the title fight to be a miller 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.090
 required because every day in between 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 that made for an easy job vitesse that last week in 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.430
 lee and what you see now is that we actually all that dutch 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.750
 boys want to come up with a good trainer who gave that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.920
 know the club through and through so it was all positive development 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.420
 you can still remember in the meantime, player of vitesse is difficult but 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 to travel down the arena for as against Ajax 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.300
 yes those are all too good that you don't have to 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.700
 I see you nobody expected that if you win it is nice if you do not win 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.770
 the tenor is also fine so 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.120
 That was always a competition that you would love to go to with your bed 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.970
 yes I have not expected that 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.509
 do you think that there seemed to be some measure that there were still points 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.029
 you expect one 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.469
 a tough duel 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.059
 A difficult duel against vitesse therefore is that he is going again for sure even more 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:21.109
 It is then harder to get PVV and the CDA we are not playing too well there 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.019
 we have to put something right for the athletes and 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.369
 if everyone does that then we are the absolute power 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.369
 japan goes the strong horse alphen the veterans day 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.429
 there is a lot of speculation about your position being violated 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.919
 we follow the discussion the united states for that we need more 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.919
 can bring another position they are following that 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:48.189
 more than eight hundred years with the distance by a boy of everything and through 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.819
 people who have me for player version 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.349
 so that I had a very different unnatural occurrence that occurred by tracing one 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.769
 movie classic yes much more present of course 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.319
 with all these options that are rarely less but I knew when I was in the future 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.589
 so it came to be that case 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.319
 is not an issue for me 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.229
 no problem i'm very light on that position and 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.699
 I'm going to make sure that we play better and better and then it will come naturally 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:13.519
 build up 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.699
 also from this position pina the average 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.859
 so far not yet a better match a spokeswoman 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.969
 kept it anyway 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:23.719
 I can not complain 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.489
 if you defend states against vitesse then probably comes a bit us 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.119
 against 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:29.719
 lucidi band 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.809
 years we were seeing each other sometimes because of her being behind me 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.769
 I move I see you when the cell has a relationship with mister 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.619
 I also have a child 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.619
 9 I know him pretty well and 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.299
 you succeeded 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.379
 seen this week or spoken by chance 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.519
 well over a minute but you do 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.139
 the hermit final 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.189
 I heard that he is always a bit far from all the holes I probably have 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.819
 a lot of sweden that I wanted to pin there was indeed 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.300
 so that sure burned over 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.700
 year out of the game to play his year 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.540
 it will be a bit tired they are not yet
