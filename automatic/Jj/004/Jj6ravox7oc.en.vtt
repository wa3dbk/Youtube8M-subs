such<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.630> gradual<00:03:05.319> thing<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.800> just

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
such a gradual thing that it just

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.290 
such a gradual thing that it just
happens<00:03:06.280> over<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.520> course<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.850> time<00:03:07.000> but<00:03:07.150> when

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
happens over the course of time but when

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.290 
happens over the course of time but when
you're<00:03:07.420> young<00:03:07.630> or<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:08.050> 18<00:03:08.440> 19<00:03:08.470> 20<00:03:09.340> 21<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:10.060> get
