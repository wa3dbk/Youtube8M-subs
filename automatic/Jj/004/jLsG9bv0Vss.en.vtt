00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.020
 he did it on facebook that if we want 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.300
 those of them already composed with acrylic 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.500
 and then I was one of those people who 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.380
 he became dad with her and they came 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 in bags but I already put them in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.469
 I already put the container and put them 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.079
 the name of each this mixture so that 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:43.290

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.560
 Who is this who are the mixtures 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.560

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 this is this and then 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.480
 this is called clickers 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.450
 this is another 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.440
 this is called 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.430
 and turkey 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.430
 It can 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.920
 d 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.920
 this is called pink cost 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.740
 and this is called the clip 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.850
 ok and I just recorded them a while ago and 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.410
 they were in one in bags and the buses 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.330
 fast containers because I do not want that 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.920
 is to be put wherever only 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.860
 I want to make them 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:47.540
 this is gold only 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.300
 and they already come with their own this 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.030
 they already come with the acrylic that she 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.530
 she prepared him she put him his applied 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.510
 I do not know what use I sent him look 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.870
 beautiful 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:09.630
 I like the scale 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.630
 what I 'm going to do 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.140
 this is the pin cast 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.700
 I do not want to grab a lot and I want to finish 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.310
 the nail because 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.010
 it's very nice it also has like 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.470
 it looks like it has mica or pigment but 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.030
 it's super thin 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 you can not see well 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.019
 and this is called 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.100
 it's compact it's going to be something quick and 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.100
 and this is called 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.350
 Turkey 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.030
 and look what is 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.400
 I did not like it 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:14.180
 it looks a little purple like it has 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.790
 a little bit is very fine this is fine 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.010
 but if you have little love 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:26.410
 but you can not see much but like that 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.400
 this little love with europe 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.400
 purple 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.780
 and this is called confetti 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.220
 I think I give a lot but good 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.220
 until the confetti 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.420
 good 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.610
 it reminds me of a birthday 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.400
 all that you put in decoration of 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.980
 birthday is fine is nice what 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.959
 you can put under one color 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.959
 examining in your habitat mind 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.400
 and I think this is called calibres 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.780
 and as I tell you, this story is 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.780
 with the camera in the middle 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.990
 my photo 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.990
 another good soft 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.870
 do not 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.160
 but also 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.820
 and these are the five segments that the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.620
 five acrylics to exchange with her 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.100
 and these are the ones he already sent me to 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.370
 back and if it looks like a collection like 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.820
 these were from a set are fine 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.820
 pretty 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.510
 and then there is I do not think there is 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.670
 encapsulate because not calling them is going to 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:58.600
 put a cue to put teeth 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:00.910
 but many thanks for the bolis by 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.660
 the methods are very nice to me 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:09.140
 I liked this number, I'm going to use them 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.960
 to see I do not think I'm good different 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.930
 all together but they are also pretty 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.630
 I liked them a lot 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.850
 so I hope you liked them all 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.449
 ours that sent me and I sent him 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:27.539
 She also sent 5 which I did and 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.539
 see I hope you like it too bye bye
