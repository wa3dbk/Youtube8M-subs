00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.370
 I am me 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.310
 and the net is that the trailer looks 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.329
 promising the series as such you see that 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.679
 is going to unwrap as well 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:43.479

 this series is a spin-off of black and 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.870
 arrow in it will show us a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.329

 the series will have the participation of 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.629
 read hunter javier martÃ­n scheinin white 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.120
 canoe reid palmer or as by the way 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.299
 this type of reforms is the same actor 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.879
 who played superman in the tan 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.150
 hated called super marathon also 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:04.269
 we will have the presence of the cold captain 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.739
 heatwave and we in effect house 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.139
 see that there are those who after to make a 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.120
 series so we'll see how 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.680
 it's fine since already up to the phil boulder 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.500
 spector that we know by interpreting 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.579
 something in new being in the games of 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.400
 leander is the favorite and the rumor says 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.109
 which is the new spiderman so this 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.909
 guy is already closing negotiations for 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.129
 make the new interpreter of this 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:29.290
 character that we love so much the amazing 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.239
 spider many ask me this old man 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.730
 that you are a fan of man space 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.069
 What do you think about this actor? How do you see him? 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.710
 or what wave and I always 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:43.020
 I answered spider-man as such has 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.580
 our officially go well so 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.100
 subliminally so to speak spain 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.750
 maintains between 15 and 16 years old when 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.520
 applies to the spider for the first time 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.800
 they say he hears hill is that in spider-man 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.990
 90s is the animated series because 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.850
 you see a mature space although it happened there 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.380
 good thing is that in this series they show you 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.000
 with Peter Parker obviously more mature 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.120
 but they are not showing you when 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.680
 the spider itches, or something 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.450
 time she spider-man since 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.470
 begins the series and it's spider-man and if 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.390
 ask me, I think that 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.520
 they wait for the animated series has its 21 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.810
 22 years out there pretty much is more I do not know 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.280
 if you have noticed it I do not know if ever 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.960
 they saw the spectacular series 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.600
 spiderman 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.430
 this peter is 16 years old there and they talk about 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.900
 that it had been a year after 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.180
 on Sunday the spider something else that 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.600
 we could consider is that sandro fil 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.430
 he is 18 years old he looks more nose but if 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.380
 we think save in civil 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.810
 world and still do not know if it will be inside 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.010
 of the plot or will only make a cameo the 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.810
 new avengers spider-man movie 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.230
 is conformed until 2017 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.730
 we are in 2015 another two years and 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.800
 Well obviously not two years more 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.510
 another year he's already nineteen after 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.240
 that movie is not confirmed any 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.830
 another movie spider-man at least 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.300
 not the cinematic universe of 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.310
 marvel will surely come appearing in 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.320
 infinity ward or definitive you are part 2 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.450
 but solo sperm does not have 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.980

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.290
