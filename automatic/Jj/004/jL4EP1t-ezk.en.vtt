might come along and make junk data or
why<00:01:48.780> would<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.590> just

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
why would they do that that's just

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.550 
why would they do that that's just
stupid<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.509> mean<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:52.020> people<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.380> nothing

better<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.070> do<00:01:53.220> than<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.939> create<00:01:54.299> junk<00:01:54.689> data

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
better to do than to create junk data

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.609 
better to do than to create junk data
seriously<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.469> it's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.550 
guess maybe this is what the Internet's
all<00:02:50.160> about<00:02:50.540> gosh<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.720> bringing<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.170> tear<00:02:52.440> to
