00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
future but for right now this lesson on

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.609 
future but for right now this lesson on
Judy<00:01:31.670> goes<00:01:32.119> into<00:01:32.420> some<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.840> really<00:01:33.170> exotic

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
Judy goes into some of the really exotic

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.290 
Judy goes into some of the really exotic
techniques<00:01:34.220> that<00:01:34.369> he<00:01:34.430> uses<00:01:34.729> in<00:01:34.880> there<00:01:35.060> it's

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
techniques that he uses in there it's

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.510 
techniques that he uses in there it's
got<00:01:35.509> unusual<00:01:35.990> timing<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.619> 3/4<00:01:37.070> time<00:01:37.100> but

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
got unusual timing it's in 3/4 time but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.520 
got unusual timing it's in 3/4 time but
it's<00:01:37.610> going<00:01:37.820> fast<00:01:38.149> enough<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.750> where<00:01:38.929> you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
it's going fast enough to where you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.140 
it's going fast enough to where you
really<00:01:39.800> got<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.009> think<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.280> it<00:01:40.369> more<00:01:40.550> as<00:01:40.610> twelve

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
really got to think of it more as twelve

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.570 
really got to think of it more as twelve
eight<00:01:41.330> or<00:01:41.630> you're<00:01:42.439> really<00:01:42.619> only<00:01:42.799> tapping<00:01:43.310> once

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
eight or you're really only tapping once

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.950 
eight or you're really only tapping once
per<00:01:43.880> measure<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:44.360> we<00:01:44.450> talked<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.630> little<00:01:44.810> bit

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
per measure so we talked a little bit

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.190 
per measure so we talked a little bit
about<00:01:45.140> compound<00:01:45.799> time<00:01:46.580> signatures<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:47.390> then

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
about compound time signatures and then

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.600 
about compound time signatures and then
we<00:01:48.439> talked<00:01:48.619> about<00:01:48.770> someone<00:01:48.950> who<00:01:49.130> performs<00:01:49.549> in

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
we talked about someone who performs in

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.890 
we talked about someone who performs in
happening<00:01:49.970> there<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.119> lot<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.509> is<00:01:50.630> very

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
happening there a lot of it is very

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.050 
happening there a lot of it is very
simple<00:01:51.200> melodies<00:01:51.950> picked<00:01:52.220> out<00:01:52.340> over<00:01:52.640> chords

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
simple melodies picked out over chords

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.969 
simple melodies picked out over chords
but<00:01:53.750> then<00:01:54.049> there's<00:01:54.229> this<00:01:54.380> interplay<00:01:54.950> of

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
but then there's this interplay of

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.249 
but then there's this interplay of
voices<00:01:55.670> where<00:01:55.909> while<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.659> base<00:01:56.840> notes<00:01:57.140> are

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
voices where while the base notes are

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.039 
voices where while the base notes are
doing<00:01:57.500> one<00:01:57.680> thing<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.939> melody<00:01:59.299> notes<00:01:59.509> have<00:01:59.900> to

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
doing one thing the melody notes have to

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.510 
doing one thing the melody notes have to
continue<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.530> ring<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.860> can't<00:02:01.130> sound<00:02:01.369> like

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
continue to ring it can't sound like

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.210 
continue to ring it can't sound like
this

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.710 

there<00:02:05.220> was<00:02:05.310> no<00:02:05.490> musical<00:02:05.940> value<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.510> so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
there was no musical value in that so

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.910 
there was no musical value in that so
what<00:02:06.900> hat<00:02:07.050> which<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.260> have<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:07.590> make<00:02:07.650> this

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
what hat which you have to to make this

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.639 
what hat which you have to to make this
work<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.869> make<00:02:09.869> sure<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.140> melody<00:02:10.470> notes

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
work is make sure the melody notes

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.540 
work is make sure the melody notes
continue<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.220> ring<00:02:11.400> when<00:02:12.920> bass<00:02:13.920> notes<00:02:14.220> change

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
continue to ring when bass notes change

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.290 
continue to ring when bass notes change
so<00:02:18.650> independent<00:02:19.650> voice<00:02:19.830> leading<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.430> some<00:02:21.209> of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
so independent voice leading is some of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.840 
so independent voice leading is some of
the<00:02:21.360> subject<00:02:21.720> of<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.200> lesson<00:02:22.440> as<00:02:22.770> well<00:02:23.040> then

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
the subject of this lesson as well then

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.250 
the subject of this lesson as well then
there<00:02:24.330> are<00:02:24.420> parts<00:02:24.690> where<00:02:24.750> we're<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.050> playing

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
there are parts where we're just playing

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.690 
there are parts where we're just playing
chords<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.650> picking<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:25.950> simple<00:02:26.340> melodies

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
chords and picking out simple melodies

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.640 
chords and picking out simple melodies
well<00:02:27.000> not<00:02:27.240> simple<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:30.570> then<00:02:31.440> we<00:02:31.500> have

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
well not simple and then we have

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.990 
well not simple and then we have
syncopated<00:02:32.280> parts<00:02:32.550> where<00:02:32.700> we're<00:02:32.850> hearing

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
syncopated parts where we're hearing
