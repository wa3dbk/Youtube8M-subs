00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
learning a lot more about the game a lot

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.980 
learning a lot more about the game a lot
more<00:01:17.939> about<00:01:18.060> different<00:01:18.540> drills<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990

structures and how people coach the game
so<00:01:20.970> I'm<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.570> getting<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.960> broader<00:01:22.560> view<00:01:22.830> on

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so I'm really getting a broader view on

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.920 
so I'm really getting a broader view on

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
how the how the coaching position can

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.690 
how the how the coaching position can
work<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.070> future<00:01:26.250> sometime

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
work and if that's in my future sometime

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.649 
work and if that's in my future sometime
soon<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:29.030> think<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.329> put<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.509> lot<00:01:30.540> of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
soon I think we really put a lot of

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.030 
soon I think we really put a lot of
emphasis<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> fall<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.530> getting<00:01:31.920> back

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
emphasis on the fall and getting back

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.109 
emphasis on the fall and getting back
into<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.340> getting<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.759> lot<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.909> camaraderie

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
into it getting a lot of camaraderie

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.719 
into it getting a lot of camaraderie
within<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> team<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.590> things<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
within the team and things like this you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.710
