00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.679
 or the people who are here romy commenting 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.290
 and good that I bring you and then today 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.520
 I bring a life worth a life that almost 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.350
 I had never done my channel I had done 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.270
 twice and in a sloppy way with 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.010
 a catch now of shit one that moss 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.650
 that I'm in one in the bedroom is worth 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.420
 is going to touch overflow or that seems 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.640
 vale vale has touched several charge and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.070
 mysteriously the magic of paco tous 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.400
 Well I'm with these people or 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.260
 count their so they are pretty good 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.300
 there is a double command out there work we are going to 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.010
 see if you like them or if I do not like them 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.300
 new rubber bands that I'm used to 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.100
 what is to comment on the gameplays 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.929
 like this you do not like much is the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.030
 first time it's new to my channel and 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.370
 that with hd pvr 2 can be done 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 wonders we can all take advantage of and 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.880
 let's see what we can do 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.470
 one thing you will see that at the most 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.970
 screen looks a few severe lines 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.559
 that's because it has not changed the 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.329
 capturer configuration and it 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.290
 have to see better I have two to the 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.790
 right or leave 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.350
 and the executive 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:04.190
 this is not usually given to me very well 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.190
 because I carry a lot besides that 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.290
 another one and another one back there are the three 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.420
 for the tactical configuration bet and 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.880
 low triple sheet tactic configuration 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.880
 It is there and it has been changing organ 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.450
 and it will seem strange to you that he is playing 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.510
 and who lives with you because not in 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.510
 life and test 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.460
 here one upstairs thrown out the window 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.259
 one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.530
 perfect 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.020
 and this 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.340
 the 61 we're going to see what we're going we want 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.460
 all still our people are not 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.600
 abandoned 160 points and the second one goes 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.000
 10 Let it come and pierce failed 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.350
 the corner of the container clean of 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.150
 material let's see 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.480
 we will handle this we will handle 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.750
 a little better 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.970
 the command direct problem 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.330
 we're not going to handle it a bit to see 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.330
 Where are you 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.310
 yes 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.350
 eleven 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.390
 we created 22 pts 21 the facts and if you 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.690
 is liking this a like it's worth if you 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.750
 Like more than I mentioned the game 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.750
 I was there 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:18.409
 the ear more blows the bullet 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.409
 look how it has been thrown 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.010
 let's see how he runs and the other one is already 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.019
 point the map for him this will give the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.840
 back here because the water is around 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.819
 back to the silo case we are invalid the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.959
 take it for ass this is going to run good 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.150
 we are going to take for ass that some 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.790
 we are on the other side of the map each one of us 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.060
 Let's see 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.480
 let's see good and laughs is me 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.140
 laughing at me look how it happens 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.140
 this is an intercept these laws 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.840
 blade co 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.840
 now run now 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.220
 let's finish that he has one life left 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.220
 but he did not want to be 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.489
 to the east again I will want to troll or 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.170
 anything is worth it because it is 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.790
 trying to troll I guess so 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.790
 let's hope I do not troll 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.820
