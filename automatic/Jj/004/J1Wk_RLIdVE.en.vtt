00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.290
 my name is peter van vliet and i have been under treatment for a few weeks 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.550
 becking 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.959
 I came across because I have a lot of problems with me 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.719
 I find it mainly painful muscles and as a result thereof 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.060
 and then since I have I am here I have 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.060
 and I don't think I have a number of ways 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.750
 where you come from a little is I think because I was a child 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.539
 it was very stressed out 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.560
 very much 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.529
 take medication 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.980
 of antibiotics because me 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.070
 to be purchased as the eighth team 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.360
 m 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.760
 in the first the headache and alcohol started 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.949
 on time 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.420
 things got worse and worse 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.720
 and to give up 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.210
 crazy heal painkillers administered heavy painkillers 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.900
 this unique and 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.970
 so in addition to all antibiotics there was an extra 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.090
 I had to take a lot more medicines 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.290
 NATO must understand 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.320
 the medicines 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.280
 they ensure a lot of pleasure in your muscles 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.970
 and therefore also very carefully 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.650
 the stiff muscles 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.110
 I understand a little worth with me 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.140
 comes from 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.700
 at a later age I also received the site from the line what 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 also provides sex pistols you can imagine a bit 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.180
 m for my muscles 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.520
 we feed or become president, say 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.650
 m 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.720
 also gives people 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.720
 I am going to live a very healthy life 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 own responsibility for my health 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.100
 will be called very good 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.790
 and I just haven't had it anymore 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.680
 they influence 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.900
 fed on my health it is found 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.850
 misses anyway value headache attacks really a lot less since I very much 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.070
 healthy living 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.750
 but 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.130
 still 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.130
 There are people who are very stiff and painful and content 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.510
 I think so myself 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.220
 I am not for their own home 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.060
 ten years 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.710
 a graph the toddler but because in the distance chiropractors a portal peeters 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.900
 that all those boys 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.379
 all come along 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.469
 and above all a lot of pain cost a lot of money but 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.409
 nothing she nobody has there 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.699
 it seems that this can change 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.709
 so when I told Tuesday's story on his website 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.899
 yes that is very nice but I still think that something like you already so often 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.579
 is not authorized you have everywhere but still from her own circle I do not know so 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.019
 good 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.019
 what was very special was that the first time I came here 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.379
 it counts 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.910
 he gets is the head and heart for this 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.699
 yes but to make power supplies 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.299
 then it hurts 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.219
 he pointed land will walk 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:52.029
 hendriks on it a few times 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.239
 and then the council has to go through it again and just go through it 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.040
 to clothing 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.539
 of it is a painful tooth 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:03.539
 x the audience it just stays 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.729
 since then headaches have appeared 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.539
 society if you have a headache yourself then you become it yourself 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:13.269
 updated game series mystique wants you in our hands at that place 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.469
 feel going ahead 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:18.540
 Tienen taught me other places 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.859
 first save just for a long time 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.280
 but eventually want to study 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.070
 I would die from myself that is a difficult victory for this 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.099
 leader, but they are very important 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.229
 geert wilders 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.379
 if i could i feel that i get a headache because 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.539
 to solve on the spot 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.609
 after another team that is really bad 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.769
 which is very, very special, perhaps, typical from that of our fathers 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.769
 not having barely made ends meet yet 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.909
 that is not fun and I always call a lot for chess then 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.579
 always a bit of everything that went wrong 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.379
 that here something where flat to play except I could not agree with the trade 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.389
 good to notice 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.479
 but besides that I'm not sure of his shares 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.279
 then it met 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.229
 with cd spray can 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:12.419
 And then that's a taste of a real one 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.170
 also rise 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.870
 he stopped giving up 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.139
 then pull on really hard 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.139
 I asked because it is already a lot gloomy than ever 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.280
 click here but i think i am 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.289
 a dogfight that is very visible right away 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.039
 he has done 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.449
 and then 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.559
 Immediately after the treatment if I was about ten centimeters the only one who could put on one 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:38.559
 solid surface for the first time 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:41.559
 the 23 year old singer would be kind of 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:45.629
 we sit 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.029
 wiljan plume i know 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.019
 the brand very much denies the progress itself continues as long as 

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:52.410
 the hand 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.949
 in the debate behind it barreled 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:55.779
 on one side
