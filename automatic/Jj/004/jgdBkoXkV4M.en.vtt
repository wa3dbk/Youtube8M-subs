00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.090 

I<00:01:21.969> guess<00:01:22.969> for<00:01:23.780> me<00:01:24.429> the<00:01:25.429> desire<00:01:25.909> than<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:27.100> started

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
I guess for me the desire than I started

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.919 
I guess for me the desire than I started
at<00:01:28.189> a<00:01:28.219> pretty<00:01:28.490> early<00:01:28.549> age<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.329> I<00:01:29.539> found<00:01:29.810> it's

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
at a pretty early age and I found it's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:30.850 
at a pretty early age and I found it's
very<00:01:29.990> important

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
very important

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.630 
very important
it<00:01:31.820> wasn't<00:01:32.179> that<00:01:32.210> I<00:01:32.750> just<00:01:33.079> what<00:01:34.009> I<00:01:34.039> could<00:01:34.310> do<00:01:34.490> it

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
I have designed and released about that

and set new goals and and what's the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.240 
and set new goals and and what's the
