work down the pant this is why i
personally<00:01:37.920> chose<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.939> use<00:01:39.119> these<00:01:39.359> when<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> was

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:39.959 
personally chose to use these when I was

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:42.410 
personally chose to use these when I was
playing<00:01:40.529> travel<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.490> stuff<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.179> is<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
playing travel and stuff this is a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.510 
playing travel and stuff this is a
stretch<00:01:42.779> lycra<00:01:43.079> material<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.919> that<00:01:44.279> really

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stretch lycra material and that really

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.099 
stretch lycra material and that really
helps<00:01:44.880> make<00:01:45.029> sure<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.359> is<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.539> almost<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
helps make sure this is a almost a

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.199 
helps make sure this is a almost a
compression<00:01:46.619> type<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.310> fit<00:01:47.520> around<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:48.209 
compression type of a fit around the

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.519 
compression type of a fit around the
player<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.719> it's<00:01:48.840> giving<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.139> the<00:01:49.169> maximum

00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:49.529 
player so it's giving you the maximum

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.529 
player so it's giving you the maximum
amount<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.919> mobility<00:01:50.459> it's<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.389> to<00:01:51.450> be

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
amount of mobility it's not going to be

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.879 
amount of mobility it's not going to be
too<00:01:51.749> loose<00:01:51.959> and<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.319> kind<00:01:52.469> of<00:01:52.499> what<00:01:52.649> kids

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:52.889 
too loose and that's kind of what kids

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:55.129 
too loose and that's kind of what kids
are<00:01:53.009> looking<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.609> days<00:01:53.849> now<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.990> have

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
and slide it around now this is one of

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.209 
and slide it around now this is one of
those<00:02:54.840> velcro<00:02:55.079> straps<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.680> was<00:02:55.799> telling<00:02:56.099> you

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
those velcro straps I was telling you

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.490 
those velcro straps I was telling you
about<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.419> where<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.780> actual<00:02:58.139> shell

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
about this is where the actual shell

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.729 
about this is where the actual shell
will<00:02:58.739> hook<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.159> to<00:02:59.430> we<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.299> one<00:03:00.599> in<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.500> back

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
will hook on to we have one in the back

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.319 
will hook on to we have one in the back
here<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.310> then<00:03:02.459> we<00:03:02.489> have<00:03:02.699> one<00:03:02.909> more<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
here and then we have one more on the

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.780 
here and then we have one more on the
side<00:03:03.569> so<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.500> helps<00:03:04.829> anchor<00:03:05.069> down<00:03:05.489> this

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
side so it really helps anchor down this

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.030 
side so it really helps anchor down this

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
one on the spinal protection and then

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.170 
one on the spinal protection and then
you<00:03:58.590> have<00:03:58.769> this<00:03:58.949> double<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.489> velcro<00:03:59.729> strap

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.729 
you have this double in the velcro strap
here<00:04:00.419> that's<00:04:00.629> coming<00:04:00.989> off<00:04:01.169> of<00:04:01.229> the<00:04:01.469> shell

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
here that's coming off of the shell

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.649 
here that's coming off of the shell
itself<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.790> slide<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.090> through<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.479> belt

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
itself and you slide it through the belt

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.439 
itself and you slide it through the belt
loop<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.139> then<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.620> give<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.859> a<00:04:05.009> really<00:04:05.250> nice

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
loop and then you give it a really nice

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.699 
loop and then you give it a really nice
strong<00:04:06.449> tug<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.409> it's<00:04:07.530> going<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
strong tug on it and it's going to

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.559 
strong tug on it and it's going to
really<00:04:07.859> give<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.250> nice<00:04:08.430> fast<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.120> hold<00:04:09.299> and

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
really give it a nice fast and hold and

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.390 
really give it a nice fast and hold and
then<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.109> could<00:04:10.259> tuck<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.620> under<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.069> you're

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
then you could tuck it under and you're

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.890 
then you could tuck it under and you're
ready<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.699> hit<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.090> ice<00:04:12.209> after<00:04:12.509> you've<00:04:12.750> got

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
ready to hit the ice after you've got

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.499 
ready to hit the ice after you've got
all<00:04:12.930> three<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:14.129> that<00:04:14.459> was<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.759> supreme<00:04:15.209> pant

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
all three so that was the supreme pant

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.509 
all three so that was the supreme pant
and<00:04:15.719> the<00:04:16.109> whole<00:04:16.320> idea<00:04:16.469> behind<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:17.070> supreme

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
and the whole idea behind that supreme

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.399 
and the whole idea behind that supreme
line<00:04:17.699> is<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.030> have<00:04:18.180> an<00:04:18.299> anatomical<00:04:19.139> tight

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
line is to have an anatomical tight

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.469 
line is to have an anatomical tight
fitting<00:04:19.859> pant<00:04:20.130> that's<00:04:20.639> why<00:04:20.789> they<00:04:20.969> took<00:04:21.120> last

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
fitting pant that's why they took last

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.029 
fitting pant that's why they took last
year<00:04:21.690> supreme<00:04:22.169> pants<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.650> made<00:04:22.860> them<00:04:23.010> the

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
year supreme pants and made them the

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.350 
year supreme pants and made them the
Nexus<00:04:23.520> ones<00:04:23.760> because<00:04:23.940> they<00:04:24.060> had<00:04:24.210> that

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
Nexus ones because they had that

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.120 
Nexus ones because they had that
traditional<00:04:24.930> fit<00:04:25.169> where<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.740> had<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.860> lot<00:04:26.099> of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
traditional fit where you had a lot of

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.640 
traditional fit where you had a lot of
relaxed<00:04:26.669> room<00:04:26.880> up<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.270> hits

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
relaxed room up in the hits

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.320 
relaxed room up in the hits
as<00:04:27.710> well<00:04:27.889> as<00:04:28.070> down<00:04:28.250> in<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.490> lower<00:04:28.639> thigh<00:04:28.970> areas

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
as well as down in the lower thigh areas

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.570 
as well as down in the lower thigh areas
this<00:04:29.870> is<00:04:29.930> essentially<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.740> quiet<00:04:30.979> opposite

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
this is essentially the quiet opposite

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.860 
this is essentially the quiet opposite
because<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:31.940> have<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> really<00:04:32.389> tight<00:04:32.630> and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
because you have a really tight and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.600 
because you have a really tight and
anatomical<00:04:33.440> fit<00:04:33.650> it's<00:04:34.130> almost<00:04:34.370> like<00:04:34.580> a

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610
