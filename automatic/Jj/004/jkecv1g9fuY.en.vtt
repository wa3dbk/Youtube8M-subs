00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
had a lot of thickness I naturally do

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.280 
had a lot of thickness I naturally do
have<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.040> care<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:37.489> it<00:00:38.489> would<00:00:38.610> always<00:00:38.820> grow

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
have to care but it would always grow

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.190 
have to care but it would always grow
about<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.500> two<00:00:40.770> inches<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.850> below<00:00:42.660> on<00:00:42.930> pit

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
about like two inches or so below on pit

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.520 
about like two inches or so below on pit
lane<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> actually<00:00:44.760> had<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.690> couple<00:00:46.289> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
lane and then I actually had a couple of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
lane and then I actually had a couple of
setbacks<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> wasn't<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:48.059> able<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
setbacks that I wasn't really able to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.170 
setbacks that I wasn't really able to
recover<00:00:49.020> from<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:50.610> everyone<00:00:51.030> always

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
recover from and like everyone always

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
recover from and like everyone always
says<00:00:51.480> health<00:00:51.870> over<00:00:52.320> length<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:55.260> here

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
says health over length right so here

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.279 
says health over length right so here
you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.160> where<00:00:56.579> my<00:00:57.059> ends<00:00:57.360> are<00:00:57.449> thin<00:00:57.660> it's

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you can see where my ends are thin it's

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.790 
you can see where my ends are thin it's
also<00:00:58.710> flat<00:00:59.250> ironed<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.530> half<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
also flat ironed here and half the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.110 
also flat ironed here and half the
thickness<00:01:02.010> right<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.609> then<00:01:02.730> look<00:01:02.910> at<00:01:03.000> those

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
thickness right and then look at those

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030 
thickness right and then look at those
scraggly<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.899> through<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:04.979> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
scraggly see through in so that's when I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.789 
scraggly see through in so that's when I
had<00:01:05.220> had<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.080> decided<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.110> go<00:01:07.260> ahead<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
had had it and decided to go ahead and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.810 
had had it and decided to go ahead and
transition<00:01:09.950> actually<00:01:10.950> originally<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> had

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
transition actually originally I had

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.210 
transition actually originally I had
decided<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.560> protect<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
style my hair for a while and after my

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460 
style my hair for a while and after my
end<00:01:16.950> still<00:01:17.369> hadn't<00:01:17.729> recovered<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.720> took<00:01:19.229> down<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

end still hadn't recovered I took down a
weed<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.070> spot<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> fresh<00:01:21.180> cut<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
weed and spot it with a fresh cut you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.530 
weed and spot it with a fresh cut you
can<00:01:22.200> see<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> sides<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.220> where<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:24.330> really

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
can see the sides here where it's really

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.899 
can see the sides here where it's really
sure<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.650> guy<00:01:25.799> took<00:01:25.860> my<00:01:26.220> bangs<00:01:26.460> really

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.929 
far back so this was the sort of
official<00:01:29.340> starting<00:01:30.119> point<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> my<00:01:30.509> transition
