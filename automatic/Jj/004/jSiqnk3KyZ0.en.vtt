00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.629
 this backlight I am now against the usual systems 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.639
 is composed of two parts that in the market of this APA in it the 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.329
 Unlock connection created so deeply unscrewed and on the other 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.630
 Page not the 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.250
 the bayonet one wants so high stood up these these objects 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.019
 easy to use 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.169
 kannste worked the practice follows 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.760
 we are all alive 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.780
 of course that's a bit of a bad example now because of this 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.760
 objective to the thing ran and camera 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.680
 already set this saving but we must now imagine that I 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.520
 no other one so important here that will be a normal future 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.770
 maybe not necessarily from Canon without this recess for this type of 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.080
 against you the cash registers do not finish least material surface of the system 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.330
 that one stole something on the Dekkers 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.550
 so 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.640
 So it would be here now for a time to criticism because I would 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.640
 this adapter these items adapter rings 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.200
 So even women in the thread that percent fictional leaped Cameron 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.320
 so 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 that brought strauss-kahn 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.790
 at the moment when I have these still deep in Drammen I can 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.760
 then here I just admit I am 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.760
 great cultural asset recess are that packaging 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.780
 fix 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.870
 because something has to hold then just the items in the right one 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.030
 Turn position 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.230
 we're all set for each show 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.220
 Of course, the advantage of such a system is that it is after that 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.750
 Cameroon use the camera again a fact 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.140
 and then it will also be percent 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.300
 is not enough so a Guttenberg in the sense of the group phase with dragging around 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.380
 That was the beginning of the objects 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.960
 decreases 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.440
 inverted world 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.200
 Drohsel also sports 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.940
 including were so before costs 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.250
 to cling on without holding on to the TV 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.720
 the advantage is that of course here is in principle the 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.790
 Lens hood is always there, even in the camera is not in use 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.840
 of course you can go up here now and find a suitable one 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.700
 Just insert the lens cap that the whole is also closed he is 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.209
 That's why I'm extra TSV Brunsbrock buy us 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.540
 ours is the whole and so in the middle of it there are, according to the words of 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.329
 systems 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.519
 but it's just not for everyone how objectively are others 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.550
 Expose manufacturer usable 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.690
 Therefore, I am not that goal if they are involved 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.099
 put the story is 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.189
 Actually, that was really not an important objective anyway 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.650
 Do not buy so if Tripolis works the one on the 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.299
 most needs
