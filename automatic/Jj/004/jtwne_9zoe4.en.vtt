00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.130

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.779
 cross and boat and I'll show you how 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.830
 get these three new characters 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 This is called the telephone booth 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.380
 messi and the goblin and before everything 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.510
 I want to thank my friend of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.980
 emilia ex channel in the description by 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.150
 give me this gameplay of the characters 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.489
 good without before everything I'm going to 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.100
 teach how to get the first 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.530
 good phone booth we are here 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.540
 in the gameplay and that's where always 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.199
 you just have to find a 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.360
 plain type in the gift and then 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.489
 which one is going to have a phone 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.890
 they even have to have a character 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.809
 new of these Irish I think this 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.379
 I was going to find this phone, nothing more 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.570
 they touch him they do not approach him and when he dies 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.799
 they will give them in the phone booth 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.799
 how are they going to be able to see right now 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.290
 edit then now we go with the 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.290
 next ernest and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.510
 well I think it's like the brother of 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.360
 hipster whale because it's the same 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.940
 way that the same form is the same 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.200
 to get it you have to find 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.680
 nessie in the water like right there in there 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.560
 right there you stand in it and the sea ​​and this one 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.800
 they give it to me or it's hipster way 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.030
 literally the heap sister www 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.300
 I do not know if it comes out with all the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:53.050
 characters but to ensure it, put yourself 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.360
 the Irish verwest good now let's 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.690
 with the following the elf 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.260
 good for the elf neither of thousands nor I 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.500
 we are sure of how it is but there are two 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.690
 theories after and first the one that I think 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.300
 that is fine that is the correct one that 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 you can see those as little plants in the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.490
 Well, right now, I think he's going to grab 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.840
 one if those are grabbed enough or 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.710
 several do not know if in a game or 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.260
 putting together several this there are possibilities 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.400
 that they are given the elf or I am 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.480
 as a type of cais in Chinese that came out 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.209
 a few weeks ago or a month ago 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.640
 disappeared or do they say that 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.190
 It could also be like craft moving 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.430
 a lot on the grass but I think the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.520
 The safest theory is that of grabbing 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.420
 these like little flowers that are shamrocks 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.910
 grabbing several of those I think that 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.960
 grabbing about 10 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.500
 15 I do not know if more 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.710
 I believe that with that they are measuring right now 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.600
 is the elf I think that with that 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.190
 they are going to give the elf they are not so 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.410
 difficult to get this time the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.930
 characters but good as you can see 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:14.890
 here and my friend got all and good 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.840
