little<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.100> more<00:00:53.250> strength<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.940> hard<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
little bit more strength to it's hard to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.229 
little bit more strength to it's hard to
tell<00:00:54.890> slides<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.280> pretty<00:00:56.520> quickly<00:00:56.820> I

of your frog as you can see it is a

I'll<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:39.990> able<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.320> better<00:01:40.500> than<00:01:40.619> I

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
I'll be able to be better than I

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.260 
I'll be able to be better than I
expected<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.460> when<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.759> looking<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.090> them

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
expected to when I was looking at them

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
expected to when I was looking at them
online<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.899> think<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.590> hold<00:01:43.740> up<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.070> lot

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
online I think it will hold up a lot

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.789 
online I think it will hold up a lot
better<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:45.630> legs<00:01:45.840> are<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> lot<00:01:46.619> more

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
better the legs are have a lot more

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.380 
better the legs are have a lot more
giving<00:01:47.220> them<00:01:47.369> than<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.610> expected<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.240> was

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
giving them than I expected when I was

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.639 
giving them than I expected when I was
ordering<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.780> online<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.350> looked<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> bit

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
ordering this online they looked a bit

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.889 
ordering this online they looked a bit
firmer<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.490> wasn't<00:01:51.060> sure<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.479> action<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.869> would

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
firmer I wasn't sure the action I would

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
firmer I wasn't sure the action I would
get<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.729> everything<00:01:53.729> about<00:01:53.939> them<00:01:54.149> is

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
get but everything about them is

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.719 
get but everything about them is
stretchy<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.500> think<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.130> frog<00:01:56.399> will<00:01:56.579> hold

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
stretchy so I think this frog will hold

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
stretchy so I think this frog will hold
up<00:01:56.850> pretty<00:01:56.969> well<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:57.899> depends<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.439> how

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
up pretty well it all depends on how

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.889 
up pretty well it all depends on how
well<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.159> fishes<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.729> will<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.420> when<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
well it fishes I will see when we get it

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.259 
well it fishes I will see when we get it
on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> water
