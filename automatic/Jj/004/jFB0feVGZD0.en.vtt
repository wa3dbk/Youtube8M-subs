the<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.239> from<00:00:54.449> burning<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.440> little<00:00:55.620> bit<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the bit from burning up a little bit it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.189 
the bit from burning up a little bit it
gives<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> little<00:00:56.910> bit<00:00:57.120> more<00:00:57.300> area<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:57.809> the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
come out exactly like you planned just

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.860 
come out exactly like you planned just
an<00:02:21.530> example<00:02:21.890> as<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.640> precision<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.299> using<00:02:23.750> a

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
router jig in this technique you can see

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.360 
router jig in this technique you can see
that<00:02:26.600> we<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.019> these<00:02:27.200> small<00:02:27.620> rings<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.280> are

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
that we have these small rings that are

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.000 
that we have these small rings that are
based<00:02:28.580> around<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.120> quarter<00:02:29.989> concentric<00:02:30.799> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
based around the quarter concentric and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.220 
based around the quarter concentric and
they<00:02:31.580> all<00:02:31.730> fit<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.840> each<00:02:32.959> other<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.540> also<00:02:35.540> we

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
they all fit to each other and also we

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.789 
they all fit to each other and also we
have<00:02:36.580> small<00:02:37.580> thin<00:02:38.569> aluminum<00:02:39.200> rings<00:02:39.560> can<00:02:39.769> be

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
have small thin aluminum rings can be

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.460 
have small thin aluminum rings can be
routed<00:02:40.069> out<00:02:40.280> with<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.489> router<00:02:40.760> also<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.540> you

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
routed out with a router also and you

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.250 
routed out with a router also and you
can<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:43.340> some<00:02:43.610> nice<00:02:43.790> trim<00:02:44.630> rings<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.110> things

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
can have some nice trim rings and things

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.900 
can have some nice trim rings and things
like<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.709> go<00:02:45.920> around<00:02:46.069> tweeters<00:02:46.549> and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.190 
or acrylic or ABS that you can cut and
this<00:02:55.040> technique<00:02:55.430> makes<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.299> pieces<00:02:56.690> exact

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
this technique makes the pieces exact

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.030 
this technique makes the pieces exact
fit<00:02:57.769> perfectly<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.609> it's<00:02:59.329> repeatable

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
fit perfectly and it's repeatable

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.020 
fit perfectly and it's repeatable
typically<00:03:01.040> if<00:03:01.190> you're<00:03:01.370> going<00:03:01.609> to<00:03:01.760> cut

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
typically if you're going to cut

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.580 
typically if you're going to cut
aluminum<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.780> thickest<00:03:03.049> you'd<00:03:03.200> want<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.440> go

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
aluminum the thickest you'd want to go

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.699 
aluminum the thickest you'd want to go
is<00:03:03.739> about<00:03:03.950> eighth<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:04.370> an<00:03:04.459> inch<00:03:04.579> because

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
is about eighth of an inch because

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.349 
is about eighth of an inch because
aluminum<00:03:06.709> is<00:03:07.040> hard<00:03:07.370> on<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.549> router<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:08.120> you

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
aluminum is hard on the router and you

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.180 
aluminum is hard on the router and you
want<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.630> use<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:09.109> proper<00:03:09.560> bit<00:03:09.769> which<00:03:10.010> would

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
want to use the proper bit which would

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.550 
want to use the proper bit which would
be<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> by<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.329> straight<00:03:11.750> cutting<00:03:12.019> bit<00:03:12.290> rather

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
be a by a straight cutting bit rather

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.210 
be a by a straight cutting bit rather
than<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.799> spiral<00:03:13.310> bit<00:03:13.489> to<00:03:13.819> cut<00:03:14.329> aluminum<00:03:15.220> just

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
than a spiral bit to cut aluminum just

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.220 
than a spiral bit to cut aluminum just
to<00:03:16.310> show<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:17.060> technique<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.690> how<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.870> cut

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
to show you the technique and how to cut

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.259 
to show you the technique and how to cut
rings<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.190> precision<00:03:19.819> around<00:03:20.150> the

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
rings of this precision around the

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.699 
rings of this precision around the
smaller<00:03:20.540> things<00:03:20.900> I'll<00:03:21.109> show<00:03:21.139> you<00:03:21.350> what<00:03:21.650> you're

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
smaller things I'll show you what you're

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.229 
smaller things I'll show you what you're
going<00:03:21.829> to<00:03:21.920> need<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.549> digital<00:03:23.209> caliper<00:03:23.590> and

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
going to need is a digital caliper and

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.240 
going to need is a digital caliper and
then<00:03:26.239> there's<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.540> little<00:03:27.049> technique<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.650> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
then there's a little technique and a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.830 
then there's a little technique and a
little<00:03:28.489> bit<00:03:28.579> of<00:03:28.700> calculation<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.600> want

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
little bit of calculation that you want

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.990 
little bit of calculation that you want
to<00:03:29.930> do<00:03:30.019> when<00:03:30.889> you're<00:03:31.010> making<00:03:31.040> precision<00:03:31.579> rings

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
to do when you're making precision rings

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.030 
to do when you're making precision rings
out<00:03:32.329> of<00:03:32.389> thinner<00:03:32.900> materials<00:03:33.590> you're<00:03:33.859> going<00:03:33.889> to

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
out of thinner materials you're going to

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.830 
out of thinner materials you're going to
have<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.280> use<00:03:34.459> some<00:03:34.790> double-sided<00:03:35.359> thin

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
have to use some double-sided thin

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.319 
have to use some double-sided thin
double-sided<00:03:36.200> tape<00:03:36.650> like<00:03:36.980> this<00:03:37.280> stuff<00:03:37.940> here

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
double-sided tape like this stuff here

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.210 
double-sided tape like this stuff here
from<00:03:38.600> mobile<00:03:38.870> solutions<00:03:39.350> it's<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.859> thin

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
from mobile solutions it's a thin

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.610 
from mobile solutions it's a thin
masking<00:03:41.120> tape<00:03:41.389> and<00:03:41.600> what<00:03:42.230> you're<00:03:42.350> going<00:03:42.500> to

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
masking tape and what you're going to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.970 
masking tape and what you're going to
want<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.859> do<00:03:43.069> is<00:03:43.930> use<00:03:44.930> quite<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.350> bit<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.769> it<00:03:45.950> so

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
want to do is use quite a bit of it so

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.270 
want to do is use quite a bit of it so
that<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:47.090> when<00:03:47.600> you've<00:03:47.780> cut<00:03:48.200> through<00:03:48.650> that

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
that that when you've cut through that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.839 
that that when you've cut through that
the<00:03:49.549> ring<00:03:49.730> doesn't<00:03:50.150> move<00:03:50.359> and

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
the ring doesn't move and

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.330 
the ring doesn't move and
gouge<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.930> edge<00:03:52.109> of<00:03:52.290> your<00:03:52.439> ring<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.069> want

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
gouge the edge of your ring so you want

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.160 
gouge the edge of your ring so you want
to<00:03:53.459> pretty<00:03:54.060> much<00:03:55.849> cover<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.060> entire<00:03:57.840> surface

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
to pretty much cover the entire surface

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.059 
to pretty much cover the entire surface
with<00:03:58.879> masking<00:03:59.879> tape<00:04:00.319> with<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.439> smaller<00:04:01.739> ring

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
with masking tape with the smaller ring

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.520 
with masking tape with the smaller ring
when<00:04:02.849> you're<00:04:02.969> done<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.510> has<00:04:03.629> a<00:04:03.659> really<00:04:04.200> small

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
when you're done it has a really small

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.250 
when you're done it has a really small
surface<00:04:05.010> area<00:04:05.249> so<00:04:05.670> if<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.879> don't<00:04:06.030> use<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.900> lot

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
surface area so if you don't use a lot

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.050 
surface area so if you don't use a lot
of<00:04:07.409> double<00:04:07.650> sided<00:04:07.769> tape<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.340> piece<00:04:08.639> will<00:04:08.819> move

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
of double sided tape the piece will move

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.149 
of double sided tape the piece will move
on<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.629> then<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.650> make<00:04:10.769> another<00:04:11.040> one

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
on you and then have to make another one

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.140 
on you and then have to make another one
and<00:04:11.519> because<00:04:12.389> this<00:04:12.540> material<00:04:13.109> is<00:04:13.200> so<00:04:13.230> thin<00:04:13.769> and

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
and because this material is so thin and

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.180 
and because this material is so thin and

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
than the center finder ruler to make

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.830 
than the center finder ruler to make
your<00:05:04.949> measurements<00:05:05.460> in<00:05:05.849> this<00:05:06.240> case<00:05:06.479> let's

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
your measurements in this case let's

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.399 
your measurements in this case let's
make<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:07.050> ring<00:05:07.409> that<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:08.570> inch<00:05:09.570> and<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.840> half<00:05:09.870> in

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
make a ring that is inch and a half in

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.200 
make a ring that is inch and a half in
diameter<00:05:11.150> exterior<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.560> inch<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.680> 3/8

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
diameter exterior and inch and 3/8

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.740 
diameter exterior and inch and 3/8
interior<00:05:15.210> diameter<00:05:15.470> so<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.800> ring<00:05:16.979> will<00:05:17.159> be<00:05:17.190> a

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
interior diameter so the ring will be a

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.290 
interior diameter so the ring will be a
the

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.830 
the
dick<00:05:19.560> when<00:05:20.560> using<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.640> calipers<00:05:22.180> what<00:05:22.750> we

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
dick when using the calipers what we

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.080 
dick when using the calipers what we
need<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.140> do<00:05:23.350> is<00:05:23.620> accommodate<00:05:24.280> for<00:05:24.880> the

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
need to do is accommodate for the

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.490 
need to do is accommodate for the
thickness<00:05:25.330> of<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:26.380> 8<00:05:26.950> inch<00:05:27.750> guide<00:05:28.750> pin<00:05:29.110> and

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
thickness of the 8 inch guide pin and

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.740 
thickness of the 8 inch guide pin and
what<00:05:30.130> we're<00:05:30.250> going<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.430> do<00:05:30.700> is<00:05:31.360> measure

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
what we're going to do is measure

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.900 
what we're going to do is measure
between<00:05:32.530> make<00:05:32.980> sure<00:05:33.130> that<00:05:33.280> your<00:05:33.430> router<00:05:33.580> is

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
between make sure that your router is

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.620 
between make sure that your router is
off<00:05:34.420> and<00:05:34.930> unplugged<00:05:38.580> plunge<00:05:39.580> plunge<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.450> base

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
off and unplugged plunge plunge the base

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.480 
off and unplugged plunge plunge the base
so<00:05:41.260> that<00:05:41.440> the<00:05:41.530> router<00:05:41.710> bit<00:05:41.920> is<00:05:41.980> sticking<00:05:42.370> up

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
so that the router bit is sticking up

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.380 
so that the router bit is sticking up
slightly<00:05:43.590> and<00:05:44.970> then<00:05:45.970> what<00:05:46.150> you're<00:05:46.240> going<00:05:46.330> to

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
slightly and then what you're going to

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.760 
slightly and then what you're going to
do<00:05:46.690> of<00:05:47.410> course<00:05:47.470> your<00:05:47.890> outer<00:05:48.100> ring<00:05:48.370> first<00:05:48.700> and

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
do of course your outer ring first and

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.400 
do of course your outer ring first and
measure<00:05:50.770> in<00:05:51.280> between<00:05:51.700> the<00:05:52.390> guide<00:05:52.780> pin<00:05:53.140> and

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
measure in between the guide pin and

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
measure in between the guide pin and
your<00:05:53.980> router<00:05:54.130> bit

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.270 

now<00:05:57.430> since<00:05:57.970> the<00:05:58.240> guide<00:05:58.960> pin<00:05:59.260> is<00:05:59.560> an<00:05:59.830> 8th<00:06:00.010> inch

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
now since the guide pin is an 8th inch

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.610 
now since the guide pin is an 8th inch
wide<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.850> decimal<00:06:01.330> equivalent<00:06:01.540> of<00:06:02.020> a<00:06:02.290> Finch

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
wide the decimal equivalent of a Finch

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.140 
wide the decimal equivalent of a Finch
is<00:06:03.090> 0.125<00:06:04.090> inches<00:06:05.220> half<00:06:06.220> of<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:06.550> is<00:06:06.790> going<00:06:06.910> to

is 0.125 inches half of that is going to

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.380 
is 0.125 inches half of that is going to
be<00:06:07.300> 0.06<00:06:07.960> 2<00:06:08.530> 5<00:06:08.830> or<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.670> 6<00:06:09.700> 3<00:06:10.270> when<00:06:10.810> you<00:06:10.900> round<00:06:11.140> up
