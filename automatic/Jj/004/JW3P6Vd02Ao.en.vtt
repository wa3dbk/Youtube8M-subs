make a difference and to do that you

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.220 
make a difference and to do that you
need<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:27.289> an<00:00:28.289> OTG<00:00:29.060> connection<00:00:30.230> adapter

our mouth and we in Roi we put that into
our<00:00:56.070> connector<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:57.770> we<00:00:58.770> plug<00:00:59.190> our<00:00:59.430> connector

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
our connector now we plug our connector

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.070 
our connector now we plug our connector
into<00:01:01.250> our<00:01:02.250> tablet<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.600> plugged<00:01:03.870> in

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
into our tablet now this is plugged in

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.730 
into our tablet now this is plugged in
through<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.400> docking<00:01:06.299> station<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:07.320> does<00:01:07.560> not

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
through the docking station it does not

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
through the docking station it does not
have<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.340> plugged<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.939> through<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> dock

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
have to be plugged in through the dock

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.740 
have to be plugged in through the dock
it<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.020> plugged<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.530> through<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:12.360> tablet

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it can be plugged in through the tablet

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
it can be plugged in through the tablet
itself<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.950> demonstration<00:01:14.240> purposes

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
itself but for demonstration purposes

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.249 
itself but for demonstration purposes
it's<00:01:15.810> easier<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.530> standing<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> we

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it's easier to have it standing up so we

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.539 
it's easier to have it standing up so we
plug<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.350> bottom<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.920> our<00:01:23.100> tablet

or into the dock and you'll see down the
bottom<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.780> comes<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.290> USB<00:01:29.009> connector

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
bottom here comes up USB connector

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.010 
bottom here comes up USB connector
connected<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> then<00:01:30.329> Mouse<00:01:30.630> connected<00:01:31.320> now

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
connected and then Mouse connected now

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.200 
connected and then Mouse connected now
when<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.430> comes<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:36.200> okay<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:39.000> been

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
when it comes on okay so now it's been

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
when it comes on okay so now it's been
hard<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.409> here<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.280> how

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
hard to see but just here we know how

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.800 
hard to see but just here we know how
the<00:01:41.490> cursor<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.710> now<00:01:44.450> scroll<00:01:45.450> through

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the cursor and we can now scroll through

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.520 
the cursor and we can now scroll through
things<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.430> scroll<00:01:47.939> through<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530

pages of our of our home screen or we

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.359 
pages of our of our home screen or we

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
can then go and click on different

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.020 
can then go and click on different
programs<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.950> no<00:02:02.670> he<00:02:02.850> knows

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
programs so you can see that no he knows

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.200 
programs so you can see that no he knows
I'm<00:02:03.149> not<00:02:03.180> touching<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.310> how<00:02:05.520> we

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
I'm not touching that so that's how we

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.510 
I'm not touching that so that's how we
connect<00:02:06.450> them<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.380> we've<00:02:07.560> got<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.069> new

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
connect them out and we've got a new

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.200 
connect them out and we've got a new
keyboard<00:02:08.879> here<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.110> could<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.470> use

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
keyboard here and we could just use

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.390 
keyboard here and we could just use
the<00:02:11.350> keyboard<00:02:12.350> on<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.260> dock<00:02:15.410> itself<00:02:15.770> well

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
the keyboard on on the dock itself well

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.180 
the keyboard on on the dock itself well
he<00:02:16.490> can<00:02:16.700> use<00:02:16.880> his<00:02:17.030> keyboard<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.890> already

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
he can use his keyboard and it's already

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.040 
he can use his keyboard and it's already
connected<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:20.000> exactly<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> same<00:02:20.570> way<00:02:20.930> it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
connected in exactly the same way it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.600 
connected in exactly the same way it
automatically<00:02:21.590> connected<00:02:22.100> with<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.400> mouse

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
automatically connected with the mouse

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.700 
automatically connected with the mouse
so<00:02:23.360> we<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.690> then<00:02:25.990> use<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:29.500> plus<00:02:30.500> plus

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
so we can then use the the plus plus

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.130 
so we can then use the the plus plus
plus<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:31.280> keyboard<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.060> comes<00:02:35.330> up<00:02:35.540> on

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
plus the keyboard and and it comes up on

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.070 
plus the keyboard and and it comes up on
your<00:02:36.320> screen<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.560> that's<00:02:39.860> how<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.160> connect<00:02:40.700> a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
your screen so that's how you connect a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.300 
your screen so that's how you connect a
keyboard<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.650> mouse<00:02:44.080> into<00:02:45.080> your<00:02:45.310> Samsung
