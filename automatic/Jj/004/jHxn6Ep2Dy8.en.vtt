when you're going we're going okay what
you<00:00:03.929> do<00:00:04.080> when<00:00:04.529> you're<00:00:04.620> carbonating<00:00:05.160> water<00:00:05.339> in

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
you do when you're carbonating water in

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.650 
you do when you're carbonating water in
a<00:00:06.259> pet<00:00:07.259> soda<00:00:07.620> bottle<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.220> first<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:09.030> burp<00:00:09.269> it

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
a pet soda bottle is first you burp it

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.259 
a pet soda bottle is first you burp it
that<00:00:09.900> means<00:00:10.139> squeeze<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.040> excess<00:00:11.940> oxygen

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
that means squeeze out the excess oxygen

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.750 
that means squeeze out the excess oxygen
because<00:00:13.019> oxygen<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.849> enemy<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.929> food<00:00:16.760> if

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
because oxygen is the enemy of food if

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.700 
because oxygen is the enemy of food if
you'll<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.210> rid<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.600> oxygen<00:00:19.230> you'll

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you'll get rid of the oxygen you'll

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.790 
you'll get rid of the oxygen you'll
breathe<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.070> little<00:00:20.310> easier<00:00:20.520> trust<00:00:21.119> me<00:00:21.359> because

breathe a little easier trust me because
you<00:00:22.800> only<00:00:23.070> want<00:00:23.250> co2<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> bottle<00:00:25.430> okay<00:00:26.430> now

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
you only want co2 in the bottle okay now

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.870 
you only want co2 in the bottle okay now
give<00:00:28.680> me<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> favor<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> take<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> look<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.730> this

give me a favor and take a look at this

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.450 
give me a favor and take a look at this
we're<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> dial<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.990> down<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.830> about<00:00:32.099> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
we're going to dial this down to about a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.090 
we're going to dial this down to about a
hundred<00:00:33.210> or<00:00:33.780> maybe<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.260> less<00:00:34.410> let's<00:00:34.920> get

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
hundred or maybe a little less let's get

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.380 
hundred or maybe a little less let's get
it<00:00:35.219> down<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.430> about<00:00:36.469> say<00:00:37.469> 50<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.820> psi

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it down to about say 50 or so psi

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.990 
it down to about say 50 or so psi
roughly<00:00:39.960> okay<00:00:40.950> we're<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> start<00:00:41.760> at

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
roughly okay we're going to start at

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.450 
roughly okay we're going to start at
it's<00:00:42.180> 50<00:00:42.450> psi<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.680> Roy<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:43.980> you'll<00:00:44.129> hold<00:00:44.280> this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it's 50 psi so Roy if you'll hold this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
it's 50 psi so Roy if you'll hold this
bottle<00:00:44.670> for<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> moment<00:00:45.329> stabilize<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> there

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bottle for a moment stabilize it there

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.700 
bottle for a moment stabilize it there
put<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.430> gloves<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.780> we're<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
put these gloves on and we're going to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.869 
put these gloves on and we're going to
start<00:00:50.070> out<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.430> about<00:00:50.489> 50<00:00:51.059> raise<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.879> what

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
start out at about 50 raise it to what

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.290 
start out at about 50 raise it to what
100<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.260> 150<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> 200<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> it'll<00:00:57.090> probably

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
100 then 150 and 200 and it'll probably

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.910 
100 then 150 and 200 and it'll probably
pop<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:58.170> 225<00:00:59.039> psi<00:00:59.789> most<00:01:00.920> beverage

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
pop at about 225 psi most beverage

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.939 
pop at about 225 psi most beverage
products<00:01:02.570> inside<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> bottle<00:01:04.049> typically

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
products inside of a bottle typically

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.700 
products inside of a bottle typically
have<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.339> 60<00:01:05.970> psi<00:01:06.600> which<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> four

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
have about 60 psi which is four

Roy all right we're going to put right
now<00:01:15.600> we're<00:01:15.900> putting<00:01:16.049> how<00:01:17.040> much<00:01:17.250> into<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
now we're putting how much into the to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.810 
now we're putting how much into the to
the<00:01:18.570> bottle<00:01:19.430> here<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> go

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the bottle here you go

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.260 
the bottle here you go
over<00:01:21.270> here<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.049> hungry<00:01:22.200> ready

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
over here just that are hungry ready

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.249 
over here just that are hungry ready
okay<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.610> we'll<00:01:26.610> bump<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
okay so we'll bump it up to about a

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.649 
okay so we'll bump it up to about a
hundred<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:29.000> okay<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.869> bottle<00:01:31.170> here

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
hundred now okay back on the bottle here

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.730 
hundred now okay back on the bottle here
okay<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> stops<00:01:34.369> when<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.400> equalized<00:01:36.740> all

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
okay it stops when we equalized all

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.899 
okay it stops when we equalized all
right<00:01:37.920> we're<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.280> bump<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> about

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
right we're going to bump it up to about

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.380 
right we're going to bump it up to about
a<00:01:39.060> hundred<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.750> what<00:01:39.990> roughly<00:01:40.409> 150<00:01:41.100> or<00:01:41.220> so

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
a hundred and what roughly 150 or so

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.170 
a hundred and what roughly 150 or so
back<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.600> bottle<00:01:43.670> okay<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.909> little<00:01:45.030> bit

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
back on the bottle okay so a little bit

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.400 
back on the bottle okay so a little bit
more<00:01:45.240> went<00:01:45.630> in

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.560 

bump<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.190> up<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.550> about<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.820> hundred<00:01:50.150> and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
bump it up to about a hundred and

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.720 
bump it up to about a hundred and
seventy-five<00:01:51.700> okay

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.190

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
you getting this thing it's starting to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.550 
you getting this thing it's starting to
deform<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.310> little<00:02:01.520> bit<00:02:01.640> can<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.850> see<00:02:02.060> that

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
deform a little bit can you see that

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.130 
deform a little bit can you see that
okay<00:02:03.560> get<00:02:03.800> a<00:02:03.830> little<00:02:04.010> closer<00:02:04.220> on<00:02:04.370> it

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
okay get a little closer on it

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.480 
okay get a little closer on it
bottle<00:02:06.140> starting<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.620> deform<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.310> get<00:02:07.400> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
bottle starting to deform and get the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.630 
bottle starting to deform and get the
psi<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:09.259> bottle<00:02:09.590> will<00:02:09.710> look<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.280> at

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
psi the bottle will look like this at

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.780 
psi the bottle will look like this at
about<00:02:10.880> whatever<00:02:11.210> psi<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.490> okay<00:02:13.490> let's<00:02:13.670> go

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
about whatever psi that is okay let's go

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.220 
about whatever psi that is okay let's go
ahead<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.030> pop<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.360> bottle<00:02:14.750> actually<00:02:15.050> let's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
ahead and pop the bottle actually let's

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.860 
ahead and pop the bottle actually let's
bump<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.590> about<00:02:16.450> 200<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.570> should

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
bump it to about 200 that should
