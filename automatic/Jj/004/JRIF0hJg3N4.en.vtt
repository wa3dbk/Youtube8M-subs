00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.640 

right<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.570> mini<00:00:03.810> I'm<00:00:04.049> just

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
right and this is the mini I'm just

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.140 
right and this is the mini I'm just
going<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.799> try<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.069> test<00:00:05.250> now<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.759> show<00:00:05.940> where

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
going to try and test now to show where

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.140 
going to try and test now to show where
power<00:00:06.509> could<00:00:06.720> be<00:00:06.870> breaking<00:00:07.820> it's<00:00:08.820> actually

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
power could be breaking it's actually

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.549 
power could be breaking it's actually
switched<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.960> as<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.380> can<00:00:10.500> see<00:00:12.290> we've<00:00:13.290> got<00:00:13.320> no

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
switched on as you can see we've got no

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.379 
switched on as you can see we've got no
power<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> front<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:14.460> you'll<00:00:15.179> see<00:00:15.299> that

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
power at the front here you'll see that

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.029 
power at the front here you'll see that
there's<00:00:15.599> many<00:00:15.719> different<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.410> know<00:00:16.710> from<00:00:16.920> no

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
there's many different you know from no

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.760 
there's many different you know from no
noise<00:00:17.279> no<00:00:17.550> volume<00:00:18.119> yeah<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.560> easiest

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
noise no volume yeah and the easiest

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.019 
noise no volume yeah and the easiest
thing<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.980> check<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.460> obvious<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.880> you've

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
thing to check is obvious that you've

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.849 
thing to check is obvious that you've
got<00:00:21.119> power<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.420> battery<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.140> easy<00:00:22.590> thing<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
got power in a battery so easy thing to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.320 
got power in a battery so easy thing to
do<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.279> take<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> test<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> screwdriver

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
do is just take a test of screwdriver

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.050 
do is just take a test of screwdriver
put<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.470> negative<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> positive

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
put it on the negative and the positive

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.050 
put it on the negative and the positive
and<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.050> we've<00:00:28.199> got<00:00:28.320> power<00:00:29.000> now<00:00:30.000> you

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and as you see we've got power now you

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.450 
and as you see we've got power now you
have<00:00:30.300> got<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> fuse<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.710> all<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> cars

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
have got a fuse that is on all the cars

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.569 
have got a fuse that is on all the cars
it<00:00:33.450> goes<00:00:33.630> from<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> battery<00:00:35.040> into<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> fuse

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
it goes from the battery into the fuse

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.299 
it goes from the battery into the fuse
and<00:00:35.610> back<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.500> basically<00:00:37.500> background<00:00:37.800> here

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
and back out basically background here

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.670 
and back out basically background here
and<00:00:38.520> into<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> charger<00:00:39.450> pool<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.500> check

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and into the charger pool so if we check

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.950 
and into the charger pool so if we check
here<00:00:41.040> we've<00:00:41.399> got<00:00:41.520> power<00:00:41.790> left<00:00:42.329> charger<00:00:42.750> pull

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
here we've got power left charger pull

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
here we've got power left charger pull
and<00:00:43.469> then<00:00:43.890> we've<00:00:44.010> got<00:00:44.100> power<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> one

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and then we've got power at the one

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.090 
and then we've got power at the one
below<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.570> well<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> means<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> pair<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
below as well so that means the pair of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.229 
below as well so that means the pair of
jorts<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> running<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> battery<00:00:48.000> into

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
jorts you running from the battery into

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
jorts you running from the battery into
the<00:00:48.390> charge<00:00:48.570> port<00:00:48.780> back<00:00:49.020> out<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.680> you'll

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the charge port back out and as you'll

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.760 
the charge port back out and as you'll
see<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.190> wire<00:00:50.460> here<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.660> wire<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.320> runs

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
see this wire here is the wire then runs

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.529 
see this wire here is the wire then runs
and<00:00:53.010> fleets<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.370> power<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.090> front<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
and fleets of power to the front of the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.410 
and fleets of power to the front of the
car<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:55.590> presumably<00:00:56.039> we've<00:00:56.820> got<00:00:57.000> no<00:00:57.090> power<00:00:57.270> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
car now presumably we've got no power in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.970 
car now presumably we've got no power in
front<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.690> car<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.079> same<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.410> yourself<00:00:58.770> but

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
front of car the same as yourself but

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
front of car the same as yourself but
we've<00:00:59.460> got<00:00:59.579> power<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.510> there's<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we've got power here so there's just a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560 
we've got power here so there's just a
break<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> circuit<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.510> saying

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
break in the circuit so as I was saying

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
break in the circuit so as I was saying
if<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.080> turn<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.470> car<00:01:04.680> over<00:01:06.320> side<00:01:07.400> underneath

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
if we turn the car over side underneath

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
if we turn the car over side underneath
where<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.670> switches<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:13.229> would

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
where the switches are you would

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.609 
where the switches are you would
actually<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.939> yeah<00:01:14.939> where<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.840> red<00:01:16.080> lead

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
actually see yeah where that red lead

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.560 
actually see yeah where that red lead
runs<00:01:17.159> along<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.820> comes<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> switch

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
runs along and comes on to the switch

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.020 
runs along and comes on to the switch
wire<00:01:18.810> now<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> smooth<00:01:20.009> switch<00:01:20.220> wire<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.970> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
wire now the smooth switch wire as you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.320 
wire now the smooth switch wire as you
see<00:01:21.330> we've<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:21.540> power<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:23.030> well<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.150> haven't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
see we've got power here well we haven't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.679 
see we've got power here well we haven't
got<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:25.320> any<00:01:25.470> power<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.509> is

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
got is any power here and this is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
got is any power here and this is
basically<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.799> wire<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.340> has<00:01:29.670> come

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
basically because the wire here has come

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.080 
basically because the wire here has come
disconnected<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.220> you've<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.610> power<00:01:32.880> up

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
disconnected so if you've got power up

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.170 
disconnected so if you've got power up
to<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.360> point<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.829> not<00:01:35.189> obviously<00:01:35.909> coming

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
to this point and not obviously coming

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
to this point and not obviously coming
out<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> other<00:01:36.600> side<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> where

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
out the other side then this is where

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.380 
out the other side then this is where
the<00:01:38.400> problem<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> could<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> faulty

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the problem is it could be a faulty

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
the problem is it could be a faulty
switch<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> wires<00:01:40.170> are<00:01:40.380> connected<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
switch if the wires are connected it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.069 
switch if the wires are connected it
could<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> edge<00:01:42.899> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
could just be this one that the edge of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.899 
could just be this one that the edge of
wire<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.799> has<00:01:43.979> broken<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.579> come<00:01:44.729> out

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
wire you know has broken and come out

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.899 
wire you know has broken and come out
come<00:01:45.420> inside<00:01:45.750> if<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.590> put<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.890> inside<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
come inside if I put that inside and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.539 
come inside if I put that inside and
there<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:49.079> take<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> other<00:01:49.500> side<00:01:49.829> isn't<00:01:50.399> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
there and take the other side isn't you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.310 
there and take the other side isn't you
see<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.880> actually<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.180> broken<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.049> it

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
see this is actually a broken one so it

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
see this is actually a broken one so it
won't<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:52.649> work<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.729> easiest

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
won't actually work now the easiest

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.630 
won't actually work now the easiest
thing<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:55.740> case<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.100> why<00:01:56.250> always<00:01:56.430> come

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
thing to do in case you why always come

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
thing to do in case you why always come
off<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> matter<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.750> simply

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
off it's just as a matter of simply

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.590 
off it's just as a matter of simply
putting<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.439> on<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:59.189> it<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> broken

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
putting it back on if it is a broken

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.569 
putting it back on if it is a broken
wire<00:02:01.229> let's<00:02:01.409> come<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.710> maybe<00:02:01.920> from<00:02:02.369> in

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
wire let's come out maybe from in

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.459 
wire let's come out maybe from in
transit<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.030> something<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.170> by

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
transit or something then just by

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.740 
transit or something then just by
connecting<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.219> there<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.600> you're

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
connecting that on there so you're

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.080 
connecting that on there so you're
bypassing<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.439> switch<00:02:07.680> you'll<00:02:08.399> now<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.670> when

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
bypassing the switch you'll now see when

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.910 
bypassing the switch you'll now see when
you<00:02:09.179> look<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> top<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
you look on the top we now have the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920 
you look on the top we now have the
ignition<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
ignition and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.589 
ignition and
everything<00:02:12.170> comes<00:02:12.409> on<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:13.040> we've<00:02:13.189> got<00:02:13.599> you

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
everything comes on and we've got you

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.589 
everything comes on and we've got you
know<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.170> music<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:15.980> things<00:02:16.159> yeah<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:17.390> if

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
know the music and things yeah and if

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.199 
know the music and things yeah and if
you<00:02:17.750> put<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.959> car<00:02:18.170> into<00:02:18.290> forward<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:20.120> would

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
you put the car into forward we would

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.839 
you put the car into forward we would
actually<00:02:20.329> have<00:02:20.659> power<00:02:21.379> as<00:02:21.560> well<00:02:21.769> so<00:02:22.519> I'm

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
actually have power as well so I'm

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.849 
actually have power as well so I'm
presuming<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.810> as<00:02:24.049> long<00:02:24.230> as<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.409> battery<00:02:24.739> is

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
presuming that as long as the battery is

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.839 
presuming that as long as the battery is
good<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.430> you've<00:02:25.549> got<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.909> vehicle<00:02:26.379> and

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
good that you've got on the vehicle and

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.069 
good that you've got on the vehicle and
that<00:02:28.849> you've<00:02:29.000> got<00:02:29.030> power<00:02:29.450> from<00:02:29.659> this<00:02:29.810> point

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
that you've got power from this point

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.709 
that you've got power from this point
going<00:02:30.889> in<00:02:31.159> this<00:02:31.340> lit<00:02:31.700> red<00:02:31.849> lead<00:02:32.090> through<00:02:32.510> to

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
going in this lit red lead through to

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.959 
going in this lit red lead through to
where<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.900> am<00:02:33.109> at<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.290> moment<00:02:33.680> then<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.700> brake

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969 
where I am at the moment then the brake

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.520 
where I am at the moment then the brake
is<00:02:35.180> up<00:02:35.299> here<00:02:35.599> which<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.810> more<00:02:36.049> than<00:02:36.139> likely<00:02:36.260> as

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
is up here which is more than likely as

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.780 
is up here which is more than likely as
I<00:02:36.560> said<00:02:36.799> on<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.129> power<00:02:37.400> switch<00:02:37.579> to<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
I said on this power switch to the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.440 
I said on this power switch to the
on/off<00:02:38.090> switch<00:02:38.359> yeah<00:02:38.980> if<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.819> are<00:02:40.939> testing<00:02:41.329> it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
on/off switch yeah if you are testing it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.569 
on/off switch yeah if you are testing it
and<00:02:41.599> you're<00:02:41.810> getting<00:02:42.109> no<00:02:42.469> power<00:02:42.829> or<00:02:43.400> you're

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
and you're getting no power or you're

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.190 
and you're getting no power or you're
getting<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:43.909> the<00:02:44.000> battery<00:02:44.389> but<00:02:44.930> then<00:02:45.079> you're

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
getting on the battery but then you're

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.899 
getting on the battery but then you're
getting<00:02:45.319> no<00:02:45.530> power<00:02:45.829> from<00:02:46.129> after<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.639> fuse

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
getting no power from after the fuse

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.059 
getting no power from after the fuse
then<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.689> could<00:02:47.810> simply<00:02:48.109> just<00:02:48.139> be<00:02:48.409> the<00:02:48.530> fuse<00:02:48.799> in

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
then it could simply just be the fuse in

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.250 
then it could simply just be the fuse in
here<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.639> again<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.389> simple<00:02:50.720> way<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.900> do<00:02:51.079> that

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
here and again the simple way to do that

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.289 
here and again the simple way to do that
is<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.680> take<00:02:51.859> the<00:02:51.980> fuse<00:02:52.189> out<00:02:52.370> join<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.150> two

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
is to take the fuse out join the two

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.390 
is to take the fuse out join the two
wires<00:02:53.599> by<00:02:53.930> bypassing<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.680> fuse<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.159> if<00:02:55.280> you

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
wires by bypassing the fuse and if you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.159 
wires by bypassing the fuse and if you
get<00:02:55.579> power<00:02:55.849> you<00:02:56.120> know<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.719> the<00:02:56.780> fuse<00:02:57.019> is

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:57.169 
get power you know that the fuse is

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.050 
get power you know that the fuse is
blown<00:02:57.290> which<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.250> know<00:02:58.370> we<00:02:58.459> can<00:02:58.579> simply<00:02:58.879> send

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
blown which you know we can simply send

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.479 
blown which you know we can simply send
you<00:02:59.239> another<00:02:59.689> fuse<00:03:00.109> and<00:03:00.889> so<00:03:01.159> that<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.340> what<00:03:01.459> I

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
you another fuse and so that is what I

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.330 
you another fuse and so that is what I
check<00:03:01.790> first<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.389> as<00:03:02.629> I<00:03:02.659> say<00:03:02.870> run<00:03:03.169> the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
check first and as I say run the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.740 
check first and as I say run the
underneath<00:03:04.340> test<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.909> power<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.540> point

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
underneath test the power to this point

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.269 
underneath test the power to this point
here<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.519> then<00:03:07.519> let<00:03:07.700> me<00:03:07.760> know<00:03:07.790> how<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.090> get<00:03:08.209> on
