section<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.500> tubing<00:04:33.389> we're<00:04:34.389> going<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.660> go<00:04:34.810> in

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
section of tubing we're going to go in

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.790 
section of tubing we're going to go in
to<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.550> ionizer<00:04:37.120> this<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.960> end<00:04:38.139> section

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
to the ionizer this is the end section

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.260 
to the ionizer this is the end section
this<00:04:38.950> is<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.250> section<00:04:39.490> where<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:39.790> says<00:04:39.880> number

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
this is the section where it says number

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.230 
this is the section where it says number
one<00:04:40.570> filter<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.520> we're<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.760> go<00:04:42.910> to<00:04:42.940> our

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
one filter and we're going to go to our

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.560 
one filter and we're going to go to our
wool<00:04:43.660> supply<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.520> first<00:04:45.790> place<00:04:46.030> we<00:04:46.150> want

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
wool supply so the first place we want

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.050 
wool supply so the first place we want
water<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:47.080> go<00:04:47.260> is<00:04:47.470> coming<00:04:48.070> out<00:04:48.250> of<00:04:48.310> your<00:04:48.790> main

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
water to go is coming out of your main

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.200 
water to go is coming out of your main
supply<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.130> in<00:04:51.400> section<00:04:52.000> of<00:04:52.120> the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
supply and to the in section of the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.450 
supply and to the in section of the
ionizer<00:04:52.720> so<00:04:53.200> we'll<00:04:53.350> just<00:04:53.380> clip<00:04:53.830> this<00:04:54.040> in<00:04:56.460> if

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
ionizer so we'll just clip this in if

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.420 
ionizer so we'll just clip this in if
you<00:04:58.240> have<00:04:58.390> one<00:04:58.660> of<00:04:58.780> these<00:04:59.100> that<00:05:00.100> would<00:05:00.280> also

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
you have one of these that would also

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.570 
you have one of these that would also
include<00:05:01.500> this<00:05:02.500> is<00:05:02.740> for<00:05:02.919> three<00:05:03.160> eighths<00:05:03.310> inch

thread this is for half inch they both

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.159 
thread this is for half inch they both
do<00:05:06.640> the<00:05:06.669> same<00:05:06.790> exact<00:05:07.330> thing<00:05:07.570> they're<00:05:07.780> just<00:05:07.990> for

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
do the same exact thing they're just for

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.070 
do the same exact thing they're just for
different<00:05:08.500> sized<00:05:08.680> faucets<00:05:09.510> if<00:05:10.510> you<00:05:10.660> have<00:05:10.840> this

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
different sized faucets if you have this

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.780 
different sized faucets if you have this
that<00:05:11.440> would<00:05:11.590> be<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.830> same<00:05:12.070> exact<00:05:12.490> thing

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
that would be the same exact thing

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.330 
that would be the same exact thing
you'll<00:05:13.750> just<00:05:13.900> have<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.260> connected<00:05:14.560> into<00:05:15.010> here

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
you'll just have it connected into here

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.409 
you'll just have it connected into here
like<00:05:15.970> this<00:05:16.270> if<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:17.889> get<00:05:18.430> this<00:05:18.640> is<00:05:18.850> plugged<00:05:19.180> in

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
like this if you get this is plugged in

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.510 
like this if you get this is plugged in
and<00:05:19.690> you<00:05:19.870> turn<00:05:20.110> your<00:05:20.290> water<00:05:20.470> supply<00:05:20.890> on<00:05:21.280> and

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
and you turn your water supply on and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.340 
and you turn your water supply on and
you<00:05:21.610> see<00:05:21.820> drips<00:05:22.150> coming<00:05:22.419> out<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:22.690> here<00:05:22.960> nine

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
you see drips coming out of here nine

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.340 
you see drips coming out of here nine
times<00:05:23.680> out<00:05:23.919> of<00:05:23.979> 10<00:05:24.370> it's<00:05:24.870> because<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:26.080> scissor

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
times out of 10 it's because the scissor

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.630 
times out of 10 it's because the scissor
cut<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:26.919> did<00:05:27.160> left<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.880> line<00:05:28.090> too<00:05:28.450> jagged

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
cut you did left the line too jagged

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.100 
cut you did left the line too jagged
that's<00:05:30.640> the<00:05:30.820> case<00:05:31.030> take<00:05:31.450> it<00:05:31.600> with<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.840> scissor

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
that's the case take it with the scissor

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.140 
that's the case take it with the scissor
and<00:05:32.410> cut<00:05:32.470> it<00:05:32.770> again<00:05:33.100> if<00:05:33.370> you<00:05:33.610> don't<00:05:33.729> see<00:05:34.000> the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
and cut it again if you don't see the

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.390 
and cut it again if you don't see the
edges<00:05:34.330> are<00:05:34.690> round<00:05:34.960> and<00:05:35.140> smooth<00:05:35.440> maybe<00:05:36.280> the

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
edges are round and smooth maybe the

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.890 
edges are round and smooth maybe the
best<00:05:36.610> thing<00:05:36.729> to<00:05:36.970> do<00:05:37.090> is<00:05:37.210> get<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.419> razor<00:05:37.720> blade

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
best thing to do is get a razor blade

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.130 
best thing to do is get a razor blade
and<00:05:38.320> cut<00:05:38.410> it<00:05:38.950> it<00:05:39.910> has<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.330> be<00:05:40.360> smooth<00:05:40.780> on<00:05:41.020> the

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
and cut it it has to be smooth on the

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.490 
and cut it it has to be smooth on the
edge<00:05:41.289> or<00:05:41.560> else<00:05:41.680> it<00:05:41.830> won't<00:05:42.039> make<00:05:42.160> a<00:05:42.220> proper<00:05:42.729> seal

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
edge or else it won't make a proper seal

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.820 
edge or else it won't make a proper seal
so<00:05:44.500> now<00:05:44.740> you've<00:05:45.340> got<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:46.120> water<00:05:46.419> supply

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
so now you've got the water supply

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.070 
so now you've got the water supply
connected<00:05:47.830> into<00:05:48.130> here<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:48.700> you<00:05:49.660> can<00:05:49.810> take

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
connected into here and you can take

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.300 
connected into here and you can take
this<00:05:50.260> blue<00:05:50.590> valve<00:05:50.890> and<00:05:51.220> turn<00:05:51.729> it<00:05:51.789> sideways<00:05:52.240> and

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
this blue valve and turn it sideways and

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.130 
this blue valve and turn it sideways and
turn<00:05:54.310> on<00:05:54.550> your<00:05:54.729> water<00:05:54.970> supply<00:05:55.270> now<00:05:55.720> and<00:05:55.930> send

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
turn on your water supply now and send

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.040 
turn on your water supply now and send
pressure<00:05:56.500> to<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.190> unit<00:05:57.520> this<00:05:58.330> is<00:05:58.539> turned<00:05:58.810> off

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
pressure to the unit this is turned off

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.900 
pressure to the unit this is turned off
so<00:05:59.350> there<00:05:59.530> no<00:05:59.800> water<00:06:00.100> will<00:06:00.340> come<00:06:00.520> out<00:06:00.580> this

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
so there no water will come out this

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.610 
so there no water will come out this
other<00:06:01.150> side<00:06:03.300> we<00:06:04.300> highly<00:06:04.840> recommend<00:06:04.870> that<00:06:05.530> you

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
other side we highly recommend that you

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.920 
other side we highly recommend that you
flush<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.160> filters<00:06:06.880> out<00:06:07.060> before<00:06:07.570> connecting

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
flush the filters out before connecting

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.750 
flush the filters out before connecting
it<00:06:08.320> to<00:06:08.350> your

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
it to your

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.720 
it to your
ionizer<00:06:09.800> so<00:06:10.800> before<00:06:11.040> we<00:06:11.370> take<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.420> supply<00:06:12.900> end

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
ionizer so before we take the supply end

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.440 
ionizer so before we take the supply end
and<00:06:15.860> connect<00:06:16.860> it<00:06:17.040> into<00:06:17.250> the<00:06:17.550> ionizer<00:06:18.090> which

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
and connect it into the ionizer which

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.750 
and connect it into the ionizer which
will<00:06:18.690> be<00:06:18.810> your<00:06:18.960> final<00:06:19.170> step<00:06:22.100> so<00:06:23.100> once<00:06:23.340> this<00:06:23.550> is

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
will be your final step so once this is

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.790 
will be your final step so once this is
plugged<00:06:24.060> in<00:06:24.270> here<00:06:26.840> your<00:06:27.840> installation<00:06:28.650> is
