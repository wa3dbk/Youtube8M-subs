support of the back these include the
stomach<00:01:54.200> muscles<00:01:54.410> in<00:01:54.849> fact<00:01:55.849> one<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.479> major

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
stomach muscles in fact one of the major

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.749 
stomach muscles in fact one of the major
reasons<00:01:57.259> why<00:01:57.349> people<00:01:57.500> get<00:01:57.950> lower<00:01:58.190> back<00:01:58.459> pain

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
reasons why people get lower back pain

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.999 
reasons why people get lower back pain
is<00:01:58.970> simply<00:01:59.750> because<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.440> weak<00:02:00.619> stomach

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
is simply because of weak stomach

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.930 
is simply because of weak stomach
muscles<00:02:02.619> let's<00:02:03.619> talk<00:02:03.950> about<00:02:04.129> how<00:02:04.489> the<00:02:04.550> back

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
muscles let's talk about how the back

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.389 
muscles let's talk about how the back
gets<00:02:05.179> injured<00:02:05.539> an<00:02:06.140> obvious<00:02:06.649> reason<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:07.069> trauma

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
gets injured an obvious reason is trauma

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.029 
gets injured an obvious reason is trauma
things<00:02:08.149> like<00:02:08.360> falling<00:02:08.899> car<00:02:09.440> accidents<00:02:09.979> and

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
things like falling car accidents and

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.670 
things like falling car accidents and

direct blows caused back injury what I

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.500 
direct blows caused back injury what I
want<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.010> focus<00:02:13.129> on<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.790> chronic<00:02:14.330> back

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
want to focus on is that chronic back
