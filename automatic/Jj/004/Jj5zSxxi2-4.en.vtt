00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:07.469 
you guys can see his cars fully

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:08.870 
you guys can see his cars fully
invisible<00:01:08.040> miss<00:01:08.190> characters<00:01:08.640> fully

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
invisible miss characters fully

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
invisible miss characters fully
invisible<00:01:09.420> even<00:01:09.690> when<00:01:10.020> he<00:01:10.110> gets<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.500> because

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
invisible even when he gets out because

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.620 
invisible even when he gets out because
gonna<00:01:10.890> start<00:01:11.190> punching<00:01:11.370> me<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:12.180> can't<00:01:12.390> see

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
gonna start punching me and I can't see

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.940 
gonna start punching me and I can't see
him<00:01:12.690> on<00:01:12.870> the<00:01:12.900> radar<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.680> glitch

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
him on the radar so this glitch

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.680 
him on the radar so this glitch
basically<00:01:14.400> makes<00:01:14.580> me<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.940> like<00:01:15.210> God<00:01:15.420> mom

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
basically makes me have like God mom

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.390 
basically makes me have like God mom
guessing<00:01:16.140> because<00:01:16.260> if<00:01:16.890> he's<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.190> on<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
guessing because if he's not on the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399 
guessing because if he's not on the
radar<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> guys<00:01:18.240> cannot<00:01:18.720> walk<00:01:18.960> onto<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
radar then you guys cannot walk onto it

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.899 
radar then you guys cannot walk onto it
with<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> weapon<00:01:19.950> unless<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.369> get<00:01:20.490> lucky<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
with the weapon unless you get lucky and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.730 
with the weapon unless you get lucky and
spray<00:01:21.270> him<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.260> it's<00:01:22.470> basically

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
spray him but you know it's basically

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.500 
spray him but you know it's basically
good<00:01:22.979> invincibility<00:01:23.549> glitch<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.240> you're

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
good invincibility glitch because you're

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.170 
good invincibility glitch because you're
invisible<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:26.010> car<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.250> invisible<00:01:26.850> not

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
invisible and your car is invisible not

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.100 
invisible and your car is invisible not
off<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.510> radar<00:01:27.690> so<00:01:27.900> you're<00:01:28.020> basically

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
off the radar so you're basically

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.200 
off the radar so you're basically
