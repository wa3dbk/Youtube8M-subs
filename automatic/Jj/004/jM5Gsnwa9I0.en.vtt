00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.190
 clutch now when I press the clutch 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.350
 she starts to whistle a little bit different 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.710
 the sound I went to the repairman 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.769

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.479

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.410
 sample he call that they walk better and 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.410
 Here is such a bearing I bought 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.970
 kind of like he is german and so here he is 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.970

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:37.330
 sort of dropped it and now I'm on my way 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.970

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.030
 squeeze bearing I looked at youtube 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.259
 Of course you can change yourself but there 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.830
 hemorrhoids on it all apart here 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.630
 repair costs 2000 is not much is not enough 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.380
 after all, it's a bit too much up to 2000 rubles 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.090
 just for the repair and this is the part 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.700
 bearing itself costs 410 rubles but 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.610
 I'm going now 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.550
 I hope he won't fix this problem 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 replacing this bearing here and then 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:15.569
 I'll show you what happened so here I am 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.590
 picked up the car in general clutch not 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:23.180
 clutch problem not fixed 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.859
 the case turned out to be a push-pull 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.530
 show you the old clutch release from him 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:32.599
 left 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.599
 the clutch is now quiet 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:43.560
 still the master replaced me with two belts because 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:48.310
 that they were also in poor condition and 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.010
 adjusted valve that's paid for 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.010
 all for all the work two and a half thousand 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.410
 plus I paid 400 rubles for two belts 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.330
 and respectively for the releaser itself 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.240
 bearing 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.550
 410 rubles now I will show you old 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.400
 release bearing 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.790
 that's what happened to him in general, he said 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.670
 what else would be a little bit and 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.500
 they could not fly too 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.800
 because they are information because they 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.290
 the box was also in poor condition 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.540
 also this basket itself could also 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.390
 on return because of this bearing 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.640
 that is, during the time I turned of course this 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.060
 I already had this business for a long time 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.700
 so it was noisy but already when in the end he 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.520
 became very noisy when some 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.370
 squeak here he started recently he 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.810
 he squeaked earlier he just made noise later we 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.590
 push the clutch goes such 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:48.300
 some squeak and of course then I already 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:52.560
 and drove the car to repair 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.560
 here it turns out the old bearing 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.890
 scrolls old belts with these 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.310
 creases and three less bullets make me good 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:18.799
 know in the inside of the crease on 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.799
 this ring being again 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:39.720
 In general, 3000 on the mountain, by the way, yes, I 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.720
 said yes and from the sea 4 all rubles
