00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.240
 hello this mode here to explain you not tutorial about for example 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.810
 something very snowing these days 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.360
 which is how to place the iphone applications within what would be the arc 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.019
 touch that does not bring 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.629
 of fabric 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.960
 it's quite simple, you just have to follow the steps that it will dictate 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 continuation 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.399
 first of all we have to go visit them 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.500
 that they should have already installed 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
 after looting the hiccup 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.440
 later we have to go 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.920
 here in the corner sos is the last 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.030
 icon we understand that adding a font 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.700
 in agreement a show is 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.890
 to what would be the triumphs we have to go to erick 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.710
 who in the other corner 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.490
 and here 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.399
 we must write 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.990
 in the following 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.130
 repo 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.420
 rl 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 eye 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.200
 vs 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.590
 we thought jocay 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.850
 now it will take a little bit of grass to smooth it out 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.330
 by the source which we have added a 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.610
 and once finished doing this it will not include as we will see below 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.850
 a folder 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.360
 what will we see next? 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.540
 It will take a little bit of agreement 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.960
 as long as they add 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.030
 something to the ipod 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.080
 so sane 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.120
 when 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.430
 nor if I will not be many times the source will weigh 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.430
 and this will take a little 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.870
 the gas 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.579
 navigazione that can be installed from the iphone has your expo 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.790
 the following are four series google maps 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.970
 movement 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.830
 move equality 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.019
 what is the mail 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.139
 the google earth the program 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.939
 typical google 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.369
 Time wind up your city or neglect that you want 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.110
 and also notice a 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.639
 a note script 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.640
 once this is done we give him adam 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.429
 where 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.429
 and we have added 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.160
 here 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.309
 which would 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.729
 percent 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.769
 This would be what we have said we give the start button 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:40.699
 I remember 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:41.690
 for 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.939
 take it to the menu again 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.140
 and environmental 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.449
 inside whatever the folder urges 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.269
 where we will leave the whole application 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.720
 memories have to appear 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.379
 another folder 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.579
 There are 1 point 1 point 1 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.399
 acz fort 

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:00.399
 Opa and fire 1 point 1 1 points 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.489
 these would be 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.900
 what applications should they see from the version they have equipment 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:12.469
 while and has version 1 point 1 point 1 because it did not update them 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:17.780
 usi will use the file to 1-point 1 point 1 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.669
 if you have the version 1 point 1 points 2 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.559
 1 point 1 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:24.389
 with everything 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.279
 you will have to use this folder 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.719
 inside this folder it is very important that they do 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.909
 in the order that I'm going to tell you next in the first place so that 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.059
 work have to add that install 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:38.919
 what the pre press of the sma press paid 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.100
 motionless map 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.549

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.419
 bauer those are the first two applications that reinstalls for them to 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.339
 work 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:50.209
 it does not matter the order of these two while they shake then we love to come here 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.209
 we install 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.379
 I remember being masters first of all because they want to pre-plant 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:02.699
 these two ended always have to be at 1 o'clock if it did not work

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.020
 The Google Maps - Max 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:20.249

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.710
 tucumán bread 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.319
 treatment of marichalar what would be

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.210
 very tired 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:08.599
 we restart 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:14.460
 we will block 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.460
 and we'll have to see the menu here 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.449
 I remember now you can see 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.449
 I no longer have accounts configured 

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:32.469
