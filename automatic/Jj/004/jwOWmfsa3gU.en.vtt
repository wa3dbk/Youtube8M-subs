total<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.359> 30<00:00:06.600> pounds<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.620> took<00:00:07.830> me

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
total of 30 pounds and it took me

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.759 
total of 30 pounds and it took me
approximately<00:00:08.480> nine<00:00:09.480> months<00:00:09.510> so<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.440> lost

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
approximately nine months so I lost

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.419 
approximately nine months so I lost
about<00:00:10.950> 3<00:00:11.550> point<00:00:11.880> 33<00:00:12.679> pounds<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.799> month<00:00:14.099> which<00:00:14.400> is

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
about 3 point 33 pounds a month which is

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.240 
about 3 point 33 pounds a month which is
pretty<00:00:15.389> slow<00:00:15.870> if<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.170> think<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.920> but

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
pretty slow if you think about it but

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.580 
pretty slow if you think about it but
the<00:00:17.820> reason<00:00:18.060> why<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.960> lost<00:00:19.260> all<00:00:19.470> this

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
the reason why I think I lost all this

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.609 
the reason why I think I lost all this
weight<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:20.100> because<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:21.119> goal<00:00:21.570> wasn't<00:00:22.140> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
weight was because my goal wasn't to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.480 
weight was because my goal wasn't to
lose<00:00:22.800> weight<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.150> actually<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:26.250> get

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
lose weight it was actually just to get

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
lose weight it was actually just to get
really<00:00:26.910> really<00:00:27.090> healthy<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.720> would<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.080> put

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
really really healthy I would have put

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
really really healthy I would have put
into<00:00:28.500> my<00:00:28.590> life<00:00:28.800> now<00:00:29.039> where<00:00:29.070> I'm<00:00:29.490> fairly

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
into my life now where I'm fairly

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.100 
into my life now where I'm fairly
disciplined<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.439> my<00:00:31.920> eating<00:00:32.160> habits<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.210> let

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
disciplined with my eating habits so let

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.569 
disciplined with my eating habits so let
me<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.410> sort<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.739> share<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.430> my

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
me just sort of share with you my

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.569 
me just sort of share with you my
lifestyle<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.570> that's<00:00:37.040> basically<00:00:38.040> how<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
lifestyle and that's basically how I

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.900 
lifestyle and that's basically how I
lost<00:00:38.969> all<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.360> weight<00:00:39.829> naturally<00:00:40.910> so

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
lost all that weight naturally so

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.229 
lost all that weight naturally so
honestly<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.450> don't<00:00:43.020> focus<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:44.090> exercising<00:00:45.090> as

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
honestly I don't focus on exercising as

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.940 
honestly I don't focus on exercising as
much<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> eat<00:00:46.230> every<00:00:46.469> single<00:00:46.800> day<00:00:47.190> so

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
much as what I eat every single day so

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.340 
much as what I eat every single day so
basically<00:00:50.239> here<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.710> my<00:00:52.710> life<00:00:54.170> every<00:00:55.170> single

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
basically here is my life every single

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.939 
basically here is my life every single
day<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.860> drink<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:57.120> least<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.780> liter<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.649> new

could be three to four coconuts a day or
I<00:01:06.380> drink<00:01:07.380> one<00:01:07.890> liter<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.580> 32<00:01:09.390> ounces<00:01:09.780> of

freshly<00:01:11.070> squeezed<00:01:11.580> juice<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.090> try<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
freshly squeezed juice I try to do that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
freshly squeezed juice I try to do that
in<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> morning<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.070> can't<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
in the morning if I can't do that in the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.399 
in the morning if I can't do that in the
morning<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.299> somehow<00:01:15.659> squeeze<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> in

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
morning that I somehow squeeze it in

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.859 
morning that I somehow squeeze it in
during<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> day<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:18.030> litre<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
during the day so one litre of that so I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
during the day so one litre of that so I
make<00:01:19.080> sure<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.409> drink<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.100> least<00:01:20.549> 20

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
make sure that I drink at least 20

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.830 
make sure that I drink at least 20
ounces<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.110> hot<00:01:22.950> drink<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> day<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.509> could

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
ounces of hot drink a day so that could

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.429 
ounces of hot drink a day so that could
be<00:01:24.869> hot<00:01:25.740> coffee<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.610> could<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.820> hot<00:01:27.060> tea<00:01:27.439> or

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
be hot coffee that could be hot tea or

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.270 
be hot coffee that could be hot tea or
just<00:01:29.159> hot<00:01:29.729> water<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.840> don't<00:01:31.079> usually<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:32.009> hot

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
just hot water I don't usually like hot

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
just hot water I don't usually like hot
water<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.670> much<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.270> usually<00:01:33.630> hot<00:01:34.079> tea

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
water that much so it's usually hot tea

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.399 
water that much so it's usually hot tea
typically<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.909> brings<00:01:36.240> me<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.689> another

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
typically and that brings me to another

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.149 
typically and that brings me to another
part<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.310> life<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.790> try<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.390> best<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.159> eat

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
part of my life I try my best not to eat

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.389 
part of my life I try my best not to eat
or<00:01:41.790> drink<00:01:41.930> anything<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.500> refined<00:01:43.979> sugar

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
or drink anything that has refined sugar

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.390 
or drink anything that has refined sugar
in<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.299> includes<00:01:45.780> white<00:01:46.170> sugar<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
in it so that includes white sugar that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.640 
in it so that includes white sugar that
whose<00:01:47.670> powdered<00:01:48.330> sugar<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:49.050> includes<00:01:49.380> brown

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
whose powdered sugar that includes brown

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.890 
whose powdered sugar that includes brown
sugar<00:01:49.980> and<00:01:50.220> coconut<00:01:50.610> sugar<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.510> doesn't

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
sugar and coconut sugar that doesn't

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.570 
sugar and coconut sugar that doesn't
mean<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.380> don't<00:01:52.560> use<00:01:52.830> sweeteners<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.430> all

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
mean that I don't use sweeteners at all

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.610 
mean that I don't use sweeteners at all
my<00:01:53.730> number<00:01:54.150> one<00:01:54.360> choice<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.930> actually<00:01:55.290> just

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
my number one choice is actually just

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.100 
my number one choice is actually just
natural<00:01:56.340> fruit<00:01:57.150> sugars<00:01:57.480> and<00:01:57.660> vegetable

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
natural fruit sugars and vegetable

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.910 
natural fruit sugars and vegetable
sugars<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.650> if<00:01:59.870> say<00:02:00.870> this<00:02:01.050> juice<00:02:01.260> for<00:02:01.440> example

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
sugars so if say this juice for example

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
sugars so if say this juice for example
the<00:02:02.040> natural<00:02:02.490> sugar<00:02:02.730> in<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.150> is<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.600> oranges

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the natural sugar in this is the oranges

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.440 
the natural sugar in this is the oranges
so<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.800> oranges<00:02:05.490> will<00:02:05.760> sweeten<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.210> juice

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
so the oranges will sweeten this juice

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.080
