jump back to our plan view so you can
see<00:01:21.360> every<00:01:21.720> page<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.050> has<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.679> dark<00:01:22.920> master

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
see every page that has the dark master

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.400 
see every page that has the dark master
applied<00:01:24.209> to<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.810> automatically<00:01:25.619> updated

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
applied to it is automatically updated

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.900 
applied to it is automatically updated
okay<00:01:28.410> let's<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.740> ahead<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.310> take<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:29.580> look<00:01:29.759> at

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
okay let's go ahead and take a look at

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.389 
okay let's go ahead and take a look at
the<00:01:30.030> texture<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:30.750> used<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.709> website<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
the texture that's used on the website I

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.589 
the texture that's used on the website I
like<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.090> use<00:01:33.240> texture<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.170> design<00:01:34.740> for

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:35.599 
like to use texture in my design for

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.969 
like to use texture in my design for
visual<00:01:36.599> interest<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.170> also<00:01:37.319> to<00:01:37.470> help<00:01:37.800> add

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
visual interest and also to help add

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.779 
visual interest and also to help add
some<00:01:39.200> depth<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.470> dimension<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.099> the<00:01:41.310> website

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
some depth or dimension to the website

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.529 
some depth or dimension to the website
so<00:01:42.690> this<00:01:43.380> texture<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.950> simply<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.670> small<00:01:44.910> image

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
so this texture is simply a small image

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.460 
so this texture is simply a small image
that<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.140> being<00:01:46.170> tiled<00:01:46.830> both<00:01:47.479> on<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.720> vertical

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that is being tiled both on the vertical

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.520 
that is being tiled both on the vertical
and<00:01:49.770> horizontal<00:01:49.800> axis<00:01:50.429> so<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.300> it<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:52.200> fill

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and horizontal axis so that it will fill

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.729 
and horizontal axis so that it will fill
this<00:01:52.800> frame<00:01:53.599> as<00:01:54.599> far<00:01:54.989> as<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.349> be<00:01:55.470> dragged

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:55.739 
this frame as far as it can be dragged

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:58.370 
this frame as far as it can be dragged
so<00:01:56.069> you<00:01:56.459> can<00:01:56.640> I'm<00:01:56.940> simply<00:01:57.390> using<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:58.050> texture

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
so you can I'm simply using the texture

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
so you can I'm simply using the texture
as<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> background<00:01:58.800> for<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.190> header<00:01:59.369> image<00:01:59.580> but

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
as a background for the header image but

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.719 
as a background for the header image but
you<00:02:00.060> could<00:02:00.479> use<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:02.250> background<00:02:02.580> for

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you could use it for the background for

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.410 
you could use it for the background for
your<00:02:02.819> entire<00:02:03.030> site<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.959> you<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.410> fit<00:02:04.970> now<00:02:05.970> this

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
your entire site if you see fit now this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.400 
your entire site if you see fit now this
texture<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> included<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.750> assets<00:02:09.750> folder

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
texture is included in the assets folder

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.130 
texture is included in the assets folder
and<00:02:11.099> if<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.790> jump<00:02:12.030> over<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.720> assets

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and if we just jump over to the assets

folder here I'm gonna open this up in

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.270 
folder here I'm gonna open this up in
Photoshop<00:02:18.110> there<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.409> our<00:02:19.439> texture

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
Photoshop there we have our texture

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.059 
Photoshop there we have our texture
image<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.819> I'm<00:02:20.969> just<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.769> overlay<00:02:22.769> a

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
image and I'm just going to overlay a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.059

let's go ahead and overlay white and as
you<00:02:28.180> can<00:02:28.269> see<00:02:28.329> here<00:02:28.689> just<00:02:28.989> make<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.439> slightly

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
you can see here just make it slightly

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.959 
you can see here just make it slightly
opaque<00:02:31.859> in<00:02:32.859> order<00:02:33.159> to<00:02:33.280> kind<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.609> change<00:02:33.879> the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:33.969 
opaque in order to kind of change the

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.089 
opaque in order to kind of change the
color<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.450> template<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.260> I'm<00:02:35.620> gonna<00:02:35.799> just

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
color of the template so I'm gonna just

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.009 
color of the template so I'm gonna just
flatten<00:02:36.400> this<00:02:36.459> real<00:02:36.700> quick<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.180> save<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
flatten this real quick and save it

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.390 
flatten this real quick and save it
obviously<00:02:38.409> you'd<00:02:38.530> want<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.739> save<00:02:38.980> for<00:02:39.219> web<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
obviously you'd want to save for web and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.160 
obviously you'd want to save for web and
optimize<00:02:39.909> it<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.390> just<00:02:41.349> do<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.709> quickly

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
optimize it but just do this quickly

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.660 
optimize it but just do this quickly
okay<00:02:44.170> now<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.470> we've<00:02:44.590> saved<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.489> image

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
okay now that we've saved the image

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.770 
okay now that we've saved the image
we'll<00:02:46.060> jump<00:02:46.299> back<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.840> muse<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:48.390> as<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.629> can

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
we'll jump back to muse and as you can

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
see we've got a warning sign on our tile

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.240 
see we've got a warning sign on our tile
showing<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.170> asset<00:02:53.530> has<00:02:53.680> been<00:02:53.709> changed

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
showing that the asset has been changed

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.280 
showing that the asset has been changed

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
will still fill the entire frame so I

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.369 
will still fill the entire frame so I
just<00:03:06.370> wanted<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.669> demonstrate<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:08.019> are
