their millions use weapons called

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.230 
their millions use weapons called
shredders<00:00:16.619> which<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.520> an<00:00:17.640> intelligent

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.390 

the<00:00:27.180> shredder<00:00:27.540> was<00:00:27.780> an<00:00:27.990> idea<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.800> Pete<00:00:29.190> had

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the shredder was an idea that Pete had

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400 
the shredder was an idea that Pete had
from<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> very<00:00:29.760> beginning<00:00:30.180> he<00:00:30.690> said<00:00:30.870> I<00:00:30.900> want

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
from the very beginning he said I want

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.660 
from the very beginning he said I want
this<00:00:32.040> weapon<00:00:32.850> slash<00:00:33.510> tool<00:00:33.990> that<00:00:34.920> should<00:00:35.460> be

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
this weapon slash tool that should be

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.210 
this weapon slash tool that should be
like<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.000> chainsaw<00:00:36.510> wrapped<00:00:37.440> around<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:38.040> sphere

like a chainsaw wrapped around a sphere
Pete<00:00:38.940> always<00:00:39.240> described<00:00:39.630> them<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:39.900> you<00:00:40.080> know

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
Pete always described them as you know

Tasmanian devils you know they have to
be<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.060> bundles<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:43.380> contained<00:00:43.920> energy<00:00:44.460> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
be like bundles of contained energy that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.900 
be like bundles of contained energy that
just<00:00:45.360> gets<00:00:45.510> unleashed<00:00:49.580> they're<00:00:50.580> basically

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that other cane rail there we do that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:39.109 
that other cane rail there we do that
pirate<00:01:17.430> technically<00:01:17.940> there<00:01:18.810> we<00:01:18.899> go

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.179 

blowing<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.930> things<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.530> best<00:01:40.680> part<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.040> my

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
blowing up things is the best part of my

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.330 
blowing up things is the best part of my
job<00:01:45.350> every<00:01:46.350> time<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.770> something<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
job every time you have something on the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670 
job every time you have something on the
set<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.700> gives<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> director<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.930> bigger<00:01:49.259> sense

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
set it gives the director a bigger sense

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.819 
set it gives the director a bigger sense
of<00:01:49.950> timing<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.030> sequencing<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> editing<00:01:52.470> so

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
of timing and sequencing and editing so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
of timing and sequencing and editing so
that<00:01:53.130> was<00:01:53.280> basically<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.880> approach<00:01:53.970> shredder

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
that was basically the approach shredder

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.070 
that was basically the approach shredder
comes<00:01:55.140> chasing<00:01:55.500> down<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> hallway<00:01:56.850> after<00:01:57.659> one

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
comes chasing down a hallway after one

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.969 
comes chasing down a hallway after one
of<00:01:58.200> our<00:01:58.380> heroes<00:01:58.710> after<00:01:59.009> ordi<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.759> shredder
