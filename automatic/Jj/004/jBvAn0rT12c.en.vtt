00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
you're really terrible parallel parking

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:35.950 
you're really terrible parallel parking
and<00:03:35.040> there's<00:03:35.160> not<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.370> hundred

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
yelling at you got maybe a cool way of

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.330 
yelling at you got maybe a cool way of
doing<00:03:38.780> things<00:03:38.930> again<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:39.830> don't<00:03:40.130> know<00:03:40.220> if

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
doing things again I don't know if

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.100 
doing things again I don't know if
they've<00:03:40.490> improved<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.150> or<00:03:41.330> if<00:03:41.660> they've<00:03:41.810> even

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
they've improved it or if they've even

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.570 
they've improved it or if they've even
gone<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.470> think<00:03:42.740> they've<00:03:42.860> gotten<00:03:43.100> rid<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.430> it

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
gone I think they've gotten rid of it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.950 
gone I think they've gotten rid of it
altogether<00:03:43.730> because<00:03:44.210> it's<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.510> little<00:03:44.720> bit<00:03:44.810> too

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
altogether because it's a little bit too

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.170 
altogether because it's a little bit too
