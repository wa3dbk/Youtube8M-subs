00:00:54.819 --> 00:01:00.670

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:18.490
 a bit that it is something weed and 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.210
 Beet is as bad as he says it is 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.100
 not now 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.100

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.250

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.920

 we get him some of you 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.979
 maybe wear artificial 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.350
 fingernails or go pro 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.109
 Nail salon to get the perfect one 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.329
 to make manicure 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.799
 others like the tine at home 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.469
 are having two young children 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.200
 maybe no time for that and have to 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.119
 do it all at home and there are 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.259
 a few simple tips and tricks the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.990
 I can give you 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.689
 to make it really fast without little 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.269
 Time without too little work too 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.250
 but mastering is a bit of something 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.750
 Of course we have to do it anyway 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.520
 Of course we need that 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.810
 First of all, the right ones 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.030
 Fit and professional products is first step 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.540
 of course, the nails in shape 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.220
 file 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.850
 if you nails or snaps for a long time or 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:33.130
 one possibility you can do that is already 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.050
 very good times most take 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.760
 still some clippers or 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.640
 Metal fall and fall the nails in 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.709
 form and that harms the naturnah the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.690
 That's enough for the nail structure 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.430
 and you really get a lot 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.500
 fast and very strong brittle nails 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.810
 that this nail plate then in too 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.810
 We have several layers of shields 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.370
 not at the teen now 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.230
 I always recommend to most people 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.360
 The sandpaper arrows because that's easy 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.950
 a long-lasting professional is always 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.390
 can also apply at home 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.350
 but there are also more recently 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:13.140
 multifunction I can drop this here 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:15.280
 Recently, however, recently signs 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.250
 already a little new we now the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.680
 filing the profiling of the paper 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.239
 work off several steps with a file 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.310
 this is I can be polished as venal 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.870
 use for trimming to evening 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.180
 clean ours I look like this is something 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.920
 of course much easier on the go 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.989
 because I do not have to line up with several 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.310
 I take'm all in one 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.200
 kit but I still prefer the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.690
 single variant I say that me 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.500
 first take a sandpaper arrows 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.150
 and file the nails in shape 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.709
 there are always ammenmÃ¤rchen me 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.190
 Sometimes I have to laugh myself when I do that 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:58.239
 hear that you only have the nails in one 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.150
 direction should fall or only from the outside 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:04.750
 inside if your the perfect darts 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.280
 have the you have it does not do it 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.440
 We distinguished from right to left 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.880
 file or from left to right or from 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.540
 top to bottom or front to back 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.640
 behind 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.470
 it is only important that they are the right one 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.359
 Grain has very very fine 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.079
 Grain and then the nail becomes quasi 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.849
 filed and sealed at the same time 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.270
 I have to coarse fine then fall 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.759
 I mean the nail 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.620
 and then I rip the structure off 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.389
 nail up and then drink again 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.629
 bathe moisture in showers 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.110
 Hand washing and making nail somehow 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.110
 split the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:44.509
 we can really do that in both sides 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:46.870
 make and nails beautiful shape 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:46.870
 file 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.900
 what you really can do if you are 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.569
 The right arrows are perfect too 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.289
 make home very easy by her 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:03.110
 just go back and forth and do it 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:06.440
 the needlepoint in shape is still filing many 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.720
 always ask me how is the perfect 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.400
 nail shape should actually be nature 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.970
 Nails look so that they are the perfect 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.909
 form 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.530
 at the celebrities is currently so hot 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:19.310
 a bit longer a bit sharper 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.409
 Filed a lot of bunch a lot bling bling in 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.210
 everyday but also what you do with the models 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.009
 that's how it looks at the fashion shows 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.750
 always giving you the nails antic longer 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.360
 Like you now, so wear them 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.880
 so i would say 23 mm over the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.280
 fingertip but not quite go 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.520
 straight and not quite oval 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:41.620
 so become a hybrid 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.620
 Half round, I would say
