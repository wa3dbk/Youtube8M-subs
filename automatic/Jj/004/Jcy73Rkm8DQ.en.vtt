way its way grippier I mean it's not you
know<00:02:22.670> it's<00:02:22.849> not<00:02:23.090> grippy<00:02:23.690> like<00:02:23.900> g10<00:02:24.379> know

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
know it's not grippy like g10 know

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.070

anything<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.360> way<00:02:26.599> grippier

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
anything but but this is way grippier

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.910 
anything but but this is way grippier
then<00:02:27.349> then<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:29.510> tailwinds<00:02:30.190> handle<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.260> it's

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
then then the tailwinds handle so it's

side to side and then one other thing I
don't<00:03:34.579> really<00:03:35.150> like<00:03:35.480> about<00:03:35.630> this<00:03:35.870> knife<00:03:36.109> is

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
don't really like about this knife is

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.589 
don't really like about this knife is
that<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:38.560> assist<00:03:39.669> mechanism<00:03:40.669> just<00:03:41.209> isn't

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
that the the assist mechanism just isn't

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.059 
that the the assist mechanism just isn't
as<00:03:42.400> smooth<00:03:43.400> as<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:44.480> one<00:03:45.200> on<00:03:45.230> micro<00:03:45.650> sure<00:03:45.859> I

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
as smooth as the one on micro sure I

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.839 
as smooth as the one on micro sure I
mean<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:47.419> knife<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:49.099> don't<00:03:49.340> need<00:03:49.489> a<00:03:49.549> lot<00:03:49.790> of

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:49.849

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
just a little slick and it just comes up

and but on this 1i I can't need to use

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.839 
and but on this 1i I can't need to use
more<00:04:00.049> force<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.709> need<00:04:00.859> to<00:04:00.980> hold<00:04:01.400> on<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
more force I need to hold on to the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.470 
more force I need to hold on to the
knife<00:04:02.030> more<00:04:02.389> and<00:04:02.660> i<00:04:03.049> need<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.970> know<00:04:04.970> look

knife more and i need to you know look

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.659 
knife more and i need to you know look
there<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.739> was<00:04:06.919> enough<00:04:07.190> force<00:04:07.459> it

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
there that that was enough force it

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.990 
there that that was enough force it
didn't<00:04:08.329> pass<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.569> threshold<00:04:09.139> I<00:04:09.790> really<00:04:10.790> need

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
didn't pass that threshold I really need

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.349 
didn't pass that threshold I really need
to<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.569> know<00:04:11.690> flick<00:04:12.319> it<00:04:12.349> out<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.910> get<00:04:14.120> this

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
to you know flick it out to get this

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:15.979 
to you know flick it out to get this
knife<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.810> point

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
knife to the point

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.900 
knife to the point
I<00:04:16.989> wish<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:19.660> would<00:04:19.870> deploy<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.620> lot<00:04:21.250> easier<00:04:21.550> I

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
I wish this would deploy a lot easier I

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.270 
I wish this would deploy a lot easier I
mean<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:23.050> know<00:04:23.170> with<00:04:23.350> less<00:04:23.650> effort<00:04:23.920> then<00:04:26.280> then

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
mean you know with less effort then then

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.560 
mean you know with less effort then then
it<00:04:27.430> does<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:27.880> mean<00:04:28.060> it's<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.810> just<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:31.420> just

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
it does I mean it's it just just it just

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.150 
it does I mean it's it just just it just
takes<00:04:31.810> a<00:04:31.930> little<00:04:32.080> bit<00:04:32.230> too<00:04:32.440> much<00:04:32.590> effort<00:04:32.860> to

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
takes a little bit too much effort to

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.810 
takes a little bit too much effort to
diplay<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.670> deploy<00:04:33.940> this<00:04:34.090> knife<00:04:35.160> maybe<00:04:36.160> one

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
diplay and deploy this knife maybe one

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.910 
diplay and deploy this knife maybe one
of<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.030> reasons<00:04:37.060> why<00:04:37.600> they<00:04:38.350> made<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:38.890> way

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
of the reasons why they made it that way

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.620 
of the reasons why they made it that way
I<00:04:39.040> guess<00:04:39.130> because<00:04:39.610> there's<00:04:39.850> no<00:04:40.000> it's<00:04:40.480> no

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
I guess because there's no it's no

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.620 
I guess because there's no it's no
safety<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.290> don't<00:04:41.830> know<00:04:41.920> I<00:04:42.100> mean<00:04:42.420> maybe<00:04:43.420> it's

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
safety I don't know I mean maybe it's

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.900 
safety I don't know I mean maybe it's
you<00:04:43.960> know<00:04:44.080> since<00:04:44.980> there's<00:04:45.190> no<00:04:45.310> safety<00:04:45.580> they

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
you know since there's no safety they

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.910 
you know since there's no safety they
didn't<00:04:46.210> they<00:04:46.480> didn't<00:04:46.690> want<00:04:46.870> anyone<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.260> you

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
didn't they didn't want anyone to you

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.660 
didn't they didn't want anyone to you
know<00:04:48.010> accidentally<00:04:49.110> deploy<00:04:50.110> this<00:04:50.320> knife<00:04:50.670> you

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
know accidentally deploy this knife you

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.320 
know accidentally deploy this knife you
know<00:04:51.760> unintentionally<00:04:52.650> but<00:04:53.880> yeah<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.150> mean

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
know unintentionally but yeah I mean

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.630 
know unintentionally but yeah I mean
this<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:56.290> Kershaw<00:04:56.620> has<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> little<00:04:57.340> safety

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
this the Kershaw has a little safety

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.770 
this the Kershaw has a little safety
button<00:04:58.330> right<00:04:58.630> here<00:04:58.830> which<00:04:59.830> I<00:05:00.160> never<00:05:01.150> use<00:05:01.480> it's

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
button right here which I never use it's

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.520 
button right here which I never use it's
always<00:05:02.110> on<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.410> on<00:05:02.560> position<00:05:03.510> but<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.900> is<00:05:05.110> so

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
always on the on position but this is so

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.580 
always on the on position but this is so
much<00:05:06.150> miss<00:05:07.150> Minnie<00:05:07.450> cyclone<00:05:07.960> is<00:05:08.140> so<00:05:08.380> much

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
much miss Minnie cyclone is so much

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.630 
much miss Minnie cyclone is so much
easier<00:05:08.770> to<00:05:09.280> deploy<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.640> band<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.480> that<00:05:10.750> and

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
easier to deploy a band and that and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.640 
easier to deploy a band and that and
they're<00:05:12.640> both<00:05:12.900> at<00:05:13.900> about<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.320> same<00:05:14.350> price

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
they're both at about the same price
