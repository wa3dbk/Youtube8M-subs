00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.060
 frank press also won roland 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.720
 garros a year and a half after the 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.550
 his first slam australia 9 equals 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.920
 hence the victories of roger cohen 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.050
 in the other Swiss here at the roland garros 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.180
 a win for each fabrica 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.900
 deserved this victory by always playing 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.070
 a match is very aggressive and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.320
 surprising djokovic with his 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.390
 wonderful even 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.119
 in the last point but also practically 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.640
 throughout the game for Switzerland 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.929
 this is the twenty-fourth slam won 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:42.429
 to insure it has indeed won 17 roger 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:47.440
 federer 2 fabrica and go 19 5 martina 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:50.350
 hingis and go 24 out of 40 finals played 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.809
 from Swiss tennis players and therefore it is 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.269
 a small country like Switzerland is 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.299
 unfortunately a sintra sardo italy but 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.209
 before this it must be said that it was one 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.930
 beautiful game and djokovic tried 

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:07.390
 to put it in the bag in the fourth set 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.189
 when the singer the break was thought 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.369
 that they would have arrived at this fifth 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.350
 once but instead he failed to 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.659
 take the game home by playing 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.430
 really very very well by the way 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.350
 very solid in fact transformed instead 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.509
 which was a winning service of have 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.180
 call out had a break ball 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.490
 for djokovic and could go 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.590
 they could go on for who knows when 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.689
 instead the American 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.420
 the immense for the brinca the surprise 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.780
 according to me it is in the fact that a 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.000
 Wine player 34 years ago was 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.280
 considered a bit primary not one 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.789
 capable of winning the great trials of the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.399
 slam 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.920
 and instead he started his own e 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.810
 putting djokovic in difficulty made it 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.479
 maybe the road is not even 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.280
 losing a proves to have quality 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.829
 he is not convinced he has just in 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.530
 those nations coveted the ocean me a year 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.390
 last big beating nadal but 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.479
 nadal also had a few problems 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.180
 maybe in the back while the 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.000
 youngster the prizes don't have it reform 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.220
 of the season he won that of seven 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.160
 months row was considered the big one 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.739
 favorite and limit what happened 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.799
 today it shows that doing the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:30.400
 large non- resident slam fails 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:34.599
 more nobody from robben in 1969 this 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.299
 koran burning and something therefore between 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.880
 the other game he was going to have 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.250
 at least the chance by winning today 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.470
 make a player you had 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.190
 won all the stands he is here at 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.170
 roland garros 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.989
 but merino crown lost its third 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.590
 final we can say that it was not 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.019
 lucky because he found the best 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.900
 Africa that could find the same 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.450
 will bother he said and better than that no 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.579
 I think I could play and it was one 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.500
 beautiful game full of suspense and 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.810
 we had so much fun 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.989
 the game was mario there have been both 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.640
 that exchanges long 39th but laws 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.650
 the variety and the game we say 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.630
 lots of break balls coming on arrival 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.819
 maybe he should have come to the net 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.190
 sometimes more but with aprica that 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.870
 pushing so hard is not good rapacious 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.400
 all for this I do not red 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.920

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.620
