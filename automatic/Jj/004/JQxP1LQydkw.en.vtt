00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
eyeliner I'm going to use this on the

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.630 
eyeliner I'm going to use this on the
war<00:01:05.500> zone<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:05.890> I'm<00:01:05.950> going<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.159> line<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.550> bottom

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
war zone so I'm going to line the bottom

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.670 
war zone so I'm going to line the bottom
waterline<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.240> then<00:01:07.479> tight<00:01:07.720> line<00:01:07.899> at<00:01:08.050> the<00:01:08.140> top

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.770 

so<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.670> eyeshadows<00:01:14.120> from<00:01:14.270> this<00:01:14.390> look<00:01:14.600> are

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
so the eyeshadows from this look are

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.780 
so the eyeshadows from this look are
from<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.290> urban<00:01:15.620> decay<00:01:15.860> naked<00:01:15.890> palette<00:01:16.280> and

from the urban decay naked palette and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.490 
from the urban decay naked palette and
the<00:01:17.150> reason<00:01:17.420> for<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.690> because<00:01:17.960> it<00:01:18.470> has

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
the reason for that is because it has

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.110 
the reason for that is because it has
everything<00:01:18.980> in<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.370> I<00:01:19.460> need<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.910> I<00:01:19.970> can<00:01:20.090> just

carry<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.540> around<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:21.050> it's<00:01:21.170> just<00:01:21.410> absolutely

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
carry it around and it's just absolutely

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.850
