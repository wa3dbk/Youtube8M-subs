using<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:34.930> peeler<00:03:35.350> is<00:03:35.530> great<00:03:36.250> because<00:03:36.930> it

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
using a peeler is great because it

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.300 
flesh now to peel the mango with a knife
it's<00:03:51.880> good<00:03:52.180> it's<00:03:52.570> not<00:03:52.780> as<00:03:52.960> good<00:03:53.170> as<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.980> peeler

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
it's good it's not as good as the peeler

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.260 
it's good it's not as good as the peeler
because<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.730> peeler<00:03:54.940> really<00:03:55.390> does<00:03:56.070> do<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.370> very

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
because the peeler really does do a very

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.080

like<00:03:58.860> thin<00:03:59.860> thin<00:04:00.430> peel<00:04:01.890> but<00:04:02.890> if<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.610> just<00:04:03.850> have

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
like thin thin peel but if you just have

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:12.620 
like thin thin peel but if you just have
a<00:04:04.120> knife<00:04:04.390> then<00:04:04.930> it's<00:04:05.920> perfectly<00:04:06.930> all<00:04:07.930> right<00:04:09.780> so

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
a knife then it's perfectly all right so

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.680 
a knife then it's perfectly all right so
and<00:04:14.400> then<00:04:15.400> what<00:04:15.850> you're<00:04:15.970> going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.180> do<00:04:16.360> is
