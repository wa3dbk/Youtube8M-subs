00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.860 
simple it's really easy for the peanut
butter<00:02:09.069> how<00:02:10.069> do<00:02:10.130> i<00:02:10.250> do<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.910> set<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.600> spoon

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
butter how do i do it is set the spoon

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.360 
butter how do i do it is set the spoon
on<00:02:12.140> top<00:02:12.440> first<00:02:14.739> because<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.860> will<00:02:15.950> still<00:02:16.190> come

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
on top first because it will still come

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.250 
on top first because it will still come
up<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.610> zero<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.239> it<00:02:17.300> won't<00:02:17.510> count<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.870> spoon

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
up a zero so it won't count the spoon

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.990 
up a zero so it won't count the spoon
then<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.769> put<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.130> peanut<00:02:19.310> butter<00:02:19.430> on<00:02:19.760> there

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
then I put the peanut butter on there

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.660 
then I put the peanut butter on there
until<00:02:20.690> I<00:02:20.720> can<00:02:21.170> get<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.380> 16<00:02:21.860> grams<00:02:22.100> which<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.489> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
until I can get to 16 grams which is a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.699 
until I can get to 16 grams which is a
half<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.300> tablespoon<00:02:23.480> now<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.350> course<00:02:24.470> you

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
half a tablespoon now of course you

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.470 
half a tablespoon now of course you
could<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:24.920> use<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.400> half<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.700> tablespoon<00:02:25.850> but

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
could just use the half a tablespoon but

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.620 
could just use the half a tablespoon but
I'm<00:02:26.720> anal<00:02:26.989> as<00:02:27.230> hell<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.769> I<00:02:28.150> go<00:02:29.150> ahead<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.450> do<00:02:29.510> it

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
I'm anal as hell so I go ahead and do it

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.600 
I'm anal as hell so I go ahead and do it
this<00:02:29.780> way<00:02:29.989> but<00:02:30.500> that's<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.130> that's<00:02:31.340> my

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
this way but that's it that's my

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.069 
this way but that's it that's my
breakfast<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.299> my<00:02:32.600> low<00:02:32.750> carb<00:02:33.019> is<00:02:33.260> peace
