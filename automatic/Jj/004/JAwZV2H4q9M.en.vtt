00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.480> one<00:00:00.570> of<00:00:00.599> the<00:00:00.719> laws<00:00:00.900> of<00:00:01.110> muting<00:00:01.410> to

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
I think one of the laws of muting to

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.800 
I think one of the laws of muting to
sort<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:01.979> as<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.070> corollary<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.149> that

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
sort of as a corollary to this is that

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.240 
sort of as a corollary to this is that
when<00:00:03.959> you're<00:00:04.080> playing<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.680> way<00:00:05.009> you're

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
when you're playing this way you're

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.619 
when you're playing this way you're
going<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.400> get<00:00:05.520> less<00:00:05.790> string<00:00:06.089> noise<00:00:06.240> than<00:00:06.540> when

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
going to get less string noise than when

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.909 
going to get less string noise than when
you're<00:00:06.750> playing<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.170> way<00:00:07.410> because<00:00:07.710> when<00:00:07.859> you

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
you're playing this way because when you

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.560 
you're playing this way because when you
play<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.250> way<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.460> have<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.670> lift<00:00:09.030> off<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
play this way you have to lift off the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.419 
play this way you have to lift off the
string<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.080> there's<00:00:10.500> nothing<00:00:10.950> up<00:00:11.099> here<00:00:11.280> or

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
string and there's nothing up here or

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.740 
string and there's nothing up here or
very<00:00:11.610> little<00:00:11.790> up<00:00:11.940> here<00:00:11.969> that's<00:00:12.240> gonna<00:00:12.330> stop<00:00:12.599> it

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
very little up here that's gonna stop it

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.509 
very little up here that's gonna stop it
from<00:00:12.780> ringing<00:00:13.230> when<00:00:13.650> you're<00:00:13.799> going<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.219> way

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
from ringing when you're going this way

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.090 
from ringing when you're going this way
the<00:00:15.179> finger<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.870> slowly<00:00:16.199> encroaching<00:00:16.890> over

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
the finger is slowly encroaching over

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.230 
the finger is slowly encroaching over
the<00:00:17.190> fret<00:00:17.340> board<00:00:17.369> almost<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:17.910> an<00:00:18.000> eclipse

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the fret board almost like an eclipse

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.599 
the fret board almost like an eclipse
will<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:19.109> blot<00:00:19.439> out<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.010> sound<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
will just blot out all that sound so the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.580 
will just blot out all that sound so the
easiest<00:00:20.939> string<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.390> mute<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.960> course<00:00:22.500> are

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
easiest string to mute on of course are

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.590 
easiest string to mute on of course are
the<00:00:22.710> easiest<00:00:23.010> string<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.850> remove<00:00:24.180> string

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the easiest string to remove string

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.259 
the easiest string to remove string
noise<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.050> would<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.590> lowest<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.310> don't

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.910

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
stray nose from any of the other strings

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.920 
stray nose from any of the other strings
because<00:00:39.030> they're<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.300> being<00:00:39.540> muted<00:00:39.840> with

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
because they're all being muted with

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.869 
because they're all being muted with
these<00:00:40.050> guys<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:43.520> now<00:00:44.520> you'll

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
notice that even though I'm not muting

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.279 
notice that even though I'm not muting
the<00:00:47.730> strings<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.360> still<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> baby<00:00:48.960> lark

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and this is an interesting topic that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.520 
and this is an interesting topic that
came<00:00:51.210> up<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> actual<00:00:52.079> interview<00:00:52.379> with

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530

Michael I don't really hear any other

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.790 
Michael I don't really hear any other
string<00:00:56.940> noise<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.750> trust<00:00:58.140> me<00:00:58.289> it's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
string noise it's there trust me it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.439 
string noise it's there trust me it's
just<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.520> note<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> being<00:01:00.180> hit<00:01:00.329> with

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
just that this note is being hit with

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.670 
just that this note is being hit with
such<00:01:00.600> authority<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.500> really

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
such authority that you don't really

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:13.890 
such authority that you don't really
hear<00:01:02.600> you<00:01:03.600> don't<00:01:03.750> hear<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.960 

I<00:01:13.960> don't<00:01:14.770> have<00:01:14.890> a<00:01:14.920> string<00:01:15.130> dampener<00:01:15.490> on<00:01:15.610> and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
I don't have a string dampener on and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.600 
I don't have a string dampener on and
the<00:01:16.090> truth<00:01:16.300> is<00:01:16.510> if<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:17.020> look<00:01:17.170> at<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.350> last

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the truth is if you look at the last

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.940 
the truth is if you look at the last
video<00:01:18.610> clip<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.660> one<00:01:19.810> in<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.620> free<00:01:20.770> pack

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
video clip the the one in the free pack

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.100 
video clip the the one in the free pack
and<00:01:21.190> also<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.490> last<00:01:21.670> clip<00:01:21.970> I<00:01:22.210> think<00:01:22.930> it's<00:01:23.020> the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
and also the last clip I think it's the

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.080 
and also the last clip I think it's the
last<00:01:23.260> clip<00:01:23.500> in<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.710> archive<00:01:24.070> I<00:01:24.400> called<00:01:25.000> it

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
last clip in the archive I called it

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.730 
last clip in the archive I called it
muting<00:01:25.420> mr.<00:01:25.630> he<00:01:25.780> actually<00:01:26.050> talks<00:01:26.290> about<00:01:26.560> this

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
muting mr. he actually talks about this

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.490 
muting mr. he actually talks about this
and<00:01:26.980> he<00:01:27.670> he<00:01:27.970> flips<00:01:28.330> up<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.870> string<00:01:29.110> dampener

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
and he he flips up the string dampener

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.990 
and he he flips up the string dampener
just<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.920> prove<00:01:30.040> a<00:01:30.160> point<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.520> he<00:01:30.640> played<00:01:30.850> and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
just to prove a point and he played and

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.430 
just to prove a point and he played and
it's<00:01:31.120> perfect<00:01:31.510> obviously<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.110> guy<00:01:32.230> doesn't

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
it's perfect obviously the guy doesn't

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.590 
it's perfect obviously the guy doesn't
