00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.810
 jumping with 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.780
 how good time friends with you 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.000
 rainway and now i will do a review on 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 bang bang supply card which in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.070
 principle built himself went around with a friend 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.529
 under it now there 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.109
 principle so important so let's get started 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.910
 to review 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:28.320
 water supply so here it is in general respa 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.660
 blues and we don’t have that principle 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 nothing to show this lattice in non drawers 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.579
 floor drawers barrels which of course on 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.920
 graphics do barrels well it 's barrels too 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.790
 and the boxes that stand there between 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 walkways 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.809
 they are granular principle show nothing 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.840
 let's go further there is such a world worth it 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.690
 waist up there is the same rat 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.170
 so you can check then there is such 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.570
 moment 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 jump there you can stream there quite and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.300
 have the same who dreamed how you called 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.939
 so you can shoot in general 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.220
 you can shoot I already checked so 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.140
 let's jump but the exit is given tourists 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.189
 I will write here of course we will not where not 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.290
 This is not a continent here but 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.710
 it does not matter because you could not say a word 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.140
 but household is not necessary so let's continue 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.320
 but here it is the principle of the respite here they themselves 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.900
 the blue box can also jump in there 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.630
 and so almost no drawer can be taken as 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.470
 of coming forms so not line to we not 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.579
 we will jump further sofia here 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 zara boxes can also 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.060
 shoot one and had both 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 called our heads shoot here 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.000
 also the box is also worth it 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.410
 sweep 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.720
 in general, it is so worth it the loader is not 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.260
 so but you saw the loader standing behind 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.140
 offtop 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.120
 root supposedly varied or something 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.760
 it is but in general dick in hand also then 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.230
 there are such boxes and unfortunately did not 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.870
 so that you can jump on them 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.300
 my if that in this I deliver 1tb you 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.509
 everywhere will jump tulisa jump day and 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.950
 that the group can be more fun to jump 2 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.670
 that is, it will be possible to wet the semi-blocks 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.760
 for okay 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.240
 Well, that's the principle further here everything is so here 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.690
 30 takes the boxes boxes as it did not give 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.490
 from on red immediately here btr which I 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.860
 also unfortunately I can't build 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.350
 normally built such old days 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.810
 I know you are like the BTR or not well 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.490
 skin principle can also 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.800
 By the way, you can still shoot here 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.160
 so here's a knock down head know there 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.580
 read well 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.320
 but basically here I think it showed everything 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.830
 Let's go further 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.900
 jump here 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.090
 here, just so that there is no such 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.640
 crashing a forklift but here 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.220
 boxes on the kit so on the map you take 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.410
 the ceiling is so cool enough 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.280
 then we have so much sticking nothing 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.990
 scary krishna for everything so much 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.570
 here we have a loader and today which 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.200
 supposedly should lift boxes just worth 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.680
 and you can also shoot here a 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.650
 also possible h to the number seems from here you are 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.400
 so here and they jump out there on you 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.280
 avoid 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.770
 on the boxes you can climb well, so low 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.110
 showed already on the spirit of prince of persia let's 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.570
 held back on the spawn all of you for sure 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.590
 just the same here are not so for me 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.740
 cheek questions online read then if 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.480
 top basically everything is identical here by 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:45.170
 my court can jump up should 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.630
 You can also check so planika where not 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.580
 it was well here I was not here yet 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.520
 we pass the boxes and there are still tender 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.209
 pixel such which goes we invest 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.040
 here at all not look today 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.010
 they can also climb boxes 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.560
 back there will process mr. principle 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.440
 not very important and you can also hopps 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:12.380
 wear a sign hid and sit 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.020
 it's okay enough 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.930
 on principle here it is probably the whole map you 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.360
 all dump the framework set each 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.310
 would be natural in the description of the map if 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.180
 you after 10 likes some videos with 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.880
 just waiting for dislikes 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.130
 so on the street it is raining or quality by 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.500
 die and told tits they are all 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.600
 ok well, and the dioxide on the house show 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.440
 ceiling you very much the same eye not 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.380
 it turned out so here it is in principle necessary 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.580
 show not really if we duffel 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.920
 by the way such a tranny from never 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.900
 took a closer look that he so create jumps and 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.720
 By the way, you can be problematic, let them 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.110
 here you can’t jump out 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.000
 them so easy through the texture about me 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.860
 it was such a big-big trial 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.260
 you can jump me okay 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.420
 then I think you will not hurt in principle 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.900
 ship with map created to 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:09.070
 you played with friends on no file 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.160
 so that you would be fine so immediately clearly 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.400
 cool so to speak overall specifically for 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.550
 you guys download put huskies and 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.170
