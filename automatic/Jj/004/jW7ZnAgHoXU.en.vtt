00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
camera it's pretty though so there are

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.610 
camera it's pretty though so there are
those<00:04:49.660> I'm<00:04:50.560> going<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:52.230> should<00:04:53.230> have<00:04:53.380> opened

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
those I'm going to should have opened

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.580 
those I'm going to should have opened
these<00:04:54.960> because<00:04:55.960> they're<00:04:56.110> great<00:04:56.260> but<00:04:56.470> I<00:04:56.500> think

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
these because they're great but I think

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.220 
these because they're great but I think
I'll<00:04:56.860> do<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.010> separate<00:04:57.340> video<00:04:57.780> with<00:04:58.780> showing

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
I'll do a separate video with showing

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.140 
I'll do a separate video with showing
these<00:04:59.410> to<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.190> ones<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.490> these<00:05:00.670> a<00:05:00.730> little

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
these to the ones in these a little

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.120 
these to the ones in these a little
closer<00:05:01.420> because<00:05:01.930> I<00:05:01.960> think<00:05:02.230> this<00:05:02.620> camera<00:05:02.860> is

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
closer because I think this camera is

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.520 
closer because I think this camera is
going<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.870> go<00:05:04.870> kaput<00:05:05.230> so<00:05:06.180> um<00:05:07.180> yeah<00:05:08.140> so<00:05:08.410> these
