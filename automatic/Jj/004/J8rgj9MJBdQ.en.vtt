00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.469 
the design I believe it it just as hard
as<00:01:22.049> version<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.740> 73<00:01:23.250> oh<00:01:23.490> yeah<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
as version of the are 73 oh yeah and

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.870 
as version of the are 73 oh yeah and
this<00:01:24.750> done<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.490> believe<00:01:26.729> it's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it's like mid range because with the 12

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.039 
it's like mid range because with the 12
they<00:02:04.680> go<00:02:04.829> further<00:02:05.360> but<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.600> 20<00:02:06.930> they're

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
they go further but with the 20 they're

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.830 
they go further but with the 20 they're
more<00:02:07.200> accurate<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:08.459> they<00:02:08.580> don't<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:08.970> far

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
more accurate but they don't go as far

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.110
