00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.490
 Show mass of spots 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:25.580
 That's over ten hours of fabric 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:30.210
 and in the back there are two countries two 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:33.540
 indicator and a colorful mix as 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.030
 and here in the front are a lot of individual ones 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.739
 marines are actually the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.559
 leadership stoxx or small 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.370
 squads of four or five in all 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.640
 companies are a real forest 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.050
 still various script ears and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 the priest of the order and one more in front 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.600
 whole heap of weapons magnetized 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.719
 are for the cyborgs to replace us 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.120
 currently painting for a customer yes 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.170
 a complete arrange complete 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.860
 own orders and that is yes we have 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.150
 already made the compagnie and that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.320
 is now probably the prelude for the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.299
 fleet or 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.030
 the prelude of the first four five 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.040
 So there are still companies yet to come 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.520
 some and not one secret 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.400
 complete entire north to mean 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.080
 or to own anyway 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.009
 the hammer have that is one 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.759
 own orders these are the boys 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.439
 frankonia so the customer has the boys 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.060
 we recognize learned by the so-called 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.590
 Franks reckon that this is it 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.250
 coat over the existing jungs 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 are a bit medieval 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.990
 of course, and of course it will 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.390
 Great here with this forest 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.590
 Calling on others has the back banners 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.079
 what of such a medieval one 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.210
 Knight's very cool and the tigers 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.530
 then we have a lot of energy 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.390
 effects energy weapons and such 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.350
 worked around this special color scheme 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.240
 to break up again and here the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.430
 entire tanks as well as you can see 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.500
 It is very good in the countries 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 there was also a bit with osl 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.060

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.539

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.209

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.010
 Of course he wanted to impress 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.969
 I briefly show you frankonia it 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.420
 hopefully he will come a bit more 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:19.590
 more than to have a whole folder 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.719
