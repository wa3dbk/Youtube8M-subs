00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.969
 chocolate and white chocolate carry 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.559
 tolerated so more or less with these 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.540
 amounts or are to eat the two 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.550
 crepes the ingredients that we're going to 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.800
 use are for white chocolate 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.140
 two soup spoons of milk powder 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.269
 two tablespoons of milk 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.430
 skimmed liquid a teaspoon of 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.380
 sweetener and aroma of vanilla and for 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.419
 the chocolate two tablespoons of 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.120
 milk powder three tablespoons of milk 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.460
 liquid a teaspoon of a Qur'an tea and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.520
 a soup spoon of fat cocoa 2 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.010
 we put the two tablespoons of milk in 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.470
 powder in our bowl and now I use 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.720
 Asturian brand with the two tablespoons 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.470
 liquid milk tureens 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.110
 add a teaspoon of sweetener 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.390
 I bought them in the leader and I already 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.310
 see what I will tell what the outcome and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.410
 after fighting with the boat of the 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.059
 aroma I got put about ten 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.760
 droplets these aromas also sell them 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.100
 in the leader come several the best is 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.800
 that you try to see how you have been 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.650
 and add more or leave it as is 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.700
 mix a little bit so there is a 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.830
 uniform cream that will then weigh you for 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.460
 the cocoa we will need the two 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.070
 Spoons of milk powder we add 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 three tablespoons in this case of milk 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 liquid 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.909
 we also add the cocoa spoonful 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.159
 defatted I buy this in the 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.110
 herbalist and what you have to look at is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.270
 that is a pure defatted cocoa and that 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.470
 does not contain sugar and to others where 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 you buy is your choice 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.170
 and we add our teaspoon of 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.840
 sweetener 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.100
 stir well until it stays like 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.100
 a pasta of nocilla 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.970
 when we have mixed them both 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.630
 we let them rest and let's do the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.250
 crepes we will need two eggs four 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.980
 tablespoons of skimmed milk 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.800
 liquid one teaspoon of sweetener 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.630
 powder a teaspoon of cinnamon and a 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.430
 soup spoon of cornstarch that I 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.890
 forgot to put the image but that is not 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.320
 let's forget we put the two 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.819
 eggs in our goal to be able 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.980
 beat them 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.290
 and beat them until they're 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.930
 completely mixed 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.930
 add the teaspoon of the Koran t 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.260
 the 4 tablespoons of milk 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.260
 skimmed liquid 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.550
 these are to my taste you can modify 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.310
 the sweetest more cinnamon what 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.950
 you prefer, we also add the spoonful 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.290
 cornstarch soup this recipe in 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.240
 actually had two tablespoons of cornstarch 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.870
 I have reduced it to one and they come out 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.660
 well we are subtracting tolerated 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.580
 we move a little bit until it is included 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.080
 the cornstarch from our mix if we 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.550
 you can pass it through the blender 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.140
 but you have to have a little bit of 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.880
 patience and as you can see there is no lumps 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.860
 to make the crepes we will put a 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.160
 little bit of our mixture in the pan 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.040
 I use the typical frying pan 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.410
 eggs that is the little one and the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.640
 we stain well all over the pan and so 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.490
 we will get us to hit the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.040
 next we cover the fund in my case 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.570
 are three tablespoons of dough and here you 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.240
 I leave the whole video so you can see 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.180
 how do I make the crepes are not difficult 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.280
 but it is true that you need a 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.870
 little practice until they are left 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.060
 perfect 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.670
 we are touching the sides until 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.470
 let's notice that they take off and are doing 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.810
 a few bubbles in the middle of the cree 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.849
 that means that it is curdling and 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.590
 when we notice that there is almost liquid 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.769
 of our mass that is completely 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.750
 set is the time to turn it around 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.480
 here as you can see, they take off a little 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.299
 walls and almost next to me is not 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.129
 I do not have cream dough left then it's the 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.989
 moment with the help of the hands of 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.989
 lift a little and turn it over 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.510
 As you can see it's very easy but I 'm telling you 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.970
 It needs a little practice we leave 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.040
 that is done by the other side and we give 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.360
 a couple of more laps to finish 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.740
 to be done and take the color 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.740
 characteristic of pancakes 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.930
 we take them out and remove them to a plate and 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.840
 we repeat the process with other 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.550
 three tablespoons of dough 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.710
 until we cover the bottom of our 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.720
 pan if you do a big one with another 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.449
 pan that you know is simply 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.370
 until we notice that it is covered 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.710
 we turn it around and we already have it 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.000
 done we can remove to a plate for 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.000
 put our cream 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.730
 when we have finished them 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.889
 crepes simply add our 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.889
 cocoa and white chocolate creams 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.309
 we remember with a teaspoon of 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.889
 powdered sweetener a little bit of 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:28.229
 cinnamon and that's it already we have them we can 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.110
 Enjoy these wonderful crepes 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:34.080
 that are delicious for phase of 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.169
