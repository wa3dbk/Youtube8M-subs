00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.840
 This match highlights how an aggressive new system works 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.610

 The same shape will be hit for the next 22 minutes, but 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.520
 why ー prevents block pinch 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 However, the two minutes later was Tan 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.300
 Tokushima Voltis fights back when the ball is taken away in the middle 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.780
 You are forgiven for the front tare first place 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:26.729
 Still it is cherry blossom to get a chance of a free kick in this position in 26 minutes immediately after that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.729
 This is decided by us directly and catch up with the tie immediately 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.930
 Frontare who raised gear at a stretch by this is 29 minutes 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.930

 I was not tied to the score, but I will be on the frontale offensive 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.500
 Another 38 minutes 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.500
 Hiroki Kazama from a combination of three nice sides-ー 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.659
 It was a decisive opportunity, but you can not make this a mystery 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.730
 The frontal pu that the goal is difficult to break but the other party 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.860
 But also wrote determine business in the first half just before the end of 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.690
 This is also a goal 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.690
 Match the game one on one 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.010
 4 minutes Oshima of the second half rising to the front to Renato 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.530
 A strong shot from dribbling, but this is blocked by the goalkeeper 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:54.600
 22 minutes this time a free kick chance will come true from Hiroki Kazama 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.600
 This too will be saved by the goalkeeper 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.850
 Frontale setting up hair follicles 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.590
 Good God camphor tree in Kazuma District Okino Trombone path in 24 minutes 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.170
 But this also does not reach the score 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.170
 Fall-Winter to urge a memorial with the 27-minute temple 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.140
 Frontale wants to settle in 90 minutes somehow 29 minutes 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.140
 Yusuke Tanaka from the late head 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.129
 It was a decisive scene but Yusuke Tanaka 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.129
 We can not decide this 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.090
 Still 33 minutes 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.160
 Fall to winter while falling into a shrine of erato 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.160
 car 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:51.730
 Finally screw in the reverse path 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:55.739
 After the frontale which resisted the reversal, only guarding tightly 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.739
 But over over was the late Adi relational time 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.920
 I also know by the shot that I felt 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.920
 The match is overtaken into overtime 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:15.680
 Then in the second half of the extension in the second half of the unsparing enthusiasm battle , Kobayashi who was on the way back from injury was boldly brave 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.680
 I aim at the goal 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:26.160
 11 minutes this time I will meet you in front of the goal 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.160
 Are also Sugiyama has not stretched the body 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.020
 Start counter attack from here, etc. 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.020
 Kobayashi on the path of the head wilderness 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.150
 I shoot with a clear shot but I can not catch the frame slightly 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:51.750
 And the end of the second half of the extension 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:54.500
 It was the time when everyone was ready for pk war 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.500
 Ah ah ah 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.159
 Growth and day of Renato of soup to the right 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:15.490
 We made a four-turn advance with dramatic victory while suffering 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.689
 In the first half of the game, it was a deployment that allowed first place points, but how was the way out of the opponent? 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.909
 Is not it 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:27.639
 It would be nice if I could play with the right to use, but my opponent's long ball 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:30.789
 The second ball has been picked up by the intention of me or the middle stage 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:36.370
 I think it was binocular problem and that 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:41.129
 What challenges in still defensive surface, including the defense of the middle defensive side and one middle at the I 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.560
 I think that there are a lot of things to say but still on the offensive side 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:47.580
 Something more than a task 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.280
 There is also an idea of ​​a fate of the path course than usual, but also the mart extra variable 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.600
 I do not think 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.849
 It feels like a little bit of gear up as a team since being preempted 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.750
 From the first half of it 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:04.020
 Well oh well I do not do it cry fine from 2 pm 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:07.070
 Now that is also true in the league, but in the first half there are often times when the other party is in leadership 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.630
 I think there is a hill as a team 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.700
 I can not say the rhythm of the team if I do not hold the ball because Jun is the most important 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.990
 I have a hard time thinking 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.670
 Still now 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:23.449
 Because it started from my pass mistake when there was employment of Mino and the first point was decided 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:27.349
 If you make a mistake at me, marching will be over 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:32.380
 First of all, keep in mind that one company should never make a mistake 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:35.849
 I think Well Do not want to further doing the Tteyuu coffee 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:39.679
 The Emperor's Cup 4 round is scheduled for December 15 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.679
 I will tell you as soon as the details are decided
