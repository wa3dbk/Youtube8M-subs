back into it back into the timings of
things<00:00:42.340> and<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.960> it's<00:00:44.260> not<00:00:44.440> like<00:00:44.590> being<00:00:44.800> at

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130

weaker<00:00:47.080> sides<00:00:47.320> are<00:00:47.710> playing<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.100> weaker<00:00:48.310> side

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
weaker sides are playing a weaker side

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.790 
weaker sides are playing a weaker side
it's<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.840> different<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.380> you're<00:00:50.500> straight

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
it's it's different and you're straight

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.700 
it's it's different and you're straight
if<00:00:50.920> you're<00:00:50.950> on<00:00:51.100> a<00:00:51.180> 2,000<00:00:52.180> people<00:00:52.360> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
if you're on a 2,000 people and

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.930 
if you're on a 2,000 people and
first-team<00:00:53.710> Wales<00:00:54.190> team<00:00:54.490> straight<00:00:54.850> out

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
first-team Wales team straight out

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.150 
first-team Wales team straight out
herself<00:00:55.260> yeah<00:00:56.260> it's<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.680> bit<00:00:56.800> differently

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
herself yeah it's a bit differently

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
herself yeah it's a bit differently
after<00:00:57.310> that<00:00:57.490> you<00:00:57.580> have<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.760> get<00:00:57.910> used<00:00:58.060> to<00:00:58.150> it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
after that you have to get used to it

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.300 
after that you have to get used to it
again<00:00:58.450> and<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.680> I<00:00:59.740> thought<00:00:59.920> there's<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.130> bit<00:01:00.280> of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
again and so I thought there's a bit of

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.520 
again and so I thought there's a bit of
that<00:01:00.490> a<00:01:00.550> bit<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:01.150> it<00:01:01.480> first<00:01:01.750> up<00:01:01.960> playing<00:01:02.230> and

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
that a bit of it first up playing and

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.170 
that a bit of it first up playing and
getting<00:01:02.620> used<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.010> each<00:01:03.070> other<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:03.610> we're

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
getting used to each other and we're

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.930 
getting used to each other and we're
also<00:01:04.330> just<00:01:04.809> testing<00:01:05.229> things<00:01:05.470> and<00:01:05.650> putting

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
also just testing things and putting

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
also just testing things and putting
realizing<00:01:06.940> what<00:01:07.270> doesn't<00:01:07.540> work<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:07.810> what

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
realizing what doesn't work and what

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.020 
realizing what doesn't work and what
does<00:01:08.110> work<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:08.620> we've<00:01:09.250> had<00:01:09.370> two<00:01:09.550> games<00:01:09.790> now<00:01:10.000> and
