00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
little off piece into the weight if you

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.029 
little off piece into the weight if you
can<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:06.300> you<00:02:06.479> can't<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.929> suggest<00:02:07.440> making<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
can if you can't I suggest making the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.259 
can if you can't I suggest making the
whole<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> weight<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.820> bigger<00:02:09.090> so

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
whole of the weight a little bigger so

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.690 
whole of the weight a little bigger so
they<00:02:09.360> fit<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.630> there<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.400> we're<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.550> take

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
they fit in there so we're going to take

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:20.410 
they fit in there so we're going to take
our<00:02:11.910> stuff<00:02:12.410> or<00:02:13.410> weight<00:02:13.620> slide<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.370> down

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420

you can see how that's totally snug now
that's<00:02:23.730> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> hold<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.330> loop<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.349> place

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
that's going to hold that loop in place

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.530 
that's going to hold that loop in place
and<00:02:27.239> keep<00:02:27.420> your<00:02:27.510> hook<00:02:27.629> on<00:02:27.780> there<00:02:29.330> alright<00:02:30.330> so

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
little holes so it's down on there like

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.820 
little holes so it's down on there like
this<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.900> completes<00:03:23.290> that<00:03:23.710> step

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
this and that completes that step

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
alright guys so let's jump into your

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.900 
alright guys so let's jump into your
blade<00:03:27.820> on<00:03:28.020> take<00:03:29.020> your<00:03:29.170> blade<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.580> measure<00:03:30.580> and

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
blade on take your blade and measure and

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.640 
blade on take your blade and measure and
make<00:03:31.270> sure<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:31.990> not<00:03:32.200> touching<00:03:32.470> your

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
make sure that it is not touching your

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.380 
make sure that it is not touching your
hook<00:03:32.800> like<00:03:33.640> there<00:03:33.850> we<00:03:34.000> got<00:03:34.120> some<00:03:34.270> good

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
hook like there we got some good

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.390 
hook like there we got some good
clearance<00:03:34.720> there<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.590> reason<00:03:35.770> is<00:03:36.130> because

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
clearance there the reason is because

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.790 
clearance there the reason is because
when<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:36.880> blade<00:03:37.120> spinning<00:03:37.510> around<00:03:37.660> if<00:03:38.080> it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
when this blade spinning around if it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.320 
when this blade spinning around if it
gets<00:03:38.920> caught<00:03:39.100> in<00:03:39.160> your<00:03:39.250> hooks<00:03:39.520> it<00:03:39.730> won't<00:03:40.030> spin

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
gets caught in your hooks it won't spin

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.660 
gets caught in your hooks it won't spin
so<00:03:41.290> just<00:03:41.470> make<00:03:41.590> sure<00:03:41.800> it's<00:03:41.950> it's<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.460> little

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
so just make sure it's it's a little

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.640 
so just make sure it's it's a little
ways<00:03:42.910> away<00:03:43.060> from<00:03:43.120> hooks<00:03:43.450> now<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:43.870> take<00:03:44.020> the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
ways away from hooks now just take the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:56.220 
ways away from hooks now just take the
tip<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:44.950> your<00:03:44.980> wire<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:54.690> then<00:03:55.690> into<00:03:55.960> a<00:03:55.990> loop

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
tip of your wire here then into a loop

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.720 
tip of your wire here then into a loop
and<00:03:57.060> there<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.150> your<00:03:58.239> finished<00:03:58.390> spinner
