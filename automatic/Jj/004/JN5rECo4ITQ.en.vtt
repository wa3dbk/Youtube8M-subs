beam on top and then there's a number of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
beam on top and then there's a number of
other<00:00:52.379> wire<00:00:53.129> antenna<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.820> connected<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
other wire antenna is connected to it

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.850

that<00:00:54.780> come<00:00:54.960> off<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.170> antenna<00:00:55.620> so<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:04.350> cabin<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that come off the antenna so a cabin is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.960 
that come off the antenna so a cabin is
a<00:01:04.979> rather<00:01:05.339> small<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:06.030> cabin<00:01:06.470> but<00:01:07.970> while
