00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
was to play in the NHL uh I think I

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.210 
was to play in the NHL uh I think I
think<00:01:36.329> when<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> bugged<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:36.990> first<00:01:37.259> package<00:01:38.100> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220

think when I bugged my first package of
hockey<00:01:38.549> card<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.049> was<00:01:40.409> kind<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
hockey card I I think it was kind of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.950

cool<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.729> all<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.090> stats<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> back

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
cool to see all the stats on the back

really<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.270> think<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.469> kind<00:02:04.890> of

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
really I think it just kind of kind of

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.190 
really I think it just kind of kind of
came<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.369> me<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.729> soccer<00:02:06.329> wasn't<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.020> me

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.780 
there
I<00:02:09.869> guess<00:02:10.379> that's<00:02:10.679> getting<00:02:11.569> its

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
I guess that's getting its

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.490 
I guess that's getting its
a<00:02:12.819> little<00:02:13.120> boring<00:02:13.299> sometimes<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.019> just<00:02:14.260> run
