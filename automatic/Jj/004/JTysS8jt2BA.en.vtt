00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
you're playing these days everyone has a

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.880 
you're playing these days everyone has a
set<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.269> mics<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.690> PA<00:03:14.870> if<00:03:15.590> you're<00:03:15.769> not

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
set of mics and a PA if you're not

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.410 
set of mics and a PA if you're not
playing<00:03:16.220> through<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:16.640> then<00:03:16.910> you're<00:03:17.060> not<00:03:17.090> using

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
playing through it then you're not using

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.150 
playing through it then you're not using
the<00:03:17.630> full<00:03:17.810> potential<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.350> your<00:03:18.410> drum<00:03:18.650> set<00:03:18.860> so

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
the full potential of your drum set so

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.520 
the full potential of your drum set so
that<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.299> huge<00:03:20.510> strength<00:03:20.930> of<00:03:21.079> this<00:03:21.200> kit<00:03:21.500> that

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
that is a huge strength of this kit that

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.560 
that is a huge strength of this kit that
it<00:03:21.769> really<00:03:21.950> lends<00:03:22.190> itself<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.549> using<00:03:22.910> mics<00:03:23.120> to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
it really lends itself to using mics to

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.660 
it really lends itself to using mics to
recording<00:03:24.079> that's<00:03:24.890> why<00:03:24.980> we're<00:03:25.130> using<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.459> full

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
recording that's why we're using a full

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.930 
recording that's why we're using a full
set<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.180> little<00:03:26.390> bit<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.570> EQ<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:27.049> our<00:03:27.260> board

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
set and a little bit of EQ on our board

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.890 
set and a little bit of EQ on our board
we're<00:03:28.940> gonna<00:03:29.060> do<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.269> second<00:03:29.630> half<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.810> this

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
we're gonna do the second half of this

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.589 
we're gonna do the second half of this
video<00:03:30.200> as<00:03:30.470> always<00:03:30.860> with<00:03:31.160> just<00:03:31.519> two<00:03:32.180> overheads

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
video as always with just two overheads

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.900 
video as always with just two overheads
and<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.959> kick<00:03:33.170> mic<00:03:33.379> flat<00:03:34.040> EQ<00:03:34.190> so<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.640> can<00:03:34.760> tell

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
and a kick mic flat EQ so you can tell

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.190 
and a kick mic flat EQ so you can tell
what<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.090> kit<00:03:35.300> would<00:03:35.390> sound<00:03:35.569> like<00:03:35.660> from<00:03:35.989> just

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
what the kit would sound like from just

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.360 
what the kit would sound like from just
outside<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.860> kit<00:03:37.040> standing<00:03:37.760> across<00:03:37.940> from
