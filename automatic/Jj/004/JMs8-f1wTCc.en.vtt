00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.810
 hello yes yes yes these are fresh ears 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.000
 I 'll probably take my story with a little 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.130
 such a story from childhood when 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.130
 we came grandmothers and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.740
 let's say in honor of our arrival early 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.680
 in the morning cut his piglet looked and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.559
 That's when it started so small 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.620
 crowd fight for salty for smolin and and 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.950
 pork ears is so tasty 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.940
 in fact we have had these watched them 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.559
 guns will be two recipe 2 resort 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.110
 It turned out too somehow by chance 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.420
 first it goes without saying with 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.989
 raspberry ears and the second of these salty 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.289
 guns we will make an oven roll that is very 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.539
 also a few recipes will remain delicious and 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:09.720
 make this little note this one 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:12.000
 Edison's recipe is nervous these ears need 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.430
 will look at open oz will 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.299
 many many smoke you are lucky if you 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:25.890
 there is an excerpt you are lucky dollar per click 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:28.380
 which is where to call so dial 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.229
 patience to share courage and 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.950
 cook with war and prices and guns 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.520
 You will 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.679
 This is delicious 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 mine how useful it is nonetheless 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.869
 Today we find the interpretation of the fact that this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.880
 very tasty 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.409
 from such small notes I want you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.079
 make a little tip 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.479
 put the ear on the skewer before 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.140
 preferably here in this place cut 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.909
 with a knife so that it opens so you have 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.310
 then get the opportunity to view 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.689
 not bad and pain inside so there is not 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.500
 left extra dirt well, even skewer 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.319
 Then so color when the little one opened 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.470
 so of course this occupation is not from 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.099
 light cartilage interfere but nonetheless 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.500
 no one says be easy 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.709
 Yes, no one promised that there will be q but also 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.319
 such helpful advice before you start with 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.790
 it is advisable to beg the ears 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.150
 if you feel sorry for her 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.150
 Pour fat here fat will be Nemer 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.769
 pay special attention to you stalling 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.409
 the thicker part of the ear that is keep 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.439
 we need him longer as we put in advance 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.540
 teapot to boil water 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:53.269
 prepare the saucepan here and now 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.139
 when our ear is ready here it is good 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.540
 darkened google and now it 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.680
 remove the saucepan and pour boiling water 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.489
 to 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.489
 from sour 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.280
 it is not necessary to completely cover 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:32.010
 half and then after time just 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:32.010
 turn over but meanwhile we fry the second 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:47.250
 No, we â€™re frying, and sometimes it turns out 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:50.420
 such balls of a piece poured now bye 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:57.720
 may be 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:04:00.410
 it is the master herself in need 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.240
 extreme but you will appreciate the taste 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.900
 present with my mother's okushka as 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.860
 spill these types long ago this gun 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.700
 which was some water already enough of it 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:21.950
 we will get it now to clean 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:21.950
 is it replaced 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.580
 that process did not stop 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.919
 use the operator I'll see 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.349
 the operator will go sidushka how to clean 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.939
 now show practical for cleaning the abalone 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.279
 use a stalk 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:47.639
 from corn or in domestic conditions 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:49.050
 it will replace the brush here and also we need 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.089
 there will be a thin trickle of water to 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.999
 shine again from the extra soot he saw 

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:57.300
 how good is the part of ilushka here we are already on 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:05:01.770
 the paths to our dish are examined and 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.909
 cleaned now need salt now 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.689
 friends favorite spices we use 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:13.080
 just take and do not hesitate sprinkle 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:15.539
 salt how would you so much of them and not 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.939
 oversalt the fat a lot does not take 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:21.240
 but where there is a salon someone eat meat 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:23.749
 then it's okay let's say so cloak 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.129
 and a pinch of salt for each gun 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:28.860
 spices, as it were, too, especially do not regret 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:32.639
 excess fray and need feeds and 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.999
 add flavor to flavor 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:39.479
 or hurry to eat now because 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:43.560
 so wet ugly so their 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.920
 need to give for this 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.570
 alternatively they can be 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.400
 by 10 positive forging so they 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.550
 dried up let's say it began to be determined 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.320
 zhirok that is, how have u boiled purchased 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.110
 such pain from a grim golden hue 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.040
 or alternatively we have a way of it 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:08.170
 indication now on group sex 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:12.140
 new and dry immediately on the burner 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:16.520
 like so constantly turning them 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:19.760
 dry but this thing is literally you 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.090
 it takes ten minutes you actually what 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.280
 guns are ready to just pour on 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.080
 glasses of beer but who cares 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.710
 the fate of the other two ears 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.420
 who sing on the steering wheel 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:36.670
 stay with us and follow the link 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.770
 watch the second video one more minute 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:44.020
 to make sure 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.020
 ear readiness and one of them I will cut 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:51.680
 Here, in principle, we do not see raw meat 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:55.390
 even here some kind of juice comes through 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:58.390
 probably sticks slush soup to handle no 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.390
 you
