00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
different than zombies but was similar

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.010 
different than zombies but was similar
to<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.380> when<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.800> like<00:04:40.980> two<00:04:41.280> guys<00:04:41.540> against<00:04:42.540> an

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
to it when you like two guys against an

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.260

army<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:43.920> that's<00:04:44.280> way<00:04:44.520> better<00:04:44.700> than<00:04:44.910> playing

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
army and that's way better than playing

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.540 
army and that's way better than playing
zombies<00:04:45.840> because<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.470> has<00:04:46.620> more<00:04:46.650> features<00:04:47.130> in
