00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
unlike her usual heavy eyeliner look I

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.709 
unlike her usual heavy eyeliner look I
thought<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.010> was<00:00:08.340> very<00:00:08.700> natural<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.570> it's

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
thought this was very natural so it's

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.600 
thought this was very natural so it's
really<00:00:09.960> appropriate<00:00:10.320> for<00:00:10.650> summer<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.400> has<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
really appropriate for summer it has a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.339 
really appropriate for summer it has a
little<00:00:11.849> bit<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.150> bronzy<00:00:12.660> color<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.170> there

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
little bit of bronzy color in there

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.259 
little bit of bronzy color in there

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
paired with natural-looking pink lip

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.150
