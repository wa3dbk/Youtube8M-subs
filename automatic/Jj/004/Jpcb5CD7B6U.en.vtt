00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
image because I think it's a little

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
image because I think it's a little
easier<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.960> I'm<00:01:25.259> gonna<00:01:25.409> zoom<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.890> just

easier to see and I'm gonna zoom in just

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.710 
easier to see and I'm gonna zoom in just
a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:26.189> bit<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> when<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.390> click<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
image it's gonna show you what it looks

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.830

like<00:01:32.670> straight<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> camera<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.810> you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
like straight out of the camera so you

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.270 
like straight out of the camera so you
can<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.200> she<00:01:34.350> has<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.189> of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
can see she has just a little bit of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.090 
can see she has just a little bit of
splotchiness<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.970> her<00:01:36.060> skin<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> when

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
splotchiness in her skin and then when

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.039 
splotchiness in her skin and then when
you<00:01:38.189> unclick<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.240> gonna<00:01:39.390> show<00:01:39.750> what

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you unclick on it it's gonna show what

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.819 
you unclick on it it's gonna show what
this<00:01:40.560> particular<00:01:40.799> setting<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> look

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
this particular setting is going to look

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.550 
this particular setting is going to look
so<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.280> want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.820> maybe<00:01:45.119> back<00:01:45.750> off<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.320> just

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so I want to maybe back off on this just

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.109 
so I want to maybe back off on this just
a<00:01:46.680> little<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.399> looking<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.850> little

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
a little because it is looking a little

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.499 
a little because it is looking a little
bit<00:01:48.450> too<00:01:48.960> much<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.399> gonna<00:01:50.549> bring<00:01:50.939> these

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
bit too much so I'm gonna bring these

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.620 
bit too much so I'm gonna bring these
details<00:01:52.020> down<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> -<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.630> then

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
details down just to - and then

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.410 
details down just to - and then
threshold<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.369> adjusts<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
threshold is really what adjusts the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.230 
threshold is really what adjusts the
kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.560> plastic<00:01:59.340> look<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
kind of I think plastic look or the you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
kind of I think plastic look or the you
know<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.360> real<00:02:00.689> smooth<00:02:01.110> smooth<00:02:01.500> part<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.340> I'm

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
know the real smooth smooth part so I'm

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.100 
know the real smooth smooth part so I'm
going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.759> back<00:02:03.000> off<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.540> little<00:02:03.960> bit

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
going to just back off on a little bit

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.539 
going to just back off on a little bit
of<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> threshold<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.070> can<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
of the threshold so that we can see a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.160 
of the threshold so that we can see a
little<00:02:05.759> texture<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> these

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
little texture and see some of these

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.650 
little texture and see some of these
hairs<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> other<00:02:09.420> thing

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
hairs in here and then the other thing

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.330 
hairs in here and then the other thing
too<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.319> can<00:02:10.349> actually

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
too is that you can actually

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.770 
too is that you can actually
create<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.480> mask<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.890> their<00:02:14.040> skin<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.630> can

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
create a mask for their skin and you can

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.920 
create a mask for their skin and you can
adjust<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.230> opacity<00:02:16.560> of<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.040> mask<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.780> I'm

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
adjust the opacity of that mask so I'm

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.570 
adjust the opacity of that mask so I'm
going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> click<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.860> white<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.489> so

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
going to click on the on white just so

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.089 
going to click on the on white just so
you<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:20.940> see<00:02:21.330> all<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:22.260> white<00:02:22.440> areas<00:02:22.860> are

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
you can see all the white areas are

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.130 
you can see all the white areas are
where<00:02:23.340> portraiture<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.270> not<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.959> touch

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
where portraiture is not going to touch

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.650 
where portraiture is not going to touch
and<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.849> if<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.060> adjust<00:02:27.480> the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and you can see that if I adjust the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.650 
and you can see that if I adjust the
opacity<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.380> mask<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.239> going<00:02:30.540> to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
opacity of the mask that it's going to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.600 
opacity of the mask that it's going to
you<00:02:31.080> know<00:02:31.200> leave<00:02:31.410> areas<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:32.040> should<00:02:32.340> stay

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you know leave areas that should stay

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.430 
you know leave areas that should stay
with<00:02:32.940> detail<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.720> background<00:02:34.230> her

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
portraiture on those five images and

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.910 
portraiture on those five images and
then<00:03:36.450> they're<00:03:36.690> gonna<00:03:36.900> have<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> nice

then they're gonna have you know a nice

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.979 
then they're gonna have you know a nice
basic<00:03:38.190> skin<00:03:38.640> smoothing<00:03:38.970> right<00:03:39.569> out<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
basic skin smoothing right out of the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.020 
basic skin smoothing right out of the
the<00:03:40.290> gate<00:03:40.829> that<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:41.310> don't<00:03:41.489> even<00:03:41.579> have<00:03:41.819> to

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
the gate that we don't even have to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.000 
the gate that we don't even have to
necessarily<00:03:42.180> open<00:03:42.959> them<00:03:43.109> in<00:03:43.260> Photoshop<00:03:43.560> to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
necessarily open them in Photoshop to

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.090 
necessarily open them in Photoshop to
show<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> client<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.840> it's<00:03:46.109> really<00:03:46.350> made<00:03:46.920> our

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
show a client so it's really made our

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.580 
show a client so it's really made our
images<00:03:47.459> look<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.819> lot<00:03:48.060> better<00:03:48.209> before<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.380> even

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
images look a lot better before we even

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.340 
images look a lot better before we even
get<00:03:50.130> them<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.790> Photoshop<00:03:51.060> stage<00:03:51.510> so

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
get them to the Photoshop stage so

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.519 
get them to the Photoshop stage so
hopefully<00:03:52.709> that<00:03:52.829> was<00:03:52.920> helpful<00:03:52.980> for<00:03:53.310> you
