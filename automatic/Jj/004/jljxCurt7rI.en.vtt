hey guys Brian Bennett for CNET and

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:06.710 
hey guys Brian Bennett for CNET and
we're<00:00:04.859> taking<00:00:04.979> a<00:00:05.189> look<00:00:05.370> at<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.729> bun<00:00:06.029> velocity

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
we're taking a look at the bun velocity

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.070 
we're taking a look at the bun velocity
brew<00:00:06.959> VT<00:00:07.559> now<00:00:08.190> this<00:00:08.520> coffee<00:00:08.820> maker<00:00:09.090> may<00:00:09.780> look

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080

brew VT now this coffee maker may look
basic<00:00:10.530> but<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.070> anything<00:00:11.280> but<00:00:11.910> it<00:00:12.180> costs

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
basic but it is anything but it costs

one hundred and seventy nine dollars
which<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.910> pretty<00:00:15.480> expensive<00:00:15.810> but<00:00:16.650> what<00:00:16.800> it

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
which is pretty expensive but what it

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.340 
which is pretty expensive but what it
does<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.280> is<00:00:17.520> brew<00:00:17.820> an<00:00:18.030> incredibly<00:00:18.450> tasty<00:00:18.930> pot

of<00:00:19.470> coffee<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.730> three<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.090> half

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
of coffee in just three and a half

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.320 
of coffee in just three and a half
minutes<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:22.170> also<00:00:22.410> keeps<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> coffee<00:00:23.789> hot<00:00:24.090> for

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
minutes it also keeps the coffee hot for

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.700 
minutes it also keeps the coffee hot for
a<00:00:24.360> very<00:00:24.510> long<00:00:24.660> time<00:00:24.690> if<00:00:25.020> it's<00:00:25.140> thermal<00:00:25.530> carafe

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
a very long time if it's thermal carafe

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.830 
a very long time if it's thermal carafe
and<00:00:26.190> what<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.270> about<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.779> that

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and what I really like about it is that

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.920 
and what I really like about it is that
when<00:00:28.350> you<00:00:28.440> pour<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:30.000> pours<00:00:30.270> very

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
when you pour it really pours very

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.720 
when you pour it really pours very
accurately<00:00:31.410> almost<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> little<00:00:32.550> like

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
accurately almost like a little like

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
cups pretty slick so how does the Bunn

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.620 
cups pretty slick so how does the Bunn
velocity<00:00:37.829> brew<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.670> brew<00:00:39.030> coffee<00:00:39.270> so

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630

matter of fact the way you actually brew

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.429 
matter of fact the way you actually brew
this<00:01:48.990> thing<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.500> by<00:01:49.799> opening<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> lid<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
this thing is by opening up the lid and

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.420 
this thing is by opening up the lid and
putting<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.530> back<00:01:52.619> down<00:01:52.829> again<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
putting it back down again and that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490 
putting it back down again and that
initiates<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.210> brew<00:01:54.450> cycle<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.439> a

initiates the brew cycle so in a
