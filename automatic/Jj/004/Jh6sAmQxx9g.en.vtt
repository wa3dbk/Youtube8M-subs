00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
super small size large sensor that's

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.490 
super small size large sensor that's
pretty<00:01:00.239> much<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.449> those<00:01:00.809> two<00:01:00.960> things<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.379> mean

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
pretty much it those two things I mean

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
pretty much it those two things I mean
if<00:01:01.649> there's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> million<00:01:02.399> other<00:01:02.579> things<00:01:02.910> too

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
if there's a million other things too

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.660 
if there's a million other things too
but<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.660> big<00:01:03.899> reasons<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.949> portable<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
but the big reasons is it's portable and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.609 
but the big reasons is it's portable and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.930 
lens it has a 28 millimeter wide angle
lens<00:02:34.920> which<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.070> nice<00:02:36.220> because<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.550> only<00:02:36.670> has<00:02:36.910> a

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
lens which is nice because it only has a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.090 
lens which is nice because it only has a
zoom<00:02:37.840> is<00:02:37.990> only<00:02:38.140> three<00:02:38.410> point<00:02:38.650> eight<00:02:38.770> times

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
zoom is only three point eight times

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.190 
zoom is only three point eight times
it's<00:02:39.400> not<00:02:39.490> like<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> travel<00:02:40.630> zoom<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:40.930> get<00:02:41.110> in

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
it's not like a travel zoom you get in

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.510 
it's not like a travel zoom you get in
20<00:02:41.470> or<00:02:41.500> 30<00:02:41.740> times<00:02:41.800> zoom<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.430> 3.8<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.370> it's

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
20 or 30 times zoom it's 3.8 so it's

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.750 
20 or 30 times zoom it's 3.8 so it's
nice<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.000> wide<00:02:46.180> angle<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.920> has<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> ring<00:02:48.610> on

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
nice of the wide angle it has a ring on

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.640 
nice of the wide angle it has a ring on
the<00:02:48.910> front<00:02:49.150> for<00:02:49.390> all<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.720> manual<00:02:50.140> controls

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.460 
the front for all the manual controls
people<00:02:50.950> compared<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.030> s90<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.989> s<00:02:53.140> 95

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
people compared to the s90 this is s 95

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.479 
people compared to the s90 this is s 95
you<00:02:54.040> can<00:02:54.220> hear<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:55.709> clicks<00:02:56.709> there<00:02:56.980> so<00:02:57.430> you

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
you can hear the clicks there so you

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:58.979 
you can hear the clicks there so you
don't<00:02:57.610> accidentally<00:02:58.090> turn<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.480> it's<00:02:58.630> nice<00:02:58.840> and

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
don't accidentally turn it it's nice and

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.130 
don't accidentally turn it it's nice and
you<00:02:59.080> can<00:02:59.260> use<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.770> set<00:03:00.610> aperture<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.570> ISO

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
you can use that to set aperture and ISO

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.910 
you can use that to set aperture and ISO
and<00:03:03.930> manually<00:03:04.930> focus<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.530> everything<00:03:05.800> like
