00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
necessarily that we're looking at it

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.130 
necessarily that we're looking at it
that<00:00:28.140> way<00:00:28.170> based<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.340> who<00:00:30.029> how<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.660> skilled

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that way based on who how the skilled

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.709 
that way based on who how the skilled
players<00:00:31.410> were<00:00:31.619> performing<00:00:32.099> more<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
players were performing more just the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.700 
players were performing more just the
level<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.079> execution<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> quarterback

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
level of execution of the quarterback

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.500
