 henry h to life to occupational health presents 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.259
 I use lighting that I am the Taiti 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.820
 You go to the market and think about your health. 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.610
 I want to reduce calories the fat uras sugar cholesterol mitchell 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.099
 and what you find 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.099
 a tangle of light city products 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:33.590
 to understand this bob bell victory you need to know the feed yourself 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.149
 what is the official language 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.100
 on food labels 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.880
 first let's get to know the taiti 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.000
 the food is from rectifying a certain ingredient is totally 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.250
 removed from its composition 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.150
 this missing ingredient 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.480
 It can be saulos sugars. 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 cholesterol and other fat 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.110
 here we have work with cholesterol 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.000
 the saturated fat and sugar is a normal ice cream 'already in the food of the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.610
 retina in this example 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.640
 the sugar was taken out but it could be the cholesterol the saturated hard pagot 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.990
 since then he suffers from diabetes without sugar 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.770
 sugar was the ingredient withdrawn the product can be used by 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.820
 diabetics 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.219
 that do not need 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.550
 restriction 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.760
 but who needs to lower cholesterol 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.100
 you can not manage speeding 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.060
 now we have an ice cream and tahiti without cholesterol if cholesterol was withdrawn 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.860
 the product can be used by those who have high cholesterol 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.990
 but it can not be used by diabetics because the sugar continues 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.659
 present in the composition 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.939
 from ice cream 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.260
 network products 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.370
 have to ensure to the consumer that that substance has been fully 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.580
 can be used by diabetics when 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.180
 have sugar for people with high cholesterol cholesterol need to be zero 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.649
 low blood pressure 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.600
 the product should not have salt 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 attention 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.709
 dailytech do not mean food has few calories 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.229
 in this example we have an Aids 'chocolate' 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:19.629
 which has no sugar at high levels of fat and is high 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.939
 medical lorico 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.600
 chocolat and not AIDS 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.890
 at 565 calories per 100 grams 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.270
 vilson covatti's network 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.410
 has 535 calories per 100 grams 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.979
 the difference is only 30 calories the support of the network has no sugar what 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:38.539
 it's good 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.539
 but not to get the taste of a bar of roraima 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.180
 it is necessary to increase the amount of fat 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.980
 and consequently of calories do not be deceived used old cola without sugar 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.170
 is indicated for diabetics but will not help anyone 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.589
 to lose weight 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.589
 now let's get to know a light product 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:07.269
 the food is light when any of its components have diminished amount 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.849
 given up on reduced fat can be the cholesterol supervision 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.739
 with others once again we have the ice cream as an example because here it has cholesterol 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.140
 the saturated fat and sugar in the food of aids we withdraw the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.579
 sugar and in the light component sugar was only reduced 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:29.969
 light products 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:35.449
 I have to assure the consumer that at least 25% of the substance has been 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:40.569
 withdrawal from the food if it is light for sugar should not be used 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.620
 diabetics because it can contain up to 75% sugar if it is light and hard dresser 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.530
 should not be used by persons with restricted 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:54.620
 a lot of attention to what you eat 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.620
 not to commit an act of hare 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.670
 always read the product label 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.340
 there is the information required by law and there is no 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.839
 advertising 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:10.799
 see for example the skim milk label the day for fats 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.579
 light for cholesterol and sugar 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.180
 in this nutritional information we have in a portion of 20 grams what 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.259
 is equivalent to a 200 ml glass the calorie value 70 calories each steer deals 11 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:30.889
 grams proteins seven grams total fat 0 'gram 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.389
 saturated fat 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.970
 grass or cholesterol - 5 milligrams 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.630
 no grass 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.010
 Calcium 265 milligrams 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.200
 sodium that is 85 milligrams sau 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.039
 health is the greatest good of us all
