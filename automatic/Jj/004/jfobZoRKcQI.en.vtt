00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
you use the remote start the car is

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.420 
you use the remote start the car is
actually<00:00:02.939> pretty<00:00:03.179> smart<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.870> winter<00:00:04.170> it

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
actually pretty smart in the winter it

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.070 
actually pretty smart in the winter it
automatically<00:00:05.430> knows<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:06.210> turn<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
automatically knows to turn on the

drivers heated seat and also

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.009 
drivers heated seat and also
automatically<00:00:09.330> knows<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.630> turn<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
automatically knows to turn on the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.020 
automatically knows to turn on the
heated<00:00:10.290> steering<00:00:10.530> wheel<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:11.070> addition<00:00:11.880> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
heated steering wheel in addition to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.539 
heated steering wheel in addition to
that<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.210> also<00:00:12.360> notice<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.679> car<00:00:13.920> senses

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
that I also notice that the car senses

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.519 
that I also notice that the car senses
whether<00:00:14.880> or<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.420> needs<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.809> turn<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
whether or not it needs to turn on the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.210 
whether or not it needs to turn on the
front<00:00:17.340> windshield<00:00:18.109> warmer<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.770> rear

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
front windshield warmer or the rear

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.330 
front windshield warmer or the rear
windshield<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.939> fog<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.660> de-icer<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.830> that's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
windshield the fog or de-icer so that's

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.859 
windshield the fog or de-icer so that's
actually<00:00:23.519> pretty<00:00:23.910> good<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.240> glad<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.630> knows

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
actually pretty good I'm glad it knows

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.269 
actually pretty good I'm glad it knows
things<00:00:25.320> like<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:27.500> there<00:00:28.500> are<00:00:28.529> settings

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
things like that and there are settings

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.269 
things like that and there are settings
inside<00:00:29.970> where<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.869> ask<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.920> tell<00:00:32.130> it

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
inside where you can ask you can tell it

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639 
inside where you can ask you can tell it
to<00:00:32.399> do<00:00:32.550> things<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.329> turn<00:00:33.540> certain<00:00:34.200> parts

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
to do things like to turn certain parts

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.200 
to do things like to turn certain parts
on<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.280> say<00:00:35.460> rain<00:00:35.730> sensing<00:00:36.149> wipers

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
on like you can say rain sensing wipers

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.340 
on like you can say rain sensing wipers
on<00:00:37.250> automatically<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.120> disses<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> berry

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
on automatically and you disses a berry

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.549 
on automatically and you disses a berry
deep<00:00:40.680> customization<00:00:41.600> system<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
deep customization system here so if you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.410 
deep customization system here so if you
don't<00:00:43.590> want<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> turning<00:00:44.520> on<00:00:44.640> your<00:00:44.850> heated<00:00:45.210> or

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
don't want it turning on your heated or

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810 
don't want it turning on your heated or
ventilated<00:00:46.320> si<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.640> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
ventilated si you don't have to have it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.569 
ventilated si you don't have to have it
do<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> connect<00:00:50.399> touch

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
do so but all in all you connect touch

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610 
do so but all in all you connect touch
is<00:00:50.760> probably<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> best<00:00:51.600> touchscreen<00:00:52.170> system

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
is probably the best touchscreen system

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.830 
is probably the best touchscreen system
on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> entire<00:00:53.250> market<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.600> works

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
on the entire market and it works

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.170 
on the entire market and it works
equally<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.559> same<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> G<00:00:56.340> facility<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
equally the same in the G facility the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.130 
equally the same in the G facility the
one<00:00:57.390> major<00:00:57.629> concern<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.649> you're<00:00:58.770> buying<00:00:59.039> a

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
one major concern when you're buying a

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.319 
one major concern when you're buying a
performance<00:01:01.140> rear-wheel<00:01:01.649> drive<00:01:01.680> car<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.609> how

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
performance rear-wheel drive car is how

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.390 
performance rear-wheel drive car is how
does<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.840> handle<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.830> inclement

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
does it handle when you have inclement

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.980 
does it handle when you have inclement
weather<00:01:05.640> conditions<00:01:06.450> when<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.810> snow

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
weather conditions when you have snow

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.280 
weather conditions when you have snow
well<00:01:07.830> basically<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.760> never<00:01:09.659> had<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> problem

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
well basically I never had a problem

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.859 
well basically I never had a problem
with<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.799> SRT<00:01:11.810> 6.1<00:01:12.810> liter<00:01:13.100> 300<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> had

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
with the SRT 6.1 liter 300 that I had

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.170 
with the SRT 6.1 liter 300 that I had
and<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.409> 6.4<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.640> doesn't<00:01:17.939> give<00:01:18.030> me<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and this 6.4 really doesn't give me a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.760 
and this 6.4 really doesn't give me a
problem<00:01:18.570> either<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> main<00:01:19.380> thing<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
problem either but the main thing that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
problem either but the main thing that
you<00:01:19.860> basically<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you basically have to do is you have to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.080 
you basically have to do is you have to
be<00:01:21.570> diligent<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.490> keeping<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.580> revs<00:01:23.820> down

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
be diligent in keeping the revs down

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.120 
be diligent in keeping the revs down
because<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> problem<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> car<00:01:25.830> even

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
because the problem with this car even

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
because the problem with this car even
on<00:01:26.400> dry<00:01:26.610> pavement<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:28.080> has

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
on dry pavement is that this thing has

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.760 
on dry pavement is that this thing has
so<00:01:28.560> much<00:01:28.799> torque<00:01:29.329> that<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.650> know

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
so much torque that just you know

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
so much torque that just you know
stepping<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> pedal<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.970> little<00:01:33.270> too<00:01:33.450> hard

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
stepping on the pedal a little too hard

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.499 
stepping on the pedal a little too hard
is<00:01:34.049> enough<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> break<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:35.210> wheel<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
is enough to break the right wheel the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.069 
is enough to break the right wheel the
wheels<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> back<00:01:37.320> loose<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.900> you<00:01:39.900> don't

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
wheels in the back loose and you don't

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
wheels in the back loose and you don't
want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.619> slipping<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.070> sliding<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.610> over

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
want to be slipping and sliding all over

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.870 
want to be slipping and sliding all over
the<00:01:41.970> ice<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.600> snow<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:44.040> basically<00:01:44.670> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the ice or the snow so basically you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
the ice or the snow so basically you
just<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.570> keep<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.930> car<00:01:46.200> under<00:01:46.740> 30

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
just have to keep this car under 30

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.920 
just have to keep this car under 30
miles<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.579> hour<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> Jeep<00:01:48.360> doesn't<00:01:48.750> have

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
miles an hour now the Jeep doesn't have

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
miles an hour now the Jeep doesn't have
that<00:01:49.079> problem<00:01:49.229> obviously<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
that problem obviously because it's you

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.080 
that problem obviously because it's you
know<00:01:50.909> um<00:01:51.180> all-wheel<00:01:52.079> drive<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> problem

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
know um all-wheel drive but the problem

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.460 
know um all-wheel drive but the problem
with<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.509> Jeep<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.110> comes<00:01:55.320> on

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
with the Jeep is that it comes on

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.160 
with the Jeep is that it comes on
Pirelli<00:01:56.159> ties<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.969> those<00:01:57.360> Pirellis<00:01:58.049> are

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
Pirelli ties and those Pirellis are

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.490 
Pirelli ties and those Pirellis are
really<00:01:58.500> not<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.799> great<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.310> snow<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.299> ice

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
really not that great in snow and ice

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.870 
really not that great in snow and ice
now<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.829> thing<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.070> really<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.490> about<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
now one thing I really like about this

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.370 
now one thing I really like about this
car<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.020> get<00:02:04.170> closer

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
car is like you know as you get closer

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.140 
car is like you know as you get closer
to<00:02:04.649> another<00:02:04.890> car<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.490> front

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
to another car you have front

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.810 
to another car you have front
detection<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.590> also<00:02:08.920> like<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.399> tells<00:02:09.610> you

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
detection and it also like it tells you

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.120 
detection and it also like it tells you
how<00:02:10.000> close<00:02:10.180> you<00:02:10.450> are<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.960> next<00:02:11.170> vehicle<00:02:11.350> so

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
how close you are to the next vehicle so

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.490 
how close you are to the next vehicle so
front<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.940> rear<00:02:13.270> ultrasound<00:02:13.990> is<00:02:14.170> really

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
front and rear ultrasound is really

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.110 
front and rear ultrasound is really
great<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:14.920> also<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:15.460> you're<00:02:15.610> driving<00:02:15.820> too

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
great and also if you're driving too

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.600 
great and also if you're driving too
fast<00:02:16.150> it'll<00:02:16.750> warn<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:18.130> feels<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.490> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
fast it'll warn you if it feels that you

fast it'll warn you if it feels that you
driving<00:02:18.970> too<00:02:19.120> fast<00:02:19.440> especially<00:02:20.440> if<00:02:21.430> you

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
driving too fast especially if you

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.120 
driving too fast especially if you
bypass<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.390> speed<00:02:22.870> limit<00:02:23.200> which<00:02:23.410> they<00:02:23.620> show

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
bypass the speed limit which they show

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.650 
bypass the speed limit which they show
you<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.370> speed<00:02:24.640> limit<00:02:24.940> right<00:02:25.090> here<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.540> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
you the speed limit right here on the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.590 
you the speed limit right here on the
UConnect<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:27.550> knows<00:02:27.850> exactly<00:02:28.060> what<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
UConnect and it knows exactly what the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.720 
UConnect and it knows exactly what the
speed<00:02:28.840> limit<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.380> whatever<00:02:29.500> zone<00:02:29.920> but

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
speed limit is for whatever zone but

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.670 
speed limit is for whatever zone but
when<00:02:31.300> you're<00:02:31.390> driving<00:02:31.600> in<00:02:31.840> bad<00:02:32.020> weather<00:02:32.290> the

you enough space to pull out see so um
all<00:03:26.739> works<00:03:27.540> extraordinarily<00:03:28.540> well<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.880> if

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
all works extraordinarily well and if

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.190 
all works extraordinarily well and if
you're<00:03:31.180> worried<00:03:31.600> about<00:03:31.690> getting<00:03:32.019> a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
you're worried about getting a

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.020 
you're worried about getting a
rear-wheel<00:03:32.620> drive<00:03:32.650> car<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:33.370> really<00:03:33.760> wouldn't

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
rear-wheel drive car I really wouldn't

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.940 
rear-wheel drive car I really wouldn't
worry<00:03:34.239> most<00:03:34.630> people<00:03:34.989> say<00:03:35.290> what<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.650> should<00:03:35.830> do

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
worry most people say what you should do

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.979 
worry most people say what you should do
is<00:03:36.070> get<00:03:36.250> what<00:03:37.209> are<00:03:37.300> they<00:03:37.390> called

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
is get what are they called

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.830 
is get what are they called
winter<00:03:38.290> tires<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:39.459> could<00:03:39.760> go<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.180> route<00:03:40.420> but

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
winter tires you could go that route but

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.870 
winter tires you could go that route but
ultimately<00:03:41.500> nothing's<00:03:42.100> gonna<00:03:42.280> really<00:03:42.580> be

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
ultimately nothing's gonna really be

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.640 
ultimately nothing's gonna really be
all-wheel<00:03:43.390> drive<00:03:43.630> because<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.200> ability

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
all-wheel drive because of the ability

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.220 
all-wheel drive because of the ability
to<00:03:44.680> really<00:03:45.310> dig<00:03:45.640> through<00:03:46.090> snow<00:03:46.450> it's<00:03:46.720> not<00:03:46.930> just

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
to really dig through snow it's not just

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.840 
to really dig through snow it's not just
bait<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.709> ice<00:03:47.890> are<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:48.160> driving<00:03:48.489> on<00:03:48.580> you<00:03:48.730> have

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
bait the ice are you driving on you have

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.220 
bait the ice are you driving on you have
the<00:03:49.000> ability<00:03:49.360> loaded<00:03:49.630> with<00:03:49.780> all-wheel-drive

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
the ability loaded with all-wheel-drive

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.400 
the ability loaded with all-wheel-drive
to<00:03:51.160> dig<00:03:51.459> through<00:03:51.760> snow<00:03:52.030> we're<00:03:52.630> in<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.870> real

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
to dig through snow we're in a real

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.890 
to dig through snow we're in a real
wheel<00:03:53.650> drive<00:03:53.920> cars<00:03:54.250> get<00:03:54.910> stuck<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.600> you<00:03:55.660> end

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
wheel drive cars get stuck and you end

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.449 
wheel drive cars get stuck and you end
up<00:03:55.989> having<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.350> shovel<00:03:56.500> behind<00:03:57.100> them<00:03:57.310> and

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
up having to shovel behind them and

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.470 
up having to shovel behind them and
whatever<00:03:57.580> to<00:03:57.820> get<00:03:57.970> them<00:03:58.120> out

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
whatever to get them out

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.750 
whatever to get them out
so<00:03:58.810> all-wheel<00:03:59.230> drive<00:03:59.500> cars<00:03:59.799> they<00:04:00.370> give<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.730> a

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
so all-wheel drive cars they give you a

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.620 
so all-wheel drive cars they give you a
little<00:04:01.060> bit<00:04:01.390> more<00:04:02.130> leeway<00:04:03.130> if<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:04.209> have<00:04:04.390> like

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
little bit more leeway if you have like

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.120 
little bit more leeway if you have like
deep<00:04:04.930> snow<00:04:05.170> right<00:04:05.410> around<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.890> wheels

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
deep snow right around the wheels

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.509 
deep snow right around the wheels
because<00:04:06.580> especially<00:04:07.480> with<00:04:07.920> even<00:04:08.920> all<00:04:09.100> season

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
because especially with even all season

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.570 
because especially with even all season
performance<00:04:09.790> tires<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.890> know<00:04:11.920> this<00:04:12.310> there's

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
performance tires you know this there's

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.400 
performance tires you know this there's
no<00:04:12.700> perfect<00:04:13.000> solution<00:04:13.660> but<00:04:14.049> if<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.260> have<00:04:14.350> a

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
no perfect solution but if you have a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.470 
no perfect solution but if you have a
real<00:04:14.620> wheel<00:04:14.799> drive<00:04:15.010> car<00:04:15.310> like<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.910> Mustang<00:04:16.359> or

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
real wheel drive car like a Mustang or

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.850 
real wheel drive car like a Mustang or
something

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:17.860 
something

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.750 
something
I<00:04:17.920> would<00:04:18.250> say<00:04:19.500> winter<00:04:20.500> tires<00:04:20.769> like<00:04:21.220> bliss<00:04:21.519> axe

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
I would say winter tires like bliss axe

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.200 
I would say winter tires like bliss axe
or<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.150> good<00:04:22.480> idea<00:04:22.810> but<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:25.060> know<00:04:25.180> if

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
or a good idea but if you you know if

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.730

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
you know having a high-performance car I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.490 
you know having a high-performance car I
would<00:04:34.120> go<00:04:34.240> for<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.540> all-wheel<00:04:34.870> drive<00:04:35.140> 300
