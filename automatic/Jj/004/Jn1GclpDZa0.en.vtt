I've<00:00:01.079> got<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.490> brake<00:00:02.490> upgrade<00:00:02.970> that<00:00:03.270> I'm<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.570> the

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
I've got a brake upgrade that I'm in the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.379 
I've got a brake upgrade that I'm in the
process<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:05.029> assembling<00:00:06.029> in<00:00:06.720> fabricating<00:00:08.389> if

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
process of assembling in fabricating if

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:17.779 
process of assembling in fabricating if
you<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:11.059> one<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.150> those<00:00:13.190> or<00:00:14.190> non-turbo<00:00:16.789> now

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
you have one of those or non-turbo now

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.980 
you have one of those or non-turbo now
with<00:00:17.970> us<00:00:19.699> with<00:00:20.699> those<00:00:20.820> wheels<00:00:21.769> all<00:00:22.769> right<00:00:22.890> I

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
with us with those wheels all right I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.859 
with us with those wheels all right I
was<00:00:24.990> walking<00:00:25.320> through<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> junkyard<00:00:25.920> one<00:00:26.160> day

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
was walking through the junkyard one day

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.959 
was walking through the junkyard one day
and<00:00:27.869> saw<00:00:28.170> these<00:00:28.410> beautiful<00:00:30.470> CalPERS<00:00:32.600> on<00:00:34.969> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and saw these beautiful CalPERS on the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.139 
and saw these beautiful CalPERS on the
Mazda<00:00:37.879> rx-7<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:40.489> know<00:00:41.489> there's<00:00:41.700> two<00:00:41.820> different

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
Mazda rx-7 I know there's two different

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.779 
Mazda rx-7 I know there's two different
types<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:43.879> CalPERS<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.000> used<00:00:46.460> single<00:00:47.460> piston

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
types of CalPERS they used single piston

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.959 
types of CalPERS they used single piston
which<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:49.039> you<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.160> no<00:00:50.489> better<00:00:50.670> than<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
which is you know no better than what I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:51.549 
which is you know no better than what I
had

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
had

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.010 
had
there<00:00:53.059> then<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> four<00:00:54.629> piston<00:00:54.930> like

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
there then you have the four piston like

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.520 
there then you have the four piston like
this<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> adjustable

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
this and it's for the adjustable

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.840 
this and it's for the adjustable
suspension<00:01:01.340> now<00:01:03.949> what<00:01:04.949> you'll<00:01:05.129> need<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> do<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
suspension now what you'll need to do is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.870 
suspension now what you'll need to do is
you'll<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.960> fabricate<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.470> bracket

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.300 

you'll<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.150> time<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.360> pewter<00:01:12.659> bracket

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
you'll have to time your pewter bracket

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.300 
you'll have to time your pewter bracket
the<00:01:14.310> bolts<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.760> caliper<00:01:18.080> you'll<00:01:19.080> also

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
the bolts on your caliper you'll also

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.130 
the bolts on your caliper you'll also
have<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> find<00:01:20.939> an<00:01:22.040> 84<00:01:23.040> 85<00:01:25.189> non-turbo<00:01:26.189> 300zx

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
have to find an 84 85 non-turbo 300zx

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.410 
have to find an 84 85 non-turbo 300zx
and<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:30.090> has<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.479> non-turbo<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:32.420> those

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and it has to be non-turbo because those

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.289 
and it has to be non-turbo because those
came<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.869> 4<00:01:34.079> lugs<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:37.799> has<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:40.189> 10<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.520> 3/4

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
came of 4 lugs but it has a 10 and 3/4

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.440 
came of 4 lugs but it has a 10 and 3/4
inch<00:01:42.450> rotor<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.869> stock<00:01:45.869> rotor<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:49.250> nine<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
inch rotor and stock rotor is nine and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.310 
inch rotor and stock rotor is nine and
nine<00:01:51.450> point<00:01:51.869> eight<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.560> nine<00:01:53.130> foot<00:01:53.340> 9<00:01:53.520> inches

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
and you'll need the bigger rotors for

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.969 
and you'll need the bigger rotors for
the<00:01:58.560> upgrade<00:02:02.390> with<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.570> rotor<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.649> was

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the upgrade with that rotor so that was

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.230 
the upgrade with that rotor so that was
just<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.250> mock<00:02:05.430> ups<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.790> got<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> brand<00:02:06.210> new

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
you'll need the 11 inch rotors for the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.940 
you'll need the 11 inch rotors for the
upgrade<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:14.500> rotor<00:02:15.450> bolts<00:02:16.450> right<00:02:16.960> on<00:02:17.730> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
upgrade and that rotor bolts right on to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.090 
upgrade and that rotor bolts right on to
your<00:02:20.950> existing<00:02:21.610> hub<00:02:21.790> before<00:02:22.570> if<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.780> have<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.180 
rotor make a bracket do a little
shimming<00:02:39.340> here<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:39.670> there<00:02:39.820> little<00:02:40.180> grinding

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
shimming here and there little grinding

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.730 
shimming here and there little grinding
and<00:02:42.330> because<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.730> was<00:02:45.850> right<00:02:46.060> together<00:02:46.740> and

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
and because it was right together and

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.680 
and because it was right together and
the<00:02:47.830> bracket<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> pain<00:02:48.550> to<00:02:48.580> make<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:52.300> after

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the bracket is a pain to make but after

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.230 
the bracket is a pain to make but after
a<00:02:52.720> lot<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.080> trial<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.470> error<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:54.150> got<00:02:55.150> the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
a lot of trial and error I got the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.110 
a lot of trial and error I got the
measurements<00:02:55.510> perfect<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:00.970> works

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
measurements perfect and and it works

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.840 
measurements perfect and and it works
good<00:03:01.860> brake<00:03:02.860> pads<00:03:03.100> are<00:03:03.280> kinda<00:03:05.820> grabbing<00:03:06.820> a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
good brake pads are kinda grabbing a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.610 
good brake pads are kinda grabbing a
little<00:03:06.910> bit<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:11.790> I've<00:03:13.050> searched<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.200> internet

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620

see why not

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.420 
see why not
