00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.920
 I want to let you know and I 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:48.800
 I want to explain how to recover the 3g in 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:54.000
 the 3g or 4g and what you had before 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.640
 to shine your huawei ascend and 330 as 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.220

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.160
 fire 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.960
 because you lose the 3g or 4g what you 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.100
 had and is simply in 2g which 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.320
 we do not like it since it is very slow and 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.710
 good in all of that then in this 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.500
 I am going to teach you how to 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.230
 recover the 3g or 4g what you guys 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.560
 They had good we will need a 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.500
 application called root explorer which 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.660
 they are waiting for them, let them be leaving the 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.869
 download link in the description of 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.390
 I will also be leaving a video 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.350
 zip file which is why we are going to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.770
 recover our 3g or 4g good 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.540
 what we have to do is when 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.909

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.190
 explorer and have downloaded the file 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.030

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.070
 explorer 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.030
 Suffice it to say that to do this 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.820
 we need to be root users 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.869
 when we are in the root explorer 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.399

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.700

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.460
 downloaded the zip file i have it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.110

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.820
 have to do is have it pressed and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.250

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.740
 we want again at the root and 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.810
 we look for a folder called data 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.900
 then we enter that folder 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.740
 call data you can see that it already exists 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.870

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.900
 then it will not run longer exists nb 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.500

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.470
 of the folder you will give that if 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.090

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.320
 folder and have copied there 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.200

 after the video is cut and all that 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:38.710
 Then when you turn on your cell phone 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.040
