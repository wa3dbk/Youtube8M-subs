00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.559
 so warm 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.359
 on the pro ca game channel we play 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.710
 gta again today and part 5 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.710
 and I have something for me today 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.009
 special thought I stand here 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.750
 on top of a bridge mean mine 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:32.219
 small helicopter also the same 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.149
 taken away and I'll go one now 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.829
 bit snipers actually wanted 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.379
 I have to snip at moving cars 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:48.379
 always watching there is just what that was 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.379
 exactly 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:04.060
 The police are all coming to me 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.700
 who had a lot of money with it I think 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.700
 war already a problem 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.909
 I took something for that 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:33.000
 That should not be a problem 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:33.000
 bmw is he meets 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.140
 it goes on again we want now 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:57.640
 new track you gain there 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:02:00.700
 behind a graphic box or what 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.240
 is or fiction box should believe 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:11.190
 I'm going to be a car again 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.190
 a helicopter explains moment 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.910
 friendly one more 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:40.310
 very calm very nice and warm 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:42.410
 is someone running out exactly? 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.510
 if it's known here are parties rom 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.220
 just get the true anyway 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.220
 not true in this case too 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:00.920
 just do not shut up bridge 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.600
 Exactly one go say how many 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.140
 Helicopters have their liberty 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:11.980
 city that's madness exactly do you know 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.980
 Panzerfaust just comes again 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.830
 the swot are too slow too 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.480
 I just enter one more units 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:33.800
 a little bit lost, looking for the way 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:37.030
 I think they go on the panzerglas 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.030
 already a bit tactical 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.700
 yes they are a little better 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.240
 so i believe that order 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.510
 directly helicopters are after because 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.610
 He lives that no end 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:17.880
 at least it helps with distance 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:20.690
 but never for him as you can see 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.340
 still light hyde police schedule 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.760
 she is not quite what she is doing yet 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.760
 should 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.420
 I was the purely formal one 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.420
 few policemen 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.160
 but now he is running too fast 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.520
 can this otherwise do not run the 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.520
 madness 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.050
 OK 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.309
 other tactics 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:11.540
 I'm looking for the pilot to meet me 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.490
 nobody believes in the side and outside 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.080
 funding the front quite nicely 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.080
 heavy guns on the 8th 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.630
 atchoo 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:40.070
 my sniper rifle is just lea faith 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:46.750
 I five stars that was relative 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:46.750
 fast grenade hail 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:11.270
 yes , that's how the forces come 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.199
 I thought he wanted to kill me 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.680
 that's a pity 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.500
 b 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:42.139
 stay blockade war you 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.439
 he does not break 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.600
 well it was worth a try but me 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.940
 I do not think so 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.710
 badly beaten 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.870

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.430
