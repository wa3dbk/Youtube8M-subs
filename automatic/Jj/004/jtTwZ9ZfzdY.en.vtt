of<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.379> protein<00:00:07.799> review<00:00:08.040> for<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.220> today<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.700> was

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
of a protein review for you today I was

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.060 
of a protein review for you today I was
meant<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.450> do<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.750> one<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.110> while<00:00:10.290> ago<00:00:10.530> again<00:00:10.800> I

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
meant to do this one a while ago again I

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.370 
meant to do this one a while ago again I
got<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.849> November's<00:00:12.420> Jack<00:00:12.690> pack<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
got this in November's Jack pack is

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.810 
got this in November's Jack pack is
Dymatize<00:00:14.009> elite<00:00:14.389> fusion<00:00:15.389> 7<00:00:15.949> it's<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.160> basically

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
Dymatize elite fusion 7 it's a basically

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.330 
Dymatize elite fusion 7 it's a basically
it's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> protein<00:00:18.510> blend<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.590> gain<00:00:19.980> lots<00:00:20.250> of

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
it's a protein blend so you gain lots of

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.740 
it's a protein blend so you gain lots of
different<00:00:20.609> types<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.939> protein<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.600> rather

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
different types of protein and it rather

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290 
different types of protein and it rather
than<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:22.199> say<00:00:22.380> constant<00:00:23.279> trip<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.760> whey

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
than just say constant trip with whey

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.950 
than just say constant trip with whey
concentrate<00:00:24.539> our<00:00:25.050> way<00:00:25.260> isomer<00:00:26.689> but<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.840> air

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
concentrate our way isomer but the air

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
concentrate our way isomer but the air
this<00:00:28.109> was<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> end<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.980> trial<00:00:29.279> size<00:00:29.640> so

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
this was like the end the trial size so

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.680 
this was like the end the trial size so
you<00:00:30.179> got<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> fair<00:00:30.990> few<00:00:31.019> servings<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.690> in

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you got a fair few servings with it in

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.090 
you got a fair few servings with it in
this<00:00:33.809> account<00:00:34.079> remember<00:00:34.260> harmony<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
this account remember harmony but it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100 
this account remember harmony but it
turned<00:00:35.280> out<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:36.000> alright

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
turned out it was alright

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.180 
turned out it was alright
I<00:00:37.290> enjoyed<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.129> okay<00:00:39.890> I'll<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.070> one

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
I enjoyed it it was okay I'll get one

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.580 
I enjoyed it it was okay I'll get one
mixed<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.300> I'll<00:00:42.510> show<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.809> showing<00:00:43.469> what

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
mixed up and I'll show you showing what

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.950 
mixed up and I'll show you showing what
it's<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.879> basically<00:00:45.270> you're

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it's like on that but basically you're

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.690 
it's like on that but basically you're
looking<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.530> 180<00:00:47.100> calories<00:00:48.170> 6<00:00:49.170> grams<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> fat

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
looking at 180 calories 6 grams of fat

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700 
looking at 180 calories 6 grams of fat
11<00:00:50.700> grams<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.030> carbs<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.750> 23<00:00:52.379> grams<00:00:52.590> of

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
11 grams of carbs and 23 grams of

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.000 
11 grams of carbs and 23 grams of
protein<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.820> quite<00:00:53.940> high-calorie<00:00:55.010> it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
protein so it's quite high-calorie it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.069 
protein so it's quite high-calorie it
has<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.550> lots<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.539> different<00:00:57.809> types<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
has got lots of different types of

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.420 
has got lots of different types of
protein<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> said<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.309> got

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
protein in there like I said it's got

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.220 
protein in there like I said it's got
whey<00:00:59.609> protein<00:01:00.000> concentrate<00:01:00.030> where<00:01:00.870> protein

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

right so I was gonna lick the lid the
thing<00:01:35.830> with<00:01:35.950> this<00:01:36.040> product<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:36.549> it<00:01:36.670> don't<00:01:37.119> need

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
thing with this product is it don't need

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.749 
thing with this product is it don't need
that<00:01:37.390> much<00:01:37.540> liquid<00:01:38.290> to<00:01:38.590> mix<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.250> very<00:01:39.460> thin

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
that much liquid to mix it's a very thin

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.609 
that much liquid to mix it's a very thin
products<00:01:40.450> like<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.600> said<00:01:40.780> there's<00:01:41.020> only<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:41.200> 5

products like I said there's only a 5
ounce<00:01:41.860> of<00:01:42.330> or<00:01:43.330> percent<00:01:43.630> milk<00:01:43.840> in<00:01:43.990> there<00:01:44.200> and

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
ounce of or percent milk in there and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.039 
ounce of or percent milk in there and
you<00:01:45.009> can<00:01:45.159> saw<00:01:45.670> get<00:01:45.940> an<00:01:46.000> idea<00:01:46.330> for<00:01:46.570> how<00:01:46.630> thin<00:01:46.960> it

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
you can saw get an idea for how thin it

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.999 
you can saw get an idea for how thin it
is

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.410 

I'm<00:01:51.009> hoping<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.549> can<00:01:51.700> sort<00:01:51.940> of<00:01:51.970> make<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.210> out

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
I'm hoping you can sort of make this out

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.730 
I'm hoping you can sort of make this out
but<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.600> can<00:01:52.750> see<00:01:52.899> all<00:01:53.049> these<00:01:53.200> bits<00:01:53.470> at<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
but you can see all these bits at the

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.600 
but you can see all these bits at the
side<00:01:54.070> it's<00:01:55.170> not<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.320> best<00:01:56.560> do<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.250> see<00:01:57.460> what<00:01:57.580> I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
side it's not the best do you see what I

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.950 
side it's not the best do you see what I
mean<00:01:57.670> there's<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.970> there's<00:01:58.180> a<00:01:58.240> lot<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.720> stuff

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
mean there's a there's a lot of stuff

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.630 
mean there's a there's a lot of stuff
collected<00:01:59.380> in<00:01:59.470> there<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:03.310> have<00:02:03.399> got<00:02:03.610> a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
collected in there it's you have got a

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.889 
collected in there it's you have got a
lot<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.819> different<00:02:04.060> ingredients<00:02:04.149> in<00:02:04.600> there<00:02:04.750> so

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
lot of different ingredients in there so

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.370 
lot of different ingredients in there so
I<00:02:04.929> mean<00:02:05.140> I'm<00:02:05.470> pretty<00:02:05.649> certain<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:06.159> think<00:02:06.399> it's

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
I mean I'm pretty certain I think it's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.199 
I mean I'm pretty certain I think it's
our<00:02:08.380> fees<00:02:08.560> must<00:02:08.979> be<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.190> albumin<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.880> think

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
our fees must be that albumin I think

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.570 
our fees must be that albumin I think
that<00:02:10.390> causes<00:02:10.780> all<00:02:10.959> these<00:02:11.140> bits<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.650> build<00:02:12.459> up

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
that causes all these bits to build up

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.559 
that causes all these bits to build up
in<00:02:12.700> there<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:12.940> know<00:02:13.060> when<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.239> have<00:02:13.330> like<00:02:13.360> a

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
in there you know when you have like a

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.190 
in there you know when you have like a
blend<00:02:13.780> 14<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:14.530> don't<00:02:15.190> quote<00:02:15.370> me<00:02:15.519> on<00:02:15.550> that

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
blend 14 but don't quote me on that

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.400 
blend 14 but don't quote me on that
let's<00:02:17.200> get<00:02:17.319> it<00:02:17.470> down<00:02:17.620> ring<00:02:20.819> now<00:02:22.380> well<00:02:23.380> I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
let's get it down ring now well I

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.130 
let's get it down ring now well I
quickly<00:02:23.709> say<00:02:23.890> about<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.959> chocolate

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
quickly say about it is it's a chocolate

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.740 
quickly say about it is it's a chocolate
shake<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:28.030> not<00:02:28.209> one<00:02:28.299> of<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.450> best<00:02:28.600> tasting

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
shake it's not one of the best tasting

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.300 
shake it's not one of the best tasting
chocolate<00:02:29.140> shakes<00:02:29.530> I've<00:02:29.739> ever<00:02:29.860> had<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.220> be

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
chocolate shakes I've ever had to be

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.840 
chocolate shakes I've ever had to be
honest<00:02:30.519> but<00:02:31.090> it's<00:02:31.239> okay<00:02:31.630> tastes<00:02:32.260> Pleasant<00:02:32.850> for

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
honest but it's okay tastes Pleasant for

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.910 
honest but it's okay tastes Pleasant for
example<00:02:34.239> optimum<00:02:34.989> nutrition<00:02:35.079> chocolate<00:02:35.799> is

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
example optimum nutrition chocolate is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.009 
example optimum nutrition chocolate is
miles<00:02:36.519> nicer<00:02:36.850> than<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.239> actually<00:02:37.780> tastes

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
miles nicer than this actually tastes

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.620 
miles nicer than this actually tastes
like<00:02:38.170> chocolate<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.709> just<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.100> like<00:02:39.630> sweet

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
like chocolate this just is like sweet

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.130 
like chocolate this just is like sweet
laughing<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:41.700> but<00:02:42.700> let's<00:02:43.209> score<00:02:43.510> anyway<00:02:43.930> let's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
laughing so but let's score anyway let's

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.680 
laughing so but let's score anyway let's
crack<00:02:44.380> on<00:02:45.420> mixability

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
crack on mixability

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.140 
crack on mixability
okay<00:02:47.109> says<00:02:47.380> you've<00:02:48.220> got<00:02:48.400> all<00:02:48.519> these<00:02:48.670> bits<00:02:48.910> in

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
okay says you've got all these bits in

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.449 
okay says you've got all these bits in
there<00:02:49.329> this<00:02:49.690> it's<00:02:50.440> not<00:02:50.650> very<00:02:50.890> it's<00:02:51.100> not<00:02:51.280> very

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
there this it's not very it's not very

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.740 
there this it's not very it's not very
good<00:02:51.609> in<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.760> sense<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.359> fact<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.600> all

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
good in that sense the fact that all

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.690 
good in that sense the fact that all
these<00:02:52.870> bits<00:02:53.079> of<00:02:53.200> leftover<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:53.920> not<00:02:54.310> good

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
these bits of leftover is is not good

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.880 
these bits of leftover is is not good
so<00:02:55.209> for<00:02:55.450> me<00:02:55.570> I'm<00:02:55.810> gonna<00:02:56.019> give<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.410> 5<00:02:56.680> out<00:02:56.859> of

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
so for me I'm gonna give it a 5 out of

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.009 
so for me I'm gonna give it a 5 out of
10<00:02:57.130> for<00:02:57.609> mixability<00:02:59.519> texture<00:03:00.630> it's<00:03:01.630> actually

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
10 for mixability texture it's actually

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.900 
10 for mixability texture it's actually
smooth<00:03:02.950> considering<00:03:03.579> there's<00:03:03.730> all<00:03:03.820> these

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
smooth considering there's all these

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.490 
smooth considering there's all these
bits<00:03:04.180> in<00:03:04.359> it<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.660> don't<00:03:04.780> get<00:03:04.930> like<00:03:05.109> any<00:03:05.140> great

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
bits in it you don't get like any great

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.900 
bits in it you don't get like any great
minestrone<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:06.549> not<00:03:06.700> that

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
minestrone like that so it's not that

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.750 
minestrone like that so it's not that
bad<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.980> obviously<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.340> could<00:03:09.519> be<00:03:09.609> better

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
bad but it obviously it could be better

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.490 
bad but it obviously it could be better
so<00:03:10.150> he's<00:03:10.420> gonna<00:03:10.540> get<00:03:10.750> an<00:03:10.840> 8<00:03:10.959> hour<00:03:11.170> turn

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.070 

turns<00:03:15.370> fast<00:03:15.640> like<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> said<00:03:16.210> it's<00:03:16.840> meant<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.020> be

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
turns fast like I said it's meant to be

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.580 
turns fast like I said it's meant to be
chocolate<00:03:17.790> it's<00:03:18.790> not<00:03:18.970> chocolate<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.590> optimum

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
chocolate it's not chocolate is optimum

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.530 
chocolate it's not chocolate is optimum
nutrition<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:21.100> rich<00:03:21.280> chocolate<00:03:21.730> are<00:03:22.180> somewhat

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
nutrition is rich chocolate are somewhat

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.210 
nutrition is rich chocolate are somewhat
the<00:03:22.600> ones<00:03:22.720> I've<00:03:22.930> been<00:03:23.050> trying<00:03:23.320> lately<00:03:23.530> but

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
it's quite sweet Pleasant so I'm gonna

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.770 
it's quite sweet Pleasant so I'm gonna
give<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:26.860> a<00:03:26.950> seven<00:03:27.070> out<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.610> ten<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.450> smell

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
give it a seven out of ten and smell

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.470 
give it a seven out of ten and smell
wise<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:30.550> does<00:03:30.610> actually<00:03:31.150> smell<00:03:31.360> like

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
wise it does actually smell like

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.870 
wise it does actually smell like
chocolate<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.290> it's<00:03:32.560> not<00:03:32.770> that<00:03:32.950> bad<00:03:33.130> there<00:03:33.400> is

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
chocolate so it's not that bad there is

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.090 
chocolate so it's not that bad there is
pretty<00:03:34.150> good<00:03:34.450> smell<00:03:35.170> I'm<00:03:35.410> gonna<00:03:35.560> give<00:03:35.740> it<00:03:35.860> an<00:03:35.980> 8

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
pretty good smell I'm gonna give it an 8

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.610 
pretty good smell I'm gonna give it an 8
out<00:03:36.130> of<00:03:36.280> 10

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620

seven out of seven fish products it's a

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.920 
seven out of seven fish products it's a
it<00:03:46.300> could<00:03:46.480> have<00:03:46.600> done<00:03:46.690> better<00:03:46.900> but<00:03:48.660> all<00:03:49.660> this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
it could have done better but all this

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.570 
it could have done better but all this

that's that's the review of damnit eyes

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.780 
that's that's the review of damnit eyes
at<00:03:56.050> least<00:03:56.140> seven<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.650> mean<00:03:56.800> if<00:03:57.310> you're<00:03:57.520> looking

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
at least seven I mean if you're looking

at least seven I mean if you're looking
for<00:03:57.940> a<00:03:58.060> blend<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.140> protein<00:03:59.290> then<00:03:59.800> yeah

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
for a blend of protein then yeah

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.210 
for a blend of protein then yeah
definitely<00:04:00.550> give<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.850> try<00:04:01.090> but<00:04:02.220> personally

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
definitely give it a try but personally
