00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.869
 to understand the complexity of dental implant placement we can 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.849
 compare it with the creation of a building 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.419
 the structure that rises on the ground would be the equivalent to the 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.069
 tooth crown 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:30.509
 the part that we do not see because the foundations are buried in the ground 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.509
 it would be the equivalent to the dental implant 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 without these foundations the building could not stand 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.930
 properly laying foundations requires careful study of the ground 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.430
 which can be of different consistencies 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 sometimes rocky 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.670
 at other times 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.310
 also the bone where we will place the dental implant 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 It may have different intensities 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.600
 sometimes very dense which is not favorable since it has a smaller number 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.850
 of vital cells responsible for establishing solid bone bridges 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.750
 and sometimes of a very low density 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.170
 also with a small number of these necessary vital cells 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.230
 determining this bone cavity can usually be done with the help of a 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.590
 radiological study also taking into account factors such as age and sex 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.939
 Sometimes it is necessary to perform a scanner 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.710
 fortunately few 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.580
 since this one supposes a great physical aggression for the organism 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.249
 based on this data 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.320
 where experience is very important 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.830
 It is decided the placement of the appropriate implant both in design and in 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.830
 length and thickness 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.299
 what happens when we want to build a building at a certain point 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.749
 and there is a fault in the field 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:17.079
 we can create complicated incline foundation systems avoiding that 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.679
 zone 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:23.339
 but the most logical thing is to level the terrain to make a filling of a 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:28.469
 sufficient strength and then build the foundations of the future 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.469
 building 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.259
 in implantology we pose a similar problem in many cases 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.510
 if there is a lack of bone at the ideal point for the placement of a 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.259
 implant 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:02.249
 we can fill the bone graft compensating so it is lost 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.399
 in a short time the restorative elements of the organism 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:12.509
 They will be responsible for forming a bone with a density similar to or higher than bone 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:13.949
 surrounding 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.459
 this will allow 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.679
 place dental implants 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.589
 with great precision 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:22.969
 in the right place and with the regulation of life 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:26.789
 the key to your prolonged stay 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.889
 we have in mind that the placement of solid and effective foundations is 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.089
 fundamental for the support of the building 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:40.079
 if this fails everything comes down regardless of the beauty of the 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.139
 building built 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.149
 In our clinic we have specialized in the placement of bases 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.109
 solid ones that avoid future problems 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.699
 and practically in any case 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.559
 this task is not easy 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:58.669
 place dental implants with liability guarantee 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.269
 it has a prolonged formation 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.089
 and years of experience 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.089
 scientifically this is known as learning curve 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:13.099
 a relationship between cases and a success rate that is very long in 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.099
 the case of complex dental implants 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.180
 We rely so much on the durability of our treatments that we can 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.460
 offer you a special commitment with no time limit 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.020
 regardless of the difficulty of your situation
