my eye on this was what it has in it be

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.819 
my eye on this was what it has in it be
luck<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.890> got<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> original<00:01:26.780> 8086<00:01:27.829> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
luck it's got the original 8086 the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.060 
luck it's got the original 8086 the
grandfather<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.909> x86<00:01:30.810> processors<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
grandfather of all x86 processors the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.090 
grandfather of all x86 processors the
8086<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:35.939> why<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.290> picked<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> up

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
8086 and so that's why I I picked it up

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.069 
8086 and so that's why I I picked it up
it<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.430> only<00:01:38.610> 15<00:01:39.030> bucks<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.540> figured<00:01:39.869> what<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
it was only 15 bucks I figured what the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.039 
it was only 15 bucks I figured what the
hell<00:01:40.939> there's<00:01:41.939> no<00:01:42.180> hard<00:01:42.479> guy<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> hard

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
hell there's no hard guy that the hard

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.380 
hell there's no hard guy that the hard
drive<00:01:43.229> was<00:01:43.380> shot<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> boot

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390

and<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.410> boots<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:25.550> computer<00:02:25.849> boots<00:02:26.540> off

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
and so it boots this computer boots off

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.229 
and so it boots this computer boots off
this<00:02:26.870> computer<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:28.340> kind<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.580> cloudy<00:02:28.790> but<00:02:29.120> it

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
384 put in a second hard drive so that i

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.140

it's back in a no Liam condition and I

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.449 
it's back in a no Liam condition and I
got<00:03:26.239> this<00:03:26.390> computer<00:03:26.870> for<00:03:26.900> free<00:03:27.109> I<00:03:27.769> got<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.340> for

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
got this computer for free I got it for

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.310 
got this computer for free I got it for
my<00:03:28.519> job<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:29.030> worked<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.720> used<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.019> work<00:03:30.140> for

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
my job I worked I used to work for

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
my job I worked I used to work for
comcast<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.180> guess<00:03:32.420> all<00:03:33.079> their<00:03:33.680> hourly

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
comcast and I guess all their hourly

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.890 
comcast and I guess all their hourly
employees<00:03:35.230> got<00:03:36.230> one<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:36.739> these<00:03:36.829> machines<00:03:37.100> as<00:03:37.700> a

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
employees got one of these machines as a

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.370 
employees got one of these machines as a
Christmas<00:03:38.900> present<00:03:38.959> for<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.680> year<00:03:39.859> 2001<00:03:41.380> he

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
Christmas present for the year 2001 he

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.960 
Christmas present for the year 2001 he
knows<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.739> say<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:42.980> was<00:03:43.250> quite<00:03:43.519> surprised

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
knows to say I was quite surprised

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.099 
knows to say I was quite surprised
because<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:45.250> was<00:03:46.250> definitely<00:03:46.459> looking<00:03:46.730> to

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
because I was definitely looking to

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.379 
because I was definitely looking to
retire<00:03:48.109> this<00:03:48.350> one<00:03:48.590> here<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.269> the

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
retire this one here and so this is the

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.680 
retire this one here and so this is the
current<00:03:50.690> system<00:03:51.380> that<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:51.950> have

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
current system that I have

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.580 
current system that I have
it's<00:03:55.300> completely<00:03:56.300> completely<00:03:57.260> custom<00:03:57.740> built

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it's completely completely custom built

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.650 
it's completely completely custom built
the<00:04:00.590> case<00:04:00.890> and<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.610> is<00:04:01.820> actually<00:04:02.210> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
the case and it's this is actually the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.480 
the case and it's this is actually the
cheapest<00:04:03.110> computer<00:04:03.770> that<00:04:04.100> I<00:04:04.130> have<00:04:04.310> put

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
cheapest computer that I have put

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.560 
cheapest computer that I have put
together<00:04:04.640> I<00:04:05.150> have<00:04:06.020> built<00:04:06.320> it's<00:04:07.570> everything

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
together I have built it's everything

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.110 
together I have built it's everything
that<00:04:08.600> is<00:04:08.870> in<00:04:09.050> here<00:04:09.380> is<00:04:10.220> recycled<00:04:10.820> from<00:04:10.880> other

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
that is in here is recycled from other

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.760 
that is in here is recycled from other
computers<00:04:11.360> that<00:04:11.810> I<00:04:11.930> had<00:04:12.110> at<00:04:12.230> my<00:04:12.350> home<00:04:12.530> back<00:04:12.710> in

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
computers that I had at my home back in

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.460 
computers that I had at my home back in
Wisconsin<00:04:13.300> do<00:04:14.300> anything<00:04:14.720> in<00:04:14.930> here<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.170> is

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
Wisconsin do anything in here that is

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.220 
Wisconsin do anything in here that is
new<00:04:15.740> was<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.190> motherboard<00:04:16.670> cpu<00:04:17.269> ram<00:04:17.989> in<00:04:18.200> the

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
new was the motherboard cpu ram in the

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.570 
new was the motherboard cpu ram in the
heat<00:04:18.500> sink<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.989> this<00:04:21.200> system<00:04:21.650> here<00:04:21.860> ignore<00:04:22.460> the

heat sink so this system here ignore the
AMD<00:04:22.940> athlon<00:04:23.330> thing<00:04:23.600> now<00:04:23.780> was<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.350> system<00:04:25.040> that

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
AMD athlon thing now was the system that

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.330 
AMD athlon thing now was the system that

watt<00:04:33.950> power<00:04:34.190> supply<00:04:34.280> back<00:04:34.760> then<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.090> was<00:04:35.210> like

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
watt power supply back then I was like

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.640 
watt power supply back then I was like
the<00:04:35.450> biggest<00:04:35.660> power<00:04:35.990> supply<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.470> could<00:04:36.800> get<00:04:37.040> I

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
the biggest power supply you could get I

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.090 
the biggest power supply you could get I
