take your your green wire here and you
would<00:01:34.500> run<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.549> other<00:01:35.970> open<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
would run it to the other open in and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.340 
would run it to the other open in and
it'll<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.880> power<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.509> taillight

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it'll go out and power your taillight

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.870 
it'll go out and power your taillight
when<00:01:40.590> you're<00:01:40.710> being<00:01:40.950> towed<00:01:41.189> down<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> road<00:01:41.729> by

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
when you're being towed down the road by

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.719 
when you're being towed down the road by
ARB<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:43.890> there's<00:01:44.100> four<00:01:44.280> diodes

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
ARB as you can see there's four diodes

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.889 
ARB as you can see there's four diodes
and<00:01:44.939> there's<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> reason<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
and there's a reason for that

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.240 
and there's a reason for that
there's<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:47.939> left<00:01:48.210> turn

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
there's going to be one for left turn

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.590 
there's going to be one for left turn
there's<00:01:50.250> gonna<00:01:50.369> be<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> right<00:01:51.329> turn

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
there's gonna be one for the right turn

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.020 
there's gonna be one for the right turn
and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.950> both<00:01:53.189> turn<00:01:53.460> signals<00:01:53.790> they're<00:01:53.909> gonna

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and then both turn signals they're gonna

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
and then both turn signals they're gonna
have<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> accompany<00:01:54.450> running<00:01:55.110> lights

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
have to accompany running lights

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.740 
have to accompany running lights
so<00:01:55.979> you're<00:01:56.130> need<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.579> diode<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.329> each<00:01:57.450> one<00:01:57.659> of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
so you're need a diode for each one of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.709 
so you're need a diode for each one of
the<00:01:57.840> running<00:01:58.110> lights

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
the running lights

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.779 
the running lights
basically<00:02:00.530> left<00:02:00.799> side<00:02:01.009> running<00:02:01.340> right<00:02:01.549> side

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
basically left side running right side

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.639 
basically left side running right side
running<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.840> now<00:02:02.930> we've<00:02:03.049> opened<00:02:03.350> up<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.469> little

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
running and now we've opened up a little

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.319 
running and now we've opened up a little
small<00:02:03.920> bag<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.310> parts<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.850> basically<00:02:05.119> this

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
small bag of parts and basically this

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:06.910 
small bag of parts and basically this
consists<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.899> all<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.170> Spade<00:02:06.409> connectors

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
consists of all the Spade connectors

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.609 
consists of all the Spade connectors
needed<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.430> do<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.030> install<00:02:08.470> basically<00:02:09.470> what

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
needed to do the install basically what

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.110 
needed to do the install basically what
these<00:02:09.769> are<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.369> cut<00:02:10.610> your<00:02:10.729> wire<00:02:10.880> what

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
these are is that you cut your wire what

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.120 
these are is that you cut your wire what
you<00:02:11.239> need<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.900> splice<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.470> wire<00:02:12.620> back<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
you need you splice the wire back and

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.160 
you need you splice the wire back and
you<00:02:13.220> expose<00:02:13.580> about<00:02:13.790> about<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.420> quarter<00:02:14.900> inch<00:02:14.989> or

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
you expose about about a quarter inch or

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.050 
you expose about about a quarter inch or
so<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.830> get<00:02:16.010> actually<00:02:16.370> crimped<00:02:16.910> on

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so of it and you get actually crimped on

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.520 
so of it and you get actually crimped on
you<00:02:17.599> have<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.780> have<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.930> right<00:02:18.080> tool<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.380> do<00:02:18.500> that

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
you have to have a right tool to do that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.229 
you have to have a right tool to do that
with<00:02:18.890> because<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.250> mixes<00:02:19.580> all<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.940> difference

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
with because it mixes all the difference

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.460 
with because it mixes all the difference
in<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.360> world<00:02:20.569> where<00:02:21.050> it's<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.290> tight

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
in the world where it's a tight

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.140 
in the world where it's a tight
connection<00:02:21.769> or<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.099> loose<00:02:22.310> connection<00:02:22.640> and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
connection or a loose connection and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.030 
connection or a loose connection and
once<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:25.370> just<00:02:25.519> slides<00:02:25.819> on<00:02:26.000> to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
once you do that it just slides on to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
once you do that it just slides on to
the<00:02:28.040> diode<00:02:28.280> prong<00:02:28.790> itself<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:30.260> may<00:02:30.410> want<00:02:30.620> to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
the diode prong itself you may want to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.050 
the diode prong itself you may want to
also<00:02:30.800> invest<00:02:31.220> in<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.370> little<00:02:31.519> the<00:02:31.580> dielectric

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
also invest in a little the dielectric

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.490 
also invest in a little the dielectric
grease<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.720> will<00:02:32.810> help<00:02:32.900> protect<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.380> and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
grease that will help protect it and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.080 
grease that will help protect it and
keep<00:02:33.560> any<00:02:33.860> arcing<00:02:34.280> from<00:02:34.430> happening<00:02:34.819> inside

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
keep any arcing from happening inside

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.190 
keep any arcing from happening inside
the<00:02:35.269> connector<00:02:35.510> which<00:02:35.870> would<00:02:36.019> cause

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
the connector which would cause

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.830 
the connector which would cause
corrosion<00:02:37.160> which<00:02:37.549> would<00:02:37.700> cause<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.180> an<00:02:38.510> open
