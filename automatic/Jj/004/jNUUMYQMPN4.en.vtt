00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.660 
I'm building a login registration system
with<00:00:06.899> codeigniter<00:00:07.470> what<00:00:08.220> I'll<00:00:08.309> be<00:00:08.370> doing<00:00:08.490> in

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
with codeigniter what I'll be doing in

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.280 
with codeigniter what I'll be doing in
this<00:00:08.730> video<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.210> I'll<00:00:09.540> make<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.809> read<00:00:09.960> the

this video is I'll make the read the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.339 
this video is I'll make the read the
restricted<00:00:10.769> view<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.219> will<00:00:11.780> create<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.929> login

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
restricted view I will create a login

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.890 
restricted view I will create a login
form<00:00:13.799> or<00:00:14.009> log<00:00:14.370> out<00:00:14.580> button<00:00:14.969> essentially<00:00:15.750> on

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
form or log out button essentially on

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.130 
form or log out button essentially on
the<00:00:16.250> members<00:00:17.250> view<00:00:17.630> which<00:00:18.630> will<00:00:18.779> log<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.050> out

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
the members view which will log you out

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.550 
the members view which will log you out
store<00:00:19.439> your<00:00:19.529> session<00:00:19.859> data<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:21.230> that<00:00:22.230> way<00:00:22.380> we

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
store your session data and that way we

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.109 
store your session data and that way we
can<00:00:22.710> actually<00:00:22.980> check<00:00:23.400> whether<00:00:23.670> our<00:00:23.760> members

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
can actually check whether our members

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.640 
can actually check whether our members
page<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> secure<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:25.019> not

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
page is secure or not

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.920 
page is secure or not
so<00:00:26.039> because<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.150> can't<00:00:27.330> actually<00:00:27.510> right<00:00:27.810> now

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
so because we can't actually right now

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.130 
so because we can't actually right now
so<00:00:28.590> here's<00:00:29.160> our<00:00:29.250> members<00:00:29.609> view<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.990> thing

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
so here's our members view first thing

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.900 
so here's our members view first thing
I'll<00:00:31.470> actually<00:00:31.890> create<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> little<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:34.910> link

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
I'll actually create a little a link

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.560 
I'll actually create a little a link
it's<00:00:36.600> what<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:41.059> this<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.480> gonna

it's what I want and this is just gonna
link<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> method<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.059> our

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
link to a to a method on one of our

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.979 
link to a to a method on one of our
controllers<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.289> we'll<00:00:46.379> go<00:00:47.539> Jeff<00:00:50.719> we<00:00:51.719> actually

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
controllers so we'll go Jeff we actually

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.040 
controllers so we'll go Jeff we actually
need<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.260> echo<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.860> base<00:00:53.039> name<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.050> our

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
need to echo the base name first so our

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:06.649 
need to echo the base name first so our
base<00:00:55.379> URL<00:00:59.030> dot<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:04.159> then<00:01:05.210> we'll<00:01:06.210> say<00:01:06.360> main

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
base URL dot and then we'll say main

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.469 
base URL dot and then we'll say main
slash<00:01:07.140> log<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:09.080> logo<00:01:10.080> -<00:01:10.760> okay<00:01:11.760> perfect<00:01:12.330> and

slash log out logo - okay perfect and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.060 
slash log out logo - okay perfect and
then<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.070> we'll<00:01:14.460> say<00:01:15.080> oh<00:01:18.320> sweet<00:01:19.320> now

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
function so we can actually write that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
function so we can actually write that
now<00:01:34.310> we'll<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.490> made<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.030> PHP<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.549> at<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
now we'll go made up PHP and at the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:48.440 
now we'll go made up PHP and at the
bottom<00:01:38.970> we'll<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.210> public<00:01:41.600> function<00:01:44.060> out<00:01:47.450> no

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
bottom we'll go public function out no

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.639 
bottom we'll go public function out no
we're<00:01:48.600> gonna<00:01:48.689> do<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.939> we'll<00:01:50.939> go<00:01:51.060> this

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
we're gonna do here is we'll go this

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.280 
we're gonna do here is we'll go this
session<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:54.649> believe<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:56.250> called<00:01:57.000> some<00:01:57.930> check

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290

we've also been redirected we didn't get

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.660 
we've also been redirected we didn't get
any<00:02:39.140> errors<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:39.680> what<00:02:39.890> happens<00:02:40.310> if<00:02:40.550> I

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
any errors but what happens if I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.970 
any errors but what happens if I
actually<00:02:40.760> try<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.180> go<00:02:41.590> manually<00:02:42.590> go<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.800> the
