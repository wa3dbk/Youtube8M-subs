of features and enhancements over the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.730 
of features and enhancements over the
last<00:00:18.150> public<00:00:18.359> preview<00:00:18.810> build<00:00:19.020> which<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.529> ten

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
last public preview build which was ten

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.250 
last public preview build which was ten
thousand<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.310> forty<00:00:20.640> seven<00:00:20.880> also<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:22.050> of

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
thousand and forty seven also as of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.259 
thousand and forty seven also as of
recording<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.220> isn't<00:00:23.609> unleased<00:00:23.939> build

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
recording this this isn't unleased build

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
not sure if I really like these um I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
not sure if I really like these um I
prefer<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> other<00:01:11.700> ones<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.630> they

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
prefer the other ones I think but they

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.750 
prefer the other ones I think but they
go<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.409> been<00:01:13.619> changed<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.580> now

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
go they have been changed and that's now

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.950 
go they have been changed and that's now
what<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
what they look like that is a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.289 
what they look like that is a
system-wide<00:01:16.350> change<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.100> any<00:01:17.640> app<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.090> has

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
system-wide change so any app that has

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.090 
system-wide change so any app that has
pill<00:01:18.689> switches<00:01:19.080> will<00:01:19.259> now<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.650> those<00:01:19.799> new

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pill switches will now have those new

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.420 
pill switches will now have those new
ones<00:01:21.049> fear<00:01:22.049> from<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> Start<00:01:22.560> menu<00:01:22.830> notice<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
ones fear from the Start menu notice the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.520 
ones fear from the Start menu notice the
3d<00:01:23.909> flip<00:01:24.210> tile<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.840> found<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.170> built-in

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
3d flip tile which was found in built-in

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.710 
3d flip tile which was found in built-in
sound<00:01:25.680> ten<00:01:26.159> thousand<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.640> seventy<00:01:27.000> four<00:01:27.180> it's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
sound ten thousand and seventy four it's

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.490 
sound ten thousand and seventy four it's
now<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> lot<00:01:28.409> smoother<00:01:29.570> as<00:01:30.570> seen<00:01:30.900> there<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.350> it's

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
now a lot smoother as seen there so it's

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.310 
now a lot smoother as seen there so it's
not<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.710> sharp<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.579> lot<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:33.049> nice<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
not as sharp it's a lot more nice I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.609 
not as sharp it's a lot more nice I
guess

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
guess

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.469 
guess
and<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.369> definitely<00:01:35.549> prefer<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.090> new

and I definitely prefer the new

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.109 
and I definitely prefer the new
smoothness<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.259> them<00:01:37.579> now<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:38.970> the

keep<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.480> mind<00:02:33.980> now<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.070> we<00:02:35.160> come<00:02:35.310> down<00:02:35.460> to

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
keep that in mind now if we come down to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the network area is now dark which is

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.910 
the network area is now dark which is
just<00:02:41.970> more<00:02:42.570> areas<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.140> operating<00:02:43.650> system

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
just more areas of the operating system

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.560 
just more areas of the operating system
turning<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.060> dark<00:02:45.360> side

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
turning to this dark side

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.230 
turning to this dark side
topical<00:02:48.570> barely<00:02:49.170> got<00:02:49.620> 25<00:02:49.980> minutes<00:02:50.280> 35<00:02:50.970> minutes

left<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.600> day<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:51.840> may<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.410> force<00:02:52.680> be

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739

with<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.670> yeah<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.540> think<00:02:54.600> that's

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
with you and yeah so I think that's

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.080 
with you and yeah so I think that's
really<00:02:55.110> about<00:02:55.620> if<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.130> build<00:02:56.400> not<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> lot<00:02:57.030> of

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
really about if this build not a lot of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.970 
really about if this build not a lot of
changes<00:02:57.450> unfortunately<00:02:58.110> but<00:02:58.320> since<00:02:58.739> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
changes unfortunately but since the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.250 
changes unfortunately but since the
build<00:02:59.580> was<00:02:59.820> just<00:03:00.150> done<00:03:00.390> they<00:03:00.690> are<00:03:00.810> now<00:03:00.959> just

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
build was just done they are now just

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.060 
build was just done they are now just
like<00:03:01.440> relaxing<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.520> guess<00:03:03.320> not<00:03:04.320> more<00:03:04.620> features

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
like relaxing I guess not more features

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.590 
like relaxing I guess not more features
I<00:03:05.220> guess<00:03:05.430> we'll<00:03:05.580> be<00:03:05.670> at<00:03:05.820> well<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.300> coming

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
I guess we'll be at well we have coming

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.270 
I guess we'll be at well we have coming
to<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> end<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.410> winter<00:03:07.590> scent<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.010> omen

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
to the end of the winter scent of omen

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.070 
to the end of the winter scent of omen
cycles<00:03:08.640> so<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.820> can't<00:03:09.270> really<00:03:09.390> be<00:03:09.540> expecting

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
cycles so you can't really be expecting

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.080 
cycles so you can't really be expecting
a<00:03:10.170> lot<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.380> new<00:03:10.530> braking<00:03:11.040> changes<00:03:11.700> anymore

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090
