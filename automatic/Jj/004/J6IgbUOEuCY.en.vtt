00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.519
 and in all that where wall street 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.730
 the battery is an instrument that has 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.560
 multifaceted 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.869
 so it's a percussion instrument 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.180
 in the first place the flows at the start was 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.500
 really played like percussion and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.420
 the cymbals at the very beginning it was a 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.410
 very small room that served only 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.239
 cymbals of facts actually it's after 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.649
 the Charleston came the idea of 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.110
 the idea of putting a cymbal on the other 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.530
 and followed called these units 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.960
 from me by the way his delegate only one 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:56.149
 ball to make the figure of the chabada 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:59.010
 to play there to play the final and then 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.780
 the first fun drive the topics have 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.409
 started playing a little in this spirit 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.409
 the best suited 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:21.619
 same request by sanding what is 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.479
 could make that bass drum stopped 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.100
 to do the apartment black he and 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.420
 the amplification the drummers had 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.560
 no need to make black the big 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.380
 crate to support the serious 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.920
 so they started to say to each other too much 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:39.799
 saw pope and they started playing 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.780
 other figures than black the thing 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.899
 magical it's happened from the ternary 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.979
 in binary and in the rock started 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.720
 here we have to imagine that the battery 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.369
 it is an instrument with which one can 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.869
 make melodies with which one can 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.130
 make ambiences with which one can 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.179
 to do rhythmics we can do some 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.390
 ethnic stuff 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.630
 we can try to do things 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.700
 melodic 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.289
 so here I am going to try for the shot 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.990
 to make a little trip around 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.990
 all this without making the idiot and 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.430
 and chained after speed that we 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.120
 requires to be careful we were going 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.120
 does chaining 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.650
 so here we are moving really in 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.800
 the tempo london supposed to stay in your 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.800
 skin
