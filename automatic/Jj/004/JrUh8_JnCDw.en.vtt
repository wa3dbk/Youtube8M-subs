00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.070
 per cent and basically is the arrest of the leaders of this organization 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.340
 for 128 kilos of marijuana undoubtedly if they are fractionated and 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.470
 imply they can supply a lot of equipment cost 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.290

 when learning information but completely damaged from Paraguay 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.250
 Colombia with respect to detainees 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.870
 as you can see one thing with another are available to the UN as 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.960
 interveners who are two people who was originally from the city of Birmingham 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.159
 of the province with whom they are based in the city 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.890
 that they contained in the scope of a drug trafficking 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.700
 ferrol 3 percent bond we are investigating or are apparently the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.860
 xolos that just to doubts who came from abroad and has not been done 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 nothing for later distribution in the fifth we get 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.280
 there are two detainees 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.890
 the cyclone are the main investigated 8 euros there is a male suárez 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.430
 continues this month I also lost four years nor by 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.240
 my passion 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.820
 our idea is to play again 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940
 kidnapping weapons 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.090
 there was achieved the kidnapping of a fist gun there are many workshops is known goes 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.440
 to channel eleven 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.930
 who the truth is that in a first moment of the presence of what 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 tried to resist but p 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.150
 the price but immediately and guns were seized from various 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.420
 calibres repeat 11 25 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.819
 a 9 millimeter 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.410
 and it is that registered housing is achieved 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.570
 in kidnapping 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.570
 about two hundred doses of cocaine hydrochloride 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.939
 in the note indicated to the two detainees with police records the 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.759
 environment more we can talk about these subjects as they worked considered 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.040
 text that said Commissioner Danielle toole 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.500
 at the end of the note I think this wave of danger and paint it clearly 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.079
 of these types of subjects were the detainees because 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:35.419
 because when resisting talk about subjects that have this experience in this subject 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:40.529
 and for the police calderón in this operation two specialist subjects 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:44.420
 in the marketing of narcotics in Córdoba 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.079
 what the police have and how they handled themselves 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.349
 for the police coves was the one that brought 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.819
 the merchandise from the outside 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:53.690
 and knoll 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.100
 who received it and marketed yesterday the report of José Orlando 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.820
 you standing there highlighted the maximum purity of the material found and what 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.820
 they told me that this the marijuana brought tera de paraguay marijuana 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.050
 Paraguayan 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.519
 It is the most required 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.910
 the one of maximum purity I asked 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.960
 how much this operation can economically raise has now an example a 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.709
 kilo 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.449
 of this morning 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.849
 compacted those bricks that you see like that in pictures 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.029
 a warm 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.210
 everything is bad in the market 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.999
 2 thousand 500 pesos 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:33.379
 but this fractioned 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.909
 fractionated you can get to get double 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.069
 of money in each of the pepa kiosks I asked how they treat what they are 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.269
 the routes 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.370
 how to get this merchandise to córdoba and because córdoba what he told me 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.709
 you have to clearly differentiate between two routes 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.649
 the route of the hallucinogens what to say of the marijuana enter 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:58.069
 from Paraguay 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.439
 by formosa port charlotte and by córdoba this is route 9 north note is not 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.509
 south 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.199
 and cocaine 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.029
 that the other route of the drug enters 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.970
 from peru Bolivia and thus enters the country 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.599
 jump jujuy tucumán 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:20.649
 santiago and córdoba what is route 9 north these are the two routes of the drug and 

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.719
 I asked for 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.289
 but how do they do to get around all the controls on the good route 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.289
 the way to disguise the drug is 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.860
 in naphtha tanks disguised as a double 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.349
 naphtha tank and yes not the most common way of this room to get to Córdoba 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.080
 is by order 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.050
 an order was sent with a false sender another pair are to him what's going 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.560
 to search the bus terminal with a document that does not exist 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.370
 nobody complains too much efe 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.490
 in the terminal to try the good fashion that happen now will have to see 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.400
 what the operation that has 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.810
 I do not know elegantly 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.930
 the world a truck percent 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.470
 in how is the magnitude of the debt has started in the country 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.670
 maybe it's little 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.500
 started giving results the first I will 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.070
 well let's hope we can see what happens but 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.080
 I think it's important to point out that this has been a blow, it's really important 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.050
 for him the marketing of gold in choirs especially 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.270
 by the two subjects 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.770
 who were arrested mainly what you see take the police 1 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.750
 knoll 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.450
 that is having an increase in its economic assets so it says the 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.160
 police 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.330
 very high 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.539
 and who had ways to evade the controls 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:38.810
 who also speak 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.200
 of the experience that they have why 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.610
 who deserved good 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.039
 that change of chiriqui cell phones permanently 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.830
 to avoid the controls kuti lizaran nextel 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.710
 the place of the phone 2 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.000
 for this it is vital that they can not follow through the phone lines 

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.860
 all this talks about the objects that have fallen 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.970
 they believe this operation was done in the early morning
