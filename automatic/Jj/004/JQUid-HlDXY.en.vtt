00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.250

 to chara or hd who loaned me these two

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.180
 wait for them to lend these two legends 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
 and thanks to my brother who allowed me to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.690
 play on his xbox to be able to test 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.950
 these two legends and you propose them 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.480
 in video simply 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.059
 so here I hope it's okay 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.399
 please so it's greener and crespo 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.899
 so it's really two pet fifa is 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.760
 devotes so you saw the stats of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.920
 green key before it was eleven matches 13 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.359
 goals and that's eleven games 17 goals 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.320
 I always played them together 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.600
 as you saw there in the team 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.260
 that I suggested that you could see 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.850
 at the beginning of the video 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.590
 I always played them together 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.900
 that's why I took I decided 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.580
 to make two legends the places in one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.020
 video of just because if a 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.060
 Once Crespo made a pass to Green Key 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.140
 then qi berthe mark to illustrate 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.460
 the pass of chris paul etc 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.869
 you understand that it's not going to be 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.159
 obvious to put twice the same 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.900
 action in two videos that would not be 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.040
 very very pretty just so there 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.689
 you have statins games that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.689
 parade so to go first of all that of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.990
 chris paul hernan crespo and then you 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.369
 will have the one of life called patrick 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.770
 greener so really stats 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.220
 exceptional really two very good 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.080
 players 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.550
 so I really enjoyed playing with 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.830
 them even though I have not had a very good 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.090
 team a great team around 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.860
 these two men but frankly it's 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.330
 exceptional crespo his bad foot 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.680
 I have the impression that he has not 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.580
 so much he will do well both feet 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 it's a sick thing 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.000
 here we are eaten I have nothing to say I 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.680
 did not lose a lot of matches with 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.060
 with these two players I believe that on 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.050
 the stuff I did like an eleven or 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.250
 thirteen matches I know more I was 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.080
 locked up one or two 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.180
 frankly it's really legends 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.920
 and that's really how good they are 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.300
 name of its surroundings of course in the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 reality it's legends and on fifa 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.090
 and its exceptional they are fast 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.619
 both of them so they both have 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.540
 a good speed really fast 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.050
 so the points the points the points 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:15.750
 strong fast then the power the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.970
 power in both the head the game 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.050
 of head and that is speed endurance 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.850
 strength 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.260
 they both have the same points 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.520
 common and that is frankly what 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.350
 makes great effort to play together 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.360
 in a team in 4-4-2 for example 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.459
 as I love you I do them so if there is 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.020
 a weak point 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.290
 that would be the price for these two players 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.270
 because he's still going a million 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.950
 credits about each after I do not know 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.380
 I'm not on xbox 1 these moments 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.970
 I had watched moment I had watched 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.620
 their prices were worth about animating credit 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.410
 everyone so it's still not nothing 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.790
 so it's really not very accessible 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.080
 because not everyone has a 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.640
 million credits do not hide it 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.000
 not everyone is a millionaire on 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.040
 football 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.360
 he watched crespo the speed he smokes 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.519
 everyone he comes face to the goal and 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.720
 the bim on the ground the guardian can 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.400
 to do nothing is a sick thing 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.560
 crespo is it that winter guys 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.180
 frankly I loved it played the worst 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.140
 it is that he berthe there a power of 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.230
 typing it's just 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.760
 extraordinary 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.200
 an agility these two days there guys 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.909
 you do not imagine it's so easy 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.500
 to play that watch chris paul and 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.549
 because they deliver to greener 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.290
 it's magic 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.150
 well there he followed well that the universe that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.060
 shows well though that he has a good 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.830
 vision of the game and there even look crespo 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.269
 of the head is no problem well he puts 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.950
 a whim and do not hesitate it's 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.360
 really two good players who are who 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.250
 are physical who are world's head 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.599
 the aclu green is very well the action 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.510
 and you'll see that in the clips 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.620
 that I could realize 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.360
 they will always be passes between them 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.709
 and there it is magic to watch chris paul 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.239
 dozens perfectly after he has more 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.980
 that lober is beautiful that's all 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.480
 simply a pleasure to play and that there 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.709
 that liberty intercept him he marks 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.450
 immediately there is no question 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.799
 look there there is a free kick the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.180
 kicks I have not spoken so 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.560
 unfortunately you know that I am 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.720
 not a very good free kick shooter 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.549
 so I had only 1 with him green and 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.230
 you saw that it was framed when 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.220
 even it's not bad and they have very 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.390
 good stats of free kicks like you 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.609
 could see in-game stats 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.569
 it's greener and crespo learn that 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.799
 they take all the benches their heads 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.329
 look at the left foot created this price 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.730
 there he has the same power it is the same 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.349
 that city ​​reigns with his right foot while 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.560
 just there look look what 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.120
 the little maria crespo country noualhac sk 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.560
 chris paul foussat is a problem ago 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.389
 problems no respect there is no 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.829
 worries fed and occasions of those of 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.200
 scissors like that they fight them 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.370
 balls crespo he would respect a scream 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.349
 post crisis it's a sick thing 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.330
 frankly between the two frankly 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.220
 these crystals that I enjoyed more so 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.030
 we go differently in weak point I know 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.340
 not what I can have 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.810
 I do not know what I can see 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.990
 maybe their weak point if we 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.970
 Seeking to find the little beast 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.410
 that they looted there will have been able to put them 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.550
 both 5-star gestures 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.320
 techniques simply because it's 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.849
 legends 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.200
 it could have been even more 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.300
 interesting but already there frankly 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.160
 it's a carnage rent here it's a 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.169
 sick thing and the crespo against the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.750
 chest and volleying at the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.520
 questions months the crisis poses positively 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.600
 exceptional 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.190
 honestly the negative points about these 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.870
 players there I do not know apart from the price 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.980
 is still his legends 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.750
 it's still the price it's 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.950
 normal after you can find some 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.330
 legends a year I still had 10th 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.610
 will cost me excuse me after you can 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.740
 find legends a little cheaper 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.820
 Paully style or other players I 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.300
 do not know exactly all 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.830
 captions like I'm not on xbox 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.240
 so here is our self it's legends 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.800
 who really speaks a shot looks at her and 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.710
 chris paul kelly green who make themselves 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.690
 magic passes the finish cc magix 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.800
 it's just exceptional by the 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.840
 unfortunately hits she's not 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.200
 inside we 'll see that the corner that 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.420
 following is going to be very interesting so 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.500
 frankly wells he had five stars 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.020
 of technical gestures both of them 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.190
 would be neither the nugget would it be a one 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.840
 pump it would be killing everything 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.220
 simply is already there look at the force 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.930
 green key they spend all your silva 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.410
 but as he wants as he wants the 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.060
 strength 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.440
 it's at q and green it's a trick of 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.960
 sick it's a type 2 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.280
 chris paul did what he crosses his shot 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.360
 the guardian does not even have time to 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.830
 understand what was so good 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.630
 to arrive and that rulers everything 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.010
 simply and it's a pleasure to play 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.840
 these two players there I repeat myself the 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.210
 freedom like bing power shot 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.000
 no chance power speed
