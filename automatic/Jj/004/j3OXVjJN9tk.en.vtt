this wall this model is also available
with<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.699> hassle<00:00:18.060> light<00:00:18.180> crystal<00:00:18.630> on<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.050> top

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.340 
with a hassle light crystal on the top
which<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.510> plastic<00:00:21.510> crystal<00:00:22.199> that

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
which is like a plastic crystal that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.320 
which is like a plastic crystal that
scratches<00:00:22.920> rather<00:00:23.070> easily<00:00:23.689> but<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:26.330> popular

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
scratches rather easily but is popular

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.060 
scratches rather easily but is popular
because<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> type<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.529> crystal<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
because it's the type of crystal that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.330 
because it's the type of crystal that
was<00:00:29.340> used<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> original<00:00:30.090> moon<00:00:30.510> watch<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
was used in the original moon watch and

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
was used in the original moon watch and
it's<00:00:32.340> extremely<00:00:32.969> impact<00:00:33.390> resistance<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it's extremely impact resistance and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.620 
it's extremely impact resistance and
won't<00:00:34.320> shatter<00:00:34.649> whereas<00:00:35.640> Crysta<00:00:36.120> sapphire

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
won't shatter whereas Crysta sapphire

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
won't shatter whereas Crysta sapphire
will<00:00:36.840> shatter<00:00:37.140> if<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:38.010> hit<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.219> hard<00:00:38.370> enough

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
will shatter if you hit it hard enough

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.380 
will shatter if you hit it hard enough

version<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.930> probably<00:00:43.290> better<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:45.000> my

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
version is probably better but in my

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.880 
version is probably better but in my
opinion<00:00:45.270> at<00:00:45.570> least<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.930> everyday<00:00:46.289> use<00:00:46.649> and

opinion at least for everyday use and
stuff<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> prefer<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> sapphire

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
stuff like that I prefer the sapphire

stuff like that I prefer the sapphire

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
crystal as you can see it's sort of a

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.319 
crystal as you can see it's sort of a
curved<00:00:51.570> crystal<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:53.039> mimics<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> HESA

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260

crocodile but from my measurements it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.810 
crocodile but from my measurements it
actually<00:02:28.970> measures<00:02:29.180> more<00:02:30.050> like<00:02:30.260> 42<00:02:31.220> with<00:02:31.580> the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
actually measures more like 42 with the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.540 
actually measures more like 42 with the
crown<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:33.260> sticks<00:02:33.590> out<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.800> little<00:02:33.890> bit<00:02:34.220> more<00:02:34.459> on

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
crown it sticks out a little bit more on

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.030 
crown it sticks out a little bit more on
this<00:02:34.700> side<00:02:34.970> between<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.620> pusher<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.739> stuff

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
this side between the pusher and stuff

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.270 
this side between the pusher and stuff
so<00:02:37.670> in<00:02:38.300> actuality<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.500> think<00:02:39.800> it's<00:02:39.920> more<00:02:40.100> like<00:02:40.250> a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
so in actuality I think it's more like a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.930 
so in actuality I think it's more like a
forty<00:02:40.730> point<00:02:40.970> five<00:02:41.300> millimeter<00:02:42.050> watch<00:02:42.940> so

the 20 millimeter lugs also make it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.449 
the 20 millimeter lugs also make it
appear<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.079> little<00:03:12.200> bit<00:03:12.380> smaller<00:03:12.470> if<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.070> one<00:03:13.220> if

appear a little bit smaller if it one if

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.520 
appear a little bit smaller if it one if
they<00:03:13.610> went<00:03:13.790> with<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.000> wider<00:03:14.360> lug<00:03:14.810> stance<00:03:15.170> maybe

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
they went with a wider lug stance maybe

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.940 
they went with a wider lug stance maybe
went<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.010> twenty<00:03:16.489> one<00:03:16.940> or<00:03:16.970> even<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.450> 22<00:03:18.079> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
went to a twenty one or even a 22 it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.300 
went to a twenty one or even a 22 it
would<00:03:19.130> probably<00:03:19.640> provide<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.090> little<00:03:20.360> bit<00:03:20.570> more

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
would probably provide a little bit more

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.069 
would probably provide a little bit more
bulk<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.700> watch<00:03:24.880> but<00:03:25.880> overall<00:03:26.840> it's<00:03:27.049> a

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
bulk to the watch but overall it's a

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.120 
bulk to the watch but overall it's a
very<00:03:27.109> cool<00:03:27.500> watch<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.910> believe<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.989> it<00:03:30.590> does

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
very cool watch I believe that it does

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.949 
very cool watch I believe that it does
achieve<00:03:31.400> what<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.290> sets<00:03:33.290> out<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.500> do<00:03:33.769> which<00:03:34.700> is

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
achieve what it sets out to do which is

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.810 
achieve what it sets out to do which is
give<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:35.989> sort<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.890> classic<00:03:37.370> look<00:03:37.579> and

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
give it sort of that classic look and

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.600 
give it sort of that classic look and
with<00:03:38.120> an<00:03:38.209> updated<00:03:38.570> appeal<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.170> it

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.430 

I<00:03:43.460> think<00:03:44.460> for<00:03:44.850> most<00:03:45.180> people<00:03:45.360> may<00:03:45.930> prefer<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
I think for most people may prefer the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.330 
I think for most people may prefer the
the<00:03:47.250> other<00:03:47.400> special<00:03:47.790> editions<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.630> watch

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
the other special editions of the watch

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.180 
the other special editions of the watch
that<00:03:50.340> have<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.580> little<00:03:51.000> bit<00:03:51.180> more<00:03:51.990> of<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.320> modern

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
that have a little bit more of a modern

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.190 
that have a little bit more of a modern
look<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.460> them<00:03:53.760> especially<00:03:54.390> with<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> silver

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
look to them especially with the silver

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.440 
look to them especially with the silver
bezel<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.740> personally<00:03:56.610> do<00:03:56.760> prefer<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.060> silver

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450
