00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
types of metals this one is a zinc and I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.819 
types of metals this one is a zinc and I
chose<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> color<00:00:40.050> but

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.860 
on the rougher side because you don't
want<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.150> slide<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.600> be<00:02:18.690> against<00:02:19.050> your<00:02:19.230> skin

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
want that slide to be against your skin

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.780 
want that slide to be against your skin
so<00:02:22.310> now<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.940> first<00:02:24.150> thing<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.600> do<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.790> to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so now the first thing to do is to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.870 
so now the first thing to do is to
string<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> wire<00:02:28.400> through<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.430> middle<00:02:29.730> of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
string the wire through the middle of

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.630 
string the wire through the middle of
the<00:02:29.940> washer<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:31.830> kind<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.100> hold<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.430> there

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
the washer just kind of hold it there

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.280 
the washer just kind of hold it there
and<00:02:32.850> start<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.660> wrap<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.050> around<00:02:34.140> your<00:02:34.830> washer

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
and start to wrap it around your washer

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.490 
and start to wrap it around your washer
now<00:02:37.290> here<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.010> want<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.140> string<00:02:40.140> your<00:02:40.260> beads

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
now here you want to string your beads

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.460 
now here you want to string your beads
onto<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.070> wire<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.730> discovered<00:02:42.720> about<00:02:42.840> four

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
onto the wire I discovered about four

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.520 
onto the wire I discovered about four
beads<00:02:43.890> will<00:02:44.520> cover<00:02:44.820> one<00:02:45.240> side<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.050> washer

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
beads will cover one side of this washer

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.310 
beads will cover one side of this washer
with<00:02:46.710> it<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.220> size<00:02:47.540> but<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.660> can<00:02:48.810> experiment

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
with it this size but you can experiment

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:59.720 
with it this size but you can experiment
with<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.710> until<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.670> looks<00:02:50.820> good<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.330> you<00:02:58.730> now

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
with it until it looks good to you now

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.360 
with it until it looks good to you now
as<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.120> wrap<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:00.450> around<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:01.440> want<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.830> make

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
as you wrap this around you want to make

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.120 
as you wrap this around you want to make
sure<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.120> very<00:03:03.570> tight<00:03:04.020> so<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
sure that it's very tight so that the

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.480 
sure that it's very tight so that the
beefs<00:03:05.340> don't<00:03:05.640> start<00:03:05.910> wiggling<00:03:06.060> around<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.870> you

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
beefs don't start wiggling around on you

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.730 
beefs don't start wiggling around on you
and<00:03:08.490> I'll<00:03:08.670> do<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.360> one<00:03:09.630> more<00:03:09.780> time<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.650> you

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
and I'll do it this one more time so you

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:21.300 
and I'll do it this one more time so you
can<00:03:10.770> kind<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.190> see<00:03:11.460> it

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.900 

change<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.360> biebs<00:03:22.860> wrap<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:24.010> around<00:03:24.099> tightly

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
change the biebs wrap it around tightly

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.040 
change the biebs wrap it around tightly
and<00:03:25.440> pull<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:27.160> here<00:03:27.760> we<00:03:27.790> finished<00:03:28.480> wrapping

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
and pull so here we finished wrapping

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.800 
and pull so here we finished wrapping
the<00:03:29.650> beads<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.520> wire<00:03:30.730> around<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.270> washer

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the beads and the wire around the washer

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.890 
the beads and the wire around the washer
and<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.650> strung<00:03:32.920> for<00:03:33.400> Laughs<00:03:33.700> speeds<00:03:34.060> on<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
and I strung for Laughs speeds on to the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.140 
and I strung for Laughs speeds on to the
first<00:03:35.170> wire<00:03:35.680> we<00:03:35.950> started<00:03:36.400> out<00:03:36.550> with<00:03:36.760> first

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
first wire we started out with first

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.850 
first wire we started out with first
part<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.599> it<00:03:37.750> which<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.410> didn't<00:03:38.650> do<00:03:38.709> in<00:03:38.800> the

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
part of it which I didn't do in the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.470 
part of it which I didn't do in the
first<00:03:39.010> place<00:03:39.130> because<00:03:39.489> they<00:03:40.060> would<00:03:40.180> be<00:03:40.269> coming

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
first place because they would be coming

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.080 
first place because they would be coming
off<00:03:40.690> while<00:03:40.930> you're<00:03:41.080> working<00:03:41.470> with<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.970> now

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
off while you're working with it so now

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.089 
off while you're working with it so now
you<00:03:43.150> get<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.540> two<00:03:43.750> ends<00:03:44.319> of<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.680> wire<00:03:44.860> that

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
you get the two ends of the wire that

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.550 
you get the two ends of the wire that
you<00:03:45.250> end<00:03:45.459> up<00:03:45.640> with<00:03:46.739> no<00:03:47.739> pun<00:03:47.950> intended<00:03:48.099> and<00:03:49.560> you

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
you end up with no pun intended and you

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.370 
you end up with no pun intended and you
want<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.860> wrap<00:03:51.069> them<00:03:51.280> together<00:03:52.380> really

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
want to wrap them together really

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.600 
want to wrap them together really
tightly<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.880> can<00:03:55.060> actually<00:03:55.450> use<00:03:55.690> your<00:03:56.610> pliers

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
tightly you can actually use your pliers

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.000 
tightly you can actually use your pliers
to<00:03:57.880> help<00:03:58.510> with<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:59.530> pinch<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.950> and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
to help with this just pinch it and

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.440 
to help with this just pinch it and
start<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.459> twist<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.850> then<00:04:04.030> we'll<00:04:04.120> move<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.330> up

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
start to twist and then we'll move it up

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.680 
start to twist and then we'll move it up
and<00:04:04.600> start<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.930> twist<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:07.120> don't<00:04:07.360> want<00:04:07.569> to

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
and start to twist and you don't want to

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.070 
and start to twist and you don't want to
try<00:04:08.580> wrapping<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:10.180> wrapping<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.660> very<00:04:10.959> much

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
try wrapping and wrapping this very much

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.600 
try wrapping and wrapping this very much
because<00:04:11.290> I've<00:04:11.470> discovered<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:12.040> will<00:04:12.310> make<00:04:12.489> the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
because I've discovered it will make the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.990 
because I've discovered it will make the
wire<00:04:12.819> quite<00:04:13.780> brittle<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:15.130> will<00:04:15.280> break<00:04:15.700> and

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
wire quite brittle and it will break and

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.270 
wire quite brittle and it will break and
then<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.239> have<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.450> start<00:04:16.810> over<00:04:16.930> again<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:21.130> you

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
then you have to start over again so you

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.040 
then you have to start over again so you
finish<00:04:21.549> wrapping<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.880> should<00:04:25.210> be<00:04:25.510> quite

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
finish wrapping that should be quite

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.730 
finish wrapping that should be quite
long<00:04:26.380> enough<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:27.180> then<00:04:29.580> cut<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.820> ends<00:04:31.090> so

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
long enough and then cut the ends so

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.350 
long enough and then cut the ends so
here<00:04:32.740> we<00:04:32.860> have<00:04:32.890> our<00:04:33.039> wire<00:04:33.430> which<00:04:34.000> has<00:04:34.180> been

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
here we have our wire which has been

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.500 
here we have our wire which has been
made<00:04:34.510> into<00:04:34.690> a<00:04:34.840> nice<00:04:35.020> little<00:04:35.260> twist<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.510> we're

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
made into a nice little twist and we're

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.700 
made into a nice little twist and we're
actually<00:04:37.570> going<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.020> use<00:04:38.050> our<00:04:38.289> round<00:04:38.530> nose

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
actually going to use our round nose

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.310 
actually going to use our round nose
pliers<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.370> make<00:04:39.789> this<00:04:39.940> into<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.330> loop<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:41.110> hang

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
pliers to make this into a loop to hang

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.520 
pliers to make this into a loop to hang
the<00:04:41.590> pendants<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:43.390> just<00:04:43.840> pinch<00:04:44.289> it<00:04:46.260> bout<00:04:47.260> that

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
the pendants so just pinch it bout that

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.580 
the pendants so just pinch it bout that
far<00:04:47.770> from<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.100> top<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.910> then<00:04:49.570> start<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.289> twist

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
far from the top and then start to twist

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.779 
far from the top and then start to twist
it<00:04:50.889> around<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:52.060> base<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.750> wire<00:04:56.669> twisted<00:04:57.669> a

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
it around the base of the wire twisted a

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.620 
it around the base of the wire twisted a
couple<00:04:58.300> times

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.770 

and<00:05:01.750> then<00:05:02.710> we're<00:05:02.890> going<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.160> cut<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.640> with<00:05:04.420> our

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
and then we're going to cut it with our

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:15.630 
and then we're going to cut it with our
wire<00:05:05.050> cutters<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:12.960> then<00:05:13.960> just<00:05:14.530> work<00:05:15.190> with<00:05:15.430> it

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
wire cutters and then just work with it

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:25.220 
wire cutters and then just work with it
until<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.570> wire<00:05:16.780> isn't<00:05:17.310> spoking<00:05:18.310> anything

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.760 

now<00:05:26.230> we're<00:05:26.470> going<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.710> get<00:05:26.860> our<00:05:26.980> cord<00:05:27.400> and

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
now we're going to get our cord and

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.650 
now we're going to get our cord and
string<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:29.890> through<00:05:29.920> the<00:05:30.340> loop<00:05:30.520> we<00:05:30.790> made<00:05:33.660> now

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
string it through the loop we made now

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.620 
string it through the loop we made now
instead<00:05:35.020> of<00:05:35.200> working<00:05:36.100> with<00:05:36.610> class<00:05:37.120> or

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
instead of working with class or

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.720 
instead of working with class or
anything<00:05:37.990> like<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.170> we're<00:05:39.100> simply<00:05:39.370> going<00:05:39.550> to

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
anything like that we're simply going to

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.670 
anything like that we're simply going to
do<00:05:39.940> is<00:05:40.210> on<00:05:41.170> each<00:05:41.470> side<00:05:42.720> we're<00:05:43.720> going<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.140> make<00:05:44.410> a

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
do is on each side we're going to make a

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.250 
do is on each side we're going to make a
knot<00:05:45.010> and<00:05:45.960> this<00:05:46.960> will<00:05:47.170> make<00:05:47.350> the<00:05:48.280> cord

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
knot and this will make the cord

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.940 
knot and this will make the cord
actually<00:05:50.260> adjustable<00:05:50.890> in<00:05:51.070> length<00:05:52.710> just<00:05:53.710> pull

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
actually adjustable in length just pull

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.160 
actually adjustable in length just pull
that<00:05:53.980> really<00:05:54.430> tight<00:05:54.700> it<00:05:55.420> could<00:05:55.630> even<00:05:55.750> use<00:05:55.900> your

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
that really tight it could even use your

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:05.130 
that really tight it could even use your
leave<00:05:59.170> to<00:05:59.710> tighten<00:06:00.550> it<00:06:03.330> make<00:06:04.330> another<00:06:04.600> knot<00:06:04.870> on

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
leave to tighten it make another knot on

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:13.010 
leave to tighten it make another knot on
the<00:06:05.170> other<00:06:05.410> side

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.730 

just<00:06:13.680> dip<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.789> little<00:06:14.819> bit<00:06:15.509> difficult<00:06:16.259> to<00:06:16.530> work

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
just dip a little bit difficult to work

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:26.350 
just dip a little bit difficult to work
with<00:06:21.199> pull<00:06:22.199> it<00:06:22.319> tight<00:06:22.680> and<00:06:23.900> there<00:06:24.900> you<00:06:24.990> go

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
with pull it tight and there you go

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.360 
with pull it tight and there you go
finished
