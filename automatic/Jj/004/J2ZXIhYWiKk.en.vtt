00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
 hello a spiritual question 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.019
 So here it is in relation to prayer 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.769
 there are times when the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.590
 yelled is very easy to do in the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.060
 getting up for art toppings 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 it's true that at times I have a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.949
 kind of heaviness that comes in 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.840
 less and and it's very very difficult 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.539
 good I do it anyway but jo are 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.010
 still this heaviness in less and 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.009
 precisely I wanted to have a council of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.890
 your part for precisely that it is a 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.710
 little higher to see here you are 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.140
 know that there are two there are two 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.340
 possible motives to seek expensive 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.440
 brother the first motivation or the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 first source of motivation 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.050
 it is that of the comparison between a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.489
 employer and our creators this does not want 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 not say once again that one establishes 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.879
 any equality between the two 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.860
 big bowl abd rabo must make graves 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.410
 of children from Morocco 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.880
 the servant of the servants the creator 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.470
 and creators and a big difference 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.380
 exists between the creator and his creature 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.490
 that said when I tell you that it takes 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.740
 from there it's basically telling you the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:29.380
 following thing if you are employed by 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.020
 an employer with whom you signed 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.450
 an employment contract that requires you 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.520
 be at yours 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.070
 working at your post at 4 am 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.570
 morning is what are you up to and what are you 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.770
 that you have the heaviness to you there 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.090
 render and what you do not take 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.369
 all the necessary provisions to 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:51.369
 to be there or not and soon then you have to 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.259
 reason this way because it is 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:59.340
 the human soul as it says itself 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:02.979
 it butchery as a child if you 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.380
 do not know if the child suffers 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.200
 not a weaning and well he would stay at 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.810
 all his life and well 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.590
 the soul if you do not make him do 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.260
 drill 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.299
 well, she will always be wanted 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.239
 which is easy and never to want 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.519
 which is difficult gold because and 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.870
 this is the second point because the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:29.200
 paradise is what each of us 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.360
 inspires because worship in the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.470
 rented surface talent and what to each 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.860
 inspires us 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.319
 well it is asked each of us 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.239
 to provide an effort you provide a 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.920
 effort to go to work because 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.060
 you want to have good pay is not 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.190
 this is not the good pay that god 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.720
 is a reserved can not be won 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.400
 easily and that's the reason for 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.910
 which to 10 teachers to that one 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.760
 melodic 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.230
 when god created paradise he 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.090
 asked to be gibril to go there 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.250
 look at the maroon black ink or the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.410
 diabetes ada to djibril like that in the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.239
 authentic adisq when god created the 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.329
 paradise asked him to djibril 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.480
 he told him djibril to the roof djibril and 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.389
 zanetti is going to heaven or flying aya 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.630
 look at the wii the gamepad or daughter ali 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:18.220
 ali and also look at what I put 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.889
 for its inhabitants 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.180
 gibril leaves and once before the 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:28.450
 paradise he returns he says erap lord 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.340
 i have seen so many bowes paradise 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.489
 that no one will hear about it without 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.919
 want to enter it and then he god 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:41.049
 asks heaven and her husband jay z 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:44.200
 he asked paradise to surround himself with 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.739
 all the difficulties and he was 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.810
 so 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.510
 then he asked for brill to leave for 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.400
 the encounter 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.659
 2 to discover paradise once 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.519
 that djibril approaches 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.829
 well they discover that all 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.629
 difficulties of the world are around the 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.150
 paradise he comes back and god tells him 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.069
 how did you find him he said I 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.010
 Lest nobody because in between 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.379
 dear brother effect and well all that is 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.879
 good all that is noble is earned 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.730
 not easily and it's for this 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.030
 reason that we say just in a hurry in 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.340
 rallying the divine merchandise is very 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.760
 dear dear brother and the playing the game in 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.760
 worth the candle
