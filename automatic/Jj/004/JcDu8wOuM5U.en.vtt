00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.580 
you will notice a slight drop in battery
performance<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:54.750> this<00:05:54.840> I'm<00:05:55.020> sure<00:05:55.169> has<00:05:55.380> to<00:05:55.500> do

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
performance and this I'm sure has to do

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.469 
performance and this I'm sure has to do
with<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.830> pixel<00:05:56.159> hungry<00:05:56.490> quad<00:05:56.699> HD<00:05:56.940> display

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
with the pixel hungry quad HD display

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.499 
with the pixel hungry quad HD display
and<00:05:57.509> higher<00:05:57.960> specs<00:05:58.380> on<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.770> note<00:05:58.949> 4<00:05:58.979> but

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
and higher specs on the note 4 but

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.370 
and higher specs on the note 4 but
Samsung<00:06:00.509> could<00:06:00.719> have<00:06:00.810> brought<00:06:00.960> a<00:06:01.110> bigger

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
Samsung could have brought a bigger

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.320 
Samsung could have brought a bigger
battery<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:02.099> seriously<00:06:02.490> I<00:06:02.610> mean<00:06:02.909> brought<00:06:03.180> a

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
battery and seriously I mean brought a

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.149 
battery and seriously I mean brought a
bigger<00:06:03.630> battery<00:06:03.990> like<00:06:04.320> Karl<00:06:04.590> Malone<00:06:04.889> used<00:06:05.070> to

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
bigger battery like Karl Malone used to

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.680 
bigger battery like Karl Malone used to
bring<00:06:05.310> it<00:06:05.430> to<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.610> whole<00:06:05.789> but<00:06:06.300> even<00:06:06.539> though

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
bring it to the whole but even though

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.689 
bring it to the whole but even though
this<00:06:06.900> has<00:06:07.199> managed<00:06:07.650> to<00:06:07.740> find<00:06:07.979> its<00:06:08.159> way<00:06:08.310> on<00:06:08.520> my

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
this has managed to find its way on my

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.610 
this has managed to find its way on my
negative<00:06:09.090> portion<00:06:09.509> the<00:06:09.840> average<00:06:10.259> smartphone

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
negative portion the average smartphone

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.290 
negative portion the average smartphone
user<00:06:10.949> which<00:06:11.159> I'm<00:06:11.310> guessing<00:06:11.490> is<00:06:11.729> at<00:06:11.820> least<00:06:11.969> half

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
user which I'm guessing is at least half

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.850 
user which I'm guessing is at least half
of<00:06:12.479> you<00:06:12.599> guys<00:06:12.750> will<00:06:13.289> not<00:06:13.469> be<00:06:13.680> disappointed

with battery performance this again is
just<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:17.159> mere<00:06:17.400> personal<00:06:17.909> opinion<00:06:18.330> that<00:06:18.750> I<00:06:18.780> have
