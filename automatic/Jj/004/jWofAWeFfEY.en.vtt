00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the right read yes right now Jupiter a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.020 
the right read yes right now Jupiter a
space<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.710> looking<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.220> any<00:01:32.549> rounds

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
space of looking really is any rounds

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.840 
space of looking really is any rounds
yeah<00:01:33.240> he's<00:01:33.570> gonna<00:01:33.659> try<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.900> defend<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.439> space

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
yeah he's gonna try to defend that space

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.929 
yeah he's gonna try to defend that space
you<00:01:35.850> know<00:01:35.909> put<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> closed<00:01:36.509> orb<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.939> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you know put a closed orb in there you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.370 
you know put a closed orb in there you
know<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.270> notice<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:39.840> he's<00:01:39.930> doing<00:01:40.229> he's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
gonna try to keep low bow outcome kind

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.359 
gonna try to keep low bow outcome kind

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
half screen space yes he does not wobble

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.780 
half screen space yes he does not wobble

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
average of teleport and now we get a set

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.450 
average of teleport and now we get a set
up<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.719> I'm<00:01:57.869> gonna<00:01:58.020> try<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.170> beat<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.409> yes<00:01:59.130> does

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
up if I'm gonna try to beat it yes does

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.539 
up if I'm gonna try to beat it yes does
he<00:01:59.880> does<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.990> does<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.439> have<00:02:02.009> armor

get<00:02:31.550> any<00:02:31.700> forward<00:02:32.090> down<00:02:32.209> this<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.510> smart<00:02:32.870> this

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
get any forward down this is smart this

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.080 
get any forward down this is smart this
is<00:02:33.170> smart<00:02:33.470> right<00:02:33.650> now<00:02:33.709> he's<00:02:34.370> sending<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.790> change

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
is smart right now he's sending a change

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.060 
is smart right now he's sending a change
realizing<00:02:35.450> Jupiter<00:02:35.780> started<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.410> side<00:02:36.800> one

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
realizing Jupiter started on side one

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.940 
realizing Jupiter started on side one
and<00:02:37.640> he<00:02:37.730> was<00:02:37.850> going<00:02:38.150> toward<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.750> turbine<00:02:39.680> and

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
and he was going toward the turbine and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
and he was going toward the turbine and
predicting<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.640> know<00:02:40.760> zoning<00:02:41.270> putting<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
predicting you know zoning putting the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.330 
predicting you know zoning putting the
putting<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.410> orbs<00:02:42.800> out<00:02:42.950> there<00:02:43.160> and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
putting the orbs out there and

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.650 
putting the orbs out there and
protecting<00:02:43.820> his<00:02:43.940> position<00:02:44.390> with<00:02:44.630> the

protecting his position with the
interactable<00:02:45.200> making<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.890> very<00:02:46.010> difficult

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
interactable making it very difficult

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.100 
interactable making it very difficult
stand<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:46.970> like<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.120> minefield<00:02:47.330> exactly

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
stand up it's like a minefield exactly

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.500 
stand up it's like a minefield exactly
so<00:02:48.320> very<00:02:48.890> smart<00:02:49.130> by<00:02:49.310> oxygen<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.820> say<00:02:50.300> you<00:02:50.360> know

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
so very smart by oxygen to say you know

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.760 
so very smart by oxygen to say you know
what<00:02:50.630> let's<00:02:50.780> get<00:02:50.900> off<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.110> thing<00:02:51.170> she's<00:02:51.590> got

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
what let's get off this thing she's got

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.420 
what let's get off this thing she's got
to<00:02:51.860> get<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.040> there<00:02:52.160> early

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
to get in there early

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.010 
to get in there early
yeah<00:02:52.670> you<00:02:52.910> can't<00:02:53.120> let<00:02:53.270> him<00:02:53.330> get<00:02:53.510> anything<00:02:53.750> set

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
yeah you can't let him get anything set

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.130 
yeah you can't let him get anything set
up<00:02:54.310> Jupiter<00:02:55.310> very<00:02:56.060> defensive<00:02:56.510> back<00:02:56.690> dashes

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
all of these normals yeah right now this

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.670 
all of these normals yeah right now this
is<00:05:41.400> looking<00:05:41.580> full<00:05:42.270> control<00:05:42.630> Jupiter<00:05:43.020> but<00:05:43.530> yeah

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
is looking full control Jupiter but yeah

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.500 
is looking full control Jupiter but yeah
he<00:05:43.950> crunches<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:44.520> back<00:05:44.669> -<00:05:44.850> from<00:05:45.000> fullscreen

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
he crunches the back - from fullscreen

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.430 
he crunches the back - from fullscreen
so<00:05:45.660> you<00:05:45.780> have<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:46.020> chance

so you have a chance

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.250 
so you have a chance
oh<00:05:49.250> so<00:05:50.250> far<00:05:50.640> those<00:05:51.060> powered<00:05:51.540> up<00:05:51.630> nuclear<00:05:51.810> cells

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
oh so far those powered up nuclear cells

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.010 
oh so far those powered up nuclear cells
man<00:05:52.530> that's<00:05:53.400> so<00:05:53.700> much<00:05:53.850> range
