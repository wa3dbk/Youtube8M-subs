00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello my name is the company 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.720
 welcome to guru's photo site 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.550
 This video tutorial will tell you how to configure 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.309
 photo mechanic program so that it 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.420
 worked properly well for starters 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:20.340
 let's go into the settings using 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.960
 edit preferences tabs 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.320
 I will talk about the most basic 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.939
 things that need to be changed here 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.619
 moment you can click on pause and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.400
 set everything up as you see with me 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.369
 on the screen 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.649
 by default in the first tab of settings 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.500
 nothing needs to be changed only 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.170
 what note is the color labels 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640
 so if you want completely 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.780
 sync color tags in photo 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.520
 mechanics and lightroom 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.340
 set them up so that they are 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.590
 the same in both programs we move 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 to the next tab here we can 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.500
 choose the control key and bream for 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.780
 to celebrate a series of images 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.879
 what's important is to change this method 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.969
 sorting all the time I choose capture 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.880
 time so that the photos are sorted in 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.580
 chronological order further can 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 increase or decrease the size of thumbnails 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.280
 in principle, by default it is quite a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.710
 normal and you can add sharpness 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.700
 so that every little preview was 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.100
 parish 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.939
 this way you can see better 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.590
 what's in the picture 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.840
 can also be combined if you 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.979
 shooting in raw + jpeg format 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:37.650
 two files in one with this one 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:41.850
 tab go further in the tab 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.649
 files it is desirable to change the following 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.450
 This checkbox is responsible for 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.799
 the program gave you a warning 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.049
 before deleting 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.119
 file and move to trash 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.579
 desirable to leave to chance 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.500
 something not to delete the next photo 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.060
 mechanic will immediately remove without 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.799
 warning to cart 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.990
 can be turned on and off as desired 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:07.500
 I prefer it to be off 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.830
 because I delete all the photos of the package 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.510
 on and 17 times need to confirm the size 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.790
 large or small letters in 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.730
 back is so important but I choose small 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.980
 as in windows explorer and 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.629
 photo resolution 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.099
 240 ppi is shown here 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.810
 next tab here we can 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.700
 customize how photo 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.950
 mechanic will use external 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.510
 editing programs can 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.480
 for example choose photoshop or 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.060
 any other program i personally by this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.510
 I do not use therefore leave everything here 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.819
 since there is this field I will not be long 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.390
 tell each settings tell 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.519
 just why does he need to change business 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.569
 in that photo mechanic allows 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.480
 to put 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.150
 star rating or color rating 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.079
 tags for each photo in order 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.829
 so that windows or mac can see in the very 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.769
 conductor 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.629
 these changes after the photo mechanic need 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.299
 set up everything just like me here 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.700
 did now so just click on 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.980
 pause and duplicate all settings 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.170
 in the same way and after that each 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.120
 the photo you will be celebrating 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.569
 rated or color tag photo 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.790
 Mechanics will display it in the other 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.340
 programs such as lightroom photoshop 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.280
 and everyone else 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.190
 the next tab is a preview here in 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.709
 basically change anything do not need sharp 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.660
 and I also would not advise 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.730
 Your photos will be very cutting 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.010
 therefore not worth it 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.060
 sharpness can be added to the profile 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.609
 images on the camera itself caching 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.489
 files it is desirable that it was fast 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.549
 the disk I have here is selected system disk 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:58.199
 since it is ssd then basically i don't 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:02.760
 me can change the size of porridge from 512 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:04.769
 under 100 more precisely up to the movie to infinity 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.159
 how much disk do you have 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:12.269
 I basically worth 512 of this is quite 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:16.500
 enough so nothing to change here 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.539
 well, every time you exit this one 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.190
 tick is responsible for the fact that both will 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.530
 cleared or can it be right now 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.210
 clean up 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.910
 as empty and just as well here next 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.690
 tab is a color space 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:38.050
 it is desirable that the profile was with rgb it 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.850
 color profile which is used in 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.290
 online and when printing photos here 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.110
 on the last but one tab we can 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.570
 choose how our hot will be assigned 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.470
 default key is from 0 to 8 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.500
 this light and from 0 to 5 is a rating i 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.980
 I choose the second need to change now 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.470
 pressing the numbers from one to five you 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:05.200
 You will put asterisks like this 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.230
 here but using the keyboard is strong 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.940
 convenient because it speeds up work either 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.590
 if you still use color 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.580
 tags you can leave first 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:19.300
 option and then from 0 to 8 will be numbers 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:22.360
 assigned to each color that we are here 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.760
 here we choose nothing else to change 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.280
 it is not necessary you can only remove this one 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.560
 Here penultimate tick it means 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.650
 that every time I close the program 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.780
 click here it will not ask 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.100
 you a question to get out of the photo mechanic 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.710
 so I turned it off 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.560
 so that it does not distract once again and 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.660
 the last tab does not need to change anything 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.970
 everything is basically nothing complicated 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.950
 click apply ok and now photo 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.020
 mechanic is fully operational and 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.910
 will work as fast as possible and 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.560
 will add you the ability to use 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.050
 keyboard commands to 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.630
 assign each photo a quantity 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.380
 star rated my name is ustream 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.660
 companion 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.550
