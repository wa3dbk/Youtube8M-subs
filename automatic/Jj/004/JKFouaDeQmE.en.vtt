little<00:03:27.660> more<00:03:27.810> awkward<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.170> carry<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.560> though

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
little more awkward to carry in though

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.880 
little more awkward to carry in though
here<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.030> platform<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.930> use<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:31.739> a

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
here is the platform that I use it's a

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.190 
here is the platform that I use it's a
modified<00:03:32.280> ratchet<00:03:32.820> strap<00:03:33.090> belt<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.959> as<00:03:34.080> you

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
modified ratchet strap belt and as you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.930 
modified ratchet strap belt and as you
can<00:03:34.320> see<00:03:34.500> here<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.799> took<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.430> permanently

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
can see here I took and I permanently

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.240 
can see here I took and I permanently
sewed<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:37.110> side<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.620> it<00:03:37.709> onto<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> strap

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
sewed this side of it onto the strap

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.100 
sewed this side of it onto the strap
after<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.670> cut<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:38.880> tow<00:03:39.150> hooks<00:03:39.390> off<00:03:39.600> of<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.049> I

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
after I cut the tow hooks off of it so I

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.020 
after I cut the tow hooks off of it so I
can<00:03:40.290> strap<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.799> this<00:03:41.430> will<00:03:41.610> never<00:03:41.730> come<00:03:41.850> off

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
can strap it in this will never come off

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.780 
can strap it in this will never come off
then<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.690> slide<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.110> Ameri<00:03:43.470> step<00:03:43.830> plastic

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
then I just slide the Ameri step plastic

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.449 
then I just slide the Ameri step plastic
tree<00:03:45.060> stand<00:03:45.360> steps<00:03:45.660> right<00:03:46.290> on<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.680> them<00:03:46.860> that

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
tree stand steps right on to them that

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.800 
tree stand steps right on to them that
way<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.640> can<00:03:47.880> adjust<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.330> around<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.600> tree<00:03:48.780> I

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
way I can adjust it around the tree I

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.170 
way I can adjust it around the tree I
just<00:03:49.080> loop<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.860> around<00:03:49.920> slip<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:50.940> through

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
just loop it around slip this in through

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.490 
just loop it around slip this in through
here<00:03:51.330> ratchet<00:03:51.720> down<00:03:51.810> as<00:03:51.959> tight<00:03:52.110> as<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.320> need

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
here ratchet down as tight as I need

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.650 
here ratchet down as tight as I need
then<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.430> position<00:03:53.940> those<00:03:54.120> evenly<00:03:54.510> around

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
then I just position those evenly around

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.060 
then I just position those evenly around
the<00:03:54.780> tree<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.140> have<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.320> platform<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:55.920> can

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
the tree so I have a platform so I can

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.990 
the tree so I have a platform so I can
circle<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.400> tree<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.760> full<00:03:56.970> 360<00:03:57.570> degrees<00:03:58.230> and

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
circle the tree the full 360 degrees and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.520 
circle the tree the full 360 degrees and
just<00:04:00.000> once<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.510> get<00:04:00.630> them<00:04:00.720> snug<00:04:00.870> hard<00:04:01.350> get

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
just once you get them snug hard get

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.570 
just once you get them snug hard get
everything<00:04:01.769> where<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.070> like<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.400> then<00:04:02.549> you

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
everything where you like it then you

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.660 
everything where you like it then you
tighten<00:04:02.910> down<00:04:03.180> good

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
tighten down good

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.670 
tighten down good
you<00:04:04.060> might<00:04:04.300> see<00:04:04.630> one<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.110> two<00:04:05.260> inches<00:04:05.500> of

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
you might see one to two inches of

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.210 
you might see one to two inches of
slippage<00:04:06.099> but<00:04:06.670> after<00:04:06.910> that<00:04:07.060> you'll<00:04:07.480> be

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
slippage but after that you'll be

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.050 
slippage but after that you'll be
settled<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.520> you're<00:04:09.610> not<00:04:09.730> gonna<00:04:09.849> go

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
settled in and you're not gonna go

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.000 
settled in and you're not gonna go
anywhere<00:04:10.360> with<00:04:10.540> those<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:11.500> last<00:04:11.709> thing

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
the trees most comfortable for me but

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.350 
the trees most comfortable for me but
they're<00:04:27.220> you<00:04:27.340> kind<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.610> play<00:04:27.820> around<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.240> little

they're you kind of play around a little
bit<00:04:30.510> it's<00:04:31.510> just<00:04:31.630> more<00:04:31.930> about<00:04:32.020> personal

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
bit it's just more about personal

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.230 
bit it's just more about personal
preference<00:04:32.710> than<00:04:33.010> anything<00:04:33.160> else<00:04:33.460> but<00:04:34.180> that

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
preference than anything else but that

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.420 
preference than anything else but that
is<00:04:34.690> pretty<00:04:35.200> much<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.590> stuff<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:36.010> use<00:04:36.250> with

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
is pretty much the stuff that I use with

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.100 
is pretty much the stuff that I use with
the<00:04:36.520> tree<00:04:36.729> saddle<00:04:37.060> on<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> regular<00:04:37.570> basis<00:04:37.960> other

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
the tree saddle on a regular basis other

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.540 
the tree saddle on a regular basis other
than<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.350> bow<00:04:38.590> hook<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.010> stuff<00:04:39.190> like<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.460> to

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
than a bow hook and stuff like that to

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.580 
than a bow hook and stuff like that to
hold<00:04:39.729> my<00:04:39.820> bow<00:04:39.970> in<00:04:40.120> place<00:04:40.270> nothing<00:04:41.229> special

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
hold my bow in place nothing special

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.260 
hold my bow in place nothing special
about<00:04:41.800> those<00:04:42.040> everybody's<00:04:42.610> seen<00:04:42.790> them<00:04:43.000> so<00:04:43.180> I

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
about those everybody's seen them so I

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.580 
about those everybody's seen them so I
figured<00:04:43.540> that<00:04:43.570> would<00:04:43.780> go<00:04:44.200> ahead<00:04:44.320> and<00:04:44.470> leave

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
figured that would go ahead and leave

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.340 
figured that would go ahead and leave
those<00:04:44.740> off<00:04:44.919> but<00:04:45.760> I<00:04:45.790> will<00:04:46.240> be<00:04:46.479> back<00:04:46.510> shortly<00:04:46.690> and

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
those off but I will be back shortly and

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.680 
those off but I will be back shortly and
