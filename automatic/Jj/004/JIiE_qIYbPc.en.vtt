hi<00:00:08.780> this<00:00:08.840> is<00:00:08.990> Sean<00:00:09.290> with<00:00:09.440> wonder<00:00:09.650> gizmos<00:00:09.980> and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
hi this is Sean with wonder gizmos and

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.730 
hi this is Sean with wonder gizmos and
today<00:00:12.020> we<00:00:12.889> are<00:00:13.160> going<00:00:13.730> to<00:00:14.090> talk<00:00:14.480> about<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.139> sin

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
today we are going to talk about the sin

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.730 
today we are going to talk about the sin
or<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.550> micro-sim<00:00:16.880> rather<00:00:17.290> so<00:00:18.290> all<00:00:18.470> of<00:00:18.590> us

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
or the micro-sim rather so all of us

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.530 
or the micro-sim rather so all of us
know<00:00:18.860> that<00:00:18.890> micro-sim<00:00:19.550> are<00:00:19.790> not<00:00:20.330> easily

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
know that micro-sim are not easily

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.260 
know that micro-sim are not easily
available<00:00:20.900> in<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.200> market<00:00:21.260> and<00:00:22.270> telecom

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
available in the market and telecom

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.990 
available in the market and telecom
operators<00:00:23.750> like<00:00:24.020> would<00:00:24.260> often<00:00:24.590> tell<00:00:25.070> Tata

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
operators like would often tell Tata

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.140 
operators like would often tell Tata
Docomo<00:00:27.279> whenever<00:00:28.279> you<00:00:28.400> go<00:00:28.579> and<00:00:28.730> approach<00:00:28.970> them

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
Docomo whenever you go and approach them

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.089 
Docomo whenever you go and approach them
for<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.540> micro-sim<00:00:30.140> they<00:00:30.650> just<00:00:30.829> tell<00:00:30.950> you<00:00:31.040> that

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
for a micro-sim they just tell you that

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.090 
for a micro-sim they just tell you that
in<00:00:31.669> either<00:00:32.300> it's<00:00:32.570> not<00:00:32.810> available<00:00:33.350> or<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:33.890> have

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
in either it's not available or you have

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.220 
in either it's not available or you have
to<00:00:34.340> get<00:00:34.790> a<00:00:34.820> postpaid<00:00:35.239> connection<00:00:35.720> in<00:00:35.899> order<00:00:36.020> to

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
to get a postpaid connection in order to

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.250 
to get a postpaid connection in order to
get<00:00:36.410> a<00:00:36.530> micro-sim<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:38.149> there<00:00:38.720> are<00:00:38.810> people<00:00:39.110> who

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
get a micro-sim so there are people who

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.720 
get a micro-sim so there are people who
keep<00:00:39.470> asking<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.920> lot<00:00:40.040> of<00:00:40.070> questions<00:00:40.160> whether

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
keep asking a lot of questions whether

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.729 
keep asking a lot of questions whether
they<00:00:40.879> should<00:00:40.940> go<00:00:41.570> ahead<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:41.809> cut<00:00:42.320> their<00:00:42.530> SIM

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
they should go ahead and cut their SIM

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.580 
they should go ahead and cut their SIM
cards<00:00:43.219> if<00:00:43.340> it's<00:00:43.550> okay<00:00:43.879> to<00:00:43.940> do<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:44.390> or<00:00:44.660> if<00:00:45.289> there

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
cards if it's okay to do so or if there

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.830 
cards if it's okay to do so or if there
is<00:00:45.890> anything<00:00:46.340> else<00:00:46.699> which<00:00:47.120> would<00:00:47.300> help<00:00:47.510> them

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
is anything else which would help them

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.000 
is anything else which would help them
cut<00:00:48.109> the<00:00:48.260> sim<00:00:48.469> card

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
cut the sim card

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.669 
cut the sim card
so<00:00:49.550> today<00:00:49.820> we<00:00:50.000> are<00:00:50.030> going<00:00:50.269> to<00:00:50.359> introduce<00:00:50.679> you

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
so today we are going to introduce you

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.889 
so today we are going to introduce you
to<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.780> sim<00:00:53.780> cutter<00:00:55.089> so<00:00:56.089> although<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:56.839> looks

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
to the sim cutter so although this looks

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.500 
to the sim cutter so although this looks
like<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.410> stapler<00:00:58.000> but<00:00:59.000> then<00:00:59.179> this<00:01:00.109> is<00:01:00.170> a<00:01:01.510> micro

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
like a stapler but then this is a micro

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.630 
like a stapler but then this is a micro
sim<00:01:02.749> cutter<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:03.800> as<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:04.010> can<00:01:04.129> see<00:01:04.309> right<00:01:04.580> here

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
sim cutter so as you can see right here

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.350 
sim cutter so as you can see right here
there<00:01:05.300> is<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.420> slot<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:06.140> place<00:01:06.440> in<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.820> SIM<00:01:08.090> card

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
there is a slot to place in the SIM card

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.880 
there is a slot to place in the SIM card
into<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:08.900> then<00:01:09.409> once<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.980> punch<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:11.800> once<00:01:12.800> you

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
into and then once you punch it once you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.020 
into and then once you punch it once you
punch<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:13.900> you<00:01:14.900> will<00:01:15.080> get<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.530> Micro<00:01:15.860> SIM<00:01:16.030> so

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
punch it you will get the Micro SIM so

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.450 
punch it you will get the Micro SIM so
let<00:01:17.270> us<00:01:17.300> go<00:01:17.540> ahead<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:18.020> see<00:01:18.920> this<00:01:19.070> stuff<00:01:19.250> in

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
let us go ahead and see this stuff in

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.310 
let us go ahead and see this stuff in
action<00:01:20.260> so<00:01:21.260> here<00:01:21.590> we<00:01:21.740> have<00:01:21.980> a<00:01:22.780> sim<00:01:23.780> card<00:01:23.810> I'm

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
action so here we have a sim card I'm

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.470 
action so here we have a sim card I'm
just<00:01:24.620> going<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:24.980> go<00:01:25.130> ahead<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.700> insert<00:01:26.210> so

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
just going to go ahead and insert so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.970 
just going to go ahead and insert so
while<00:01:26.630> inserting<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.230> have<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.470> take<00:01:27.590> care<00:01:27.830> as

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
while inserting you have to take care as

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.690 
while inserting you have to take care as
you<00:01:28.010> can<00:01:28.280> see<00:01:28.400> here<00:01:29.440> so<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.830> tells<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.310> where

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
you can see here so this tells you where

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.440 
you can see here so this tells you where
how<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:32.180> have<00:01:32.420> to<00:01:32.540> place<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.860> SIM<00:01:34.130> card<00:01:34.460> into

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
how you have to place the SIM card into

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.200 
how you have to place the SIM card into
the<00:01:35.690> slot

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.860 

so<00:01:38.930> I'm<00:01:39.230> gonna<00:01:39.730> insert<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:40.940> SIM<00:01:41.150> card<00:01:41.180> here<00:01:41.750> in

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
so I'm gonna insert the SIM card here in

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.220 
so I'm gonna insert the SIM card here in
the<00:01:41.960> slot<00:01:42.310> then<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.400> have<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.640> press<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.110> so<00:01:45.110> as

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
the slot then you have to press it so as

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.310 
the slot then you have to press it so as
to<00:01:45.290> ensure<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.760> SIM<00:01:47.210> card<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.810> properly

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
to ensure that the SIM card is properly

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:56.010 
to ensure that the SIM card is properly
inserted<00:01:48.890> into<00:01:49.730> the<00:01:49.910> sim<00:01:50.240> cutter<00:01:53.410> okay<00:01:54.410> now

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
inserted into the sim cutter okay now

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.550 
inserted into the sim cutter okay now
I'll<00:01:57.020> just<00:01:57.080> go<00:01:57.530> ahead<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:58.300> cut<00:01:59.300> it<00:02:01.240> so<00:02:02.240> in<00:02:02.840> one

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
I'll just go ahead and cut it so in one

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.380 
I'll just go ahead and cut it so in one
action<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.950> have<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:04.700> apply<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> lot<00:02:05.240> of<00:02:05.300> force

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
action you have to apply a lot of force

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.840 
action you have to apply a lot of force
so<00:02:06.350> that<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.770> SIM<00:02:06.950> card<00:02:06.980> doesn't<00:02:07.280> Bend<00:02:07.520> but<00:02:07.700> it

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
so that the SIM card doesn't Bend but it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.120 
so that the SIM card doesn't Bend but it
actually<00:02:08.330> gets<00:02:08.750> cut<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:09.410> I'm<00:02:09.500> gonna<00:02:09.710> apply<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
actually gets cut so I'm gonna apply the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.540 
actually gets cut so I'm gonna apply the
force<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:12.080> same<00:02:12.590> Micro<00:02:13.070> SIM<00:02:13.190> might<00:02:13.370> just

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
force and the same Micro SIM might just

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.430 
force and the same Micro SIM might just
pop<00:02:13.790> out<00:02:13.940> okay<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.810> let's<00:02:14.990> go<00:02:15.110> ahead<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.350> do

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
pop out okay so let's go ahead and do

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:25.470 
pop out okay so let's go ahead and do
this<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:21.260> there<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.530> go

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.440 

so<00:02:26.480> there<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.750> go

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
so there you go

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.840 
so there you go
you<00:02:29.450> have<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.660> micro<00:02:30.080> sim<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:31.160> one<00:02:31.400> shot<00:02:31.610> here

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
you have a micro sim in one shot here

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.840 
you have a micro sim in one shot here
and<00:02:33.580> as<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:34.880> see<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:37.130> was<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.670> whole

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
and as you can see so this was the whole

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:47.290 
and as you can see so this was the whole
sin<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:43.630> now<00:02:44.630> it<00:02:44.810> has<00:02:45.019> been<00:02:45.260> turned<00:02:46.209> into<00:02:47.209> a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
sin and now it has been turned into a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.570 
sin and now it has been turned into a
micro<00:02:47.720> sim<00:02:47.930> with<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.200> help<00:02:48.410> of<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.130> micro<00:02:49.430> sim

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
micro sim with the help of the micro sim

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.000 
micro sim with the help of the micro sim
cutter<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.600> now<00:02:54.019> if<00:02:54.140> you're<00:02:54.290> wondering<00:02:54.500> that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
cutter so now if you're wondering that

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.220 
cutter so now if you're wondering that
hey<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.670> have<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> micro<00:02:56.450> sim<00:02:56.660> now<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:56.989> can

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
hey you have a micro sim now you can

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.729 
hey you have a micro sim now you can
easily<00:02:57.560> use<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:58.580> phones<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.870> iPhone<00:02:59.900> or

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
easily use in phones like the iPhone or

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.070 
easily use in phones like the iPhone or
maybe<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.820> Nokia<00:03:02.180> Lumia<00:03:02.209> series<00:03:02.570> which<00:03:02.900> also

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
maybe the Nokia Lumia series which also

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.170 
maybe the Nokia Lumia series which also
has<00:03:03.350> micros<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.860> minute<00:03:04.160> but<00:03:04.670> then<00:03:04.820> what<00:03:05.060> if<00:03:05.150> you

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
has micros a minute but then what if you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.970 
has micros a minute but then what if you
want<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.540> go<00:03:05.690> ahead<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.110> revert<00:03:06.470> back<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.890> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
want to go ahead and revert back to the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.040 
want to go ahead and revert back to the
normal<00:03:07.190> sin<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:08.480> might<00:03:08.660> be<00:03:08.780> thinking<00:03:09.019> that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
normal sin you might be thinking that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.259 
normal sin you might be thinking that
you<00:03:09.230> have<00:03:09.350> to<00:03:09.500> go<00:03:09.620> ahead<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.269> telecom

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
you have to go ahead to a telecom

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.240 
you have to go ahead to a telecom
operator<00:03:11.600> store<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.110> get<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.260> new<00:03:12.440> SIM<00:03:13.010> card

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
operator store and get a new SIM card

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.380 
operator store and get a new SIM card
but<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:14.000> not<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.209> case<00:03:15.880> thanks<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:17.090> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
but that is not the case thanks to the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.960 
but that is not the case thanks to the
normal<00:03:18.260> sim<00:03:18.410> adapter<00:03:18.830> as<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.610> can<00:03:19.730> see<00:03:19.820> right

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
normal sim adapter as you can see right

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.210 
normal sim adapter as you can see right
here

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.300 

so<00:03:26.220> all<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.550> have<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.700> do<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:28.280> place<00:03:29.280> your

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
so all you have to do is place your

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.050 
so all you have to do is place your
micro<00:03:29.819> SIM<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:31.069> just<00:03:32.069> push<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.340> into<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
micro SIM and just push it into the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.699 
micro SIM and just push it into the
grooves<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.740> sim<00:03:34.740> adapter<00:03:36.470> as<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.590> can

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
grooves of the sim adapter as you can

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:45.380 
grooves of the sim adapter as you can
see<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.959> have<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.410> normal<00:03:43.650> stem<00:03:43.860> again<00:03:44.390> and

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
see so you have a normal stem again and

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.660 
see so you have a normal stem again and
in<00:03:45.480> case<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.780> want<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.110> micro<00:03:46.380> sim<00:03:46.560> back<00:03:46.770> this

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
in case you want a micro sim back this

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.540 
in case you want a micro sim back this
is<00:03:47.760> all<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.180> do<00:03:49.070> so<00:03:50.070> this<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.340> how

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
is all you have to do so this is how

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.520 
is all you have to do so this is how
easy<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.790> folks<00:03:53.790> from<00:03:54.150> Vodafone<00:03:54.750> or

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
easy it is and folks from Vodafone or

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.199 
easy it is and folks from Vodafone or
other<00:03:55.860> telecom<00:03:56.190> operators<00:03:56.700> are<00:03:56.970> taking<00:03:57.180> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
other telecom operators are taking a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.350 
other telecom operators are taking a
look<00:03:57.330> at<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.540> video<00:03:57.780> you<00:03:58.620> know<00:03:58.739> what<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:59.010> do

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
look at this video you know what to do

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.910 
look at this video you know what to do
this<00:04:00.360> was<00:04:00.540> shown<00:04:00.690> with<00:04:00.780> only<00:04:00.989> gizmos<00:04:01.290> signing

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
this was shown with only gizmos signing
