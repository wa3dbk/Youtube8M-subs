this video is about how to replace a

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.200 
this video is about how to replace a
clutch<00:00:03.720> on<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.140> scout<00:00:04.950> 80<00:00:05.250> with<00:00:06.180> a

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
clutch on a scout 80 with a

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.179 
clutch on a scout 80 with a
four-cylinder<00:00:06.990> engine<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.649> three-speed

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
four-cylinder engine and a three-speed

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.810 
four-cylinder engine and a three-speed
transmission<00:00:09.740> using<00:00:10.740> air<00:00:10.860> tools<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> great

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
transmission using air tools is a great

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.320 
transmission using air tools is a great
way<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.000> do<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:13.250> you<00:00:14.250> will<00:00:14.400> first<00:00:14.700> remove<00:00:15.059> all

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
way to do this you will first remove all

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.939 
way to do this you will first remove all
the<00:00:15.389> bolts<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.020> connect<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.560> bell<00:00:16.740> housing

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the bolts that connect the bell housing

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.080 
the bolts that connect the bell housing
to<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.789> engine<00:00:18.210> block

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
to the engine block

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.380 
to the engine block
then<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.359> use<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.510> pry<00:00:21.810> bar<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:23.390> separate

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
then you can use a pry bar to separate

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.200 
then you can use a pry bar to separate
the<00:00:24.539> two<00:00:24.800> we've<00:00:25.800> already<00:00:26.039> loosened<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.849> bolts

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the two we've already loosened the bolts

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.150 
the two we've already loosened the bolts
or<00:00:27.359> remove<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> bolts<00:00:28.410> from<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
or remove the bolts from the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490 
or remove the bolts from the
transmission<00:00:29.760> mounts<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> transmission

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
transmission mounts so the transmission

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.340 
transmission mounts so the transmission
and<00:00:32.000> belt<00:00:33.260> housing<00:00:34.290> move<00:00:34.680> freely<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.079> back

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and belt housing move freely so you back

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350 
and belt housing move freely so you back
it<00:00:37.530> straight<00:00:37.950> out<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> away<00:00:38.730> from<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> engine

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it straight out and away from the engine

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.869 
it straight out and away from the engine
and<00:00:42.770> set<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.860> aside

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.670 

here<00:00:47.879> we're<00:00:48.120> removing<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.020> clutch<00:00:49.320> pressure

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
to replace the rear main seal all of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.210 
to replace the rear main seal all of
these<00:01:29.030> engines<00:01:29.390> are<00:01:29.539> getting<00:01:29.780> old<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.350> you

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
these engines are getting old and you

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.309 
these engines are getting old and you
would<00:01:31.729> not<00:01:31.909> want<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.210> do<00:01:32.329> a<00:01:32.360> clutch<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.020> find

work your way all the way around is
called<00:02:10.970> walking<00:02:11.360> in<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.870> seal<00:02:14.260> you'll<00:02:15.260> tap<00:02:15.530> it

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
called walking in the seal you'll tap it

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.360 
called walking in the seal you'll tap it
in<00:02:15.889> until<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:16.519> flush<00:02:16.609> and<00:02:18.220> then<00:02:19.220> you'll

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
in until it's flush and then you'll

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.610 
in until it's flush and then you'll
drive<00:02:19.519> it<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.970> little<00:02:20.450> bit<00:02:20.630> further<00:02:21.019> with

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
drive it in a little bit further with

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.620 
drive it in a little bit further with
some<00:02:21.889> sort<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.400> drift<00:02:22.730> or<00:02:22.910> some<00:02:23.150> sort<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.510> a

some sort of a drift or some sort of a
small<00:02:23.810> tapping<00:02:24.440> device<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:31.670> it's

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
small tapping device and now it's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.100 
small tapping device and now it's
probably<00:02:32.480> flush

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.770 

and<00:02:37.560> now<00:02:37.680> you'll<00:02:37.860> set<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.160> all<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.490> way<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.850> by

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
and now you'll set it all the way in by

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.330 
and now you'll set it all the way in by
walking<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> all<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> way<00:02:40.710> around<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.280> you

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
walking it all the way around and you

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.850 
walking it all the way around and you
set<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> way<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.930> until<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.470> stops

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
set it all the way in until it stops

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.890 
set it all the way in until it stops
moving<00:02:44.190> there's<00:02:44.730> kind<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.180> detent<00:02:45.630> that's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
moving there's kind of a detent that's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.460 
moving there's kind of a detent that's
built<00:02:46.200> into<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> block<00:02:47.300> you'll<00:02:48.300> remove<00:02:48.690> any

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
built into the block you'll remove any

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
that's why you need to hold it into an

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:50.589 
that's why you need to hold it into an
alignment<00:04:40.740> state
