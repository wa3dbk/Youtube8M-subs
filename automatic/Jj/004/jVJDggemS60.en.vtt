million<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.709> rank<00:03:38.919> up<00:03:39.069> so<00:03:39.220> that's<00:03:39.370> good<00:03:39.579> warp

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
million to rank up so that's good warp

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.110 
million to rank up so that's good warp
see<00:03:40.959> so<00:03:41.230> warp<00:03:41.440> see<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:42.099> main<00:03:42.609> mind<00:03:42.880> that

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
see so warp see is the main mind that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.699 
see so warp see is the main mind that
wasn't<00:03:43.419> really<00:03:43.540> changed<00:03:44.139> at<00:03:44.290> all<00:03:44.319> whatsoever

wasn't really changed at all whatsoever
and<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.700> main<00:03:45.819> reason<00:03:45.880> for<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.510> was<00:03:46.569> just

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
and the main reason for that was just

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.990 
and the main reason for that was just
