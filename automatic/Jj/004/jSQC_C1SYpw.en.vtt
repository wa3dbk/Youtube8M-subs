00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.070
 This comic has the same 5 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:11.080
 introduction from the authors themselves here with us 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:15.470
 poison ivy depicts a female cat 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.900

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.650

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.370
 read 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.450
 here we would like to repeat the story 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.970
 the movie is the beginning of the movie batman 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.840
 Greg itself actually shows up as 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.790
 bruce wayne lost his parents there 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.890
 after the theater or what they went there 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.650
 performance on some of shot them 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.650
 so this gangs here from the moment he 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.530
 decided to revenge all the bandits as it became 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.660
 batman today killed him nah parents 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.430
 about it became what a rich son 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.430
 Yes, and would spend money right and left 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.650
 but he decided to let it all go 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.180
 say with evil here it is with us 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.380
 Batman himself is standing on a gargoyle 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:08.359
 you don't know who it is you quite like him 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.980
 decides to revenge all the bandits so little 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.790
 look here such a maxi will not 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.340
 flipping but i really like 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.260
 everything is done qualitatively do not know candy 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.530
 translations many complain about translations 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.980
 marvolo chic that there are many mistakes marriage but 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.069
 This book is not a given book at all. 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.160
 so say already world bestseller up to 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.569
 the original name sounds batman hash 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.930
 too quiet now she tried 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.060
 million copies in Russia, too, she 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.970
 sell well sold everywhere seen in 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.130
 tops of sales we are comic stores and this 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.459
 already a prepress that is released the second 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.760
 circulation would be bought 1 time also in this 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.100
 the series has a comic called batman 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.359
 Arkham clinic but I decided to start bye 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.359
 But with this I understand that we have krok 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:11.190
 igy batman catwoman is also the head of the 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:17.410
 it is divided that it is convenient to see us boats 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:20.079
 again krog here we will have a superman 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:26.230
 here on the female cat against 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:31.870
 poison ivy here superman batman 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:34.480
 fights for some reason with superman but 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.240
 I think comic worth its money 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:41.440
 so if you like comics disi there 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:46.470
 Batman then I advise you to buy it Harley 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:52.060
 Quinn's girlfriend crazy joker 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:56.980
 they themselves joker himself he is a broker 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:02.669
 in blood that i don't understand harley quinn herself 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.669
 kills him strangely 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.620
 how many chapters is interesting chapter 7 here 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.970
 as if all pages are not all comics 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.310
 there are all sorts of additional materials 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.880
 Now let's see them so that's what we have and 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.620
 let's go 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.360
 additional material is a note 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.730
 look how many materials are there 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.730
 pages do not know pages 40 is no more 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:34.810
 every note is so long to read kopets 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.810
 of course they did their best 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:45.229
 here are such small sketches of superman 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:50.869
 batman &amp; robin probably or nightwing me 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:52.399
 I do not know this and actually listing 

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:55.159
 circulation circulation of only 3 thousand 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:59.119
 instances that very few and again 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:06:00.860
 icon 16 + about 

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:05.599
 This suggests that this as if comics 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.309
 for such older people already 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.529
 here you see one of the most iconic 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:11.089
 graphic novels in the world for the first time on 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:14.619
 Russian as I said he already 

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:18.879
 the most popular comic becomes 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:18.879
 Well, here we have different estimates 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:24.099
 publishers all sorts of server baba kind of comic 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:31.089
 books 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:33.979
 that's what a pretty good comic 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:36.589
 how would alternatives be young in russia 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:40.459
