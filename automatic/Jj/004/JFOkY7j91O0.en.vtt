00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.500
My name is Martin Lübber.
I am running a dairy farm with my wife and parents

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.410
close to Hannover in Lower Saxony, Germany.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.410
At the moment we have 430 Dairy Cows on our farm.
We made a big step forward two years ago

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.119
when we decided to build a new shed with cubicles and milking parlour.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.940
Before that we had 250 cows on our old farm in the village where we couldn’t expand.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.489
That's why we decided to build a brand-new shed with a bio-gas plant just outside the village.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.870
We are currently milking 370 cows on the new farm. 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.570
The dry cows are kept behind at the old farm for calving. 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.570
Cows are kept behind on the old farm for the first few milkings after calving and then brought over to the new farm later.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.290
While planning the new parlour we also looked at a few other installations from other manufacturers

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.950
but none of them really convinced us. 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.740
Finally, I decided to go over to Ireland with my wife to see more rotary installations

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.170
and we quickly decided to get an external milking Dairymaster Rotary.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.619
We are still convinced that this was the right thing to do

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.160
and that this was the perfect milking system for us!
