muscles that you can see in the mirror
we<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.559> think<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.800> pretty<00:00:47.100> silly

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
we actually think that's pretty silly

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.569 
we actually think that's pretty silly
and<00:00:47.730> yes<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.930> work<00:00:49.140> those<00:00:49.350> muscles<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:50.070> we

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and yes we do work those muscles but we

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.670 
and yes we do work those muscles but we
also<00:00:50.789> work<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.300> muscles<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.110> important

her bottom leg which is the leg that
we're<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.210> working<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.689> thighs<00:01:51.899> at

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
we're going to be working the thighs at

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.679 
we're going to be working the thighs at
90<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> knees<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.220> 90<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.180> resting

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
90 and the knees at 90 and it's resting

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.280 
90 and the knees at 90 and it's resting
on<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.200> block<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.159> cushion<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.719> top<00:01:57.990> leg

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
on a block this is a cushion the top leg

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.830 
on a block this is a cushion the top leg
is<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> stabilizing<00:01:59.070> leg<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.390> leg<00:02:00.659> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
is a stabilizing leg and this leg is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.359 
is a stabilizing leg and this leg is
really<00:02:00.990> important<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.469> stabilize<00:02:01.680> because<00:02:02.070> we

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
really important to stabilize because we

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.280 
really important to stabilize because we
can't<00:02:02.670> strengthen<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.840> side<00:02:04.140> without

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
can't strengthen one side without

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.170 
can't strengthen one side without
stabilizing<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.189> other<00:02:05.310> side<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.939> leg

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
stabilizing the other side so this leg

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.609 
stabilizing the other side so this leg
is<00:02:06.329> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> lemon<00:02:07.020> skat<00:02:07.259> which<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
is going to do a lemon skat which is a

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.830 
is going to do a lemon skat which is a
figure<00:02:07.979> eight<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> gently

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
figure eight so this is going to gently

and rhythmically and over time if I want

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.390 
and rhythmically and over time if I want
to<00:02:52.420> add<00:02:52.540> resistance<00:02:52.780> go<00:02:53.530> ahead<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:53.950> can<00:02:54.130> also

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
to add resistance go ahead I can also

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.880 
to add resistance go ahead I can also
resist<00:02:54.880> with<00:02:55.030> my<00:02:55.209> hand<00:02:55.510> or<00:02:55.780> we<00:02:56.350> can<00:02:56.500> even<00:02:56.650> put

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
resist with my hand or we can even put

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.800 
resist with my hand or we can even put
an<00:02:57.010> ankle<00:02:57.430> weight<00:02:57.489> on<00:02:57.910> her<00:02:58.150> leg<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.660> add

an ankle weight on her leg to add

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.530 
an ankle weight on her leg to add
resistance<00:02:59.350> our<00:02:59.650> goal<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.700> three<00:03:01.120> sets<00:03:01.390> of

resistance our goal is three sets of
fifty<00:03:02.459> okay<00:03:03.459> now<00:03:03.670> that's<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.180> open<00:03:04.570> chain

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
fifty okay now that's the open chain

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.170 
fifty okay now that's the open chain
position<00:03:05.380> now<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.890> there's<00:03:06.370> also<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.880> lot<00:03:07.120> of

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
knows how to do this type of work now

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.530 
knows how to do this type of work now
from<00:03:24.010> here<00:03:24.310> we're<00:03:24.489> going<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.640> go<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:25.030> semi

from here we're going to go to a semi

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.300 
from here we're going to go to a semi
closed<00:03:25.989> chain<00:03:26.380> position<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.070> I'm<00:03:27.130> going<00:03:27.250> to

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
closed chain position so I'm going to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.789 
closed chain position so I'm going to
have<00:03:27.400> Alyssa<00:03:27.700> come<00:03:28.390> up<00:03:28.600> into<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.200> myofascial

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
have Alyssa come up into the myofascial

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.710 
have Alyssa come up into the myofascial
stretching<00:03:30.430> position<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.180> operator<00:03:31.570> and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
stretching position of the operator and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.949 
stretching position of the operator and
Ternes<00:03:32.079> which<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.250> also<00:03:33.610> called<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.180> 90<00:03:34.540> 90<00:03:34.930> 90

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
Ternes which is also called a 90 90 90

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.229 
Ternes which is also called a 90 90 90
position<00:03:35.799> so<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.430> can<00:03:36.459> see<00:03:36.760> she's<00:03:36.970> got<00:03:37.150> her

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
position so you can see she's got her

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.210 
position so you can see she's got her
thigh<00:03:37.420> at<00:03:37.480> 90<00:03:37.989> her<00:03:38.170> knee<00:03:38.350> at<00:03:38.470> 90<00:03:38.920> I'm<00:03:39.100> gonna

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
she's doing external rotation so this is

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.840 
she's doing external rotation so this is
the<00:04:29.850> semi<00:04:30.300> closed<00:04:30.930> chain<00:04:31.320> position<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:32.040> want<00:04:32.730> to

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
the semi closed chain position I want to

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.300 
the semi closed chain position I want to
Lissa<00:04:33.060> okay<00:04:33.720> thank<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.020> Lissa<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.590> want<00:04:35.190> to

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
now the semi closed chain position of

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.140 
now the semi closed chain position of
the<00:04:42.630> operator<00:04:43.020> Ternes<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.970> fantastic<00:04:44.970> for

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
the operator Ternes is fantastic for

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.440 
the operator Ternes is fantastic for
supporting<00:04:45.780> the<00:04:45.900> internal<00:04:46.380> organs<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:48.210> there

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
supporting the internal organs so there

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.790 
supporting the internal organs so there
you<00:04:48.630> have<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.870> that's<00:04:49.140> how<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:49.410> work<00:04:49.680> the

you have it that's how you work the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.420 
you have it that's how you work the
operator<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.310> turn<00:04:50.490> us<00:04:50.640> both<00:04:51.210> open<00:04:51.660> chain<00:04:51.930> and

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
operator and turn us both open chain and

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.860 
operator and turn us both open chain and
semi<00:04:53.430> closed<00:04:53.760> chain<00:04:54.090> if<00:04:54.330> you<00:04:54.390> have<00:04:54.720> any

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870
