and also when you see this throttle I

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:10.580 
and also when you see this throttle I
think<00:04:10.320> that

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
think that

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.070

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
that also is a sign that this is nicely

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.810 
that also is a sign that this is nicely
