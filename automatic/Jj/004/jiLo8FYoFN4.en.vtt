in<00:00:02.610> yesterday's<00:00:03.060> video<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.629> over<00:00:03.810> the

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
in yesterday's video going over the

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.680 
in yesterday's video going over the
full-back<00:00:04.470> screen<00:00:04.920> Joe<00:00:05.819> from<00:00:06.089> madam<00:00:06.390> school

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
full-back screen Joe from madam school

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.190 
full-back screen Joe from madam school
commented<00:00:07.410> that<00:00:08.010> he<00:00:08.189> wanted<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.550> see<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:09.200> play

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
commented that he wanted to see a play

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.620 
commented that he wanted to see a play
that<00:00:10.380> could<00:00:10.590> beat<00:00:10.769> man<00:00:11.610> press<00:00:11.969> coverage<00:00:12.420> that

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
that could beat man press coverage that

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.120 
that could beat man press coverage that
he<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:12.809> playing<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.110> guy<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.590> continually

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
he was playing a guy that continually

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.770 
he was playing a guy that continually
just<00:00:14.340> man<00:00:14.549> pressed<00:00:14.910> them<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.179> whole<00:00:15.299> time<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
just man pressed them the whole time and

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
just man pressed them the whole time and
so<00:00:16.289> I'm<00:00:16.379> assuming<00:00:16.500> that's<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.070> two<00:00:17.369> men<00:00:17.550> under

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so I'm assuming that's a two men under

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.910 
so I'm assuming that's a two men under
type<00:00:18.029> defense<00:00:18.480> where<00:00:18.960> he's<00:00:19.500> not<00:00:19.650> pressing

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
type defense where he's not pressing

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
type defense where he's not pressing
with<00:00:20.369> zero<00:00:20.730> guys<00:00:20.939> over<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.300> top<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.689> then

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
with zero guys over the top because then

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.050 
with zero guys over the top because then
you<00:00:22.140> would<00:00:22.260> just<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:23.189> know<00:00:23.250> kind<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.640> LA<00:00:23.850> but

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
you would just you know kind of LA but

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.340 
you would just you know kind of LA but
deep<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> touchdown<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.930> assume<00:00:25.230> he<00:00:25.320> has

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
deep and get a touchdown I assume he has

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.830 
deep and get a touchdown I assume he has
two<00:00:25.619> deep<00:00:25.769> safeties<00:00:26.510> patrolling<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.630> deep

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
two deep safeties patrolling that deep

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.859 
two deep safeties patrolling that deep
part<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.289> can't<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.590> go<00:00:29.099> deep<00:00:29.869> he

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
part so you can't really go deep he

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.510 
part so you can't really go deep he
wanted<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.349> be<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.859> play<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.399> the

plays broken down in a similar style in
that<00:00:51.239> playbook<00:00:51.660> I'll<00:00:52.289> be<00:00:52.500> blowing<00:00:52.680> over<00:00:52.800> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
that playbook I'll be blowing over a

that playbook I'll be blowing over a
play<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.280> isn't<00:00:53.670> found<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.449> ebook

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
play that isn't found in that ebook
though<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.789> more<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
though and it's more just really a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.020 
though and it's more just really a
concept<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.440> use<00:00:58.680> rather<00:00:59.219> than<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.850> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
concept to use rather than just a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
concept to use rather than just a
specific<00:01:00.600> play<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.829> place<00:01:02.010> called

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
specific play and the place called

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.619 
specific play and the place called
corner<00:01:02.579> strike<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.210> we're<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.510> looking

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
corner strike but we're really looking

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.289 
corner strike but we're really looking
at<00:01:03.899> those<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.680> call<00:01:04.860> sea<00:01:05.189> routes<00:01:05.430> which

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
at those what we call sea routes which

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
at those what we call sea routes which
you<00:01:06.900> essentially<00:01:07.380> kind<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> start<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.310> slant

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you essentially kind of start on a slant

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
you essentially kind of start on a slant
type<00:01:08.970> thing<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> go<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.409> field<00:01:10.619> then

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
type thing then you go up the field then

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.140 
type thing then you go up the field then
you<00:01:10.920> break<00:01:11.100> back<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.520> towards<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> sideline

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you break back out towards the sideline

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090 
you break back out towards the sideline
and<00:01:12.510> we're<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> call<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and we're going to kind of call it

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.090 
and we're going to kind of call it
against<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> two<00:01:14.760> men<00:01:14.939> under<00:01:15.210> press<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:17.009> know

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
against the two men under press you know

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
against the two men under press you know
go<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> dime<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.630> there's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
go do it on a dime so you know there's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.950 
go do it on a dime so you know there's
good<00:01:18.990> coverage<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.240> Buccaneers<00:01:21.810> have

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
good coverage the the Buccaneers have

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.330 
good coverage the the Buccaneers have
good<00:01:22.110> cornerbacks<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:22.890> Darrell<00:01:23.009> Revis

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
good cornerbacks I think Darrell Revis

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
good cornerbacks I think Darrell Revis
is<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.909> side<00:01:23.939> there's<00:01:24.330> somebody<00:01:24.600> pretty

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
is on one side there's somebody pretty

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.749 
is on one side there's somebody pretty
good<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> other<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:26.250> also<00:01:26.400> use<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
good on the other we also use this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.399 
good on the other we also use this
formation<00:01:27.150> because<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.020> notice<00:01:28.200> our

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that you don't need a really good

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.090 
that you don't need a really good
receiver<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.329> routes<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.869> work<00:01:37.100> so

I'll go ahead and put Steve Smith on a
slant<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.930> bailout<00:01:40.170> route<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
slant it's kind of a bailout route the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.770 
slant it's kind of a bailout route the
other<00:01:41.640> two<00:01:41.850> receivers<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.329> second<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
other two receivers are second and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.910 
other two receivers are second and
third-string<00:01:43.200> receivers<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.740> they're<00:01:43.860> not

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
third-string receivers so they're not

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.260 
third-string receivers so they're not
the<00:01:44.070> best<00:01:44.220> receivers<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> world<00:01:45.090> they're

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the best receivers in the world they're

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.020 
the best receivers in the world they're
probably<00:01:45.450> about<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.439> know<00:01:46.470> 75<00:01:47.040> 282<00:01:47.880> overall

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
probably about you know 75 282 overall

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.810 
probably about you know 75 282 overall
somewhere<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.720> range<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:50.430> reason<00:01:50.729> this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
somewhere in that range the reason this

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.999 
somewhere in that range the reason this
play<00:01:51.060> works<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:52.320> both<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
play works is because both of the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
play works is because both of the
receivers<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.549> these<00:01:53.700> sea<00:01:53.939> routes<00:01:54.180> run<00:01:54.930> on

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
receivers on these sea routes run on

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.170 
receivers on these sea routes run on
bumpa<00:01:55.439> below<00:01:55.619> outs<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.100> when<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.670> defense

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
bumpa below outs so when the defense

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.780 
bumpa below outs so when the defense
comes<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> bump<00:01:57.899> them<00:01:58.079> or<00:01:58.229> press<00:01:58.469> them<00:01:58.790> our

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
comes up to bump them or press them our

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.730 
comes up to bump them or press them our
guys<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.240> run<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.479> by<00:02:00.689> them<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.649> what

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
guys just run right by them and so what

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.959 
guys just run right by them and so what
we'll<00:02:01.890> want<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.310> eventually<00:02:02.790> were

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
we'll want to do is eventually were

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.730 
we'll want to do is eventually were
going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> want<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.329> lead<00:02:03.509> pass<00:02:03.750> bullet<00:02:04.590> pass

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
going to want to lead pass bullet pass

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.700 
going to want to lead pass bullet pass
towards<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.159> sideline<00:02:06.229> both<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.350> these<00:02:07.469> will

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
towards the sideline both of these will

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.369 
towards the sideline both of these will
be<00:02:07.860> open<00:02:08.190> against<00:02:09.060> any<00:02:09.270> sort<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.629> man<00:02:10.050> demand

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
be open against any sort of man demand

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.500 
be open against any sort of man demand
press<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.459> man<00:02:11.670> covered<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.120> general

press or really man covered in general

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.600 
press or really man covered in general
but<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> works<00:02:12.810> even<00:02:12.930> better<00:02:13.080> against

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
but it works even better against

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.150 
but it works even better against
and<00:02:13.700> press<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:15.320> can<00:02:15.470> do<00:02:15.590> whatever<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:15.980> want

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
and press you can do whatever you want

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.740 
and press you can do whatever you want
with<00:02:16.220> your<00:02:16.310> tight<00:02:17.120> end<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.480> you're<00:02:17.630> running

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
with your tight end and you're running

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
with your tight end and you're running
back<00:02:17.960> as<00:02:18.110> long<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.320> they<00:02:18.380> don't<00:02:18.470> get<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.710> the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
back as long as they don't get in the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.820 
back as long as they don't get in the
way<00:02:18.830> of<00:02:18.950> those<00:02:19.780> sea<00:02:20.780> routes<00:02:21.020> so<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.320> can<00:02:21.620> block

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
way of those sea routes so I can block

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.020 
way of those sea routes so I can block
them<00:02:22.010> running<00:02:22.190> back<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.640> can<00:02:22.760> put<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
them running back and you can put the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.460 
them running back and you can put the
tie<00:02:23.150> down<00:02:23.330> like<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.600> streak<00:02:23.990> or<00:02:24.140> something<00:02:24.380> like

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
tie down like a streak or something like

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.140 
tie down like a streak or something like
that<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.920> really<00:02:25.130> whatever<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.550> want<00:02:25.790> it's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
that it's really whatever you want it's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.390 
that it's really whatever you want it's
kind<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.480> optional<00:02:26.930> I'll<00:02:27.860> show<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.070> how<00:02:28.250> it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
kind of optional I'll show you how it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.490 
kind of optional I'll show you how it
should<00:02:28.610> work<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:29.990> should<00:02:30.170> notice<00:02:30.350> that

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
should work and you should notice that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.590 
should work and you should notice that
both<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.370> Joe<00:02:31.640> wanted<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.060> know<00:02:32.210> both<00:02:32.570> of

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
both but like Joe wanted to know both of

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.110 
both but like Joe wanted to know both of
these<00:02:33.160> cornerbacks<00:02:34.160> are<00:02:34.340> impressed<00:02:34.730> coverage

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
these cornerbacks are impressed coverage

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.050 
these cornerbacks are impressed coverage
and<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.470> place<00:02:36.710> should<00:02:36.890> beat<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.940> you

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
and so this place should beat it and you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.430 
and so this place should beat it and you
can<00:02:41.150> see<00:02:41.270> when<00:02:41.390> we<00:02:41.450> leave<00:02:41.630> past<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.080> sideline

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
can see when we leave past the sideline

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.400 
can see when we leave past the sideline
there<00:02:42.680> he's<00:02:43.250> wide<00:02:43.520> open<00:02:44.110> even<00:02:45.110> if<00:02:45.170> he<00:02:45.230> doesn't

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
there he's wide open even if he doesn't

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.780 
there he's wide open even if he doesn't
appear<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:45.890> open<00:02:46.160> if<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.370> throw<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.670> any

way you lead pass to the sideline he

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.850

after i run this this one more time
through<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.580> these<00:02:55.760> guys<00:02:55.910> are<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.300> fact

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
through that that these guys are in fact

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.300 
through that that these guys are in fact
pressing<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.500> route<00:02:57.739> that<00:02:57.770> makes

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
pressing that it's the route that makes

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.940 
pressing that it's the route that makes
this<00:02:59.270> play<00:02:59.540> work<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.410> I'm<00:03:00.500> going<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.680> run<00:03:00.800> it

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
this play work so I'm going to run it

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.530 
this play work so I'm going to run it
one<00:03:01.190> time<00:03:01.340> one<00:03:01.760> more<00:03:01.850> time<00:03:01.910> through<00:03:02.239> here<00:03:02.420> and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
one time one more time through here and

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.210 
one time one more time through here and
then<00:03:03.140> I'm<00:03:03.230> going<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.380> heart<00:03:03.739> route<00:03:03.890> one<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.130> our

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
then I'm going to heart route one of our

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.530 
then I'm going to heart route one of our
guys<00:03:04.310> like<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.610> streak<00:03:04.970> route<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.360> show<00:03:05.510> that

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
guys like a streak route and show that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.500 
guys like a streak route and show that
he<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:05.989> indeed<00:03:06.260> pressed<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.940> this<00:03:08.360> is

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
he is indeed pressed and that this is

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.240 
he is indeed pressed and that this is
this<00:03:08.750> particular<00:03:08.959> sea<00:03:09.470> route<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.890> reason

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
this particular sea route is the reason

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.090 
this particular sea route is the reason
why<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.459> play<00:03:10.790> is<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.060> good<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.890> can<00:03:16.010> see

compress them went on the sea route that

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.789 
compress them went on the sea route that
they<00:03:29.840> couldn't<00:03:30.170> press<00:03:30.290> them<00:03:30.440> they<00:03:30.530> will<00:03:30.620> go<00:03:30.709> up

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
they couldn't press them they will go up

to press them they'll just miss our guy

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.090 
to press them they'll just miss our guy

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
would run right by them and that's why

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.949 
would run right by them and that's why
the<00:03:34.160> play<00:03:34.370> works<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.209> I'll<00:03:35.269> just<00:03:35.330> show<00:03:35.600> this<00:03:35.780> to

you one time obviously the play won't
work<00:03:38.000> at<00:03:38.150> all<00:03:38.209> because<00:03:38.390> they're<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.720> Street

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959
