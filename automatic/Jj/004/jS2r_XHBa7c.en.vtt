00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the menu up so I can only assume I don't

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.930 
the menu up so I can only assume I don't
know<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.069> is<00:02:55.220> where<00:02:55.370> I'm<00:02:55.489> going<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.700> come<00:02:55.849> in

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
are eggs there it was the the gameplay

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.050 
are eggs there it was the the gameplay
that<00:03:33.650> i<00:03:33.709> wanted<00:03:34.069> so<00:03:34.370> that's<00:03:34.549> why<00:03:34.760> it<00:03:34.819> looks<00:03:34.849> a

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
that i wanted so that's why it looks a

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.910 
that i wanted so that's why it looks a
little<00:03:35.180> bit<00:03:35.329> choppy<00:03:35.750> because<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.590> theater

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
little bit choppy because the theater

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.410 
little bit choppy because the theater
mode<00:03:37.010> never<00:03:37.370> looks<00:03:37.549> as<00:03:37.700> smooth<00:03:37.970> as<00:03:38.150> what<00:03:38.299> the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
mode never looks as smooth as what the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.000 
mode never looks as smooth as what the
actual<00:03:38.510> game<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:39.079> but<00:03:39.319> yeah<00:03:39.560> i<00:03:39.709> was<00:03:39.859> really

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
actual game is but yeah i was really

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.680 
actual game is but yeah i was really
pleased<00:03:40.310> about<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.579> and<00:03:41.329> it<00:03:41.420> got<00:03:41.540> me<00:03:41.569> to

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
pleased about that and it got me to

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.599 
pleased about that and it got me to
thinking<00:03:41.810> why<00:03:42.709> can't<00:03:42.739> they<00:03:43.130> just<00:03:43.160> bring

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
thinking why can't they just bring

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.000 
thinking why can't they just bring
theater<00:03:44.060> mount<00:03:44.239> back<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.900> know<00:03:45.019> black<00:03:45.380> ops<00:03:45.650> 3
