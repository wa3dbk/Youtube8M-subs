then<00:00:18.670> there's<00:00:18.940> the<00:00:19.150> deep<00:00:19.330> cleaning<00:00:19.660> of<00:00:19.840> the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
then there's the deep cleaning of the

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.320 
then there's the deep cleaning of the
brewer<00:00:20.170> which<00:00:20.800> we<00:00:21.040> suggest<00:00:21.580> to<00:00:21.730> do<00:00:21.880> as<00:00:22.060> often

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
brewer which we suggest to do as often

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.720 
brewer which we suggest to do as often
as<00:00:22.630> you<00:00:22.750> need<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.200> based<00:00:23.650> on<00:00:23.890> your<00:00:24.490> water

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
as you need to based on your water

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.760 
as you need to based on your water
conditions<00:00:25.360> and<00:00:25.630> there's<00:00:26.170> probably<00:00:26.529> other

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
conditions and there's probably other

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.800 
conditions and there's probably other
things<00:00:27.130> that<00:00:27.340> use<00:00:27.490> water<00:00:27.760> in<00:00:28.090> your<00:00:28.210> house<00:00:28.450> and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
things that use water in your house and

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.880 
things that use water in your house and
you'll<00:00:28.960> know<00:00:29.140> if<00:00:29.380> you<00:00:29.500> have<00:00:29.619> hard<00:00:29.830> water

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
you'll know if you have hard water

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.310 
you'll know if you have hard water
conditions<00:00:30.700> the<00:00:31.360> mineral<00:00:31.750> content<00:00:31.960> will

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
conditions the mineral content will

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.700 
conditions the mineral content will
build<00:00:32.559> up<00:00:32.710> more<00:00:32.950> quickly<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:35.050> some<00:00:35.320> damage

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
build up more quickly and do some damage

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.619 
build up more quickly and do some damage
to<00:00:35.739> the<00:00:36.010> internal<00:00:36.340> system<00:00:36.850> if<00:00:37.059> you<00:00:37.210> don't<00:00:37.420> take

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
to the internal system if you don't take

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:38.250 
to the internal system if you don't take
care<00:00:37.660> of<00:00:37.930> it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
care of it

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.070 
care of it
so<00:00:38.739> it<00:00:39.040> may<00:00:39.250> be<00:00:39.280> every<00:00:39.910> month<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.570> maybe<00:00:40.780> every

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
so it may be every month and maybe every

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.420 
so it may be every month and maybe every
three<00:00:41.410> months<00:00:41.559> that<00:00:41.920> you're<00:00:42.040> gonna<00:00:42.129> want<00:00:42.370> to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
three months that you're gonna want to

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.790 
three months that you're gonna want to
do<00:00:42.550> a<00:00:42.580> deep<00:00:42.850> clean<00:00:43.090> with<00:00:43.270> vinegar<00:00:43.750> so<00:00:43.989> all<00:00:44.559> you

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
do a deep clean with vinegar so all you

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.520 
do a deep clean with vinegar so all you
do<00:00:45.070> this<00:00:45.640> is<00:00:45.820> just<00:00:46.000> regular<00:00:46.150> vinegar<00:00:47.080> it's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
do this is just regular vinegar it's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.170 
do this is just regular vinegar it's
white<00:00:47.739> vinegar<00:00:47.980> but<00:00:48.399> it<00:00:48.520> certainly<00:00:48.940> smells

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
white vinegar but it certainly smells

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.990 
white vinegar but it certainly smells
like<00:00:49.570> vinegar<00:00:49.810> and<00:00:50.200> you<00:00:51.040> pour<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.489> in<00:00:51.850> it

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
like vinegar and you pour that in it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.639 
like vinegar and you pour that in it
acts<00:00:52.210> as<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.540> it's<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:52.989> perfect<00:00:53.380> cleaning

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
acts as the it's the perfect cleaning

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.680 
acts as the it's the perfect cleaning
agent<00:00:54.130> vinegar<00:00:54.610> is<00:00:54.760> safe<00:00:55.030> well<00:00:55.360> it<00:00:55.480> might<00:00:55.660> not

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
agent vinegar is safe well it might not

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.450 
agent vinegar is safe well it might not
have<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.200> most<00:00:56.380> pleasant<00:00:56.620> odor<00:00:56.950> it's<00:00:57.399> a

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
have the most pleasant odor it's a

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.280 
have the most pleasant odor it's a
perfectly<00:00:57.790> safe<00:00:58.090> cleaning<00:00:58.390> agent<00:00:58.840> and<00:00:59.020> one

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
perfectly safe cleaning agent and one

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.840 
perfectly safe cleaning agent and one
that<00:00:59.440> we<00:00:59.559> think<00:00:59.739> does<00:00:59.950> the<00:01:00.070> best<00:01:00.280> job<00:01:00.399> in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
that we think does the best job in

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.930 
that we think does the best job in
helping<00:01:01.660> maintain<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.469> internal<00:01:03.340> components

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
helping maintain the internal components

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.969 
helping maintain the internal components
now<00:01:04.780> this<00:01:04.930> goes<00:01:05.110> through<00:01:05.380> the<00:01:05.470> internal

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
now this goes through the internal

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.940 
now this goes through the internal
system<00:01:06.460> into<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.240> hot<00:01:07.420> water<00:01:07.660> tank<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.530> so

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
system into the hot water tank and so

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.230 
system into the hot water tank and so
it's<00:01:09.100> actually<00:01:09.250> gonna<00:01:09.520> be<00:01:09.610> pressed<00:01:10.030> out

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
it's actually gonna be pressed out

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.109 
it's actually gonna be pressed out
initially<00:01:10.840> was<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.680> hot<00:01:11.860> water<00:01:12.160> that<00:01:13.000> was

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
initially was the hot water that was

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.389 
initially was the hot water that was
inside<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.570> machine<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.710> as<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:15.039> vinegar

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
inside the machine so as the vinegar

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.100 
inside the machine so as the vinegar
comes<00:01:15.700> into<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.119> machine<00:01:16.509> that<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:16.960> what's

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
comes into the machine that is what's

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.500 
comes into the machine that is what's
really<00:01:17.289> helping<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.830> clean<00:01:18.280> some<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.820> lime

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
really helping to clean some of the lime

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.539 
really helping to clean some of the lime
build<00:01:19.810> up<00:01:19.990> mineral<00:01:20.229> deposits<00:01:21.070> that<00:01:21.340> are

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
build up mineral deposits that are

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.800 
build up mineral deposits that are
really<00:01:22.390> inherent<00:01:22.869> in<00:01:22.990> most<00:01:23.369> waters

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
really inherent in most waters

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.359 
really inherent in most waters
and<00:01:25.810> so<00:01:26.049> again<00:01:26.290> we<00:01:26.409> recommend<00:01:26.860> doing<00:01:26.979> this<00:01:27.190> as

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
and so again we recommend doing this as

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.950 
and so again we recommend doing this as
often<00:01:27.580> as<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.000> need<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.299> based<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.780> the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
often as you need to based on the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.000 
often as you need to based on the
condition<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.500> your<00:01:29.670> water<00:01:30.670> supply<00:01:31.560> after<00:01:32.560> you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
condition of your water supply after you

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.620 
condition of your water supply after you
run<00:01:33.430> through<00:01:33.670> vinegar<00:01:34.210> now<00:01:34.420> you're<00:01:34.540> gonna

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
run through vinegar now you're gonna

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.940 
run through vinegar now you're gonna
want<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:34.900> flush<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.140> out<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.560> internal

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
want to flush it out of the internal

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.490 
want to flush it out of the internal
tank<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:37.090> what<00:01:37.240> I<00:01:37.270> have<00:01:37.570> here<00:01:37.600> are<00:01:37.930> some<00:01:37.960> clean

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
tank so what I have here are some clean

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.969 
tank so what I have here are some clean
water<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.280> I'm<00:01:40.000> gonna<00:01:40.119> do<00:01:40.420> as<00:01:40.689> many<00:01:41.500> clean

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
water and I'm gonna do as many clean

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.420 
water and I'm gonna do as many clean
water<00:01:42.250> brews<00:01:42.700> as<00:01:43.590> comfortable<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:45.189> kind<00:01:45.400> of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
water brews as comfortable to kind of

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.990 
water brews as comfortable to kind of
get<00:01:45.670> rid<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.909> that<00:01:46.030> sense<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.259> vinegar<00:01:48.000> hard

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
get rid of that sense of vinegar hard

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.090 
get rid of that sense of vinegar hard
water<00:01:49.299> is<00:01:49.600> not<00:01:49.840> ideal<00:01:50.110> for<00:01:50.560> coffee<00:01:50.799> brewing

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
water is not ideal for coffee brewing

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.399 
water is not ideal for coffee brewing
equipment<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.570> lead<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.810> lime<00:01:53.140> buildup

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409

and<00:01:53.920> impede<00:01:54.460> on<00:01:54.610> your<00:01:54.759> Brewer<00:01:54.970> performance<00:01:55.689> so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
and impede on your Brewer performance so

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.010 
and impede on your Brewer performance so
we<00:01:56.409> highly<00:01:56.770> recommend<00:01:56.970> its<00:01:57.970> frequent<00:01:58.600> again
