there's no randomness it's all legit 1 B
1<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.530> fine<00:02:11.830> but<00:02:12.070> it's<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.250> little<00:02:12.370> more<00:02:12.520> narrow

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
1 is fine but it's a little more narrow

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.490 
1 is fine but it's a little more narrow
2v2<00:02:13.270> really<00:02:13.600> let's<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> characters<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.440> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
2v2 really let's the characters and the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500 
2v2 really let's the characters and the
spaces<00:02:14.860> open<00:02:14.980> up<00:02:15.190> really<00:02:15.400> well<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.390> you're

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
spaces open up really well so you're

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.600 
spaces open up really well so you're
still<00:02:16.750> really<00:02:16.930> playing<00:02:17.290> all-stars<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.550> it's

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
still really playing all-stars but it's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.520 
still really playing all-stars but it's
in<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.210> much<00:02:19.360> more<00:02:19.390> controlled<00:02:19.960> way<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.440> you

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
in a much more controlled way and you

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.990 
in a much more controlled way and you
let<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.800> characters<00:02:21.190> pair<00:02:21.430> together<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.880> all

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
let the characters pair together in all

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.550 
let the characters pair together in all
sorts<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.270> interesting<00:02:22.450> ways<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.380> like

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
sorts of interesting ways and I like

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.380 
sorts of interesting ways and I like
kill<00:02:23.800> them<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.010> rather<00:02:24.160> than<00:02:24.250> time<00:02:24.550> limit<00:02:24.850> then

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
kill them it rather than time limit then

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.520 
kill them it rather than time limit then
you<00:02:25.480> don't<00:02:25.660> play<00:02:25.780> any<00:02:25.930> games<00:02:26.110> with<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.320> clock

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
you don't play any games with the clock

part 2 or something like that that's

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.640 
part 2 or something like that that's
kind<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.750> thing<00:03:01.900> we'd<00:03:02.050> love<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.290> be<00:03:02.410> able<00:03:02.500> to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
kind of thing we'd love to be able to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.410 
kind of thing we'd love to be able to
think<00:03:02.830> about<00:03:02.920> right<00:03:03.670> now<00:03:03.700> just<00:03:04.150> getting<00:03:04.270> that

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
think about right now just getting that

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.150 
think about right now just getting that
Corps<00:03:04.630> combat<00:03:04.840> loop<00:03:05.140> fun<00:03:05.410> making<00:03:06.010> sure<00:03:06.130> all

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
Corps combat loop fun making sure all

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.860 
Corps combat loop fun making sure all
the<00:03:06.220> characters<00:03:06.640> are<00:03:06.730> fun<00:03:06.970> making<00:03:07.660> sure<00:03:07.750> the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
the characters are fun making sure the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.940 
the characters are fun making sure the
game<00:03:07.989> has<00:03:08.170> at<00:03:08.320> least<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.560> little<00:03:08.709> bit<00:03:08.860> of

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
game has at least a little bit of

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.970 
game has at least a little bit of
balance<00:03:09.100> but<00:03:10.090> mostly<00:03:10.540> fun<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.080> it's<00:03:11.800> been

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
balance but mostly fun and it's been

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.830 
balance but mostly fun and it's been
really<00:03:12.130> rad<00:03:12.340> so<00:03:12.550> far<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.030> hopefully<00:03:13.540> next<00:03:13.720> time

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
really rad so far so hopefully next time

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.870 
really rad so far so hopefully next time
so<00:03:14.440> as<00:03:14.620> far<00:03:14.650> as<00:03:14.860> levels<00:03:15.340> go<00:03:15.459> how<00:03:15.610> many<00:03:15.760> guys

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
so as far as levels go how many guys

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.460 
so as far as levels go how many guys
think<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.209> have<00:03:16.330> because<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.630> stages<00:03:16.959> are<00:03:17.080> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
think it have because the stages are the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.229 
think it have because the stages are the
real<00:03:17.650> star<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:17.950> lot<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.580> time<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:18.970> what<00:03:19.120> do<00:03:19.180> we

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
real star a lot of time so what do we

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.870 
real star a lot of time so what do we
think<00:03:19.300> we<00:03:19.630> got<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> 14<00:03:20.770> stages<00:03:21.250> right<00:03:21.400> now<00:03:21.580> but

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
think we got a 14 stages right now but

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.699 
think we got a 14 stages right now but
every<00:03:22.120> stage<00:03:22.360> has<00:03:22.630> sort<00:03:23.020> of<00:03:23.050> multiple<00:03:23.410> parts

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
every stage has sort of multiple parts

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.710 
every stage has sort of multiple parts
so<00:03:23.830> some<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.040> them<00:03:24.190> start<00:03:24.489> in<00:03:24.580> one<00:03:24.700> area<00:03:24.910> go<00:03:25.660> to

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
so some of them start in one area go to

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.840 
so some of them start in one area go to
a<00:03:25.840> different<00:03:26.020> part<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.380> an<00:03:26.500> area<00:03:26.739> we<00:03:27.640> got<00:03:27.760> the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
a different part of an area we got the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.220 
a different part of an area we got the
Alden<00:03:28.120> tower<00:03:28.330> stage<00:03:28.720> where<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.140> basically

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
Alden tower stage where it basically

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.110 
Alden tower stage where it basically
scrolls<00:03:29.830> up<00:03:30.040> that's<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.430> little<00:03:30.610> different<00:03:30.790> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
scrolls up that's a little different and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.340 
scrolls up that's a little different and
then<00:03:31.420> we've<00:03:31.510> got<00:03:31.540> some<00:03:31.810> more<00:03:31.900> corn<00:03:32.110> sort<00:03:32.290> of

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
then we've got some more corn sort of

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.479 
then we've got some more corn sort of
conservative<00:03:32.800> stages<00:03:33.100> that<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.280> think<00:03:33.459> people

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
conservative stages that I think people

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.890 
conservative stages that I think people
who<00:03:33.760> are<00:03:33.820> playing<00:03:34.030> competitively<00:03:34.480> will<00:03:34.720> like

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
who are playing competitively will like

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.050 
who are playing competitively will like
where<00:03:35.770> it's<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.950> little<00:03:35.980> more<00:03:36.250> simple<00:03:36.640> but<00:03:37.030> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
where it's a little more simple but the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.240 
where it's a little more simple but the
stages<00:03:37.480> all<00:03:37.570> mashup<00:03:37.989> two<00:03:38.290> different<00:03:38.590> IPS<00:03:38.860> so

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
stages all mashup two different IPS so

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.729 
stages all mashup two different IPS so
whether<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.120> have<00:03:40.270> uncharted<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.500> bioshock

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
whether you have uncharted and bioshock

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.100 
whether you have uncharted and bioshock
that<00:03:42.640> kind<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:42.910> stuff<00:03:43.120> whether<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:43.540> got<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
that kind of stuff whether you got the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.780 
that kind of stuff whether you got the
infamous<00:03:44.470> series<00:03:44.890> and<00:03:45.280> it's<00:03:45.430> like<00:03:45.580> Cooper

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
infamous series and it's like Cooper

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.460 
infamous series and it's like Cooper
being<00:03:46.150> matched<00:03:46.360> together<00:03:46.570> they<00:03:47.200> do<00:03:47.320> that

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
being matched together they do that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.110 
being matched together they do that
really<00:03:47.620> well<00:03:47.739> but<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.310> level<00:03:48.489> hazards<00:03:48.910> will

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
really well but the level hazards will

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.610 
really well but the level hazards will
never<00:03:49.300> kill<00:03:49.570> you<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:50.020> you<00:03:50.080> can<00:03:50.260> turn<00:03:50.380> them<00:03:50.530> off

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
never kill you so you can turn them off

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.690 
never kill you so you can turn them off
you<00:03:50.890> don't<00:03:51.010> want<00:03:51.130> if<00:03:51.310> you<00:03:51.400> don't<00:03:51.459> want<00:03:51.640> that

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
you don't want if you don't want that

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.040 
you don't want if you don't want that
kind<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.880> randomness<00:03:52.120> I'm<00:03:52.480> talking<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.900> both

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
hardcore guy so I keep flipping it back

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.040 
hardcore guy so I keep flipping it back
and<00:03:57.330> looking<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:58.450> switch<00:03:58.660> back<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:58.870> forth

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050

we've<00:04:56.790> been<00:04:56.910> experimenting<00:04:57.240> with<00:04:57.510> out<00:04:57.750> a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
we've been experimenting with out a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.080 
we've been experimenting with out a
little<00:04:58.020> bit<00:04:58.200> ratchet<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.490> actually<00:04:59.880> pretty

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
little bit ratchet is actually pretty

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.510 
little bit ratchet is actually pretty
solid<00:05:00.540> overall<00:05:00.750> but<00:05:01.140> he's<00:05:01.230> also<00:05:01.410> he's<00:05:02.340> got

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
solid overall but he's also he's got

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.000 
solid overall but he's also he's got
like<00:05:02.760> basically<00:05:03.150> an<00:05:03.360> SPD<00:05:03.780> kind<00:05:04.080> of<00:05:04.169> throw<00:05:04.380> so

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
like basically an SPD kind of throw so

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.730 
like basically an SPD kind of throw so
he<00:05:05.250> sucked<00:05:06.060> gun<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.450> see<00:05:06.630> like<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.930> vacuuming

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
he sucked gun you see like the vacuuming

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.520 
he sucked gun you see like the vacuuming
vacuums<00:05:08.400> you<00:05:08.580> in<00:05:08.730> that<00:05:09.600> has<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.840> range<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.350> like

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
vacuums you in that has a range of like

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.250 
vacuums you in that has a range of like
bat<00:05:10.890> most<00:05:11.310> throw<00:05:11.520> ranges<00:05:11.880> like<00:05:12.030> that<00:05:12.260> although

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
bat most throw ranges like that although

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.659 
bat most throw ranges like that although
we've<00:05:13.470> been<00:05:13.590> changing<00:05:13.919> that<00:05:14.010> as<00:05:14.190> well<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
we've been changing that as well so the

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.250 
we've been changing that as well so the
throw<00:05:14.880> ranges<00:05:15.270> have<00:05:15.390> been<00:05:15.510> moving<00:05:15.990> up<00:05:16.169> a

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
throw ranges have been moving up a

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.680 
throw ranges have been moving up a
little<00:05:16.440> bit<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.800> also<00:05:17.430> your<00:05:18.150> momentum<00:05:18.570> if

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
little bit and also your momentum if

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.240 
little bit and also your momentum if
you're<00:05:18.810> running<00:05:18.930> will<00:05:19.260> carry<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.890> gravel

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
you're running will carry and the gravel

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.830 
you're running will carry and the gravel
extend<00:05:20.940> so<00:05:21.030> it's<00:05:21.180> got<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.330> little<00:05:21.450> easier<00:05:21.780> to

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
extend so it's got a little easier to

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.560 
extend so it's got a little easier to
throw<00:05:22.050> people<00:05:22.200> which<00:05:22.440> is<00:05:22.470> good<00:05:22.940> it's<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.030> good

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
throw people which is good it's a good

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.080 
throw people which is good it's a good
way<00:05:24.690> to<00:05:24.750> sort<00:05:25.229> of<00:05:25.320> slow<00:05:25.500> somebody<00:05:25.830> down<00:05:26.010> if<00:05:26.970> you

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
way to sort of slow somebody down if you

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.190 
way to sort of slow somebody down if you
think<00:05:27.270> they're<00:05:27.390> building<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:27.720> level<00:05:27.960> 3<00:05:28.110> or

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
think they're building to level 3 or

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.980 
think they're building to level 3 or
whatever<00:05:28.410> but<00:05:29.040> right<00:05:29.580> now<00:05:29.760> ratchets<00:05:30.540> probably

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
whatever but right now ratchets probably

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.350 
whatever but right now ratchets probably
the<00:05:31.169> sangeetha<00:05:31.919> range<00:05:32.640> is<00:05:32.760> pretty<00:05:32.790> massive<00:05:33.120> on

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
the sangeetha range is pretty massive on

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.659 
the sangeetha range is pretty massive on
