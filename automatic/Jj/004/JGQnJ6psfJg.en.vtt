to just enlarge the brush and I'm just
painting<00:02:22.200> in<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.490> underpainting<00:02:23.940> layer<00:02:24.470> and

painting in the underpainting layer and
all<00:02:26.640> I'm<00:02:26.850> concerned<00:02:27.390> about<00:02:27.510> here<00:02:28.080> right<00:02:28.350> now

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
all I'm concerned about here right now

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.710 
all I'm concerned about here right now
is<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:29.220> getting<00:02:29.610> coverage<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.360> doesn't

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
is just getting coverage it doesn't

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.140 
is just getting coverage it doesn't
matter<00:02:30.900> what<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.440> looks<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.250> coverage

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
matter what it looks like just coverage

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.910 
matter what it looks like just coverage
is<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.930> important<00:02:34.380> thing

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
is the important thing

tell it where the source data is and
this<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.020> in<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.500> second<00:03:04.950> duplicate<00:03:05.520> layer<00:03:05.760> so

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
this is in the second duplicate layer so

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690 
this is in the second duplicate layer so
let's<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:06.990> click<00:03:07.290> here<00:03:07.680> I'm<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.610> to

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
let's just click here I'm going to

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.790 
let's just click here I'm going to
choose<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> much<00:03:09.270> smaller<00:03:09.630> brush<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.200> time<00:03:10.230> -

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
choose a much smaller brush this time -

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.980 
choose a much smaller brush this time -
I'm<00:03:11.280> going<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.580> choose<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> nice<00:03:12.270> little<00:03:12.570> soft

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
I'm going to choose a nice little soft

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.880 
I'm going to choose a nice little soft
brush<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:14.480> if<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.630> not<00:03:15.810> small<00:03:16.290> enough<00:03:16.590> again

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
brush and if it's not small enough again

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.710 
brush and if it's not small enough again
I'm<00:03:17.010> going<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.280> use<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.640> square<00:03:17.970> bracket<00:03:18.480> keys

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
I'm going to use the square bracket keys

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.530 
I'm going to use the square bracket keys
to<00:03:19.290> make<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.710> smaller<00:03:20.160> or<00:03:20.460> larger<00:03:20.910> as<00:03:21.090> I<00:03:21.120> need

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
to make it a smaller or larger as I need

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.900 
to make it a smaller or larger as I need
to<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.440> as<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.680> can<00:03:22.830> see<00:03:22.890> I'm<00:03:23.310> just<00:03:23.520> shrinking

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
to and as you can see I'm just shrinking

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.940 
to and as you can see I'm just shrinking
the<00:03:24.030> brush<00:03:24.240> as<00:03:24.480> I'm<00:03:24.810> painting<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
the brush as I'm painting and the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.180 
the brush as I'm painting and the
smaller<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.580> make<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.150> brush<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:28.050> more<00:03:28.560> detail

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
smaller I make the brush the more detail

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.660 
smaller I make the brush the more detail
I'm<00:03:29.370> getting<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:29.940> my<00:03:30.120> painting<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.640> all<00:03:32.640> I

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
I'm getting in my painting and all I

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.270 
I'm getting in my painting and all I

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
image I'm trying to do it in a very very

short period of time I'm just going to

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.840 
short period of time I'm just going to
shrink<00:03:52.050> my<00:03:52.200> brush<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:53.310> down<00:03:53.550> nice<00:03:53.820> and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
shrink my brush right down nice and

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.730 
shrink my brush right down nice and
small<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.720> we<00:03:54.810> can<00:03:54.990> see<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.260> bit<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.560> detail

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
small so that we can see a bit of detail

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.190 
small so that we can see a bit of detail
coming<00:03:56.220> through<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:57.420> want<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.720> compromise

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
coming through you want to compromise

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.610 
coming through you want to compromise
with<00:03:58.709> your<00:03:58.920> brush<00:03:59.250> size<00:03:59.550> between<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.959> detail

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
with your brush size between the detail

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.040 
with your brush size between the detail
and<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.980> painterly<00:04:02.670> effect<00:04:02.700> so<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.420> smaller

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
and the painterly effect so to smaller

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.870 
and the painterly effect so to smaller
brush<00:04:04.440> will<00:04:04.680> give<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:04.920> too<00:04:05.160> much<00:04:05.310> details

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
brush will give you too much details

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.340 
brush will give you too much details
that's<00:04:06.090> going<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:06.360> start<00:04:06.570> looking<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:06.930> a

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
that's going to start looking like a

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.920 
that's going to start looking like a
photograph<00:04:07.800> again<00:04:08.250> -<00:04:09.150> bigger<00:04:09.450> brush<00:04:09.720> won't

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
photograph again - bigger brush won't

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.560

give<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.350> enough<00:04:10.740> detail<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:12.209> can<00:04:12.390> use

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
give you enough detail and you can use

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.510 
give you enough detail and you can use
multiple<00:04:12.870> paint<00:04:13.500> layers<00:04:13.770> if<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.160> want<00:04:14.370> to

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
multiple paint layers if you want to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.000 
multiple paint layers if you want to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.340 

do<00:04:20.640> exactly<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:21.210> same<00:04:21.420> as<00:04:21.570> we<00:04:21.750> did<00:04:21.990> for

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
do exactly the same as we did for

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.010 
do exactly the same as we did for
deleting<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.280> layer<00:04:23.520> contents<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.390> then

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
deleting the layer contents and then

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.470 
deleting the layer contents and then

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.040 

you<00:04:34.550> might<00:04:34.759> use<00:04:34.940> different<00:04:34.970> brushes<00:04:35.900> on

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
different layers to get different

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.180 
different layers to get different
amounts<00:04:37.729> of<00:04:38.150> texture<00:04:38.780> in<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.500> important

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
that looks a lot more painterly than a

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.640 
that looks a lot more painterly than a
photograph<00:04:55.700> and<00:04:56.360> we've<00:04:56.780> done<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.170> using<00:04:57.320> the
