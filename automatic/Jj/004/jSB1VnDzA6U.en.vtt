00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.330
 there is already a video where I mentioned 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.500
 engine characteristics but want 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.709
 add 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.810
 maybe I missed something and so 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:20.830
 engine with a displacement of 223 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:28.060
 cubic centimeter is 1 cylinder 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:30.429
 single cylinder engine and here 2 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.400
 here two valves he 2 valve one 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.080
 valve inlet one to release the engine 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.969
 very common for Chinese 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.570
 motorcycles 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.219
 therefore it is often where it occurs and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.149
 problems there for parts and so on 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.120
 should not be 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:51.100
 if they are useful in principle the engine 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:55.800
 behaves very predictably say 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.149
 immediately this is the engine from the brand 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.269
 women are manufacturers 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:05.199
 Chinese motorcycle vipers in principle 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.320
 zone-tan have been working lately 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.540
 together and many motorcycles trading 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.630
 brand viper is available with engines 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.009
 there is a whole line of women there and so 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.009
 the engine in my case is 165 m m m 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.009
 here 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.630
 I'm already on the engine, I basically nothing 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.299
 this is not doing the only thing after 1 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.390
 0 running from 0 to 300 kilometers running 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.720
 I regulated after 300 kilometers 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.000
 valve independently exhibited gaps 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.740
 and everything else is in principle done 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.020
 it is very easy if you know 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.030
 what and where it didn't take very much 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.039
 time everything was adjusted was calm 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.890
 why got into the valve because u 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.770
 Many of my friends had a situation when 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.869
 they bought a new chinese motorcycle 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.759
 the motorcycle is not some of the domes could be 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.270
 just pinched evening went down on 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:12.930
 the factory there is tight enough 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:15.900
 all all the details and therefore can be 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.370
 pressed valve and it immediately threatens 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.870
 that the valve may burn and may be 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.030
 the consequences for the engine are very sad 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.360
 so I decided to play it safe and climbed 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.519
 valve clearance 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.500
 the intake valve was 005 originally with 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:33.180
 of the factory, I just made sure of it, and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.940
 stayed calm let's say a prom 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.610
 I have already adjusted the valve a little 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.200
 I will tell you face values 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.870
 actually about lumen per watt 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.519
 there is a lot of controversy debate I will not 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.590
 you try to offer some version 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.079
 because on the Internet you will find for yourself 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.769
 what kind of option are you? 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.359
 will believe I picked up my 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.459
 so at the outlet valve 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.690
 I will not advise anything here 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.600
 decision 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.440
 for every state it is for that 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.280
 9 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.280
 proper
