it's just injured I think he's had

injury and at this stage of his career

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.810 
injury and at this stage of his career
you<00:01:31.500> know<00:01:31.860> he<00:01:32.009> might<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.189> want<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> do<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
you know he might not want to do that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240 
you know he might not want to do that
but<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.329> think<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.720> also<00:01:33.869> important<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.650> he

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
but I think it's also important that he

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.380 
but I think it's also important that he
never<00:01:35.430> has<00:01:35.579> proven<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.150> win

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

never has proven that they can win
without<00:01:36.540> him<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.470> they<00:01:38.430> don't

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
without him so you know they they don't

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
without him so you know they they don't
they<00:01:38.729> won't<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.090> need<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.450> force<00:01:39.840> him<00:01:40.049> but

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
they won't really need to force him but

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.719 
they won't really need to force him but
you<00:01:40.350> know<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> mean<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:40.950> he's<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.579> sure

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you know I mean if he's there for sure

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:51.440 
you know I mean if he's there for sure
you'll<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.000> able<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.299> help<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.570> team

I've been getting a brief and we're
saying<00:01:54.880> no<00:01:54.970> but<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.210> would<00:01:55.300> seem<00:01:55.450> a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
saying no but that would seem a

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.890
