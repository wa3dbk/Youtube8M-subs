00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.069
 a final result here in mendoza that 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.230
 gives for many condiments because they were 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.719
 many controversial situations where 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.379
 there was a goal in an advanced position where 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.839
 there was a criminal 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.110
 the controversial also sanctioned by 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.410
 trick where according to the place where 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.690
 one can visualize it gives the feeling 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 that buffarini touches the ball first and 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.870
 that the player of godoy crÃºz crashes 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.810
 against that leg of the player who arrives 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.850
 first is but ultimately the referee 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.370
 resolves on the fly and charged the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.320
 criminal where there are two expulsions one I think 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.329
 that is well expelled barriento is a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.539
 stupid nonsense and another one 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.219
 exaggerated second yellow for caruso 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.620
 that as a young man in his time of san 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.510
 lorenzo with 10 but leaving aside 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.159
 all these situations we are going to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.199
 tell them that godoy cross had a first 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.359
 time where he saw what he intends 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.339
 your technician a team that bails towards 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.170
 Go ahead and put the bottom line very 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.120
 near the middle of the court going to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.969
 recover the ball near the area 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.250
 opposite with fliers that recovered and 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.320
 they left fast they joined the attack 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.280
 that they tried to triangulate and from that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.310
 way they generated 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.619
 occasions and a second time where san 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.690
 lorenzo in the pines in the first 20 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.030
 He came out of the passivity he had shown 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.040
 in the first time he decided to go to 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.320
 look for it to unbalance it to the godoy 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.570
 cross to not allow to go out with balls 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.930
 clean and that's where he showed the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.610
 best moments the best passages of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.500
 this game after good they came 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.600
 all these situations that we have 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.610
 commented on odds of godoy crust of 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.580
 expulsions and the goal of the draw 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.070
 in synthesis san lorenzo I think that in a 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.509
 party that was distorted 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.460
 we thought the victory was carried by 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.619
 what he had done in that beginning 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.320
 of the second time godoy cross finished it 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.350
 tying with a controversial criminal one to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.659
 one that divides honors in a party that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.830
 in synthesis and by the management of each one 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.830
 it is good that this is so
