00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
kind of it's the extension part of the

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.799 
kind of it's the extension part of the
chorus<00:00:23.050> that<00:00:23.079> we<00:00:23.380> did<00:00:23.529> earlier<00:00:24.570> followed<00:00:25.570> by

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:25.809 
chorus that we did earlier followed by

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:27.569 
chorus that we did earlier followed by
the<00:00:25.869> main<00:00:26.320> riff<00:00:26.619> so<00:00:27.040> it's<00:00:27.189> basically

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
the main riff so it's basically

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.060 
the main riff so it's basically
backwards<00:00:28.270> from<00:00:28.660> what<00:00:28.899> the<00:00:29.259> second<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:29.980> third

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
backwards from what the second and third

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.609 
backwards from what the second and third
chorus<00:00:30.430> were<00:00:30.700> but<00:00:31.570> you<00:00:31.869> don't<00:00:32.050> do<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.380> whole

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
chorus were but you don't do the whole

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.100 
chorus were but you don't do the whole
main<00:00:32.920> riff<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:34.090> basically<00:00:34.450> play<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.719> very

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
main riff you basically play the very

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.639 
main riff you basically play the very
beginning<00:00:35.620> of<00:00:35.770> the<00:00:36.280> main<00:00:36.460> riff<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:36.790> we<00:00:36.910> have

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
beginning of the main riff so we have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:59.340 
beginning of the main riff so we have
basically<00:00:38.649> just<00:00:38.769> this<00:00:39.219> we<00:00:39.429> have<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.319 

all<00:01:00.309> right<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.609> I<00:01:00.640> think<00:01:00.820> you'd<00:01:01.030> see<00:01:01.149> what's

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
going on here we had that same open G

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.330 
going on here we had that same open G
power<00:01:04.030> chord<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.979> we<00:01:06.130> did<00:01:06.310> in<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:07.110> extended

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
power chord that we did in the extended

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.120 
power chord that we did in the extended
part<00:01:09.340> of<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.520> course<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.259> power

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
part of the course to the a power

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.460 
part of the course to the a power
then<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.869> first<00:01:15.350> part<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:15.979> main<00:01:16.130> riff

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:42.899 

okay<00:01:21.470> so<00:01:21.860> just<00:01:22.009> put<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:22.250> together

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.969

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.490 
this to instead of if we have that big
riff<00:03:03.299> going<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.629> underneath<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.379> you

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
riff going on underneath this if you

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.050 
riff going on underneath this if you
can't<00:03:04.739> do<00:03:04.890> both<00:03:05.099> obviously<00:03:05.519> at<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.700> same<00:03:05.849> time

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
can't do both obviously at the same time

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:18.770 
can't do both obviously at the same time
you<00:03:06.209> can<00:03:06.329> go<00:03:16.549> so<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.579> just<00:03:17.730> kind<00:03:17.909> of<00:03:17.970> doing<00:03:18.569> two

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
you can go so I just kind of doing two

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.920 
you can go so I just kind of doing two
quick<00:03:19.140> hits<00:03:19.409> to<00:03:19.739> start<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.129> and<00:03:20.689> then<00:03:21.689> hit<00:03:21.900> it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
quick hits to start it and then hit it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.759 
quick hits to start it and then hit it
one<00:03:22.230> more<00:03:22.439> time<00:03:22.590> between<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.280> next<00:03:24.769> slide

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
one more time between the next slide

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.670

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
I think if you if you go through all

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.360 
I think if you if you go through all
these<00:03:46.570> parts<00:03:46.960> note-for-note<00:03:47.710> you<00:03:48.010> can<00:03:48.160> really

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
these parts note-for-note you can really

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.650 
these parts note-for-note you can really
