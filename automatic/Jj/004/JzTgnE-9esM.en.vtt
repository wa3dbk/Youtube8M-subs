00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello how about top comic followers I am 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.509
 that 'revenge and welcome again 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.929
 to a video more this time will be a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.809
 little different will be a new section like that

 I hope you like it and good without more 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.730
 we start not please 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.160
 bitter library we'll talk very well 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.800
 of this controversial format that manages 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.740
 televisa editorial will try to see their 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.870
 good points those bad points so 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.850
 without more we begin 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.940
 I learned it from the knowledgeable public of 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.400
 the top comic that told me what opinion 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.660
 have about this format and some 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.360
 of the answers are the following 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.770
 driven deeds says pros has its 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.390
 advantages for anyone who has not 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.580
 read the complete stories and not 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.350
 I would like to spend a lot of money and not even 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.540
 Interested in collecting the ones that are good 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.670
 cons bad print material 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.100
 quality looks like the cowboy book x 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.080
 chose gabriel gÃ³mez does not read me I prefer 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.970
 spend more for the normal edition the 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.680
 truth of the paper is ugly I have not 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.640
 bought none because it makes me very 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 current the paper 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.230
 Hector Quijano says all the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.450
 complainers will say the same without encouragement 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.150
 offending anyone specifically is that the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 role is that the format is that this and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 that my opinion is that many who do not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.659
 we follow the stories and I many that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.610
 its economy was not or is not enough 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.490
 to get the originals it makes me 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.560
 great this format I hope not to offend 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.659
 the detractors of the format since it is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 a simple personal opinion alejandro 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.430
 massa says I do not see it bad before 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.610
 comics were that kind of paper for the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.200
 who did not know him like that though 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.850
 I respect the taste of everyone and I 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.399
 wanted to publish more gas in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 this format that I never was of 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.170
 according to the price that should have 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.820
 cost 15 or 20 pesos less I had him 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.740
 the benefit in the sense of size and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.509
 that you can take it on a trip 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.369
 pocket or even to have it in the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.429
 bathroom ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.319
 Juan Ordaz Fonseca says hello angel 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.509
 all projects are good 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.510
 goes forward are very brave or be 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.360
 you have the courage to be an entrepreneur 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.190
 ok this last one did not have much to do in 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.890
 this topic however is always 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.380
 pretty to ghent 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.300
 make these kinds of comments so 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.000
 Greetings to Mrs. Juan now the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.260
 consequences that this video looks at many 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.910
 thanks for your comment 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.190
 I want to think that those people 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.780
 who had this idea did it 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.030
 thinking about the consumer and his 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.850
 needs I understand those 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.090
 people who suggest that it was was more 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.950
 idea the most suitable that the backs the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.170
 first networks in monster format 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.780
 edition since the library price 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.060
 marvel is 69 pesos the monster 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.709
 edition cost 99 pesos so the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.709
 difference was not so considerable 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.319
 this difference than in the size with 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.239
 this marvel library publication and a 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.310
 comic book thor bad editorial television the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.840
 price if it seems quite excessive 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.769
 I consider 69 pesos to pay 69 pesos 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.870
 for this material is not ideal 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.870
 remember that marvel comics 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.450
 you handle orders by volume so 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.209
 I do not think this product costs more than 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.919
 15 pesos at the most obviously I'm 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.930
 saying this without being an expert in 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.790
 marketing one of the advantages as 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.799
 well mention it from the comments is 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.609
 the size the truth is that you can see it 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.829
 practically in your pocket or in a 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.540
 backpack and you can read it where you 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.939
 want between the sagas that can 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.189
 published we have billboard so if you 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.859
 division among others that are pretty 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.599
 good disadvantages the paper is pretty 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.030
 fragile you have to be careful 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.379
 with this format since in any 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.239
 You can defoliate it 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.110
 accidentally the price is 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.360
 relatively accessible 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.520
 they wear the material very quickly 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.800
 with which it is made is a format that 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.380
 it's useful for collectors like this 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.200
 that televisa editorial returns to this 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.660
 format bringing avengers' versus 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.360
 x-men this is the avengers against 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.820
 men x when I heard this news 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.610
 from marvel mexico the truth is 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.190
 that caused me a certain conflict is more than 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.980
 nothing the way they announced this 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.420
 format which is the following for 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.220
 all those who wondered what 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.200
 had happened with the marvel library 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.900
 one of our most successful products 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.090
 of 2012 that had been publishing 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.520
 monthly we have a great 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.169
 news on next March 11th 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.840
 will launch the first tone under this format 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.660
 the avengers versus which 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.190
 will include from 1 to 6 we know that many 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.650
 readers did not have the opportunity to 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.480
 get the first numbers so 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.250
 this is a great opportunity to read 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.770
 the event that led to the house of the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.750
 ideas to the next marvel now very well not 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.590
 I know you but from the beginning I noticed a 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.689
 slight sarcasm or at least I think what 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.029
 misunderstand 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.849
 it's not the big format that handles 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:56.169
 editorial televisa is very far from the 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.719
 monster edition that is the one that I 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.999
 consider the best format so for 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:02.889
 that is for that simple reason what 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:05.229
 I felt more than a mockery on the part of 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.419
 of them I clarify that I have nothing in 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.159
 Unlike televisa against me 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.769
 It seems that they have done a good job with 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.779
 marvel mexico however the way in 

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:15.849
 they announced it, you do not stop me 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.739
 it seemed the right one very well for 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.749
 finish I just want to tell you that 

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:22.119
 this kind of videos 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:23.769
 they are simply to inform the end 

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:25.509
 the day you have the best of 

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:27.219

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.300
 opinions regarding him and this video 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.069

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.879
