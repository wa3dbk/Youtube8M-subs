strips right there can't really see
they're<00:02:03.730> all<00:02:03.820> black<00:02:04.030> but<00:02:04.900> uh<00:02:04.960> if<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.890> lift<00:02:06.070> this

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
they're all black but uh if I lift this

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.340 
they're all black but uh if I lift this
pedal<00:02:06.520> board<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.610> shake<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.640> or<00:02:10.030> I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
pedal board up and I I shake it or I

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.800 
pedal board up and I I shake it or I
probably<00:02:11.350> wouldn't<00:02:11.680> flip<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:11.980> over<00:02:12.070> but<00:02:12.520> if<00:02:13.510> it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
probably wouldn't flip it over but if it

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.560 
probably wouldn't flip it over but if it
does<00:02:13.930> get<00:02:14.050> move<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.560> pedals<00:02:14.860> won't<00:02:15.040> move

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
does get move the pedals won't move

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.600 
does get move the pedals won't move
they're<00:02:16.570> all<00:02:16.660> fell<00:02:16.840> code<00:02:17.080> but<00:02:17.740> it's<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.250> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
they're all fell code but it's it's the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.800 
they're all fell code but it's it's the
easiest<00:02:18.940> way<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.300> then<00:02:19.390> by<00:02:19.510> your<00:02:19.690> own<00:02:19.780> power

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
easiest way and then by your own power

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.110 
easiest way and then by your own power
supply<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.980> don't<00:02:21.100> need<00:02:21.220> a<00:02:21.250> bipedal<00:02:21.850> board

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
with a power supply so you buy paint

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.620
