00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
able to do that you might be able to

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.300 
able to do that you might be able to
stabilize<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.870> game<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.410> seems<00:03:24.950> like<00:03:25.130> that

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
stabilize the game and seems like that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.190 
stabilize the game and seems like that
now<00:03:25.489> Huck<00:03:25.700> want<00:03:26.060> be<00:03:26.239> more<00:03:26.570> of<00:03:26.720> going<00:03:26.840> for

now Huck want be more of going for

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.289 
now Huck want be more of going for
immortals<00:03:27.680> going<00:03:28.310> for<00:03:28.549> those<00:03:28.700> colossi

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
immortals going for those colossi

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.000 
immortals going for those colossi
they're<00:03:29.510> going<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.780> be<00:03:29.870> very<00:03:30.200> needed<00:03:30.560> against

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
they're going to be very needed against

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.099 
they're going to be very needed against
this<00:03:31.100> marine<00:03:31.459> marauder<00:03:31.609> wall<00:03:32.090> also<00:03:32.900> getting

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
this marine marauder wall also getting

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.110 
this marine marauder wall also getting
the<00:03:33.200> extended<00:03:33.709> thermal<00:03:34.100> Lance<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.459> very<00:03:34.880> useful

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
the extended thermal Lance a very useful

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.750 
the extended thermal Lance a very useful
upgrade<00:03:35.750> one<00:03:36.320> of<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:36.650> finest<00:03:37.250> ones<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
upgrade one of the finest ones in the

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.490 
upgrade one of the finest ones in the
game<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:37.970> would<00:03:38.120> say<00:03:38.420> they're<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.170> effective

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
game I would say they're so effective

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.890 
game I would say they're so effective
for<00:03:39.739> colossi<00:03:40.400> helped<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.150> much<00:03:41.329> to<00:03:41.540> keep<00:03:41.690> them

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
for colossi helped so much to keep them

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.720 
for colossi helped so much to keep them
on<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.200> back<00:03:42.350> of<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.680> main<00:03:42.859> force<00:03:43.160> so<00:03:43.579> they

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
on the back of the main force so they

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.430 
on the back of the main force so they
don't<00:03:43.850> get<00:03:44.060> completely<00:03:44.570> focused<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:45.260> shot

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
don't get completely focused and shot

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.039 
don't get completely focused and shot

would<00:04:13.760> be<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:14.180> much<00:04:14.389> effective<00:04:14.959> but<00:04:15.500> well<00:04:16.010> we

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
would be so much effective but well we

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.039 
would be so much effective but well we
have<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.640> play<00:04:16.849> with<00:04:17.030> what<00:04:17.239> we<00:04:17.419> got<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.780> Huck

have to play with what we got and Huck
went<00:04:18.289> for<00:04:18.470> this<00:04:18.620> build<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.519> sequence<00:04:19.940> so

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
went for this build and the sequence so

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.819 
went for this build and the sequence so
hopefully<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:20.870> going<00:04:20.989> to<00:04:21.140> get<00:04:21.260> some<00:04:21.530> more

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
hopefully is going to get some more

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.499 
hopefully is going to get some more

I<00:05:01.610> would<00:05:01.789> say<00:05:01.969> and<00:05:02.150> now<00:05:02.539> here<00:05:02.780> comes<00:05:03.020> big<00:05:03.590> push

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
I would say and now here comes big push

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.170 
I would say and now here comes big push
into<00:05:03.949> the<00:05:04.039> base<00:05:04.280> i'm<00:05:04.400> going<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.639> take<00:05:04.759> the<00:05:04.909> HP

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180

as<00:07:50.160> you<00:07:50.250> guys<00:07:50.430> can<00:07:50.610> see<00:07:50.670> he<00:07:51.210> was<00:07:51.390> making<00:07:51.780> a

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 
as you guys can see he was making a

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.960 
as you guys can see he was making a
colossus<00:07:52.500> he<00:07:52.680> had<00:07:52.860> the<00:07:53.010> Colossus<00:07:53.520> by<00:07:53.700> the<00:07:53.760> way

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:53.970 
colossus he had the Colossus by the way

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.770 
colossus he had the Colossus by the way
and<00:07:54.240> then<00:07:55.050> well<00:07:55.650> it's<00:07:56.040> completely

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:56.780 
and then well it's completely

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.360 
and then well it's completely
overwhelmed<00:07:57.780> by<00:07:57.900> the<00:07:57.960> forces<00:07:58.380> from<00:07:58.650> from

00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.370 
overwhelmed by the forces from from

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.090 
overwhelmed by the forces from from
makkah<00:07:59.610> makkah<00:07:59.880> was<00:08:00.150> even<00:08:00.420> making<00:08:00.750> a<00:08:00.870> nuke<00:08:01.100> so

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:02.100 
makkah makkah was even making a nuke so

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.090 
makkah makkah was even making a nuke so
this<00:08:02.700> is<00:08:02.850> basically<00:08:03.000> it<00:08:03.480> maka<00:08:04.140> just<00:08:04.500> trampled

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:05.100 
this is basically it maka just trampled

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.580 
this is basically it maka just trampled
brute-force<00:08:05.790> attack<00:08:06.180> out<00:08:06.450> of<00:08:06.480> this<00:08:06.720> match<00:08:06.960> we

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:07.590 
brute-force attack out of this match we

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.320 
brute-force attack out of this match we
did<00:08:07.770> sheer<00:08:08.040> amount<00:08:08.310> of<00:08:08.490> forces<00:08:08.910> that<00:08:08.940> he<00:08:09.150> had

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.330 
did sheer amount of forces that he had

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.510 
did sheer amount of forces that he had
this<00:08:10.080> is<00:08:10.290> the<00:08:10.380> first<00:08:10.620> match<00:08:10.860> of<00:08:10.890> the<00:08:11.190> series
