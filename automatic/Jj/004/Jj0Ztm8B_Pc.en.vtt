believe<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:08.390> real<00:01:09.390> nice<00:01:09.600> stocks<00:01:10.050> look<00:01:10.500> just

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
believe it is real nice stocks look just

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.520 
believe it is real nice stocks look just
like<00:01:10.800> any<00:01:11.009> browning<00:01:11.539> cut<00:01:12.539> the<00:01:12.690> browning<00:01:13.140> boss

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
like any browning cut the browning boss

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.850 
like any browning cut the browning boss
system<00:01:14.039> which<00:01:14.869> helps<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.020> recoil<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.649> whole

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
system which helps with recoil a whole

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.529 
system which helps with recoil a whole
lot<00:01:17.069> kind<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> makes<00:01:17.910> it<00:01:18.060> louder<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
lot kind of makes it louder it is

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.059 
lot kind of makes it louder it is
adjustable<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:20.729> believe<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.569> a<00:01:21.690> force<00:01:22.440> for

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
adjustable I believe it's a force for

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.930 
adjustable I believe it's a force for
shot<00:01:23.840> box<00:01:24.840> magazine<00:01:25.470> actually<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.700> plate

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
has the Bucks magazine attached it's an

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.109 
has the Bucks magazine attached it's an
