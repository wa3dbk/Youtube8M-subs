actually put him to go back in the crow

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.440 
actually put him to go back in the crow
that<00:02:27.200> he<00:02:27.290> does<00:02:27.440> not<00:02:27.470> again<00:02:28.370> he<00:02:29.000> goes<00:02:29.120> for<00:02:29.390> the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
that he does not again he goes for the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.140 
that he does not again he goes for the
hopeless<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.580> that's<00:02:31.580> if<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.820> went<00:02:31.970> for<00:02:32.090> her

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
hopeless and that's if I went for her

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.180 
hopeless and that's if I went for her
who<00:02:32.300> got<00:02:32.450> probably<00:02:32.690> taken<00:02:33.080> him<00:02:33.170> out<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.530> but

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
who got probably taken him out and but

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.370 
who got probably taken him out and but
he<00:02:34.520> just<00:02:34.790> he's<00:02:35.390> bank<00:02:35.720> out<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.900> fact<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.350> was

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
he just he's bank out of fact I was

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.990 
he just he's bank out of fact I was
gonna<00:02:36.560> overplay<00:02:37.070> for<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.370> crow<00:02:37.580> bad<00:02:37.790> so

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
gonna overplay for that crow bad so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.790 
gonna overplay for that crow bad so
that's<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:38.450> what<00:02:38.600> happened<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.020> just<00:02:39.560> opted

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
that's just what happened I just opted

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.470 
that's just what happened I just opted
to<00:02:39.920> go<00:02:39.950> first<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.640> again<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.000> figured<00:02:41.420> me

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
to go first on it again I figured me

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.850 
to go first on it again I figured me
look<00:02:41.600> at<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> creek<00:02:42.050> or<00:02:42.200> take<00:02:42.440> him<00:02:42.530> out<00:02:42.650> he<00:02:42.770> has

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
look at a creek or take him out he has

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.590 
look at a creek or take him out he has
no<00:02:42.980> recovery<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:43.640> that's<00:02:43.820> radical<00:02:44.150> but<00:02:44.510> he

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
no recovery so that's radical but he

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.690 
no recovery so that's radical but he
goes<00:02:44.720> for<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.930> flamethrower<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.709> guess<00:02:46.040> he<00:02:46.220> has<00:02:46.310> a

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
goes for a flamethrower I guess he has a

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.880 
goes for a flamethrower I guess he has a
he<00:02:47.209> he<00:02:47.420> was<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.690> GBA<00:02:47.989> season<00:02:48.290> one<00:02:48.500> two<00:02:48.739> and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
he he was in the GBA season one two and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.470 
he he was in the GBA season one two and
three<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.160> he<00:02:49.400> he<00:02:49.760> brought<00:02:49.970> some<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.270> its<00:02:50.360> own

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480
