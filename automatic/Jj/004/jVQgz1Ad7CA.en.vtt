 in that displaces the state displaces and does not 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.720
 there are those who guarantee the protection of 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.360
 rights of communities and that's why 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.519
 this community declared disobedience 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.519
 and permanent civil resistance 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.460
 yes 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.350
 it is normal that in a project of this 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.150
 nature there are always people not 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.460
 agree but let's remember that it is 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.290
 a project of national interest to 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.130
 guarantee the energy supply 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.630
 electric for the country the color of 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.980
 same voice in my song I continue 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.629
 of the sea water 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.730
 we are not going to leave the 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.140
 territory we are going to stay here and if 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.120
 They want to come and take us out 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.950
 they will have to take out this belongs to us and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.019
 if they are going to take us peacefully we are going to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.909
 resist let's go to the last 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.560
 moment to not allow ourselves to be taken out 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.060
 of what belongs to us 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.950
 then we stay in the river 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.450
 we remain on the earth is what 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.450
 we are doing that is disobeying
