00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:07.859

from<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.829> point<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:20.159> driveshaft<00:01:20.850> will<00:01:21.299> go

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
from this point the driveshaft will go

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.690 
from this point the driveshaft will go
into<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.780> transfer<00:01:22.679> case<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.310> basically

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
into a transfer case that basically

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.719 
into a transfer case that basically
takes<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.420> power<00:01:24.630> from<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> engines<00:01:25.829> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
takes the power from the engines and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
takes the power from the engines and
leads<00:01:26.969> them<00:01:27.119> back<00:01:27.149> this<00:01:27.509> way<00:01:27.719> so<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.679> have

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
leads them back this way so we have

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.709 
leads them back this way so we have
upper<00:01:29.880> driveshaft

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
upper driveshaft

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.230
