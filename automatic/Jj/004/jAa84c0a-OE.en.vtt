00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.909
 not really 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.339
 speaking to saint-matrÃ© animals am not passionate about animals 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.999
 in the sense in the coming months 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.990
 I'm very happy 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.239
 easy with animals 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.480
 johan djourou 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.620
 she will be present at this break 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.620
 I try to analyze that and I know why I have a problem 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.430
 when I was a kid myself I grew up in Morocco 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 the time of the dogs of the cats that was not allowed 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.490
 a most competitive team 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.810
 we do not know where they come from 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.160
 but in fact it was not animals could leave the site 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.490
 Gbagbo 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.570
 I was looking at this thing like that where 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.080
 I am my wife 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.500
 I am in the mood to feel that the steering wheel we have in charge by oneself 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 all my affection without bounds 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.600
 every time we make a living with his baton opens on a shoot of 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.870
 movie 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.830
 20h at home 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 an interview granted to South 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.740
 a long time in prisons 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.250
 immediately our victory to each sensor 3mos supporters sponsors a shot 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.710
 look 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.710
 so I ran off from what's going on 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.650
 save the queen is sung live in paris 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.510
 shepard in danger 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.060
 that damn 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.909
 and the orchestrations me it relaxes me it's a bit what I observe all this 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 pretty enough sensual class 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.080
 its shareholding 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.980

 often doubled a marble for movies for the film I do regularly 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.639
 more than 3,500 came to me 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.549
 w 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.559
 someone else competing for the first time a bear is really the 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:28.549
 first time 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.829
 it's really interesting it's funny 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.699
 it is necessary especially densifies dollars 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:34.349
 this saturday june 5th 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.349
 I do not ask to go to the woods 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.259
 the agenaises 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.519

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.709
 while being stupefied lisa change but we saw no problem 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.479
 finally it's over 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.169
 for what is a pity 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.699
 every year it's rebelote with the help of non methods that there was act and has 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.870
 considered that light 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.839
 men are being studied 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.119
 what price 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.119
 and bpce are morally what happens to me 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.529
 national commemoration safeguard 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.529
 nature and the animals that they know how to wean themselves 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.049
 provinces more 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.049
 with France 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.909
 there was a time when the public could leave more 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.909
 we see all the following days like this 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.799
 thomas sept 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.819
 this is my heart and my movie and if you ever had them 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.110
 in case she is in her eighth 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.359
 three men are accused for example the day 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.569
 to say that I chose Spain remains a party or an animal in two times a weight 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.569
 will be 100% trouble-free 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.719
 it must be remembered that the animal revolt by m 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:18.599
 the same same same 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.680
 fresh alassania 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.800
 his wise I'm pretty 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.229
 shiny in the honey movie 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.229
 we say it's really meaningful 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.050
 by decades ducks 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.129
 I must also be ready 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.340
 one can be stopped at the high poverty line while praying that m 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.150
 reality 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.190
 but what will change the helmet for him that for later of course we 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.479
 may go pedaling with a dog or with a blowtorch 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.909
 it's also a lot of people by jean-paul ii 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.300
 the party killed harry redknapp 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.300
 now I'm not talking about ball as if their choice 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.460
 if that name so young 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.690
 no it'll take a hot bath of the year on the second round of the tournament 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.719
 open source 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.770
 let's start with the beefier do not have a lot of skepticism 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.059
 but for now the aquarium 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:23.669
 it's super passive 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.229
 the frame of the pnr with m the next day 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.009
 their recipe of what to go to work a period the tone goes up the aquarium and 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:30.949
 it weighs 9 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:31.850
 the same meaning before 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.850
 when I write I look 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.569
 You have to be patient 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.650
 in fact you have to play very well 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.509
 and the concept 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.789
 tsonga that pushed me to do it and I can even ticket on the platform as 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:48.530
 I am used to it 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.020
 for the same reasons that escape me but this beautiful growth is that 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.219
 you talk to them about growth 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.569
 road transport no more than that in order to save the club 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.800
 it's a counter are planned with the little secrets of small woes 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.339
 that she falls from their father 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:04.089
 currently several months 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:05.589
 however quite offbeat 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:08.969
 I'm afraid we'll hear all this is just a series of nickel complaints 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.969
 among the agents is no longer than 1,330 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.110
 Tony Parker 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.909
 it's funny it's quite acceptable that you could see him at 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.749
 Hockey club doctor called arthuis arthuis 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:32.599
 it's been a good job before m blocking access by surpluses 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.650
 this one the maize herself no longer start working separately 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:38.499
 no 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:41.499
 it means that as soon as you think you've set the tone 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:43.799
 nobody
