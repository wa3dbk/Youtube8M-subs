things that we did see in the sonar we

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.900 
things that we did see in the sonar we

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
started realizing that most of them were

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.819 
started realizing that most of them were
boats<00:02:34.510> or<00:02:34.840> ships<00:02:38.280> we<00:02:39.280> have<00:02:39.610> found<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.829> wonderful

the same interest in the history of the

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.550 
the same interest in the history of the
lake<00:02:49.569> I<00:02:53.850> was<00:02:54.850> not<00:02:55.060> diving<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.900> wrecks<00:02:56.139> of<00:02:56.319> Lake

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
lake I was not diving the wrecks of Lake

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.129 
lake I was not diving the wrecks of Lake
Union<00:02:57.010> before<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.819> survey<00:02:58.269> began<00:02:58.450> just

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
Union before the survey began just

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.229 
Union before the survey began just
because<00:02:59.500> diving<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.010> lake<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.430> illegal<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.060> do

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
because diving the lake is illegal to do

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.270 
because diving the lake is illegal to do
frankly<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.440> didn't<00:03:02.709> even<00:03:02.829> think<00:03:03.069> there<00:03:03.190> was

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
frankly I didn't even think there was

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.789 
frankly I didn't even think there was
anything<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.989> historical<00:03:04.989> significance<00:03:05.200> in

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
anything of historical significance in

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.410 
anything of historical significance in
the<00:03:05.920> lake<00:03:06.099> so<00:03:06.730> we<00:03:06.849> never<00:03:06.970> even<00:03:07.120> thought<00:03:07.359> about

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
the lake so we never even thought about

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.890 
the lake so we never even thought about
getting<00:03:07.840> in<00:03:07.959> here<00:03:09.690> knowing<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.720> people

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
getting in here knowing that people

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.449 
getting in here knowing that people
aren't<00:03:11.169> technically<00:03:11.680> allowed<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.099> dive<00:03:12.280> in

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
aren't technically allowed to dive in

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.190 
aren't technically allowed to dive in
the<00:03:12.549> lake<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:12.880> found<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.209> kind<00:03:13.359> of<00:03:13.450> interesting

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
the lake we found it kind of interesting

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.360 
the lake we found it kind of interesting
and<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.410> there'd<00:03:14.560> probably<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:14.919> things<00:03:15.190> to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
and that there'd probably be things to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.000 
and that there'd probably be things to
find<00:03:15.609> and<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.209> know<00:03:16.299> things<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.630> document<00:03:17.230> we

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
find and you know things a document we

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.620 
find and you know things a document we
got<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.190> target

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
got a target

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.140 
got a target
we<00:03:19.990> know<00:03:20.140> it<00:03:20.260> won<00:03:20.460> and<00:03:21.460> so<00:03:21.490> that's<00:03:21.790> what<00:03:21.910> we<00:03:22.000> did

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
we know it won and so that's what we did

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.880 
we know it won and so that's what we did
we<00:03:22.330> kind<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.570> visualize<00:03:22.990> how<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.380> lake<00:03:23.680> was

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
we kind of visualize how the lake was

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
we kind of visualize how the lake was
100<00:03:24.280> years<00:03:24.430> ago

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
100 years ago

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.430 
100 years ago
and<00:03:25.000> where<00:03:25.570> things<00:03:25.810> were<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.230> then<00:03:26.320> we're

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
and where things were and then we're

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.500 
and where things were and then we're
able<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.680> go<00:03:26.830> down<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.640> basically<00:03:27.940> find<00:03:28.270> those

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
able to go down and basically find those

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.450 
able to go down and basically find those
items<00:03:28.720> based<00:03:29.200> on<00:03:29.470> where<00:03:29.830> you<00:03:30.130> know<00:03:30.220> things

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
items based on where you know things

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.240 
items based on where you know things
were<00:03:30.520> located<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:35.380> steps<00:03:35.650> we<00:03:35.860> take<00:03:36.070> when<00:03:36.220> we

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
were located the steps we take when we

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.690 
were located the steps we take when we
come<00:03:36.880> across<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.180> shipwreck<00:03:37.720> first<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:39.280> take<00:03:39.640> a

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
come across a shipwreck first we take a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.550 
come across a shipwreck first we take a
tape<00:03:39.970> measure<00:03:40.000> Minh<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.750> wreck<00:03:40.960> so<00:03:41.200> we'll<00:03:41.380> do

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
tape measure Minh the wreck so we'll do

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.740 
tape measure Minh the wreck so we'll do
the<00:03:41.860> full<00:03:42.100> length<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.700> wreck<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.210> then

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
the full length of the wreck and then

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.720 
the full length of the wreck and then
we'll<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.170> beam<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.650> wreck<00:03:44.920> after

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
we'll do the beam of the wreck after

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.510 
we'll do the beam of the wreck after
that<00:03:46.360> we<00:03:46.600> start<00:03:46.930> looking<00:03:46.990> at<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.680> key<00:03:47.950> areas

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
that we start looking at the key areas

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.710 
that we start looking at the key areas
for<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:49.000> name<00:03:50.970> there's<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.030> name<00:03:52.300> it's<00:03:52.510> pretty

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
for a name there's a name it's pretty

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.200 
for a name there's a name it's pretty
easy<00:03:52.900> we<00:03:53.350> we<00:03:53.830> can<00:03:53.980> identify<00:03:54.100> using<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.970> we

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
easy we we can identify using that we

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.880 
easy we we can identify using that we
can<00:03:55.360> then<00:03:55.510> go<00:03:55.660> through<00:03:55.900> our<00:03:56.020> caves<00:03:56.290> where<00:03:56.770> they

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
can then go through our caves where they

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.800 
can then go through our caves where they
have<00:03:57.070> photos<00:03:57.550> they<00:03:57.850> have<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.180> history<00:03:58.480> on<00:03:58.660> the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
have photos they have the history on the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.790 
have photos they have the history on the
wrecks<00:04:00.240> once<00:04:01.240> we<00:04:01.450> know<00:04:01.690> what<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.260> boat<00:04:02.530> is

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
wrecks once we know what the boat is

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.460 
wrecks once we know what the boat is
what<00:04:03.280> type<00:04:03.550> of<00:04:03.580> thing<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:04.090> was<00:04:04.270> in<00:04:04.660> even<00:04:04.990> the

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
what type of thing it was in even the

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.190 
what type of thing it was in even the
specific<00:04:06.090> vessel<00:04:07.090> then<00:04:07.360> we<00:04:07.480> can<00:04:07.630> start<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.050> get

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
specific vessel then we can start to get

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.410 
specific vessel then we can start to get
it<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.410> history<00:04:08.890> we<00:04:09.700> can<00:04:09.850> start<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.270> learn

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
it to history we can start to learn

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.480 
it to history we can start to learn
about<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.840> people<00:04:11.290> who<00:04:11.530> were<00:04:11.680> involved<00:04:12.040> with

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
about the people who were involved with

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.270 
about the people who were involved with
it<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.350> really<00:04:14.350> kind<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.680> bring<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.100> boat

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
it and really kind of bring the boat

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.520 
it and really kind of bring the boat
back<00:04:15.550> to<00:04:16.030> life<00:04:18.780> probably<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.230> most

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
back to life probably the most

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.580 
back to life probably the most
interesting<00:04:21.690> wreck<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:22.960> we<00:04:23.110> have<00:04:23.260> done

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
interesting wreck that we have done

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.420 
interesting wreck that we have done
would<00:04:23.860> be<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.610> gypsy<00:04:24.940> Queen<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.890> Gypsy<00:04:27.280> queen

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
would be the gypsy Queen the Gypsy queen

changes my relationship with the lake
and<00:05:43.199> it<00:05:43.590> changes<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.550> way<00:05:45.210> that<00:05:45.419> I<00:05:45.479> perceive

it it makes it much more lively it makes

it it makes it much more lively it makes
it<00:05:48.810> not<00:05:48.960> so<00:05:49.169> much<00:05:49.229> big<00:05:49.949> empty<00:05:50.250> space

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.160 

some<00:05:55.820> of<00:05:55.910> the<00:05:55.970> vessels<00:05:56.360> just<00:05:56.600> have<00:05:56.720> great

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
some of the vessels just have great

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.760 
some of the vessels just have great
stories<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.220> there's<00:05:58.640> hundreds<00:05:59.480> if<00:05:59.630> not

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
stories and there's hundreds if not

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.290 
stories and there's hundreds if not
thousands<00:06:00.770> of<00:06:00.950> those<00:06:01.550> stories<00:06:01.940> under<00:06:02.180> the

thousands of those stories under the

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.950 
thousands of those stories under the

that<00:06:06.320> scientists<00:06:07.100> or<00:06:07.480> historians<00:06:08.480> can

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
that scientists or historians can

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.620 
that scientists or historians can
examine<00:06:09.410> but<00:06:09.740> I<00:06:09.800> think<00:06:10.100> it's<00:06:10.430> even<00:06:10.880> better<00:06:10.910> to

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
examine but I think it's even better to

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.170 
examine but I think it's even better to
be<00:06:11.960> able<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.260> get<00:06:12.530> at<00:06:12.680> these<00:06:12.890> stories<00:06:13.460> about

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
be able to get at these stories about

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.860 
be able to get at these stories about
Seattle<00:06:15.020> maritime<00:06:15.740> heritage<00:06:15.950> I<00:06:16.720> think<00:06:17.720> the

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
Seattle maritime heritage I think the

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.590 
Seattle maritime heritage I think the
story<00:06:18.230> will<00:06:18.530> go<00:06:18.740> on<00:06:19.010> and<00:06:19.460> on<00:06:19.610> for<00:06:19.940> a<00:06:19.970> long<00:06:20.240> time

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
story will go on and on for a long time

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.860 
story will go on and on for a long time
and<00:06:20.930> will<00:06:21.500> become<00:06:21.680> a<00:06:22.100> legend<00:06:22.970> of<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.630> lake

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
and will become a legend of the lake

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.140 
and will become a legend of the lake
that<00:06:24.230> everybody<00:06:25.040> wants<00:06:25.580> to<00:06:25.640> tell<00:06:25.880> everybody

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
that everybody wants to tell everybody

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.250 
that everybody wants to tell everybody
else<00:06:26.570> about<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:29.240> me<00:06:29.390> it's<00:06:29.540> like<00:06:29.810> treasure

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
else about to me it's like treasure

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.410 
else about to me it's like treasure
hunting<00:06:30.680> I<00:06:30.830> don't<00:06:31.160> get<00:06:31.430> the<00:06:31.550> payoff<00:06:31.760> a<00:06:31.940> find<00:06:32.300> a

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
hunting I don't get the payoff a find a

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.330 
hunting I don't get the payoff a find a
bucket<00:06:32.600> of<00:06:32.810> gold<00:06:33.050> but<00:06:33.560> I<00:06:33.590> do<00:06:33.680> get<00:06:33.890> the<00:06:34.010> payoff

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
bucket of gold but I do get the payoff

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.550 
bucket of gold but I do get the payoff
of<00:06:34.370> finding<00:06:35.000> an<00:06:35.090> old<00:06:35.270> wreck<00:06:35.630> that<00:06:35.960> no<00:06:36.350> one's

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
of finding an old wreck that no one's

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.980 
of finding an old wreck that no one's
seen<00:06:36.830> since<00:06:37.160> the<00:06:37.280> 1800s<00:06:37.730> or<00:06:38.090> the<00:06:38.150> early<00:06:38.390> 1900s

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
seen since the 1800s or the early 1900s

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.510 
seen since the 1800s or the early 1900s
so<00:06:39.470> that's<00:06:39.680> what<00:06:39.890> I<00:06:39.980> see<00:06:40.250> when<00:06:40.280> I<00:06:40.460> get

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
so that's what I see when I get

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.430 
so that's what I see when I get
underwater<00:06:41.060> here<00:06:41.420> in<00:06:41.510> Lake<00:06:41.660> Ian<00:06:41.900> I<00:06:42.110> see<00:06:42.320> the

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
underwater here in Lake Ian I see the

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.030 
underwater here in Lake Ian I see the
history<00:06:42.890> of<00:06:43.070> where<00:06:43.580> I<00:06:43.610> live
