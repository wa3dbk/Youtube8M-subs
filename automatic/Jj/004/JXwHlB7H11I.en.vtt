00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hi everyone, guys, welcome to this 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.040
 video 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.679
 I am 17 and I am here today irreducible 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.360
 and I think in preview I think I'm one 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.590
 of the first Italian videos to talk to you 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.430
 of the keynote that has just concluded from 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.070
 part of the apple 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.769
 we actually followed the live 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.359
 through space and now I want to do 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.949
 a little brief to you for 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.240
 explain to me a little about what he presented 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.340
 apple today 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.179
 then first of all let's talk about ios 7 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.700
 that the new operating system 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.309
 presented by apple and I think by now 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.649
 all you know will be released to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.040

 September 16th so there are six left 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.809
 days at the exit of s7 help is the thing 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.190
 more beautiful in my opinion than this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 presentation and the fact that the suite 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 how highlife they say of the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.100
 apple then to the work that not and come 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.530

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 inside the macs are i come in 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.000

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.799
 ios 7 installation you will have the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.750
 possibility to use all these 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.869
 Apple apps that you pay for 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.640
 you can use a lot of money up to now 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.829
 for free this is a great one 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 what because you save really beautiful 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.140
 soldini then ios 7 will be released on the 16th 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 September 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.030
 today we say apple contravening everything 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.560
 what was the concept of apple when 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.520
 he was still alive steve jobs presented 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 two iphone and finally presented 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.340
 I think the economic iPhone finally 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.759
 as you can see the iphone 5 c 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.060
 what is this iphone 5 c the iphone 5 c 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.299
 it is nothing but the iPhone 5 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.659
 then the current iphone 5 with a body 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.110
 in polycarbonate plastic and and with 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.110
 various colors 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.670
 now let's see 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:17.670
 white hair and let's say you see 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.129
 they also made these nice ones 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.650
 rubber housings and so this 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.170
 iphone 5 there will be an iphone 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.340
 let's say an iphone 5 with some 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.709
 improvements because it will have a battery 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.180
 a little bit better now I don't know 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.790
 because the site was opened in English 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.930
 but let's see if I can find it 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.650
 here here then how it sees is the site is 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.599
 however overloaded with an a6 chip and one 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.079
 then 8 megapixel camera will have the 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.849
 same room as the iPhone 5 and will have a 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.889
 processor like the briante one will be a 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.639
 iphone 5 but in a more economical version 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:56.790
 and the iphone 5 will be withdrawn from the 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:00.280
 trade will now be sold 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.400
 the 8 giga iphone 4s the iphone 5 c is 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.040
 the iphone 5 s what is the iphone 5 s 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.260
 boys the iPhone 5 is the real one 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.299
 apple innovation 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.349
 first of all let's start with our own things 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.760
 earth earth 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.790
 Apple introduced a new coupe 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.709
 coloring that is and is beautiful and is 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.400
 this breakfast called him gold 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.989
 so it will be white black and gold 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.659
 this coloring here then how 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.359
 you can see the flash has been changed 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:33.549
 it will be a flash with a double LED flash 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:35.680
 one above and one below then indeed 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.400
 here we see that he talks about the double flash 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.680
 led and iphone 5 will have the same 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.530
 megapixel of the previous model 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.720
 so it will have 8 megapixels but raam will have a 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.340
 focal length from 2.2 then a 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.340
 improved focal aperture 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.900
 I said not only will it have a focal aperture 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.610
 improved but will also have a la 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.390
 ability to shoot videos not a 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.500
 1080p but 720p at 100 frames for 120 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.870
 frames per second 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.180
 therefore it gives the possibility to make 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.100
 slow motion 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.590
 other thing will change the home key not 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.329
 we will have the usual curved home button 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.000
 with the picture of a centrone montas tom 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.829
 plate with this decorative ring the 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.580
 home button will be one of the largest 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.100
 surprises we say there have been up 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.870
 these do because the home button will be 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.360
 a home button with the possibility of 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.160
 recite the fingerprints so not 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.600
 will need more slide to unlock for 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.460
 unlock the phone lower 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.630
 place any thumb on the thumb 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.250
 finger you want 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.930
 in this part of the screen here he 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.140
 read has always anti trip there the 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.050
 phone and you will unlock something else 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.520
 presented the processor at 7 and the first 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.190
 iphone 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.400
 the first iphone with operating system a 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:58.210
 64 bits no longer 32 bits like i 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:05.380
 previous ones have been redesigned 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:08.169
 components to be adapted to the s7 and e 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.160
 I think it's all boys of course either 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:15.430
 the iphone 5 c that the iphone 5 are 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.440
 compatible with technology technology 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.030
