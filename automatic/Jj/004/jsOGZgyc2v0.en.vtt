October in November of 2010 American
Heart<00:00:22.890> Association<00:00:23.240> came<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.449> with<00:00:24.660> new

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
Heart Association came out with new

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
Heart Association came out with new
guidelines<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.430> might<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:26.910> seen<00:00:27.119> my

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
guidelines so you might have seen my

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.750 
guidelines so you might have seen my
other<00:00:27.359> videos<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.260> talk<00:00:28.439> about<00:00:28.740> v-fib<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
other videos that talk about v-fib and

other videos that talk about v-fib and
PA<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.570> asystole<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:32.189> want<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.460> review

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
PA and asystole I just want to review

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.430 
PA and asystole I just want to review
them<00:00:32.969> with<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.420> more<00:00:33.450> time<00:00:33.750> make<00:00:34.110> sure<00:00:34.290> we

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
them with you one more time make sure we

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.590 
them with you one more time make sure we
have<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> changes<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.030> need<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.390> know

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
have the changes that we need to know

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.530 
have the changes that we need to know
they've<00:00:37.350> actually<00:00:37.530> simplified<00:00:38.540> cardiac

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
they've actually simplified cardiac

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.139 
they've actually simplified cardiac
arrest<00:00:39.870> algorithms<00:00:40.649> they<00:00:41.460> say<00:00:41.670> they<00:00:41.820> wanted

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
arrest algorithms they say they wanted

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.139 
arrest algorithms they say they wanted
to<00:00:42.239> look<00:00:42.360> more<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.960> pediatric

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
to look more like the pediatric

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.660 
to look more like the pediatric
algorithms<00:00:45.149> which<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.539> actually<00:00:45.930> simpler<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
algorithms which are actually simpler so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
algorithms which are actually simpler so
let's<00:00:48.660> start<00:00:49.020> by<00:00:49.230> talking<00:00:49.500> about<00:00:49.649> cardiac

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
let's start by talking about cardiac

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.880 
let's start by talking about cardiac
arrest<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:51.629> know<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> team

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
arrest we know that we have a team

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.029 
arrest we know that we have a team
that's<00:00:53.070> doing<00:00:53.390> high-quality<00:00:54.390> CPR<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.320> that

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that's doing high-quality CPR and that

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.069 
that's doing high-quality CPR and that
CPR<00:00:56.489> today<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.210> at<00:00:57.390> least<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.020> hundred

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
CPR today is at least a hundred

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.799 
CPR today is at least a hundred
compressions<00:00:58.980> per<00:00:59.070> minute<00:00:59.690> compressing<00:01:00.690> in

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
compressions per minute compressing in

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.549 
compressions per minute compressing in
between<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> chest<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:02.570> depth<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.750> 2<00:01:04.080> inches

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
between the chest at depth of 2 inches

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.310 
between the chest at depth of 2 inches
deep<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.119> fast<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.659> heart<00:01:06.869> CPR

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
deep so it is really fast in heart CPR

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.800 
deep so it is really fast in heart CPR
and<00:01:07.590> recoil<00:01:08.100> coming<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> way<00:01:09.060> back<00:01:09.390> up<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and recoil coming all the way back up is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.210 
and recoil coming all the way back up is
very<00:01:10.140> important<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.150> we<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.570> adults

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
very important and we know that adults

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.060 
very important and we know that adults
have<00:01:14.220> 10<00:01:15.150> minutes<00:01:15.570> worth<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.020> oxygen<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.860> their

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
have 10 minutes worth of oxygen in their

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.850 
have 10 minutes worth of oxygen in their
bloodstream<00:01:17.659> where<00:01:18.659> they're<00:01:19.020> now<00:01:19.200> saying<00:01:19.619> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
bloodstream where they're now saying you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.390 
bloodstream where they're now saying you
know<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.159> instead<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.729> B<00:01:20.790> C<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.960> C<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.380> B<00:01:22.770> so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
know that instead of a B C it's C a B so

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.120 
know that instead of a B C it's C a B so
that<00:01:23.430> circulation<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.049> important<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.799> we

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that circulation is so important that we

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
that circulation is so important that we
should<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> high<00:01:26.909> quality<00:01:27.420> CPR<00:01:27.659> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
should do that high quality CPR and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
should do that high quality CPR and
hopefully<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.340> soon<00:01:29.369> as<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> team<00:01:30.030> comes<00:01:30.390> into

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
hopefully as soon as the team comes into

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.980 
hopefully as soon as the team comes into
the<00:01:30.810> room<00:01:31.049> or<00:01:31.560> an<00:01:32.220> EMS<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.299> know<00:01:33.420> enters<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the room or an EMS you know enters the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.469 
the room or an EMS you know enters the
area<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.619> we're<00:01:34.740> outside<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.130> hospital

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
area if it's we're outside the hospital

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.600 
area if it's we're outside the hospital
we<00:01:36.479> could<00:01:36.659> start<00:01:36.930> our<00:01:37.049> 32<00:01:37.439> -<00:01:37.740> right<00:01:37.979> away<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
we could start our 32 - right away and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
we could start our 32 - right away and
outside<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.479> hospital<00:01:39.960> EMS<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.619> could

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
outside the hospital EMS what could

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.010 
outside the hospital EMS what could
start<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.640> know<00:01:41.759> their<00:01:42.030> oxygen<00:01:42.570> aiding<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
start you know their oxygen aiding and

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.289 
start you know their oxygen aiding and
intubating<00:01:43.530> patients<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.909> we're<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
intubating patients so we're going to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.420 
intubating patients so we're going to
start<00:01:45.540> compressions<00:01:45.960> right<00:01:46.350> away<00:01:46.619> oxygenate

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
start compressions right away oxygenate

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
start compressions right away oxygenate
the<00:01:47.460> patient<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.149> soon<00:01:48.570> as<00:01:48.720> possible<00:01:49.290> we're

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770

the patient as soon as possible we're
doing<00:01:50.070> high<00:01:50.399> quality<00:01:50.939> CPR<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.869> then<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.829> need

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
doing high quality CPR and then we need

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.480 
doing high quality CPR and then we need
to<00:01:53.159> treat<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.270> patient's<00:01:54.780> rhythm<00:01:55.229> and

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
to treat the patient's rhythm and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.670 
to treat the patient's rhythm and

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
vasopressin and in PA and asystole as

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.570 
vasopressin and in PA and asystole as
well<00:04:35.090> as<00:04:35.330> in<00:04:35.509> ventricular<00:04:36.169> fibrillation<00:04:36.580> we

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
well as in ventricular fibrillation we

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.270 
well as in ventricular fibrillation we
are<00:04:37.729> trying<00:04:38.120> really<00:04:38.750> hard<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.199> treat<00:04:39.979> any

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
are trying really hard to treat any

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.929 
are trying really hard to treat any
underlying<00:04:41.120> cause<00:04:41.509> of<00:04:42.159> death<00:04:43.159> because<00:04:43.639> that's

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939 
underlying cause of death because that's

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.249 
underlying cause of death because that's
what<00:04:44.360> might<00:04:44.569> ensue

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
what might ensue

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.909 
what might ensue
so<00:04:46.099> epinephrine<00:04:46.909> is<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.210> drug<00:04:47.419> of<00:04:47.569> choice<00:04:47.919> for

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
so epinephrine is the drug of choice for

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.950 
so epinephrine is the drug of choice for
a<00:04:49.400> PA<00:04:49.729> and<00:04:50.060> asystole

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
a PA and asystole

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.159 
a PA and asystole
and<00:04:51.229> a<00:04:51.979> vasopressin<00:04:52.879> in<00:04:53.389> and<00:04:53.629> try<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.870> treat

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
and a vasopressin in and try to treat

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.649 
and a vasopressin in and try to treat
the<00:04:54.319> underlying<00:04:54.439> cause<00:04:54.949> of<00:04:54.979> death

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:55.659 
the underlying cause of death

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.050 
the underlying cause of death
so<00:04:56.659> that<00:04:56.930> was<00:04:57.169> v-fib<00:04:58.300> v-tach<00:04:59.300> no<00:04:59.360> pulse<00:04:59.659> and

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
so that was v-fib v-tach no pulse and

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.959 
so that was v-fib v-tach no pulse and
peña<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.629> asystole<00:05:03.199> treatment<00:05:03.969> with

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
peña and asystole treatment with

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.899 
peña and asystole treatment with
high-quality<00:05:05.210> CPR<00:05:06.279> so<00:05:07.279> hope<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.460> was<00:05:07.789> a<00:05:07.819> good

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
high-quality CPR so hope that was a good

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.839 
high-quality CPR so hope that was a good
review<00:05:08.210> of<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.539> changes<00:05:09.080> for<00:05:09.289> those<00:05:09.469> rhythms

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
review of the changes for those rhythms
