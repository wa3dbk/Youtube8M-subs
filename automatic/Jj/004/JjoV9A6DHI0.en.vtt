00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 you are searching in a padded podium 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.629
 unusual but tantalizing then I can 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.910
 give you some bad ideas 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 I have a simple tome for you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.929
 prepared with a combination of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.340
 very curious ingredients then you are 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 ready for a taste explosion 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.619
 enclosed in a single sandwich we see the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 recipe to prepare them the sandwich is the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.890
 tuna we need 130 grams of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:32.040
 bread 80 g of tuna in oil drained 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.960
 80 g of greek yogurt a tablespoon of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.890
 capers a bunch of fresh rocket 30 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:45.600
 g grated carrots 50 g of sauce 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.360
 guacamole 50 g of prawns and a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.059
 teaspoon of oregano 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 then I got him a giant sandwich and 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.730
 I divided it into three parts, but see 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.590
 you can choose any type of bread 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.629
 wholegrain rye what you like 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820
 more or even fabio at home better 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.090
 even now we are going to bring it in 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.090
 oven at about 180 degrees for 5 6 minutes 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.760
 until the bread toasts in the oven 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.670
 we do have the shrimp we have 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.460
 put to boil some water we dip 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:24.940
 shrimp and we cook them about 2 3 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:27.130
 minutes we drained the gambers now 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.500
 let's proceed with the filling of the first 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.860
 layer of our simple self vi 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.020
 I recommend mixing Greek yogurt 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.820
 with the tuna in oil his show side 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.990
 to reduce calories even more you can 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.110
 replace tuna in oil 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.820
 naturally with natural tuna e 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.550
 meanwhile we mix naturally 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.490
 removed the bread from the batch state oven 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.160
 also left to assault we join the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:00.970
 let's think of tuna, let's call it that 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.619
 we save on the first layer of bread 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.810
 we think, however, a little bit there 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:10.140
 will serve as the last layer adhesive 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 we give good 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.940
 we also put some capers 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.540
 and I don't have some rocket leaves 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.680
 I add salt because we already find the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.620
 tuna which is salty defense and now 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.870
 let's proceed with the second layer for the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.260
 second layer I children suggest one 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.820
 very special avocado sauce la 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.440
 guacamole sauce then you will find 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.990
 naturally the overlay link 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.910
 even at the end of the video so maybe 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.400
 if you can consult the recipe it is a lot 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.370
 simple we crushed the lawyer 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.730
 then we added garlic coriander 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.730
 black pepper and pieces of tomato 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:12.840
 we also add our julienne of 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:14.970
 carrots the prawns I added salt 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.830
 pepper or nothing because I like the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.830
 shrimp influence in this case 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:32.120
 a bit of oregano and this is the second 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.090
 layer of our sandwich we are 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.230
 take the third dough then the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.940
 we turn it over and here we put ourselves 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.450
 a neck sauce that we put forward 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:50.180
 before we will serve as a glue and 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.000
 Now let's compose the simple first 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:59.030
 layer second tear and it was 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.360
 slightly we do a little and this 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.680
 our super sandwich at the top 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.019
 call it pure sandwich 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.519
 anglosassone or tramezzino 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.319
 Italian style if you prefer 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.880
 the fact is that this super sandwich 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.220
 stuffed and people what we need 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.610
 to tease the palate and awaken the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.610
 our senses
