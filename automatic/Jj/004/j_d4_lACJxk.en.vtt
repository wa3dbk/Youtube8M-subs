00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
slight Bend on the G which is incredibly

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.259 
slight Bend on the G which is incredibly
important<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:18.290> song<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.500> neither<00:02:18.769> a

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
important because the song is neither a

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.130 
important because the song is neither a
minor<00:02:20.269> or<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.500> major<00:02:21.880> 7<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:23.420> between<00:02:23.569> and

minor or a major 7 it's in between and
it's<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.440> tweaking<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.130> third<00:02:29.200> that

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
that's what you want but he's pretty

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.400 
that's what you want but he's pretty
loose<00:04:47.360> with<00:04:47.390> that<00:04:47.540> sometimes<00:04:47.870> he<00:04:47.990> doubles<00:04:48.320> it

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
loose with that sometimes he doubles it

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.890 
loose with that sometimes he doubles it
up<00:04:48.530> sometimes<00:04:48.890> he<00:04:49.010> kind<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.340> loses<00:04:49.670> it

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
up sometimes he kind of loses it

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.800 
up sometimes he kind of loses it
in<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:52.010> coolest<00:04:52.430> way<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:53.090> wouldn't<00:04:53.390> get<00:04:53.660> too

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
in the coolest way so I wouldn't get too

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.870 
in the coolest way so I wouldn't get too
crazy<00:04:54.080> about<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.770> but<00:04:55.010> when<00:04:55.610> you're<00:04:55.700> playing

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
crazy about it but when you're playing

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.950 
crazy about it but when you're playing
one<00:04:56.030> with<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.240> track<00:04:58.360> maybe<00:04:59.360> just<00:04:59.600> practice

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
one with the track maybe just practice

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.100 
one with the track maybe just practice
your<00:05:00.140> thumb<00:05:00.380> doing<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.010> part<00:05:01.250> now<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.900> hard

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
your thumb doing the part now the hard

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.750 
your thumb doing the part now the hard
part<00:05:03.170> is<00:05:03.500> getting<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.190> thumb<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.700> the

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
part is getting the thumb and the

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.520 
part is getting the thumb and the
fingers<00:05:05.450> together<00:05:05.630> now<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.020> obviously<00:05:06.230> I'm

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
fingers together now you obviously I'm

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.200 
fingers together now you obviously I'm
not<00:05:06.650> using<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:07.010> pick<00:05:07.190> on<00:05:07.400> this<00:05:07.610> it's<00:05:07.760> all<00:05:07.880> finger

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
not using a pick on this it's all finger

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:22.020 
not using a pick on this it's all finger
picked<00:05:08.450> so

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.510 

my

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.820 

and<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:26.210> played<00:05:26.960> it<00:05:27.080> pretty<00:05:27.289> straight<00:05:27.620> there

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
and I played it pretty straight there

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.650 
and I played it pretty straight there
you<00:05:27.919> want<00:05:28.069> to<00:05:28.129> swing<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.520> a<00:05:28.550> little<00:05:28.610> harder<00:05:29.180> but

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
you want to swing it a little harder but

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.059 
you want to swing it a little harder but
when<00:05:29.810> you're<00:05:29.930> practicing<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.560> sometimes<00:05:30.919> it

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
when you're practicing it sometimes it

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:32.140 
when you're practicing it sometimes it
works<00:05:31.310> when<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.610> play<00:05:31.789> with<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.030> metronome

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
works when you play with the metronome

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.540 
works when you play with the metronome
and<00:05:32.629> really<00:05:33.289> just<00:05:33.470> try<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.680> lock<00:05:33.949> that<00:05:34.190> stuff

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
and really just try to lock that stuff

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.399 
and really just try to lock that stuff
up<00:05:34.789> I<00:05:35.030> wish<00:05:35.509> I<00:05:35.599> could<00:05:35.750> give<00:05:35.870> you<00:05:35.990> some<00:05:36.169> sort<00:05:36.379> of

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409 
up I wish I could give you some sort of

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.680 
up I wish I could give you some sort of
trick<00:05:36.770> acid<00:05:37.159> this<00:05:37.250> is<00:05:37.310> how<00:05:37.580> you<00:05:37.639> do<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:38.030> the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
trick acid this is how you do it the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.020 
trick acid this is how you do it the
only<00:05:38.960> way<00:05:39.229> you<00:05:39.289> get<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.560> is<00:05:39.770> by<00:05:39.949> practicing<00:05:40.190> the

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
only way you get it is by practicing the

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.890 
only way you get it is by practicing the
heck<00:05:41.240> out<00:05:41.479> of<00:05:41.509> it

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
heck out of it

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.809 
heck out of it
it's<00:05:42.110> really<00:05:42.560> actually<00:05:42.860> pretty<00:05:43.129> difficult<00:05:43.490> to

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
it's really actually pretty difficult to

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.659 
it's really actually pretty difficult to
get<00:05:43.909> together<00:05:44.860> but<00:05:45.860> it<00:05:46.009> totally<00:05:46.159> pays<00:05:46.490> off

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
get together but it totally pays off

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:48.070 
get together but it totally pays off
because<00:05:46.729> tons<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.330> tunes<00:05:47.569> do<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:47.900> we're<00:05:47.990> going

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
as well so that's the first half of the

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.219 
as well so that's the first half of the
riff<00:05:52.159> now<00:05:52.669> when<00:05:53.389> somebody's<00:05:53.720> singing<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.080> might

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
riff now when somebody's singing I might

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:55.930 
riff now when somebody's singing I might
not<00:05:54.349> want<00:05:54.440> to<00:05:54.530> be<00:05:54.590> as<00:05:54.830> busy<00:05:55.220> as<00:05:55.340> the<00:05:55.490> main<00:05:55.669> riff

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
not want to be as busy as the main riff

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:10.779 
not want to be as busy as the main riff
so<00:05:56.150> I'm<00:05:56.270> doing<00:06:08.830> it<00:06:09.830> some<00:06:09.979> kind<00:06:10.069> of<00:06:10.159> combination

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
so I'm doing it some kind of combination

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.409 
so I'm doing it some kind of combination
of<00:06:10.880> that<00:06:11.090> stuff<00:06:11.449> so<00:06:11.659> that's<00:06:11.780> all<00:06:12.020> thinking

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
of that stuff so that's all thinking

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.490 
of that stuff so that's all thinking
little<00:06:14.419> bitty<00:06:14.630> minor<00:06:15.110> pentatonic<00:06:15.880> so<00:06:17.500> that's

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
little bitty minor pentatonic so that's

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.740 
little bitty minor pentatonic so that's
really<00:06:18.710> I<00:06:18.800> like<00:06:19.159> this<00:06:19.340> low<00:06:19.550> e<00:06:19.580> top<00:06:20.150> two<00:06:20.419> strings
