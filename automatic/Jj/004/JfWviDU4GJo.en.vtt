telling<00:00:51.570> us<00:00:51.690> okay<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.199> building<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
telling us okay this building is

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.400 
telling us okay this building is
Renaissance<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.600> medieval<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
Renaissance this one is medieval and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.549 
Renaissance this one is medieval and
this<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.850> built<00:00:57.149> only<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:58.079> 100<00:00:58.530> years

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.220 
this one was built only like 100 years
ago<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.280> could<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.570> our<00:01:00.809> research

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
ago so we could really in our research

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
ago so we could really in our research
due<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.100> difference<00:01:02.520> between<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
due to the difference between the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
due to the difference between the
architecture<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.379> doing<00:01:05.189> our<00:01:05.339> research

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
architecture and then doing our research

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.880 
architecture and then doing our research
we<00:01:05.970> could<00:01:06.180> also<00:01:06.330> say<00:01:06.689> okay<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.110> building<00:01:07.650> was

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
we could also say okay this building was

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.810 
we could also say okay this building was
not<00:01:08.159> exactly<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.330> now<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.400> take<00:01:11.430> an

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
not exactly like it is now if I take an

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.020 
not exactly like it is now if I take an
