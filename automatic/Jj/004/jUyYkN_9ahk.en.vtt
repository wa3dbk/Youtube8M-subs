know<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.770> could<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:35.130> something<00:01:35.460> for

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
know I think this could be something for

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
know I think this could be something for
you<00:01:35.850> because<00:01:36.390> he<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.409> taking<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.920> as

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you because he was not taking it as

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.440 
you because he was not taking it as
serious<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.759> he<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.000> had<00:01:39.240> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
serious you know and he just had this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.749 
serious you know and he just had this
I'd<00:01:40.229> hate<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> see<00:01:40.860> natural<00:01:41.280> talent<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.640> he

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
I'd hate to see natural talent but he

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.639 
I'd hate to see natural talent but he
did<00:01:42.000> he<00:01:42.240> had<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.840> motivation<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.560> this

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
did he had this this motivation in this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.830 
did he had this this motivation in this
talent<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.270> very<00:01:45.420> much<00:01:45.659> at

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
talent that you don't see very much at

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.380 
talent that you don't see very much at
his<00:01:45.990> age<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.549> had<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> tell<00:01:47.970> my<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.210> know

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
his age and so I had to tell my you know

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.730 
his age and so I had to tell my you know
I<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.780> could<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:48.990> something<00:01:49.079> big<00:01:49.530> for

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
I think this could be something big for

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.929 
I think this could be something big for
you<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.220> might<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.460> might<00:01:50.520> want<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.759> take<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you you might you might want to take a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.569 
you you might you might want to take a
little<00:01:51.090> more<00:01:51.180> serious<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.920> take

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
little more serious and not just take

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.310 
little more serious and not just take
the<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.180> know<00:01:54.270> whatever<00:01:54.570> fly-by-night

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the you know whatever fly-by-night

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.280 
the you know whatever fly-by-night
sponsor<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.310> giving<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.630> shirt<00:01:58.020> every

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
sponsor that is giving you a shirt every

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.810 
sponsor that is giving you a shirt every
once<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> while<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.790> have

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
once in a while you know you you have

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.580 
once in a while you know you you have
potential<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.840> on<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> bigger<00:02:01.259> scale

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
potential to do this on a bigger scale

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.310 
potential to do this on a bigger scale
and<00:02:01.969> I<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.390> he<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.689> did<00:02:03.899> take<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and I think he really did take that to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.389 
and I think he really did take that to
heart<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.829> about<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.310> was

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
heart because that was about that was

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.029 
heart because that was about that was
about<00:02:05.520> four<00:02:05.759> years<00:02:05.880> ago<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.649> he<00:02:07.649> went

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
about four years ago and and he went

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.710 
about four years ago and and he went
full<00:02:08.580> speed<00:02:08.789> ahead<00:02:09.090> and
