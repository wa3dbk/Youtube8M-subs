inches<00:00:46.110> blade<00:00:46.649> length<00:00:46.920> three<00:00:47.430> point<00:00:47.730> seven

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
inches blade length three point seven

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.200 
inches blade length three point seven
eight<00:00:48.260> closed<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.860> four<00:00:50.309> point<00:00:50.640> nine<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
eight closed it is four point nine and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.740 
eight closed it is four point nine and
the<00:00:51.930> weight<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.379> four<00:00:53.280> point<00:00:53.760> two<00:00:54.239> ounces

so<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.559> very<00:00:55.829> light<00:00:56.120> it's<00:00:57.120> known<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.360> being

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so it's very light it's known for being

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.770 
so it's very light it's known for being
durable<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.530> strong<00:00:59.219> now<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.149> has<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> dual

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
durable and strong now it has a dual

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.290 
durable and strong now it has a dual
locking<00:01:01.230> system<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
locking system on it you can see the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140 
locking system on it you can see the
liner<00:01:03.539> lock<00:01:03.809> right<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.610> has<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
liner lock right there and it has the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
liner lock right there and it has the
roto<00:01:06.390> lock<00:01:06.720> system<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> liner<00:01:08.189> can't

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
roto lock system so that the liner can't

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.750 
roto lock system so that the liner can't
be<00:01:08.909> pushed<00:01:09.270> over<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.130> natural<00:01:11.729> very

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
be pushed over so it's very natural very

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.630 
be pushed over so it's very natural very
fluid<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
fluid I like it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.539

I<00:01:18.540> prefer<00:01:19.020> knives<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.619> g10<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.880> does

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
I prefer knives with g10 but it does

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.749 
I prefer knives with g10 but it does
have<00:01:21.360> some<00:01:21.810> texture<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.400> said<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
have some texture and like I said it is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.080 
have some texture and like I said it is
very<00:01:24.060> light<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> bad<00:01:25.680> choice<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.340> handle

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
very light so not a bad choice on handle

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
very light so not a bad choice on handle
material<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.810> now<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.829> see<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.520> this

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
material there now you can see that this

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.039 
material there now you can see that this
blade<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.409> dual<00:01:31.409> bevel<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.750> spear

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
blade is dual bevel so it's a spear

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.260 
blade is dual bevel so it's a spear
point<00:01:34.290> design<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.549> doesn't<00:01:35.880> come<00:01:36.060> with

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that top edge sharpened but I went to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.480 
that top edge sharpened but I went to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
impressed with the initial quality

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.109 
impressed with the initial quality
because<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.560> blade<00:01:52.860> was<00:01:53.369> totally<00:01:53.909> off

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
because the blade was totally off

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.030

centered<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> handle<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.829> they

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
centered in the handle so they

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.039 
centered in the handle so they
straightened<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.850> me<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.180> sharpened<00:01:57.930> it
