patient to make it early diagnosis we're

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.620 
patient to make it early diagnosis we're
looking<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.010> non-invasive<00:00:23.670> ways<00:00:24.180> of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
assessing things that at the moment we

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.019 
assessing things that at the moment we
have<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.910> use<00:00:27.199> invasive<00:00:28.199> means<00:00:28.699> like<00:00:29.699> sticking

have to use invasive means like sticking

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.250 
have to use invasive means like sticking
a<00:00:30.090> needle<00:00:30.240> into<00:00:30.510> someone<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> blood

a needle into someone to get a blood

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.610 
a needle into someone to get a blood
sample<00:00:31.399> to<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> same<00:00:32.880> information<00:00:33.620> one

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
sample to get the same information one

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.740 
sample to get the same information one
of<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> problems<00:00:35.219> with<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.579> project<00:00:36.180> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
of the problems with this project is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.220 
of the problems with this project is
that<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:37.350> are<00:00:37.559> too<00:00:38.070> many<00:00:38.340> good<00:00:38.790> questions

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
that there are too many good questions

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.930 
that there are too many good questions
every<00:00:40.230> doctor<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.649> speak<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.219> comes<00:00:41.550> up<00:00:41.760> with

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
every doctor you speak to comes up with

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
every doctor you speak to comes up with
two<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.210> three<00:00:42.239> really<00:00:42.780> good<00:00:43.140> research<00:00:43.710> ideas

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
two or three really good research ideas

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.889 
two or three really good research ideas
so<00:00:44.910> we're<00:00:45.030> having<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.450> very<00:00:45.660> selective

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
so we're having to be very selective

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.560 
so we're having to be very selective
we're<00:00:46.800> focusing<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.550> patients<00:00:48.450> with

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
we're focusing on patients with

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.479 
we're focusing on patients with

analysis that comes from atmospheric

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.950 
analysis that comes from atmospheric
chemistry<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:23.220> involves<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> analysis<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
chemistry this involves the analysis of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.719 
chemistry this involves the analysis of

compounds that are exhaled by the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.609 
compounds that are exhaled by the
patient<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> tell<00:01:28.140> something<00:01:28.560> about

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
patient so we can tell something about

analyzing the heart's activity and the
blood<00:01:42.270> circulation<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.439> tell<00:01:43.740> us<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.979> lot<00:01:44.130> more

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
blood circulation to tell us a lot more

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.789

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
about how efficiently the heart is

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.609 
about how efficiently the heart is

working and how efficiently the blood is

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.460 
working and how efficiently the blood is
circulating<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.540> most<00:01:51.720> exciting<00:01:52.229> part<00:01:52.409> of

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.880 
people that I don't usually work with
that<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.909> different<00:01:57.240> perspective<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that have a different perspective on the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.069 
that have a different perspective on the
sort<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> problems<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:01:59.850> looking<00:02:00.030> at<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
sort of problems that I'm looking at so

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.350 
sort of problems that I'm looking at so
I'm<00:02:01.200> working<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.939> scientists<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.119> other

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
I'm working with scientists from other

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600 
I'm working with scientists from other
areas<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.079> university<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.579> a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
areas of the university that have a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.819 
areas of the university that have a
completely<00:02:06.119> different<00:02:06.570> way<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.079> looking<00:02:07.649> at<00:02:07.770> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
completely different way of looking at a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.440 
completely different way of looking at a
problem<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:09.090> very

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
problem and that's really very

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.840 
problem and that's really very
stimulating

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
stimulating

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.310 
stimulating
diagnosis<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:11.970> emergency<00:02:12.480> care<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.960> putting

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
diagnosis in emergency care is putting

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.520 
diagnosis in emergency care is putting
together<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.680> jigsaw<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.990> information<00:02:15.990> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
together a jigsaw of information to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.020 
together a jigsaw of information to
create<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> picture<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.640> gives<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
create a picture that gives you the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.630 
create a picture that gives you the
diagnosis<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:19.410> hope<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:20.100> sort<00:02:20.580> of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
diagnosis we hope that this sort of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.610 
diagnosis we hope that this sort of
technology<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> give<00:02:21.930> us<00:02:21.960> more

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
technology is going to give us more

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.830 
technology is going to give us more
pieces<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.550> jigsaw<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.510> make<00:02:24.660> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
pieces to the jigsaw to make that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.700 
pieces to the jigsaw to make that
picture<00:02:25.080> clearer<00:02:25.800> earlier<00:02:26.490> on
