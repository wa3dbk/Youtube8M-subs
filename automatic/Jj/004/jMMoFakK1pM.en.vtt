00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:09.240
 Hello everyone, Mr. X 45 and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:14.280
 Today is the 50th anniversary issue homemade from 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.279
 me and probably so cool no one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.380
 so much homemade no well so much for 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.070
 such a little time wheel to do 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.689
 homemade 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.260
 that is, as many as 50 do-it-yourselfers I did with 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.369
 early april 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:35.309
 food-food of the end of june from kansai they first 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.250
 hello until the end of July by 50 homemade and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.410
 half which i did i don't you 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.899
 showed i have more than five miss i am you 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.570
 did not show 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.309
 probably homemade baptized at 10 itself 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.980
 the case which we do is not shown because 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.719
 that they are exclusive and they will only 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 probably after I take off show 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:01.859
 film invasion from the abyss to which all 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:07.020
 wait for the last trailer so today 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.700
 made a stringer and turned out for me 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.640
 the simplest than the ball 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.189
 that beam I had to paint this gray 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.560
 you donâ€™t know his helmet details 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.509
 how much and decorate how much dried here 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 stringers helmet and made very simple 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.930
 just painted with a caustic marker which 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.720
 communication is washed off and let's move on 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.259
 first in armor armor as almost like u 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.280
 series 30 by the way we have no badge exactly 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.079
 because like i picked picked up 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.770
 don't remember nothing picked up nothing 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:46.439
 came up there is a little bit of such detail 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:51.409
 number without number though in series 30 she 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:55.040
 another principle will do all the last 30 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.630
 the weapon of the world to surprise I did that 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.750
 because I didn't know how to comp a weapon 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.560
 always matched by color 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.009
 body paint 2 and by the color of this body i am not 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.200
 knew how to choose what that is and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.200
 I did not have to take such a detail 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:23.690
 also we can not hook on his hand and he 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.690
 may be 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:35.220
 You can also do this series 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:38.090
 pick it up all you want by 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.630
 designs construction by the way weapons 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.019
 It is worth such details and you can when to 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.239
 next did everything as a series 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.950
 just remove the item because of whom 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.870
 gun at the sky stringer down his 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.610
 the artist is no longer Murcia in stringers can 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.280
 it probably says everything that you feel sorry 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.030
 that stringer removed the series, we probably 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.160
 you do not know that I have removed new 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.750
 as I learned from a series of bionic thoughts began 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.480
 remove 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.599
 heroes then began to run away a series of 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.579
 It has become the main characters and that is 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.850
 came out in the invasion of the abyss and on 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.100
 the fifteenth year is most often clever because 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.000
 that the series you vannikova originated and 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.010
 slowly began to clean up the series of the hero so 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.840
 like nix 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:35.819
 stringer is not him so now we will not 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.739
 forget these heroes because on nexia 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.410
 stringers because they are very cool 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.690
 remember the hero and especially my stringer 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.569
 favorite character 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.430
 music is and let's consider 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:56.419
 dick again you say i'm breaking helmets 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:58.230
 from his spoiled helmet here his part and 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:03.319
 spoiled 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:07.200
 he nyx painted in black marker branches 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:11.410
 by the way is very similar happened sight 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:15.670
 light combines light a little candle 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.370
 this is what turned out cool and this number 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.980
 I like more than the mouse beams 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.320
 a little there is a rough so im more 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.480
 poor quality and the color did not look like in 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:41.950
 this more interesting 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:44.320
 dark let's set the camera fruit blame well 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.140
 I like it cool and not so 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:57.370
 just fixed here and it turns out 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:05:02.290
 such a helmet is streaming and that's it and everything seems to be 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.600
 all everyone thanks for watching all bye 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.560
