00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.259
 the days friends and followers of the value 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.709
 technical all almond tree all almond 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 chanel we are on day 26 of 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:15.150
 February 2014 in MÃ©rida I am already 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.250
 moving this plantation of antonieta 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.039
 one just a week ago on 19 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.720
 February 2014 now we are already 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.650
 in full bloom 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.840
 and we see that it has a number of flowers 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.770
 impressive this plantation already in its 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.210
 day already had as we have been advancing 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.640
 a production a very productions 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.880
 tall 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.489
 this year and as you can see he still has a 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.320
 great load of flowers that is going to 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.750
 translate as not 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.180
 a strong production of almonds in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.430
 the lower areas than last year already 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.809
 they were producing can be true 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.300
 that this year they have stayed seems a 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.790
 little more depopulated but not 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.190
 means that they are exhausted is that 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.080
 means that this year they will rest this 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 year, the new fruits will be renewed 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.030
 and next year these low areas already 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.119
 we will show them you will see how they continue to give 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.980
 harvest on top because above is 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.380
 to the top as you are seeing 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.110
 this year as you have seen if you have 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.050
 followed our historical series as it has 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.660
 there was an advance in flowering but 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.420
 right now at risk irrigation area in 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.520
 Guadiana in the lowlands of Guadiana 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.690
 with an excellent climate that we are 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.030
 talking about that almost all 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.610
 peach plum varieties already 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.520
 they are in bloom it is very difficult that 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.219
 there are frost problems 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.409
 this plantation is going to continue 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.950
 yielding to continue giving good harvests 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.630
 almond prices remain high 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.880
 we say that this year is 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.350
 could have been liquidated in campaign 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.579
 at six euros per kilo of seed 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.400
 Currently the prices are very good 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:02.350
 They are scary scared abi 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.270
 almond offers right now to 740 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.370
 then let's hope that by the time 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.830
 arrive the date of collection that will be 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.140
 mid-August about this 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.330
 variety the antonieta because the price 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.090
 may be close to six euros and 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.690
 medium so we can achieve a great 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.180
 cost effectiveness 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.280
 we talk that with 1,500 2,000 kilos that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 is this plantation more or less 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.050
 can reach in those productions then 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.100
 made in the account at the expense level a 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.860
 light pruning 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.670
 and fertigation that is very important 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.180
 suicidal under covered trees 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.500
 Vegetables on the street and picking 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.980
 what can be done mechanized 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.370
 perfectly 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.270
 we will be following the setting of this 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.800
 variety in next video 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.490
 until then 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.490
 friends
