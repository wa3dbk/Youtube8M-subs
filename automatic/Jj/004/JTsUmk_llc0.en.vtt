00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 numerous archaeological finds show 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 often a significant similarity 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.010
 with the on the edge of modern ufo 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.490
 Phenomenon always in appearance 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.740
 Stepping on small room in old 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.210
 Traditions and myths are often used by 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.670
 spoken small fashion 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.460
 because of their strikingly large heads 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.460
 and oval eyes look scary 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.100
 Welcome to exo magazine tv 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.320
 the magazine for freerister the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.270
 so-called extraterrestrial like that 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.190
 We know that since at least 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.670
 the film scary encounters of 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.830
 third type of 1977 portrayed in it 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.019
 Director Steven Spielberg the visitors 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.180
 as a little gray shape without 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.180
 body hair with big black ones 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.980
 eyes and long arms of course that 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.390
 universe is huge and it likes the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.589
 different types of 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.229
 give to extraterrestrials 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.090
 but is not it amazing that exactly 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.490
 this form of appearance already on 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.780
 relics emerge very early cultures 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.090
 worldwide 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.910
 that at least has the Austrian 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.610
 Researcher Rio Rang found out 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.360
 what is behind it 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.740
 there must be so-called bodies with 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.649
 the most famous mythical creatures in the world 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.970
 Japanese folk beliefs the first 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.630
 reports on the miraculous beings 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.190
 go back to the year 720 as humans 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.810
 from these stunted thorough 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.380
 attacking was attacked 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 been 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.299
 of human and animal-like demons 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.729
 Here was the speech that specifically 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.770
 to stop at the water 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.659
 and the people uncomfortable 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.850
 a property associated with it 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.350
 the associative connections to the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.470
 well-known kidnapping cases 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.409
 but I would like to water then 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.520
 again extra to come back further 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.189
 in the past the winter 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.960
 ceramics the culture at music 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.110
 neolithic mainly in serbia and 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.790
 south hungary so southeastern europe 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.590
 and has some mysterious symbols 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.690
 and also archaeological finds 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.360
 leave like this mask here for 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.769
 not just that she is one 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.350
 Mysterious until today not them 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.180
 The magazine developed the riots 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.290
 this can also be a precursor 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.370
 be today's scripture 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.470
 there are also significant ones again 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.350
 sculptures under the excavated 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.239
 relive the classic again 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.239
 Remember the picture of our crane 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.230
 5000 before christ 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.230
 numerous representations 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.640
 disproportionate heads and eyes 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.560
 the similarities to the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.909
 to have cosmic visitors 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.959
 from the common science at the same time 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.519
 dismissed as anthropomorphic ceramics 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.720
 but without a deeper meaning and one 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.720
 meaning to look for 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.010
 no less startling for many 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.650
 perhaps already known the so-called 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.810
 China's living the Australian rain 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.250
 ghosts again water here 3000 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.079
 in front of christ australian 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.389
 Cave paintings of the mythical rain and 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.669
 clouds spirits of the aborigines the of 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.959
 china or band china called show 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.239
 a significant similarity to the 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.919
 grace these paintings are over 5000 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.090
 years old and could join the 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.889
 oldest representations of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.040
 could count extraterrestrials 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.090
 mind you today are these 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.489
 heavenly spirits of the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.340
 Australian Aborigines now worship 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.400
 something completely new would be alright 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.510
 I like to know something about it 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.799
 then at the posteression about it 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.239
 I am very interested in speaking 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.190
 I was not there myself either 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.620
 that is information that became more 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.120
 as recently leaked a well-known 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.379
 Switzerland has some for me 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.819
 send photos 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.629
 and then I started to 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.060
 research what is that i am talking about 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.340
 here from the pedro attacked on the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.530
 virgin islands many throughout 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.209
 unknown strange rock images the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.010
 creatures with big eyes and 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.139
 represent oversized heads 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.720
 can be found on the virgin islands saint 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.340
 John and 10 Thomas are there 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.409
 again just above the water surface 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.500
 so that is interpreted 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:24.110
 there are water symbols are the 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.270
 made from an old trick 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.199
 should be Colombian culture 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.380
 consider this representation something 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.380
 closer 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.389
 but that's how they show themselves for us 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.699
 by no means crystal clear connections to 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.659
 water except that you are near 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.070
 there were scratched in the rocks 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.710
 staying with my that the wet 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.750
 wet 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.670
 by means of schematic tables or the 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.030
 symbol image of a fish at least 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.350
 if something had been presented 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.540
 the motive should be 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.840
 instead, it seems like here as well 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.970
 would be humanoid beings with big minds 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.950
 and eyes have been immortalized 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.990
 Here's the distance skeptics claim 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.580
 yes, that Steven Spielberg's movie only 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.500
 the image of the gray alien in 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.270
 our pop culture have influenced 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.890
 well the early cultures had 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.170
 certainly no cable tv in the 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.180
 cave and even if Hollywood movies 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.160
 are based on real cases 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.260
 the ufo research and not vice versa 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.840
 that's what the film scholar Robbie has 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.400
 program out got the alien 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.590
 but could also look like us 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.340
 and completely undetected among us 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.200
 have mixed 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.170
 theme figure twill even times 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.460
 have met what you think about it 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.680
 your neighbor an alien in 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.280
 human form please write me one 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.080
 comment 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.060
 the entire post about the gray in 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.250
 the past is now on excel
