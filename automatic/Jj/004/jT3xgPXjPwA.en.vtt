00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.219
 victory is in our hands 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.949
 let's look at today a great adventurer albert bachmann spanish a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.010
 already accomplished a lot in his life 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.260
 and this year he participates in the dakar driving a vehicle a place 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.260
 Home 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.780
 why not after the queen paola 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 herold goulon why then the opposite effect 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.150
 I have always been interested in adventures back to the origins because 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.780
 during my previous participations in the dakar I only thought about the engine 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.110
 have more power go faster i know i will never win dakar 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.150
 mans I think 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.840
 and in a way this approach allows us to cover its 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.540
 closets in different ways like an adventure alone taking all the 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 things I can do in these conditions we are in the posture 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.989
 October at the airport 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.750
 others 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.280
 it's a mountaineer it took this week the most common mountain of 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.100
 each of the seven continents of the world 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 he has achieved his ends from each of them but almost 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.490
 I think the hardest thing I did was the rest and the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.490
 mornings of dakar on a israel security motorcycle 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.299
 the year 2009 the vast mountains very symbolic missed 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.380
 the statue is no longer as heroic as in the past to conquer it 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.870
 a lot of people today gold but it's still very difficult and risky 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.600
 still as dakar going through london an agreement is an agreement for 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.709
 to hold this rally is only 6 088 that during the first editions 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.189
 sumbe every participant this year is that it will be very hard very 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:55.940
 dangerous 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.200
 like the vast seyne-on-sea 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.550
 such 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.200
 not easy to live both are pretty much alike 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.580
 he had to find the right team a good little devil and to play so that 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.790
 we sometimes knew that for a very short time and even longer 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.819
 besides it accompanies you in your successes and you do not know of your 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.819
 life in their hands claude sarraute thornton 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.009
 and there I really realized for border crossings some 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.559
 members of my team today these are people I only know 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:30.609
 for three months and lyon mag just met 6% everything depends on them they 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.159
 are my family and 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.029
 have the death penalty dpic 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:39.519
 he's also a writer he's published a book about his mountain experiences 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.959
 and even if he has already run from dakar to motorbike his remains a difficult exercise 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.909
 the edges of the mersey she well the mother of m 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.139
 to hamilton art for me it's about living an adventure the dakar allows to 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.599
 people like that too is his favorite at the same time or even 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.229
 producers and processors of problems on each in his own way 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.789
 to lose it 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.789
 but many other companies 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.700
 we will keep an eye on this crazy man until the end of the dakar
