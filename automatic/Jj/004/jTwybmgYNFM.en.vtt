00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
thing is so I suggest maybe even sending

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.350 
thing is so I suggest maybe even sending
me<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> PM<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:11.250> might<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> better<00:01:12.090> bet<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
me a PM that might be the better bet I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.200 
me a PM that might be the better bet I

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
guys to the website of the server down

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.580 
guys to the website of the server down
below<00:02:26.490> because<00:02:27.270> that's<00:02:27.930> where<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.380> find

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
below because that's where you can find

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.330 
below because that's where you can find
a<00:02:28.680> lot<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.980> info<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> server<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
a lot of the info for the server so I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.390 
a lot of the info for the server so I
don't<00:02:32.880> typically<00:02:33.180> play<00:02:33.450> pixelmon<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.110> lot<00:02:34.400> but

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
don't typically play pixelmon a lot but

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.330 
don't typically play pixelmon a lot but
I<00:02:35.700> will<00:02:36.360> probably<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:37.290> playing<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.800> here<00:02:38.040> some

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
I will probably be playing on here some

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.850 
I will probably be playing on here some
so<00:02:39.210> with<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.570> being<00:02:39.780> said<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.290> easiest<00:02:40.650> way

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
so with that being said the easiest way

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.320
