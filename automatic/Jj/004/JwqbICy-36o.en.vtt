00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
the third Rock from the Sun how did this

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.169 
the third Rock from the Sun how did this
ever<00:00:09.320> happen<00:00:09.940> and<00:00:11.379> then<00:00:12.379> 800<00:00:13.190> million<00:00:13.759> years

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
ever happen and then 800 million years

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.070 
ever happen and then 800 million years
later<00:00:14.709> people<00:00:15.709> appear<00:00:16.160> and<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:17.420> people<00:00:17.780> can

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
later people appear and the people can

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.439 
later people appear and the people can
look<00:00:18.590> back<00:00:18.920> at<00:00:19.189> the<00:00:19.310> whole<00:00:19.490> thing<00:00:19.519> and<00:00:20.000> try<00:00:20.390> to

protein the structure of protein is

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.869 
protein the structure of protein is
dictated<00:00:54.199> by<00:00:54.340> DNA<00:00:55.899> so<00:00:57.609> protein<00:00:58.609> is

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
dictated by DNA so protein is

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.420

the protein is broken down into amino

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.750 
the protein is broken down into amino
acids<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.250> then<00:01:10.340> rebuilt<00:01:11.060> into<00:01:11.510> whatever<00:01:12.760> the

behind it and puts the code on a piece
of<00:01:48.680> RNA<00:01:49.180> so<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:50.600> takes<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:52.370> DNA<00:01:52.820> code<00:01:53.120> and

the RNA goes out into the cell and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
and the RNA code is made into a sequence

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.720 
and the RNA code is made into a sequence
of<00:02:21.300> amino<00:02:21.450> acids<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.190> it's<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.820> RNA

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730

establishes what the protein looks like

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.140 
establishes what the protein looks like
the<00:02:28.080> DNA<00:02:28.500> establishes<00:02:29.190> what<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.490> RNA<00:02:29.880> looks

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the DNA establishes what the RNA looks

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.410 
the DNA establishes what the RNA looks
like<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.980> that's<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.490> that's<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
like and that that's the that's the the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.250 
like and that that's the that's the the
basic<00:02:33.840> dogma<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.770> genetics<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:36.260> transcription

basic dogma of genetics is transcription

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.430 
basic dogma of genetics is transcription

into RNA and then translation into
protein<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.160> everything<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.330> really<00:02:42.630> driven
