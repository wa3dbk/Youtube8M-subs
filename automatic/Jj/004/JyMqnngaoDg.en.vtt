and you have to edge as you tie you have

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.310 
and you have to edge as you tie you have
to<00:01:17.380> keep<00:01:17.500> everything<00:01:17.710> tight<00:01:18.870> come<00:01:19.870> like<00:01:20.080> that

to keep everything tight come like that

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.510 
to keep everything tight come like that
make<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> loop<00:01:22.470> bring<00:01:23.470> your<00:01:23.740> end<00:01:24.040> of<00:01:24.190> your<00:01:24.280> rope

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
make a loop bring your end of your rope

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.810 
make a loop bring your end of your rope
back<00:01:25.360> through<00:01:25.719> your<00:01:25.960> loop<00:01:26.140> as<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:27.670> doing

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
back through your loop as you're doing

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.569 
back through your loop as you're doing
this<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.180> have<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.390> keep<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.719> all<00:01:28.869> tight<00:01:29.200> and

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
this you have to keep it all tight and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.600 
this you have to keep it all tight and
you<00:01:30.579> pull<00:01:30.820> that<00:01:31.000> through<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.310> pull<00:01:33.520> it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
you pull that through and you pull it

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.340 
you pull that through and you pull it
tight<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.060> then<00:01:34.180> that's<00:01:34.810> going<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.049> be<00:01:35.110> your

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
tight and then that's going to be your

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.270 
tight and then that's going to be your
basic<00:01:36.310> tie<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.200> keep<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.500> tight<00:01:38.799> my

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
basic tie going to keep that tight my

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.929 
basic tie going to keep that tight my
tail<00:01:39.579> end<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:39.909> always<00:01:40.090> put<00:01:40.450> through<00:01:40.659> here<00:01:41.939> make

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
tail end I always put through here make

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.609 
tail end I always put through here make
your<00:01:43.119> loop<00:01:43.390> little<00:01:43.630> smaller<00:01:43.899> bring<00:01:44.469> that

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
your loop little smaller bring that

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.370 
your loop little smaller bring that
through<00:01:44.829> there<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.850> in<00:01:46.000> case<00:01:46.210> they<00:01:46.450> go<00:01:46.659> if<00:01:46.899> they

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
through there so in case they go if they

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.230 
through there so in case they go if they
sometimes<00:01:47.799> they'll<00:01:48.219> chew<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.640> this<00:01:48.850> or<00:01:49.060> pull

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
sometimes they'll chew on this or pull

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.940 
sometimes they'll chew on this or pull
it<00:01:49.270> through<00:01:49.570> always<00:01:50.289> just<00:01:50.469> keep<00:01:50.619> it<00:01:50.770> through

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
it through always just keep it through

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.090 
it through always just keep it through
here<00:01:51.250> then<00:01:51.729> that<00:01:51.939> can<00:01:52.090> ever<00:01:52.210> come<00:01:52.420> undone<00:01:53.100> when

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
here then that can ever come undone when

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.359 
here then that can ever come undone when
you<00:01:54.460> want<00:01:54.609> to<00:01:54.700> tie<00:01:54.939> pull<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.630> through<00:01:56.369> pull

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
you want to tie pull it through pull

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.849 
you want to tie pull it through pull
your<00:01:57.549> knot

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:19.370 

there<00:02:02.859> you<00:02:03.039> go

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.400 

I'm<00:02:20.380> only<00:02:20.740> getting
