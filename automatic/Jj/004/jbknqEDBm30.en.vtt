an<00:02:20.190> unusual<00:02:20.820> alien<00:02:21.240> technology<00:02:21.900> my<00:02:22.860> money

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
an unusual alien technology my money

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.010 
an unusual alien technology my money
says<00:02:23.370> there<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.330> what<00:02:24.480> I'm<00:02:24.600> more<00:02:24.810> curious

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
says there is but what I'm more curious

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.870 
says there is but what I'm more curious
about<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.010> technology<00:02:26.550> was<00:02:26.670> used

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
about is what that technology was used

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.940 
about is what that technology was used
for<00:02:27.180> when<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.140> were<00:02:28.260> insisting<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:28.890> we

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
for when you were insisting that we

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.830 
for when you were insisting that we
activate<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.580> device<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:30.570> seemed<00:02:30.810> pretty

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
activate the device you seemed pretty

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.260 
activate the device you seemed pretty
close<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.410> some<00:02:31.620> sort<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.890> revelation<00:02:32.550> it's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
close to some sort of revelation it's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.720 
close to some sort of revelation it's
like<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.450> dream<00:02:33.810> now<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:35.130> know<00:02:35.250> how<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.489> most

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
like a dream now you know how the most

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.460 
like a dream now you know how the most
ridiculous<00:02:36.270> things<00:02:36.540> can<00:02:36.750> seem<00:02:36.900> logical<00:02:37.080> when

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
ridiculous things can seem logical when

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.140 
ridiculous things can seem logical when
you're<00:02:37.590> having<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.920> dream<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:38.760> when<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.000> wake

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
you're having a dream but when you wake

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.880 
you're having a dream but when you wake
up<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.540> can't<00:02:39.780> make<00:02:39.810> sense<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> no<00:02:40.709> matter

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
up you can't make sense of it no matter

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.580 
up you can't make sense of it no matter
how<00:02:41.190> hard<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.700> try<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.720> way<00:02:42.870> my<00:02:43.050> engineering

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
how hard you try the way my engineering
