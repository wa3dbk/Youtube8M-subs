00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
Japan as we know she delivered on that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
Japan as we know she delivered on that
triple<00:01:51.479> axel<00:01:51.960> which<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.229> something<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.619> kim

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
triple axel which is something that kim

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.550 
triple axel which is something that kim
yu-na<00:01:53.430> does<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:55.020> side

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
yu-na does not do so if we put them side

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.260 
yu-na does not do so if we put them side
by<00:01:55.590> side<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> performances<00:01:56.700> explain<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> me

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
by side the performances explain to me

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.330 
by side the performances explain to me
why<00:01:57.509> asada<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.710> second<00:01:59.130> place

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
why asada is in second place

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.280 
why asada is in second place
well<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> get<00:02:00.119> easiest<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.719> explain<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
well I get easiest way to explain as a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.569 
well I get easiest way to explain as a
triple<00:02:01.619> axel<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.009> an<00:02:02.070> extraordinary

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
triple axel is an extraordinary

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.240 
triple axel is an extraordinary
achievement<00:02:02.700> triple<00:02:03.420> axel<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.229> she<00:02:04.409> ends<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
achievement triple axel but she ends the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.649 
achievement triple axel but she ends the
combination<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> double<00:02:06.180> toe<00:02:06.329> loop<00:02:06.360> so

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
combination with a double toe loop so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.389 
combination with a double toe loop so
you<00:02:06.750> add<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> rotations<00:02:07.500> three<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> half

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you add the rotations three and a half

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.820 
you add the rotations three and a half
for<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> triple<00:02:08.879> axel<00:02:09.030> two<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> double<00:02:10.709> toe

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
for a triple axel two for a double toe

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.260 
for a triple axel two for a double toe
loop<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.190> five<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> half<00:02:11.700> revolutions

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
loop that's five and half revolutions

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.800 
loop that's five and half revolutions
triple<00:02:12.930> triple<00:02:13.050> combination

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
triple triple combination

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.120 
triple triple combination
not<00:02:13.930> only<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.349> keep<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.709> speed<00:02:14.950> off

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
not only you have to keep the speed off

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.650 
not only you have to keep the speed off
the<00:02:15.250> first<00:02:15.459> trip<00:02:15.670> Bowl<00:02:15.849> but<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.569> do

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
the first trip Bowl but you have to do

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.270 
the first trip Bowl but you have to do
another<00:02:16.840> triple<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> landing<00:02:17.680> that's<00:02:17.800> six

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
another triple on the landing that's six

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.070 
another triple on the landing that's six
revolutions<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.599> actually<00:02:19.900> worth<00:02:20.050> more

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
revolutions so it's actually worth more

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.380 
revolutions so it's actually worth more
points<00:02:20.349> so<00:02:20.980> as<00:02:21.190> much<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:21.940> triple<00:02:22.150> axel

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
points so as much as the triple axel

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.850 
points so as much as the triple axel
mile<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.080> only<00:02:23.380> woman<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.709> world

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
mile is the only woman in the world

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.380 
mile is the only woman in the world
that's<00:02:24.220> done<00:02:24.489> it's<00:02:24.670> done<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> first

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
that's done it's done it and the first

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.610 
that's done it's done it and the first
time<00:02:25.599> in<00:02:25.690> Olympic<00:02:25.959> history<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.349> been<00:02:26.500> done

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
time in Olympic history it's been done

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.800 
time in Olympic history it's been done
in<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.770> short<00:02:26.950> program<00:02:27.239> it's<00:02:28.239> still<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> half<00:02:28.750> a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
in the short program it's still a half a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.479 
in the short program it's still a half a
revolution<00:02:28.959> less<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> triple<00:02:30.400> triple

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
revolution less and so a triple triple

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.000 
revolution less and so a triple triple
combination<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.330> still<00:02:31.930> much<00:02:32.200> more<00:02:32.230> difficult

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
combination is still much more difficult

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.490 
combination is still much more difficult
and<00:02:33.610> very<00:02:33.819> quickly<00:02:34.150> Kim<00:02:34.450> Yuna<00:02:34.630> eyes<00:02:34.750> almost

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
and very quickly Kim Yuna eyes almost

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.140 
and very quickly Kim Yuna eyes almost
five<00:02:35.830> points<00:02:36.130> ahead<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.400> everybody<00:02:36.610> else<00:02:36.910> is

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
five points ahead of everybody else is

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.089 
five points ahead of everybody else is
she<00:02:37.300> catchable<00:02:40.019> she's<00:02:41.019> gonna<00:02:41.170> have<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.500> really

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
she catchable she's gonna have to really

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.309 
she catchable she's gonna have to really
fall<00:02:42.370> apart<00:02:42.730> for<00:02:43.390> anybody<00:02:43.720> else<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.959> catch<00:02:44.140> her

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
fall apart for anybody else to catch her

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.020 
fall apart for anybody else to catch her
and<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.920> know<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.069> was<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.670> was<00:02:45.760> saying<00:02:45.910> earlier

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
and you know I was I was saying earlier

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.970 
and you know I was I was saying earlier
the<00:02:46.569> one<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.140> best<00:02:47.290> biographies<00:02:47.830> I've

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the one of the best biographies I've

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.340 
the one of the best biographies I've
ever<00:02:48.160> read<00:02:48.370> was<00:02:48.549> Seabiscuit<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.350> Seabiscuit

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
ever read was Seabiscuit and Seabiscuit

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.900 
ever read was Seabiscuit and Seabiscuit
was<00:02:50.380> known<00:02:50.680> for<00:02:50.860> breaking<00:02:51.250> down<00:02:51.280> other<00:02:51.580> horses

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
was known for breaking down other horses

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.940 
was known for breaking down other horses
and<00:02:52.299> when<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.810> look<00:02:53.140> at<00:02:53.319> her<00:02:53.709> biggest

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
and when I look at her biggest

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.130 
and when I look at her biggest
competition<00:02:54.220> like<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.720> know<00:02:55.840> its<00:02:55.930> biggest

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
competition like you know its biggest

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.440 
competition like you know its biggest
competition<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.739> Mao<00:02:56.950> Mao's<00:02:57.850> gonna<00:02:58.120> do<00:02:58.239> two

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
competition is Mao Mao's gonna do two

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.690 
competition is Mao Mao's gonna do two
triple<00:02:58.780> axels<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.349> two<00:02:59.440> triple<00:02:59.709> flips<00:02:59.950> but

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
triple axels and two triple flips but

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.309 
triple axels and two triple flips but
that<00:03:01.209> probably<00:03:01.599> isn't<00:03:01.720> going<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.959> be<00:03:02.049> enough

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
that probably isn't going to be enough

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.530 
that probably isn't going to be enough
because<00:03:02.590> when<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.610> add<00:03:03.760> up<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.000> points<00:03:04.209> and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
because when you add up the points and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.809 
because when you add up the points and
when<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.720> look<00:03:04.870> at<00:03:05.019> what<00:03:05.380> what<00:03:06.099> Kim<00:03:06.549> Yuna<00:03:06.760> is

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
when you look at what what Kim Yuna is

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.199 
when you look at what what Kim Yuna is
rewarded<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:09.250> perfect<00:03:09.849> skating

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
rewarded for that it's perfect skating

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.990 
rewarded for that it's perfect skating
