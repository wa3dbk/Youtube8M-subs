00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.460
 hello everyone I hope you 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.170
 go well today we find ourselves 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.150
 for testing a new phone 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.330
 as you can see it's the test 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.880
 motorola motorcycle I have a smartphone to 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.769
 low to very low prices since it costs 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.020
 around 150 euros which can 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.060
 make it very interesting especially considering 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.730
 its technical characteristics 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:39.440
 go see it in more detail it's 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:41.570
 gone and so that's for the points 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.410
 strong we start first by the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.420
 phone price 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.489
 it's true for the course at at 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.870
 around 150 euros which is 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.059
 really cheap for a phone from 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.559
 this range because it has one continues 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.800
 a course in points without a 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.000
 big screen of 4.5 inches hd so a 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.219
 screen that is diagonally a bit more 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.059
 great that we have an iphone 5 for 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.840
 a little bit if you are at the level of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.920
 processor for those who are a little 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.659
 professional or in any case who 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.600
 know is a quad core processor 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.760
 at this rate and 1.2 giguÃ¨re more 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.869
 simply said it's up to a processor that 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.770
 will allow you to turn the games 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 without problem 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.399
 which also has a graphics processor that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.100
 lets run the games 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.390
 even the most recent 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.420
 so it's really nice for those who 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.039
 are looking for this kind of use host 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.130
 then we continue with the device 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:39.179
 photo that is correct from 5 megapixels to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.829
 the back and 1.3 megapixel in the front 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.959
 so that's what you'll do 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.549
 pictures without problem the quality is 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.240
 rather correct it is not 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.100
 extraordinary but it's quite 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.829
 acceptable for a phone of this price 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.939
 there is also another benefit to having this 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.470
 phone is that you will always have 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.170
 the latest updates from android 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.700
 that is, the lot is what is 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.119
 in this phone will always be the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.099
 latest 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.220
 you will always have the latest version 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.899
 the wedge point 4.4 for this phone for 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.009
 the moment but when you go through 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.610
 example at the next update 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.259
 android 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.269
 you will be one of the first to have it and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.269
 it's pretty cool and we continue 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.250
 with the last strong point of this 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.079
 smartphone for me is that this 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.129
 phone is fun that is to say that we 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.799
 can change the back shell 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.299
 do not be afraid there on the videos there 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.980
 has no coke in the back ie 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.680
 that is to say that the battery is 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.480
 visible but here you can change 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.970
 the hulls of different colors that 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.139
 are sold by the builders to 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.370
 around 10 euros 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.019
 so it's really cheap for 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.180
 add a little fun to this 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.280
 smartphone we go right to 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.670
 weak point there are not many but 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.670
 there are still 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.470
 in my eyes there may be two 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.170
 weak points for this smartphone this 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.180
 motorola moto g the first is that 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.950
 first of all you do not have access to the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.260
 battery in any case you can see it 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.730
 but you can not change it and that 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.590
 it's really a fault for me 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.300
 since imagine that you have this 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.130
 phone for a while and you 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.660
 Feel the battery goes away 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.190
 you can not change yourself 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.959
 and that for me that's 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.850
 really a flaw when we see 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.860
 for example other smartphones where we 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.600
 can buy the battery for example on 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.989
 internet and change it directly at 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.470
 yourself for the second point 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.050
 weak I will say first of all that the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.780
 memory is not expandable by cards 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.220
 that is, you are going to buy 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.380
 your motorola motorcycle I have 8 giga 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.940
 around 150 euros if you want 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.520
 a little more memory it will take 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.700
 the model is gaa around 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.280
 199 euros but you can not you 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.590
 even add memory via a 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.720
 expansion card and that's it really 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.250
 a defect because if we want to store 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.590
 games plus music plus photos 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.540
 more videos there it really starts 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.330
 to overload the phone when you 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.790
 are aware that only about 8 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.360
 giga that are available you have them 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.130
 of accessible in reality rather 6 and 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.650
 when you are dealing with guys rather 12 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.600
 giga really accessible appointment 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.700
 directly count it's going to be a little 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.510
 difficult to store a maximum of 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.510
 multimedia
