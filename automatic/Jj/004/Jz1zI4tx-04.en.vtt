to<00:00:01.949> do<00:00:02.040> in<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.250> video<00:00:02.550> will<00:00:02.669> show<00:00:02.700> you<00:00:02.850> a

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
to do in this video will show you a

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.599 
to do in this video will show you a
simple<00:00:03.270> jig<00:00:03.570> that<00:00:03.600> I've<00:00:03.929> made<00:00:04.170> here<00:00:04.250> too

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
simple jig that I've made here too

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.400 
simple jig that I've made here too
to<00:00:05.819> put<00:00:06.000> handles<00:00:06.450> on<00:00:06.690> kitchen<00:00:07.049> cabinets

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
to put handles on kitchen cabinets

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.720 
to put handles on kitchen cabinets
you've<00:00:07.529> got<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> whole<00:00:07.859> bunch<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.160> handles<00:00:08.610> to

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
you've got a whole bunch of handles to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.459 
you've got a whole bunch of handles to
put<00:00:08.849> on<00:00:09.000> then<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.929> don't<00:00:10.110> want<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.380> be

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
put on then you don't want to be

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.070 
put on then you don't want to be
measuring<00:00:10.740> every<00:00:11.429> hole<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.420> takes<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.780> lot<00:00:12.960> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
measuring every hole it takes a lot of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.839 
measuring every hole it takes a lot of
time<00:00:13.259> whereas<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.799> can<00:00:13.950> make<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> simple<00:00:14.490> jig

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
time whereas you can make a simple jig

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.300 
time whereas you can make a simple jig
like<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.929> all<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.100> wide

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
like this and all this is is just a wide

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.519 
like this and all this is is just a wide
piece<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.789> stock<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.029> will<00:00:18.449> rest<00:00:18.930> flat<00:00:19.320> on

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
piece of stock that will rest flat on

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.400 
piece of stock that will rest flat on
the<00:00:19.650> door<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.640> we've<00:00:20.880> got<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.410> wider

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
the door and then we've got this wider

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.490 
the door and then we've got this wider
piece<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.100> enables<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.449> able<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.900> clip

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
piece that enables it to be able to clip

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.099 
piece that enables it to be able to clip
onto<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.920> door<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.580> know<00:00:27.000> if<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.900> want

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
onto the door so you know if if I want

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.259 
onto the door so you know if if I want
to<00:00:28.199> do<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> left-hand<00:00:28.830> door<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.699> jig<00:00:30.090> would

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
to do a left-hand door this jig would

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.330 
to do a left-hand door this jig would
just<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.810> know<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> keep<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.410> tight<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.009> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
just you know I keep it tight to this to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.920 
just you know I keep it tight to this to
the<00:00:32.460> edge<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> door<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.750> slide

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the edge of the door and then just slide

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.959 
the edge of the door and then just slide
it<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.170> tight<00:00:34.440> if<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.040> want<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> right-hand

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
it up tight if I want to do a right-hand

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.030 
it up tight if I want to do a right-hand
side<00:00:36.239> same<00:00:37.050> thing<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.530> clip<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
side same thing just clip it on and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.720 
side same thing just clip it on and
slide<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.700> pipe<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.829> you<00:00:40.829> know<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.950> usually

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
slide it up pipe and you know I usually

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.030 
slide it up pipe and you know I usually
make<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.649> don't

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
make like this is as you can I don't

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.110 
make like this is as you can I don't
know<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.940> says

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
know if you can see it or not it says

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.020 
know if you can see it or not it says
white<00:00:45.450> doors<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.020> usually<00:00:46.800> make<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> new<00:00:47.309> jig<00:00:47.610> for

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
white doors I usually make a new jig for

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.060 
white doors I usually make a new jig for
each<00:00:48.300> style<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:49.020> door<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
each style of door because if this was a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.090 
each style of door because if this was a
shaker<00:00:50.399> door<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.750> hole<00:00:52.440> would<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
shaker door then the hole would be in a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.770 
shaker door then the hole would be in a
different<00:00:53.399> spot<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.059> I'd<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.629> go

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
different spot because I'd want to go

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.600 
different spot because I'd want to go
Center<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> face<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> shaker

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
Center to the face so on a shaker

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
Center to the face so on a shaker
there's<00:00:57.000> no<00:00:57.210> exterior<00:00:57.750> edge<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
there's no exterior edge here so the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.380 
there's no exterior edge here so the
center<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> different

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
center is going to be in a different

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.840 
center is going to be in a different
spot<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.829> know<00:01:01.949> rather<00:01:02.219> than<00:01:02.489> having<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
spot and you know rather than having a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.670 
spot and you know rather than having a
whole<00:01:03.000> bunch<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.329> holes<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.780> send<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.199> board

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
whole bunch of holes to send one board

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.700 
whole bunch of holes to send one board
because<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:06.479> would<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.900> easy<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> mess<00:01:07.530> up

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
because it would be so easy to mess up

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.230 
because it would be so easy to mess up
and<00:01:07.920> drill<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> hole<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> wrong<00:01:08.729> spot<00:01:09.090> with

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and drill a hole in the wrong spot with

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
and drill a hole in the wrong spot with
this<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.010> it's<00:01:11.010> pretty<00:01:11.130> much

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
this but with this it's pretty much

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
this but with this it's pretty much
bulletproof<00:01:11.580> because<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.180> only<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.720> doing

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
bulletproof because I only if I'm doing

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
bulletproof because I only if I'm doing
a<00:01:13.020> knob<00:01:13.229> I've<00:01:13.500> only<00:01:13.710> got<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:13.950> hole<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> do

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
a knob I've only got one hole here to do

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.490 
a knob I've only got one hole here to do
this<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.689> then<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> different

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
this and then if it was a different

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.899 
this and then if it was a different
style<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> different<00:01:17.729> door

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
style I just make up a different door

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.390 
style I just make up a different door
and<00:01:18.060> I've<00:01:18.180> got<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.799> got<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:19.950> marked<00:01:20.130> as

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and I've got them got them marked as

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.899 
and I've got them got them marked as
well<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> very<00:01:22.710> simple<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.729> see

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
well so so very simple as you can see

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.570 
well so so very simple as you can see
here<00:01:24.689> another<00:01:25.530> tip<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.430> show

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
came with these they just weren't quite

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.160 
came with these they just weren't quite
long<00:01:35.189> enough<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.270> here's<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.840> the

long enough like you know here's the the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.080 
long enough like you know here's the the
stock<00:01:37.409> screw<00:01:37.740> well<00:01:38.400> when<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.579> went<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> screw

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
stock screw well when I went to screw

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.760 
stock screw well when I went to screw
the<00:01:39.210> handle<00:01:39.390> down<00:01:39.750> they're<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.530> quite

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the handle down they're just not quite

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100 
the handle down they're just not quite
long<00:01:41.100> enough<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
long enough that it's because the the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.760 
long enough that it's because the the
way<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.100> knobs<00:01:44.340> are<00:01:44.579> made<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.350> kind

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
way the the knobs are made so I'm kind

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.590 
way the the knobs are made so I'm kind
of<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.640> want<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.939> countersink<00:01:48.420> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
of I don't really want a countersink it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170 
of I don't really want a countersink it
but<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.700> some

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180

but what I do have is I do have some
really<00:01:51.450> long<00:01:51.810> screws<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.220> buy<00:01:53.369> them

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
really long screws here I can buy them

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.789 
really long screws here I can buy them
by<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> box<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.420> usually<00:01:54.570> get<00:01:54.869> these<00:01:55.020> but

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
by the box you can usually get these but

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.639 
by the box you can usually get these but
-<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:57.180> they're<00:01:57.420> they're<00:01:57.930> too<00:01:58.110> long<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.530> can

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
- but they're they're too long you can

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.780 
- but they're they're too long you can
see<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> they're<00:01:59.159> sticking<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.579> there

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
see that they're sticking out there

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.910 
see that they're sticking out there
better<00:02:00.450> than<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> half<00:02:00.930> an<00:02:01.079> inch<00:02:01.200> well<00:02:01.770> these

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
better than a half an inch well these

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.780 
better than a half an inch well these
would<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.250> too<00:02:02.430> long<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.189> quick<00:02:05.549> way<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
would be too long so so one quick way to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
would be too long so so one quick way to
shorten<00:02:06.570> them<00:02:06.659> I'm<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> show<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
shorten them I'm going to show you a

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.479 
shorten them I'm going to show you a
little<00:02:07.409> pair<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.710> pliers<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.220> I've<00:02:08.340> got

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
little pair of pliers that I've got

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.790 
little pair of pliers that I've got
around<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.750> set<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.110> they're<00:02:10.590> kind

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
around here it's the set of they're kind

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
around here it's the set of they're kind
of<00:02:10.860> electricians<00:02:11.430> pliers<00:02:12.060> they're<00:02:12.239> kind<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
of electricians pliers they're kind of a

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.760 
of electricians pliers they're kind of a
multi-purpose

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
multi-purpose

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.100 
multi-purpose
but<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.270> they<00:02:16.080> have

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
but what you can see that they have

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.200 
but what you can see that they have
these<00:02:16.530> different<00:02:17.010> screw<00:02:17.490> holes<00:02:17.730> here<00:02:18.060> and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
these different screw holes here and

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.420 
these different screw holes here and
there<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.570> thread<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.890> size<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
there in the thread the size of the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.670 
there in the thread the size of the
screw<00:02:20.670> holes<00:02:20.940> are<00:02:21.240> all<00:02:21.810> numbered<00:02:22.290> here<00:02:22.500> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
screw holes are all numbered here and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.130 
screw holes are all numbered here and
usually<00:02:23.580> handle<00:02:24.060> screws<00:02:24.330> are<00:02:24.630> eight<00:02:24.840> thirty

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
usually handle screws are eight thirty

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.840 
usually handle screws are eight thirty
seconds<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:25.830> what<00:02:26.010> they<00:02:26.130> are<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.700> see

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
seconds is what they are and you can see

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.490 
seconds is what they are and you can see
they<00:02:27.420> well<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.600> guess<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.900> can't<00:02:28.110> see<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.470> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
they well I guess you can't see it's a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.080 
they well I guess you can't see it's a
little<00:02:28.590> these<00:02:28.920> are<00:02:29.070> I've<00:02:29.400> had<00:02:29.670> these<00:02:29.850> around

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
little these are I've had these around

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.630 
little these are I've had these around
for<00:02:30.270> years<00:02:30.540> there's<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.470> there's<00:02:32.070> an<00:02:32.250> eight

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
for years there's a there's an eight

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.040 
for years there's a there's an eight
thirty<00:02:32.910> second<00:02:33.330> hole<00:02:33.450> well<00:02:33.720> what<00:02:33.870> that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
thirty second hole well what that

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.410 
thirty second hole well what that
enables<00:02:34.500> me<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.850> take<00:02:36.210> and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
enables me to do is I can just take and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.290 
enables me to do is I can just take and
I<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.660> screw<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.080> screw<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
I can screw that screw in to the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.000 
I can screw that screw in to the
distance<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.930> want<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.350> clip<00:02:40.530> off<00:02:40.710> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
distance that I want to clip off and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.040 
distance that I want to clip off and
then<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.520> matter<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:42.810> clipping

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
then it's just a matter of just clipping

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.800 
then it's just a matter of just clipping
it<00:02:43.230> off<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.650> nice<00:02:43.830> thing<00:02:43.860> about<00:02:44.070> these<00:02:44.490> is

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
it off and the nice thing about these is

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.540 
it off and the nice thing about these is
when<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> screw<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.470> back<00:02:46.710> out<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.190> threads

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
when I screw that back out the threads

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.490 
when I screw that back out the threads
are<00:02:47.790> not<00:02:47.820> messed<00:02:48.240> up<00:02:48.450> even<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.110> little<00:02:49.260> bit

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
are not messed up even a little bit

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.430 
are not messed up even a little bit
there<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:50.070> threads<00:02:50.340> are<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.670> real<00:02:50.850> good<00:02:51.060> shape

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
there the threads are in real good shape

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.570 
there the threads are in real good shape
that<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.710> just<00:02:52.890> take<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.520> screw<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.060> on

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
that I can just take in and screw it on

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.210 
that I can just take in and screw it on
for<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.670> most<00:02:56.820> part<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:58.800> I'm
