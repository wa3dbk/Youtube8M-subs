00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.680 
gigabyte hard drive so it's you know
slightly<00:03:23.920> better<00:03:24.220> than<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.519> 250<00:03:25.060> gig<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:25.420> that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
slightly better than the 250 gig in that

twistable<00:03:54.880> d-pad<00:03:55.510> I<00:03:55.780> don't<00:03:56.019> we've<00:03:56.169> seen<00:03:56.349> that

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
twistable d-pad I don't we've seen that

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.009 
twistable d-pad I don't we've seen that
before<00:03:56.700> but<00:03:57.700> basically<00:03:58.030> like<00:03:58.299> you<00:03:58.480> spin<00:03:58.840> it

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
before but basically like you spin it

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.089 
before but basically like you spin it
and<00:03:59.430> it<00:04:00.750> becomes<00:04:01.750> flat<00:04:02.200> like<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.650> old<00:04:02.829> xbox

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
and it becomes flat like the old xbox

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.430 
and it becomes flat like the old xbox
360<00:04:03.669> controllers<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.329> then<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.780> spin<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
360 controllers and then you spin it the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.339 
360 controllers and then you spin it the
other<00:04:05.799> way<00:04:05.919> and<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:07.030> pops<00:04:07.299> out<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.139> the

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
other way and it pops out so that the

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.089 
other way and it pops out so that the
d-pad<00:04:08.739> is<00:04:08.769> more<00:04:09.099> prominent<00:04:09.989> it's<00:04:10.989> got<00:04:11.290> black

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
d-pad is more prominent it's got black

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.370 
d-pad is more prominent it's got black
battery<00:04:13.000> backing<00:04:13.480> on<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:14.260> back<00:04:16.200> so<00:04:17.200> that's

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
battery backing on the back so that's

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.400 
battery backing on the back so that's
the<00:04:17.590> controller<00:04:18.039> it's<00:04:18.400> also<00:04:18.609> got<00:04:18.849> the<00:04:19.410> chrome

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
the controller it's also got the chrome

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.159 
the controller it's also got the chrome
on<00:04:20.709> it<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:21.190> like<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.489> newer<00:04:22.169> controllers

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
on it just like the newer controllers

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.830 
on it just like the newer controllers
that<00:04:23.200> you<00:04:23.469> see<00:04:23.680> out<00:04:23.710> there

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
that you see out there

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.110 
that you see out there
