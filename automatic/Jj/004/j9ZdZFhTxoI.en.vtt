usually find somewhere in our cleaning

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.940 
usually find somewhere in our cleaning
closet<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> make<00:00:40.680> sure<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
closet and just want to make sure that

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.569 
closet and just want to make sure that
it's<00:00:41.129> clean<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.180> relatively<00:00:42.899> soft<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.649> some

it's clean and relatively soft and some
sort<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.120> all-purpose<00:00:45.780> cleaner<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.590> then<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
sort of all-purpose cleaner and then I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.650 
sort of all-purpose cleaner and then I
just<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.489> started<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> very

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
just get started so a very

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.500 
just get started so a very
unsophisticated<00:00:49.190> approach<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.579> still<00:00:51.480> very

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
unsophisticated approach but still very

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.360 
unsophisticated approach but still very
effective<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> never<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.840> um<00:00:55.370> put

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
effective so what I never do is um put

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.189 
effective so what I never do is um put
the<00:00:56.579> cleaner<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.719> lot<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> dog

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the cleaner and there's a lot of dog

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
the cleaner and there's a lot of dog
hair<00:00:58.440> sorry<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.100> put<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> cleaner

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
hair sorry about that put the cleaner

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.740 
hair sorry about that put the cleaner
straight<00:01:01.160> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.640> strings<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
straight on the strings or the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
straight on the strings or the
instruments<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> matter<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.189> want<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
instruments for that matter I want to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.570 
instruments for that matter I want to
avoid<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:05.970> I've<00:01:06.720> always<00:01:07.560> put<00:01:07.950> whatever

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
avoid that I've always put whatever

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.010 
avoid that I've always put whatever
cleaner<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.090> use<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.799> on<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.240> rack<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
cleaner I use up on on the rack or the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.580 
cleaner I use up on on the rack or the
cloth<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.600> then<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.909> use<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.299> part<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.290> clean

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
cloth and then I use that part to clean

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.060 
cloth and then I use that part to clean
my<00:01:19.830> strings<00:01:20.900> what<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> usually<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.009> just

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
my strings what I usually do is I just

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.490 
my strings what I usually do is I just
wrap<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.909> around<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.750> string<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
wrap it around the string I want to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.660 
wrap it around the string I want to
clean<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.430> case<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.979> low<00:01:28.979> E<00:01:29.250> string

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
clean here in that case the low E string

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.990 
clean here in that case the low E string
and<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.840> slide<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.130> forth<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.790> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
and then I slide back and forth and I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.230 
and then I slide back and forth and I
can<00:01:33.180> actually<00:01:33.450> see<00:01:34.220> how<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.250> color<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
can actually see how the color of the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.990 
can actually see how the color of the
string<00:01:36.450> changes<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.770> interesting<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
string changes that's interesting and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.850 
string changes that's interesting and
then<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:42.060> is<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> effect<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.649> is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
then you see this is the effect this is

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.249 
then you see this is the effect this is
what<00:01:44.040> came<00:01:44.310> off<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.049> actually

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
what came off so I think it's actually

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.999 
what came off so I think it's actually
very<00:01:46.590> effective<00:01:47.750> again<00:01:48.750> isn't<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> best<00:01:49.649> way

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
very effective again isn't the best way

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.789 
very effective again isn't the best way
to<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:51.030> no<00:01:51.270> idea<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.619> an

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to do it I have no idea but it's an

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.639 
to do it I have no idea but it's an
effective<00:01:52.920> way<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.930> move<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
effective way and then I just move on to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.889 
effective way and then I just move on to
the<00:01:55.860> next<00:01:56.189> string<00:01:56.490> put<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.360> bit<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.689> that

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the next string put a little bit of that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.969 
the next string put a little bit of that
all-purpose<00:01:58.200> cleaner<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.549> my<00:02:00.060> cloth<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.979> move

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
all-purpose cleaner on my cloth and move

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.249 
all-purpose cleaner on my cloth and move
on<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> string<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> particular

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
on to the a string in that particular

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.530 
on to the a string in that particular
case<00:02:04.469> again<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> slide<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:06.030> bit

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
case again I slide a little bit

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.380 
case again I slide a little bit
back<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> forth<00:02:10.400> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.520> guess<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:12.030> get<00:02:12.210> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
back and forth and I guess you get the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.950 
back and forth and I guess you get the
point

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
point

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.830 
point
