had enough water and so there's an

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.660 
had enough water and so there's an
offset<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> balance<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.720> sugar<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.040> fluid

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
actually receiving and giving the way

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.100 
actually receiving and giving the way
that<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:26.610> normally<00:01:26.759> need<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that they normally need to so if you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.370 
that they normally need to so if you
hydrate<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> result<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
hydrate you can see a result in the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.859 
hydrate you can see a result in the
blood<00:01:31.560> sugar<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.890> coming<00:01:32.159> down<00:01:32.450> exercise<00:01:33.450> is
