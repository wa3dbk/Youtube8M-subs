00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.420
 Today I'm going to start a series called I have 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.610
 questions where to advocate giving all 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.830
 doubts that you readers have about 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.900
 a doubt that I think is general all 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.279
 we have what it is like to apply the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.289
 eyeliner 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.560
 I have a tip I hope 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.320
 You like it, if you want to meet the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.960
 curious to know how I applied and 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.899

 No way to make a tan mouse 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.809
 So I have the solution for you. 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.239
 solution is a spoon 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.850
 that's a spoon just remembering that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.199
 It has to be a dessert spoon. 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.670
 so tiny and okay with the way 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.370
 Correct why are we going to be using it? 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.039
 part of the way and this part here 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.530
 plump spoon what then ask 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.899
 spoon at home and come with me to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.990
 On Sunday you can use two types of 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.470
 eyeliner is a liquid that it is a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.420
 slightly more difficult to handle and a gel 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.790
 that you may be using two types 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.159
 different of brushes is the brush 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.479
 little pig to delineate and the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.850
 chad utah 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.860
 for me chan radinhos novice girl 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
 It will give you more firmness when it comes to making 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.240
 your outlined but today I'm going okay 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.110
 using my henrique of the ideal of 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.020
 Maybelline and asked if I'll get the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.030
 I'll put the rock scoop on the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.329
 the outer corner of my eye 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.140
 I do not have it, and I'll make one 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.950
 line must be right at the end of the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.759
 eye 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.759
 come on 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.049
 Okay and so you've been drawing there for a long time. 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.400
 This little piece of the spoon I'm going to put 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.290
 the tip in mine on my eyelid and 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.800
 I'll make the call 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.569
 there you see the space in which it is only makes 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.630
 the connection there that you will get 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.440
 make your outline in a good 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.980
 I promise people come the way I do. 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.610
 I'm doing it very firmly. 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.050
 He should be like that, okay, well, good. 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.170
 up 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.450
 good now that we've made the end of it 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.420
 It's the hardest I'll do the rest. 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.030
 of the eye contour always left 21 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.319
 It's going to be easier to 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.810
 you and from there you go well close to the eyelashes 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.299
 and make your line 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.250
 I advise provincial is using 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.290
 gel eyeliner that will give you more 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.989
 firmness and a brush to give more firmness 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.810
 at the time of making your outline but 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.470
 you want to use the email can also 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.470
 use ok 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.609
 just follow the line of your eye well 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.609
 surrenders to your children 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.359
 Is my friend a swab at the time? 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.769
 help you a lot here, put a 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.629
 little belly 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.969
 After all, it's your own tummy. 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.069
 end up doing the finishing touches where you 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.290
 think you need if you are dumb 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.750
 're seeing here O I'll have to put 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.530
 new such outlined 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.530
 come on 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.250
 calmly at this time who 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.319
 prontinho I think right now okay 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.120
 make the other eye the same as the 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:49.390
 people made the first 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.849
 I put it to the spoon at the end of the 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.040
 look in the outer corner of the eye and pull 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.219
 Your line up with who will stay 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.560
 so it gives you the finishing touches there that you 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:02.639
 necessary to thicken or 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.639
 tune the line further 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.280
 now you do the same you did in the other 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.569
 just follow the contour of the spoon 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.239
 fill this space apap half a spoon and 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.959
 then just get around the eye well 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.959
 close to lashes 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.720
 our outline has already been ready but 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.010
 This woman is also used to pass 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.040
 eyelash mask 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.220
 Let's learn the mask I'm causing. 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.590
 to put the smoky express volume at the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.840
 esq is new in my own brand 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.900
 until when we do that guy 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.750
 of smoky eye okay but takes any 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.630
 mask that you have in your home 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.220
 spoon and come and apply more face to me 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:55.340

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.010
 Above your eyelid 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.280
 up and apply the eyelash mask 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.950
 can you understand that we will have more 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.850
 ease and apply the mask if 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.040
 to smudge ours who has taken our shade 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.400
 will apply there how many layers you 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:17.590
 find it necessary to get some eyelashes 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.590
 very pretty and well highlighted 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.270
 do in the other eye the same thing as 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.789
 Did you do it in the previous eye? 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.870
 This woman will make your 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.870
 Life saw my friend. 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.410
 now let's go to the bottom with the 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.640
 end spoon path follow the path 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.950
 positions and below your lashes 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.900
 lower and apply the same way 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.250
 that we applied on the part of the eyelashes 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.890
 superior 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.960
 make sure that the spoon handle is 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.590
 end on the team he will disturb you 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.590
 a little there 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:03.110
 our outline is already ready 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.960
 our children are already beautiful and 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.400
 and the button you are using 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.699
 it's only 2 to 1 button is the hot cocoa this 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.180
 hence an illusion of indutative 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:20.840
 and the other is the club 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.270
 he is kind of a little face lilac he goes 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.910
 give the beautiful finish and hence your lipstick 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.729
 will end up getting well both the two 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.819
 commandments and they have and the finish is 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:34.520
 glauce who is brilliant they not only matt 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:38.180
 and I advise you to use these 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.370
 colors more so for me the darker 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.050
 Winter ark as we are already 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.900
 getting there in the ore 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.669
 Let's enjoy it, at first you will. 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.130
 find some difficulty in 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.860
 doing the outline is like this at any 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.930
 way but with lots of practice 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.060
 firmness in the hands you will achieve 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.180
 I think the spoon will help you. 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:03.229
 because it will give you the basis on her is 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:06.469
 had and this base rounded that in the case 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:08.690
 does and if this detail here from above a 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:10.820
 outlined I very much hope that you 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.340
 Did you like the tip if you liked it? 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.169
