00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
so I'm going to get started by dropping

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.140 
so I'm going to get started by dropping
my<00:00:21.750> needle<00:00:22.050> down<00:00:22.080> into<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> down<00:00:22.859> position

bringing<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.240> all<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.779> way<00:00:24.869> back<00:00:25.109> up<00:00:25.380> again<00:00:25.650> I

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
bringing it all the way back up again I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.250 
bringing it all the way back up again I
got<00:00:26.460> hooked<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.970> foot<00:00:27.150> right<00:00:27.330> there<00:00:27.359> just

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
got hooked on the foot right there just

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.650 
got hooked on the foot right there just
tug<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.740> top<00:00:29.130> thread<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.789> my<00:00:30.150> bobbin

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
tug on that top thread and my bobbin

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
tug on that top thread and my bobbin
thread<00:00:30.929> will<00:00:31.170> come<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> little<00:00:32.820> tiny

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
thread will come up it's a little tiny

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.229 
thread will come up it's a little tiny
string<00:00:33.920> pull<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> way<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.850> tuck

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
string pull it all the way up and tuck

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
string pull it all the way up and tuck
both<00:00:36.480> redtails<00:00:37.079> underneath<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> foot<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
both redtails underneath the foot and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.610 
both redtails underneath the foot and
drop<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.329> needle<00:00:39.510> back<00:00:39.780> down<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> down

drop that needle back down to the down
position<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:42.300> reason<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
position the reason that I do that is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.500 
position the reason that I do that is
simply<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.280> keep<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> thread<00:00:44.910> tails<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
simply to keep the thread tails on the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.590 
simply to keep the thread tails on the
surface<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.170> quilt<00:00:46.640> versus<00:00:47.640> getting<00:00:48.239> tucked

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
surface of a quilt versus getting tucked

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.779 
surface of a quilt versus getting tucked
around<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> back<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.770> making<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> block

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
around on the back and making the block

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.600 
around on the back and making the block
look<00:00:51.030> ugly<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> now<00:00:52.800> let's<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.100> started<00:00:53.430> I'm

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
look ugly so now let's get started I'm

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.110 
look ugly so now let's get started I'm
going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.270> basically<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.550> stitch<00:00:56.550> right

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
going to basically just stitch right

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.369 
going to basically just stitch right
around<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:58.550> rainbow<00:00:59.550> shape<00:01:00.260> with<00:01:01.260> an

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
around this rainbow shape with an

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.060 
around this rainbow shape with an
outline<00:01:01.940> if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.090> ever<00:01:03.860> overshoot<00:01:04.860> your

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
outline if you ever overshoot your

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.800 
outline if you ever overshoot your
stitching<00:01:05.549> by<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:06.000> stitch<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.659> just

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
stitching by one stitch you can just

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.590 
stitching by one stitch you can just
back<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.380> by<00:01:07.920> rotating<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> Meo<00:01:09.000> backwards

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
back it up by rotating the Meo backwards

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.660 
back it up by rotating the Meo backwards
on<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.930> machine

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
on your machine

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.609 
on your machine
now<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.939> stitched<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.390> deep<00:01:12.689> curve<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.409> this

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
now as I stitched a deep curve like this

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
now as I stitched a deep curve like this
I'm<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:14.490> sure<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> stop<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
I'm going to make sure to stop and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.640 
I'm going to make sure to stop and
rotate<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> block<00:01:16.830> often<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> I'm<00:01:19.500> just

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
rotate the block often so I'm just

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.690 
rotate the block often so I'm just
stopping<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.159> my<00:01:20.250> needle<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> down

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
stopping with my needle in the down

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.590 
stopping with my needle in the down
position

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
position

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.960 
position
rotating<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.530> around<00:01:22.619> making<00:01:23.460> sure<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
rotating it around making sure that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.080 
rotating it around making sure that
whatever<00:01:24.299> angle<00:01:24.900> I'm<00:01:25.020> stitching<00:01:26.090> whatever

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
whatever angle I'm stitching whatever

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.560 
whatever angle I'm stitching whatever
I'm<00:01:27.240> wanting<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.990> right<00:01:28.500> directly<00:01:29.570> straight

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I'm wanting is right directly straight

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.350 
I'm wanting is right directly straight
down<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> front<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.890> walking<00:01:32.460> foot<00:01:32.729> as

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
down the front of that walking foot as

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.969 
down the front of that walking foot as
that's<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> ultimate<00:01:33.930> direction<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
that's the ultimate direction that it

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.789 
that's the ultimate direction that it
stitches<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.990> little<00:01:37.229> different<00:01:37.560> from

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
stitches in it's a little different from

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.520 
stitches in it's a little different from
free<00:01:38.070> motion<00:01:38.250> quilting<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> always

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
free motion quilting we have to always

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.399 
free motion quilting we have to always
have<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> block<00:01:41.520> rotated<00:01:42.210> around<00:01:42.329> right<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
have the block rotated around right and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
have the block rotated around right and
right

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
right

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.830 
right
correction<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:48.159> getting<00:01:48.490> around<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.090> one

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
correction so getting around this one

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.770 
correction so getting around this one
thing<00:01:50.049> that<00:01:50.320> makes<00:01:50.770> walking<00:01:51.040> foot<00:01:51.400> so<00:01:51.729> easy<00:01:52.299> is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
thing that makes walking foot so easy is

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.100 
thing that makes walking foot so easy is
the<00:01:53.260> fact<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.790> stitches<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.540> size<00:01:55.930> of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
the fact that the stitches the size of

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.660 
the fact that the stitches the size of
the<00:01:56.170> stitches<00:01:56.560> are<00:01:56.740> regulated<00:01:57.310> by<00:01:57.340> your

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
the stitches are regulated by your

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.120 
the stitches are regulated by your
machine<00:01:58.000> because<00:01:58.320> you're<00:01:59.320> using<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.770> machine

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130

the<00:02:00.369> way<00:02:00.520> it's<00:02:00.700> designed<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:01.119> use<00:02:01.330> using<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.930> B

dogs<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.729> don't<00:02:03.970> have<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.149> worry<00:02:04.360> about<00:02:04.540> my

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
dogs so I don't have to worry about my

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.109 
dogs so I don't have to worry about my
stitches<00:02:05.259> at<00:02:05.380> all<00:02:05.560> because<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.520> walking<00:02:06.940> foot

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
stitches at all because the walking foot

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.270 
stitches at all because the walking foot
is<00:02:07.390> making<00:02:07.869> them<00:02:08.020> very<00:02:08.380> nice<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:08.800> tiny<00:02:08.979> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
is making them very nice and tiny and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.330 
is making them very nice and tiny and
consistent<00:02:09.819> every<00:02:10.390> single<00:02:10.690> one<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:12.190> my

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
consistent every single one I have my

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.400 
consistent every single one I have my
stitch<00:02:12.640> length<00:02:12.850> right<00:02:13.209> now<00:02:13.360> set<00:02:13.720> at<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.170> point

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
stitch length right now set at one point

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.430 
stitch length right now set at one point
six<00:02:14.860> millimeters<00:02:15.630> produces<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.660> very<00:02:17.110> nice

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
six millimeters produces a very nice

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.740 
six millimeters produces a very nice
tiny<00:02:17.920> stitch<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.580> think<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.850> looks<00:02:19.000> really<00:02:19.420> good

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
tiny stitch I think it looks really good

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.810 
tiny stitch I think it looks really good
on<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.989> 12<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.980> know<00:02:21.100> I'm<00:02:21.250> gonna<00:02:21.340> be<00:02:21.489> playing

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
on the 12 you know I'm gonna be playing

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.880 
on the 12 you know I'm gonna be playing
with<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.510> lot<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:23.080> these<00:02:23.200> blocks<00:02:23.620> just

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
with that a lot with these blocks just

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.400 
with that a lot with these blocks just
seeing<00:02:24.190> different<00:02:25.060> effects<00:02:25.780> playing<00:02:26.110> with

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
seeing different effects playing with

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.590 
seeing different effects playing with
the<00:02:26.950> stitch<00:02:27.190> link<00:02:27.550> seeing<00:02:27.820> what<00:02:28.030> happens

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
the stitch link seeing what happens

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.170 
the stitch link seeing what happens
I<00:02:29.200> plan<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.950> try<00:02:30.160> some<00:02:30.400> decorative<00:02:30.850> threads

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
I plan to try some decorative threads

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.060 
I plan to try some decorative threads
just<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.690> see<00:02:31.870> what<00:02:32.080> what<00:02:32.410> effects<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.950> would

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
just to see what what effects that would

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.070 
just to see what what effects that would
create<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.880> well<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.390> think<00:02:34.840> that'll<00:02:35.050> be

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
create but it well I think that'll be

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.259 
create but it well I think that'll be
really<00:02:35.380> interesting<00:02:35.920> okay<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.000> now<00:02:37.150> I'm

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
really interesting okay so now I'm

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.000 
really interesting okay so now I'm
starting<00:02:37.450> my<00:02:37.630> echo<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.350> stitched<00:02:38.620> down

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
starting my echo and I stitched down

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.160 
starting my echo and I stitched down
about<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:39.880> half<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.300> an<00:02:40.390> inch<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.720> overshot

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
about a half of an inch and I overshot

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.680 
about a half of an inch and I overshot
just<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.769> bit<00:02:42.010> what<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:42.970> want<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.180> do<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.510> want

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
just a bit what I want to do is I want

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.509 
just a bit what I want to do is I want
to<00:02:43.720> make<00:02:43.840> sure<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.140> I'm<00:02:44.470> lining<00:02:45.010> up<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.310> edge

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
to make sure that I'm lining up the edge

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.300 
to make sure that I'm lining up the edge
of<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:45.970> walking<00:02:46.269> foot<00:02:46.690> with<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.980> edge<00:02:48.280> of

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
of that walking foot with the edge of

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.210 
of that walking foot with the edge of
the<00:02:48.820> rainbow<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:50.620> I'm<00:02:50.799> just<00:02:50.829> going<00:02:51.160> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the rainbow and now I'm just going to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.979 
the rainbow and now I'm just going to
maintain<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.880> I'm<00:02:52.329> just<00:02:52.540> gonna<00:02:52.630> kind<00:02:52.930> of

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
maintain that I'm just gonna kind of

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.229 
maintain that I'm just gonna kind of
keep<00:02:53.170> an<00:02:53.320> eye<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.459> edge<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.880> that<00:02:54.970> walking

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
keep an eye on the edge of that walking

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.090 
keep an eye on the edge of that walking
foot<00:02:55.630> as<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.989> stitch<00:02:56.230> straight<00:02:56.560> down<00:02:56.769> towards

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
foot as I stitch straight down towards

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.090 
foot as I stitch straight down towards
myself<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:58.690> trickiest<00:02:59.110> part<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.769> gonna<00:03:00.010> be

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
myself the trickiest part is gonna be

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.270 
myself the trickiest part is gonna be
getting<00:03:00.579> inside<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:01.840> rainbow<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:03.130> it's

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
getting inside of this rainbow and it's

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.390 
getting inside of this rainbow and it's
okay<00:03:03.700> if<00:03:03.730> your<00:03:04.150> echo<00:03:04.510> isn't<00:03:05.350> exactly<00:03:05.920> perfect

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
okay if your echo isn't exactly perfect

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.720 
okay if your echo isn't exactly perfect
as<00:03:06.940> usual<00:03:07.299> it's<00:03:07.840> perfectly<00:03:08.410> fine<00:03:08.769> if<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.549> echo

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
as usual it's perfectly fine if the echo

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.289 
as usual it's perfectly fine if the echo
comes<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.420> or<00:03:10.780> out<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.470> exact<00:03:12.400> distance<00:03:12.970> a

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
comes in or out of that exact distance a

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.870 
comes in or out of that exact distance a
little<00:03:13.780> bit<00:03:14.110> it's<00:03:14.739> no<00:03:14.950> big<00:03:15.130> deal<00:03:15.340> it's<00:03:15.519> nothing

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
little bit it's no big deal it's nothing

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.009 
little bit it's no big deal it's nothing
that<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.090> need<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.299> pick<00:03:16.450> up<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.690> seam<00:03:16.900> ripper

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
that you need to pick up a seam ripper

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.620 
that you need to pick up a seam ripper
to<00:03:17.260> rip<00:03:17.440> out<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.390> how<00:03:19.570> many

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
to rip out but you can see how many

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.530 
to rip out but you can see how many
times<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.170> had<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.350> rotate<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.130> take<00:03:21.850> it<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.239> and

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
times I had a rotate that take it in and

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.569 
times I had a rotate that take it in and
out<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.900> space<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.470> said<00:03:23.950> bring<00:03:24.310> it<00:03:24.370> on

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
out of that space and I said bring it on

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.990 
out of that space and I said bring it on
down<00:03:24.810> as<00:03:25.810> far<00:03:26.049> as<00:03:26.079> knowing<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:27.459> know<00:03:27.549> how<00:03:27.730> far

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
down as far as knowing you know how far

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000 
down as far as knowing you know how far
to<00:03:28.030> stitch<00:03:28.390> down<00:03:28.630> in<00:03:28.840> order<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.200> come<00:03:29.410> down

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
to stitch down in order to come down

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.009 
to stitch down in order to come down
this<00:03:30.370> direction<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.420> just<00:03:31.690> comes<00:03:31.900> with

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
this direction this just comes with

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.990 
this direction this just comes with
practice<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.799> being<00:03:33.010> able<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.340> visually

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
practice and being able to visually

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.229 
practice and being able to visually
estimate<00:03:34.989> your<00:03:35.140> space<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:36.670> know<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.090> just

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
estimate your space you know it just

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.750 
estimate your space you know it just
it's<00:03:37.570> kind<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:37.870> like<00:03:38.049> driving<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.769> car<00:03:38.799> you<00:03:39.670> know

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
it's kind of like driving a car you know

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.040 
it's kind of like driving a car you know
how<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:39.940> kind<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.269> know

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
how you kind of know

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.840 
how you kind of know
exactly<00:03:41.860> when<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.070> put<00:03:42.340> your<00:03:42.460> foot<00:03:42.640> on<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
exactly when to put your foot on the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.950 
exactly when to put your foot on the
brake<00:03:42.880> when<00:03:43.210> you're<00:03:43.360> turning<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.750> corner

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
brake when you're turning the corner

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.200 
brake when you're turning the corner
kind<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.890> like<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.430> more<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.820> do<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
kind of like that the more you do it the

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.870 
kind of like that the more you do it the
more<00:03:46.660> you'll<00:03:46.870> know<00:03:47.100> about<00:03:48.100> how<00:03:48.340> far<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.850> need

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
more you'll know about how far you need

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.750 
more you'll know about how far you need
to<00:03:49.060> stitch<00:03:49.270> something<00:03:49.720> down<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:51.250> until<00:03:51.610> you

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
to stitch something down but until you

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.270 
to stitch something down but until you
do<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.060> few<00:03:52.090> times<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:53.620> gonna<00:03:53.800> guesswork

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
do it a few times it's gonna guesswork

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.610 
do it a few times it's gonna guesswork
and<00:03:55.150> like<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:55.540> showed<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:55.930> tip<00:03:56.320> about

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
and like I showed you that tip about

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.490 
and like I showed you that tip about
backing<00:03:56.950> up<00:03:57.220> one<00:03:57.460> overshoot<00:03:58.060> it's<00:03:58.930> really<00:03:59.350> no

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
backing up one overshoot it's really no

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.840 
backing up one overshoot it's really no
big<00:03:59.680> deal<00:03:59.740> if<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:00.250> accidentally

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
big deal if you accidentally

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.410 
big deal if you accidentally
insufficient<00:04:01.540> once<00:04:01.750> it's<00:04:02.020> too<00:04:02.290> much<00:04:03.420> that's

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
insufficient once it's too much that's

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.020 
insufficient once it's too much that's
not<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.720> big<00:04:05.140> big<00:04:06.010> deal<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.430> if<00:04:06.520> you<00:04:06.610> end<00:04:06.820> up

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
not a big big deal and if you end up

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.480 
not a big big deal and if you end up
doing<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.420> slightly<00:04:07.690> wider<00:04:08.080> echo<00:04:08.680> that's<00:04:09.220> not<00:04:09.460> a

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
doing a slightly wider echo that's not a

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.910 
doing a slightly wider echo that's not a
big<00:04:09.700> deal<00:04:09.910> either<00:04:10.260> it's<00:04:11.260> really<00:04:11.620> nothing<00:04:11.770> to

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
big deal either it's really nothing to

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.300 
big deal either it's really nothing to
panic<00:04:12.100> about<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:14.260> one<00:04:14.470> thing<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.710> I<00:04:14.890> want<00:04:15.160> you

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
panic about so one thing that I want you

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.160 
panic about so one thing that I want you
to<00:04:15.520> notice<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.120> this<00:04:16.209> was<00:04:16.360> intentional<00:04:16.720> is

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
to notice and this was intentional is

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.800 
to notice and this was intentional is
that<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.380> am<00:04:17.590> working<00:04:17.980> around<00:04:18.459> this<00:04:19.270> rainbow

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
that I am working around this rainbow

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.830 
that I am working around this rainbow
shape<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.590> walk<00:04:20.950> wise<00:04:21.250> direction<00:04:22.120> and

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
shape and it walk wise direction and

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.690 
shape and it walk wise direction and
there<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.140> reason<00:04:23.590> for<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.800> as<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.490> work

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
there is a reason for that as I work

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.030 
there is a reason for that as I work
clockwise<00:04:25.420> this<00:04:26.290> is<00:04:26.500> going<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.830> feel<00:04:27.010> very

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
clockwise this is going to feel very

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.570 
clockwise this is going to feel very
natural<00:04:28.000> because<00:04:28.440> for<00:04:29.440> some<00:04:29.650> reason<00:04:29.680> how<00:04:30.250> this

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
natural because for some reason how this

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.510 
natural because for some reason how this
is<00:04:30.760> feeding<00:04:31.180> through<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.990> machine<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:33.250> feels

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
is feeding through the machine it feels

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.190 
is feeding through the machine it feels
like<00:04:33.760> I'm<00:04:33.970> gonna<00:04:34.150> deal<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.540> less<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.050> less

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
like I'm gonna deal with less and less

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.950 
like I'm gonna deal with less and less
bulk<00:04:35.700> within<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.820> machine<00:04:37.150> if<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.720> was

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
bulk within the machine if I was

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.530 
bulk within the machine if I was
stitching<00:04:38.670> counterclockwise<00:04:39.670> it<00:04:40.300> would<00:04:40.390> feel

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
stitching counterclockwise it would feel

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.330 
stitching counterclockwise it would feel
the<00:04:40.720> opposite<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.470> that's<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:42.040> something

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
the opposite and that's just something

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.400 
the opposite and that's just something
that<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.550> pick<00:04:42.760> up<00:04:42.910> on<00:04:43.260> after<00:04:44.260> having

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
that you pick up on after having

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.430 
that you pick up on after having
stitched<00:04:44.920> this<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.280> little<00:04:45.730> bit<00:04:46.170> of<00:04:47.170> course

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
stitched this a little bit of course

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.960 
stitched this a little bit of course
these<00:04:47.590> blocks<00:04:47.830> are<00:04:48.010> not<00:04:48.190> very<00:04:48.460> bulky<00:04:48.700> they're

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
these blocks are not very bulky they're

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.780 
these blocks are not very bulky they're
not<00:04:49.120> very<00:04:49.330> big<00:04:49.630> so<00:04:50.080> it's<00:04:50.770> not<00:04:50.980> a<00:04:51.040> big<00:04:51.340> deal<00:04:51.520> even

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
not very big so it's not a big deal even

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.310 
not very big so it's not a big deal even
if<00:04:51.940> you<00:04:52.090> do<00:04:52.270> stitch<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.840> opposite

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
if you do stitch it the opposite

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.470 
if you do stitch it the opposite
direction<00:04:53.470> again<00:04:54.250> don't<00:04:54.670> bother<00:04:54.910> ripping<00:04:55.390> it

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
direction again don't bother ripping it

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.080 
direction again don't bother ripping it
out<00:04:55.660> or<00:04:56.430> restarting<00:04:57.430> or<00:04:57.550> anything<00:04:57.790> like<00:04:58.030> that

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
out or restarting or anything like that

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.880 
out or restarting or anything like that
it's<00:04:58.990> just<00:04:59.170> one<00:04:59.290> of<00:04:59.350> those<00:04:59.410> things<00:04:59.650> that<00:04:59.740> I've

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
it's just one of those things that I've

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.460 
it's just one of those things that I've
noticed<00:05:00.240> working<00:05:01.240> in<00:05:01.480> that<00:05:01.720> clockwise

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
noticed working in that clockwise

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.620 
noticed working in that clockwise
direction<00:05:03.000> especially<00:05:04.000> with<00:05:04.150> anything<00:05:04.480> that

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
direction especially with anything that

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.910 
direction especially with anything that
spirals<00:05:05.320> outwards<00:05:05.920> like<00:05:06.280> this

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
spirals outwards like this

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.430 
spirals outwards like this
that<00:05:07.460> really<00:05:07.760> can<00:05:08.060> help<00:05:08.480> you<00:05:09.110> reduce<00:05:09.230> that

that really can help you reduce that

that really can help you reduce that

just to make this feel nice and easy at
some<00:05:17.360> point<00:05:17.570> you're<00:05:17.660> gonna<00:05:17.720> reach<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.080> corner

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
some point you're gonna reach the corner

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.860 
some point you're gonna reach the corner
of<00:05:18.740> your<00:05:18.830> block<00:05:19.100> and<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.580> echoes<00:05:20.030> are<00:05:20.480> just

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
of your block and the echoes are just

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.570 
of your block and the echoes are just
gonna<00:05:21.050> run<00:05:21.290> up<00:05:21.440> against<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:22.040> edge<00:05:22.190> of<00:05:22.490> the

gonna run up against the edge of the

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.580 
gonna run up against the edge of the
block<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.510> let<00:05:23.720> me<00:05:23.810> show<00:05:23.960> you<00:05:24.050> how<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:24.320> deal

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
block and let me show you how you deal

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.990 
block and let me show you how you deal
with<00:05:24.620> that<00:05:24.830> it's<00:05:25.010> just<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.280> little<00:05:25.580> bit<00:05:25.730> of

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
with that it's just a little bit of

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.690 
with that it's just a little bit of
maneuvering<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.710> mean<00:05:28.100> that<00:05:28.250> stitch<00:05:28.490> my

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
maneuvering so I mean that stitch my

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.080 
maneuvering so I mean that stitch my
echo<00:05:29.060> down<00:05:29.650> when<00:05:30.650> this<00:05:31.310> book<00:05:31.580> as<00:05:31.760> I<00:05:31.910> progress

towards<00:05:50.420> myself<00:05:50.570> I<00:05:51.670> can<00:05:52.670> just<00:05:52.880> kind<00:05:53.030> of

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
towards myself I can just kind of

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.300 
towards myself I can just kind of
guesstimating<00:05:53.720> that<00:05:53.840> space<00:05:54.200> kind<00:05:54.890> of<00:05:55.010> seeing

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
guesstimating that space kind of seeing

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
guesstimating that space kind of seeing
where<00:05:56.200> that's<00:05:57.200> lined<00:05:57.500> up<00:05:57.770> that<00:05:58.670> goes<00:05:58.970> spaced

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
where that's lined up that goes spaced

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.390 
where that's lined up that goes spaced
out<00:05:59.480> again<00:05:59.810> and<00:06:00.500> this<00:06:00.980> feels<00:06:01.250> a<00:06:01.370> little

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
out again and this feels a little

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.430 
out again and this feels a little
awkward<00:06:01.790> cuz<00:06:02.210> it's<00:06:02.360> a<00:06:02.420> little<00:06:02.690> bit<00:06:02.780> more<00:06:02.930> bulky

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
awkward cuz it's a little bit more bulky

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.230 
awkward cuz it's a little bit more bulky
in<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.740> machine<00:06:04.190> but<00:06:04.580> it's<00:06:04.700> no<00:06:04.850> big<00:06:05.030> deal

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
in the machine but it's no big deal

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.500 
in the machine but it's no big deal
