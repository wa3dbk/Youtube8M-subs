00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.410
 work week 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 the national team won from home in their own field 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 the top institute has done that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.560
 mistake 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.560

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.080
 one in five companies 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.340
 plasterk posted I am actually 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.310

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.969
 called for every position in midfield her work 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.249
 so that denounce the company 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.649
 I'm guessing 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.479
 9 the previous record was broken at sports park 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.539

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.229
 in Roodepoort 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.229
 club Brugge

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:30.929
 7 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.559
 great plan 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:35.879
 by the keeper large number 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.879
 drove a traffic jam at the club 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.659
 like the water to keep king or pop 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.329
 after rejecting 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.900
 the hospital by barrel I had counted the number of breakdowns 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.229
 every turn 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:55.719
 puncture 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.719
 especially earning falls 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.409
 Doesinchem 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.539

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.539
 novum ap eb 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.249

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:39.179
 and not yet left 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:44.399
 appropriate language at the campsite I think finished 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.129
 the club 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.129
 Age 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.569
 per barrel the number under construction 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.149
 really link together 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.919
 the question remains 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.889
 Friday belongs to the citizen 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.889
 placed at 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:27.319
 for that save a stolen bike i don't think it is a pinkpop plan 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:27.949
 ready 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.800
 thereby 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.139
 I let myself be told go to work 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.319
 he was right 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.620
 what does it matter 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.289
 limited 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.969
