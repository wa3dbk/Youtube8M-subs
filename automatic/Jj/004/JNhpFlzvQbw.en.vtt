00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
this would be a little more complicated

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.670 
this would be a little more complicated
if<00:02:10.060> these<00:02:10.209> were<00:02:10.360> big<00:02:10.599> but<00:02:11.200> since<00:02:11.530> they're

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
pat dry them okay just so that there's

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.350 
pat dry them okay just so that there's
less<00:04:09.160> splashing<00:04:09.760> when<00:04:09.850> you<00:04:09.940> put<00:04:10.090> them<00:04:10.180> in<00:04:10.270> the

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
less splashing when you put them in the

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.970 
less splashing when you put them in the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980
