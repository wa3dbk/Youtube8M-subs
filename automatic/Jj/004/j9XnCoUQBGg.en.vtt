77 buses upgraded card in FIFA 13 but in

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.449 
77 buses upgraded card in FIFA 13 but in
my<00:03:25.990> opinion<00:03:26.110> next<00:03:26.740> year<00:03:26.860> he<00:03:26.950> should<00:03:27.130> be<00:03:27.220> much

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
my opinion next year he should be much

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.520 
my opinion next year he should be much
higher<00:03:27.670> maybe<00:03:27.940> an<00:03:28.090> 80<00:03:28.300> 81<00:03:28.750> thought<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.380> many

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
higher maybe an 80 81 thought so many

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.230 
higher maybe an 80 81 thought so many
goals<00:03:29.800> for<00:03:29.980> Swansea<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:30.850> he<00:03:31.060> definitely

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
goals for Swansea so he definitely

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.300 
goals for Swansea so he definitely
warrants<00:03:31.959> an<00:03:32.080> upgrade<00:03:32.350> but<00:03:32.470> in<00:03:32.590> FIFA<00:03:32.860> Levin<00:03:33.100> he

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
warrants an upgrade but in FIFA Levin he

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.870 
warrants an upgrade but in FIFA Levin he
