00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
easiest way to tell is you take a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.170 
easiest way to tell is you take a
toothpick<00:03:55.590> inserted<00:03:56.160> right<00:03:56.550> into<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.790> center

toothpick inserted right into the center

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.300 
toothpick inserted right into the center
if<00:03:57.330> it<00:03:57.660> comes<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:57.990> clean<00:03:58.050> with<00:03:58.530> no<00:03:58.560> wet<00:03:59.070> batter

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
if it comes out clean with no wet batter

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.100 
if it comes out clean with no wet batter
on<00:03:59.550> it<00:03:59.700> they're<00:04:00.030> done<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:00.450> then<00:04:00.930> you're<00:04:01.020> going

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
on it they're done and then you're going

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.270 
on it they're done and then you're going
to<00:04:01.170> put<00:04:01.290> them<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.500> wire<00:04:01.710> rack<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.070> cool

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
to put them on a wire rack to cool
