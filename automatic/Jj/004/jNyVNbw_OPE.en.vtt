 What do you want to achieve by being a game? 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.120
 ds a shooting game you make you are 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.680
 to build a place of oscar or bad of 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.510
 a quality you speak like that changes 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.650
 gun several times and that here in 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.680
 how did they not eat them? 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.870
 accurate and firm it is the scrum is iron 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.910
 you can see here a good find to 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.540
 was leaving his footprint well. 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.880
 firm 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.000
 the mouse also has this system 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.860
 weight that lets you leave 11 lighter 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.390
 more used depending on your style 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.160
 to play here with you can see this 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.900
 here are several 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.220
 but none of these here and can not really 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.710
 talk like that without taking your 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.390
 the predecessor he provided whenever he had 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.460
 5 and 7 of ipi 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.470
 and this one already has eight thousand and two hundred 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.410
 dp the main problem you can 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.710
 see that laser that the executive alone 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.070
 5707 took only this already takes 8,200 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.700
 set the old lion were the dns 9,500 and 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.500
 this here is a lenovo the dns 9800 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.840
 The difference is a brutal laser beyond 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.060
 be faster it is also much more 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.100
 than the old one and it shows 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.290
 has an incredible macro system that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.020
 I tested the macro I liked a lot 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.140
 you can customize the profiles 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.520
 to save the mouse profiles that you have 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.140

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.290
 macro of new scheduling possibility 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.990
