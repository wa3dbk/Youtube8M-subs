00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.980

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.980

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.010
 super voice 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.890
 exceptional singer truce warm 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.380
 really is a choice becomes a choice 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.380
 of songs that were really perfect 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 my 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.790
 there is he has a beautiful voice both 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.890
 guitarists of all and this all 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.310
 musicians moment it's not easy to get 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:02.580
 throw in the queen remake 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.580
 So here we are really extraordinary 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.370
 m 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.370
 hypothesis 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.390
 I especially appreciated the fact that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.520
 there is no willingness to copy by 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.500
 example freddie mercury early for a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.969
 unique who are friendly and that everything 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.479
 was put on music on the quality 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.399
 music 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.590
 I think it's very good and especially 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.899
 they came on the night of albums 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.850
 at the opera the dead ears of 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.560
 albums from the 70's and that's it 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:02:06.560
 purely extraordinary in any case for 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 those who really know 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.110
 2 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.900
 for a few minutes we forget that we 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.650
 is bank win pals i loved i 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.960
 listened to it all night it was giant 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.220
 is true firework land no 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.120
 I really did not see the difference with 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.990
 freddie mercury 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.990
 Great 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.819

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.469
 exceptional 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.860
 not both of them because I 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.830

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.560
 been good c is super dynamic we are 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.220

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.220
 original group 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.480
