perspective like a year and a half ago

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.870 
perspective like a year and a half ago
on<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.200> whim<00:02:18.650> because<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.100> was<00:02:19.280> thinking<00:02:19.370> oh<00:02:19.700> I'm

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
on a whim because I was thinking oh I'm

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.670 
on a whim because I was thinking oh I'm
gonna<00:02:20.000> miss<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.420> healthy<00:02:20.990> but<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.470> never

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
gonna miss so healthy but it never

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.340 
gonna miss so healthy but it never
actually<00:02:21.920> happened<00:02:22.240> but<00:02:23.240> now<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.570> think<00:02:23.930> it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
actually happened but now I think it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.310 
actually happened but now I think it
might<00:02:24.380> actually<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.220> sustainable<00:02:26.030> thing<00:02:26.450> so

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
might actually be a sustainable thing so

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.650 
might actually be a sustainable thing so
I<00:02:27.350> have<00:02:27.650> bigger<00:02:27.980> plans<00:02:28.250> for<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.880> channel<00:02:29.510> I
