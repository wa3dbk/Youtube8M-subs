camera<00:04:58.310> I<00:04:58.340> think<00:04:58.610> about<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:58.880> week<00:04:59.210> or<00:04:59.360> so<00:04:59.420> ago

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
camera I think about a week or so ago

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.860 
camera I think about a week or so ago
this<00:05:00.410> is<00:05:00.620> basically<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:02.000> molded<00:05:02.600> dad

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
this is basically the molded dad

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.710 
this is basically the molded dad
pack-a-punch<00:05:03.200> camo<00:05:03.890> but<00:05:04.580> then<00:05:04.760> blue<00:05:05.150> instead

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
pack-a-punch camo but then blue instead

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.470 
pack-a-punch camo but then blue instead
of<00:05:05.930> orange<00:05:06.800> if<00:05:07.100> i'm<00:05:07.280> not<00:05:07.310> mistaken<00:05:07.490> i<00:05:07.940> think

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
of orange if i'm not mistaken i think

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.360 
of orange if i'm not mistaken i think
the<00:05:08.870> actual<00:05:09.140> camera<00:05:09.440> itself<00:05:09.620> is<00:05:09.800> orange<00:05:10.220> but

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
the actual camera itself is orange but

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.610 
the actual camera itself is orange but
this<00:05:10.490> one<00:05:10.640> looks<00:05:10.670> really<00:05:11.090> good<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.480> I'm<00:05:12.410> not

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620

this one looks really good and I'm not
too<00:05:12.770> sure<00:05:12.980> how<00:05:13.220> they<00:05:13.370> did<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:13.550> but<00:05:13.640> it's<00:05:13.970> like

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
too sure how they did it but it's like

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
diamond camo for literally every gun but

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.340 
diamond camo for literally every gun but
in<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.150> end<00:06:02.180> it<00:06:02.419> was<00:06:02.510> definitely<00:06:02.660> worth<00:06:03.110> it

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
in the end it was definitely worth it

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.860
