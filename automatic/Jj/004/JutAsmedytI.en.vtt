00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
plate itself will slide a bit forward

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.040 
plate itself will slide a bit forward
and<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.239> lift<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.600> off<00:00:38.270> I'll<00:00:39.270> zoom<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.840> on

and you just lift it off I'll zoom in on
the<00:00:40.200> Wi-Fi<00:00:40.590> card<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.370> right<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the Wi-Fi card here it's right in the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.690 
the Wi-Fi card here it's right in the
middle<00:00:42.649> there's<00:00:43.649> two<00:00:43.829> wires<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.399> antenna

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
middle there's two wires the antenna

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.119 
middle there's two wires the antenna
wires<00:00:44.940> we're<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> remove<00:00:46.440> those<00:00:46.680> little

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
wires we're going to remove those little

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of you know a regular screw driver find

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.080 
of you know a regular screw driver find
it's<00:00:50.670> easier<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.270> pop<00:00:51.989> them<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.500> way

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's easier just to pop them up that way

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.189 
it's easier just to pop them up that way
and<00:00:54.090> once<00:00:54.360> you've<00:00:54.480> done<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.719> there's<00:00:55.140> a

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you just simply and that card should pop

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
you just simply and that card should pop

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
antenna wires back on the card while

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
antenna wires back on the card while
it's<00:01:18.750> still<00:01:19.049> out<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> laptop<00:01:19.950> assuming
