00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.620 
zoom cameras in story of Peters at
camera<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.250> pretty<00:00:12.000> much<00:00:12.120> similar<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.599> a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
camera is pretty much similar to a

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.680 
camera is pretty much similar to a
normal<00:00:12.960> camera<00:00:13.219> we<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.370> power<00:00:14.639> video<00:00:15.450> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
normal camera we have power video and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.840 
normal camera we have power video and
data<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.859> cube<00:00:17.190> CCTV<00:00:17.930> high-speed<00:00:19.850> PD

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
data this is a cube CCTV high-speed PD

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.650 
data this is a cube CCTV high-speed PD
set<00:00:21.029> camera<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:23.760> if<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.970> see<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.300> camera

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
set camera and if you see this camera

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.410 
set camera and if you see this camera
you<00:00:24.750> got<00:00:24.920> body<00:00:25.920> bracket<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.300> also

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
you got body bracket and then you also

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.580 
you got body bracket and then you also
have<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> power<00:00:27.869> supply

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.650 

difference<00:00:36.370> between<00:00:36.700> PT<00:00:36.910> said<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.300> normal

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
difference between PT said a normal

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.010 
difference between PT said a normal
camera<00:00:37.870> is<00:00:38.590> that<00:00:38.770> you<00:00:38.920> now<00:00:39.130> have<00:00:39.400> three<00:00:40.030> wires

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
camera is that you now have three wires

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.730 
camera is that you now have three wires
one<00:00:41.830> for<00:00:42.310> video<00:00:42.490> one<00:00:43.300> for<00:00:43.570> power<00:00:43.750> and<00:00:44.050> the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
one for video one for power and the

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:53.700 
one for video one for power and the
other<00:00:44.770> one<00:00:45.040> is<00:00:45.250> for<00:00:45.460> data

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.540 

you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:14.430 

you

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.530 

so<00:01:15.440> what<00:01:15.590> I've<00:01:15.740> done<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:16.190> we<00:01:16.880> have<00:01:17.150> connected

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
so what I've done is we have connected

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.890 
so what I've done is we have connected
them<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:19.270> ip66<00:01:20.270> box<00:01:21.970> right<00:01:22.970> next<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.510> PT

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
them and ip66 box right next to the PT

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.870 
them and ip66 box right next to the PT
set<00:01:24.080> camera<00:01:24.320> now<00:01:25.280> if<00:01:26.120> you<00:01:26.480> have<00:01:26.870> any<00:01:27.610> way<00:01:28.610> of

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
set camera now if you have any way of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.570 
set camera now if you have any way of
sending<00:01:29.180> device<00:01:29.530> through<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.860> pic<00:01:31.250> value

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
sending device through the pic value

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.820 
sending device through the pic value
then<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:32.540> will<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:32.870> probably<00:01:33.410> need<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.650> box

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
then you will not probably need the box

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.400 
then you will not probably need the box
and<00:01:34.400> but<00:01:35.000> if<00:01:35.150> not<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:35.930> probably<00:01:36.140> need<00:01:36.350> a

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
and but if not then you probably need a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.719 
and but if not then you probably need a
box<00:01:36.620> here<00:01:37.450> now<00:01:38.450> I'm<00:01:38.630> using<00:01:38.840> shotgun<00:01:39.440> so<00:01:40.250> I'll

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
box here now I'm using shotgun so I'll

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.520 
box here now I'm using shotgun so I'll
be<00:01:40.880> using<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.270> short<00:01:41.479> control<00:01:41.900> video<00:01:42.140> and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
be using the short control video and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.190 
be using the short control video and
power<00:01:43.150> M<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.630> I'm<00:01:45.200> using<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.770> cat5<00:01:46.450> cat5e<00:01:47.450> cable

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
power M and I'm using a cat5 cat5e cable

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:00.090 
power M and I'm using a cat5 cat5e cable
for<00:01:48.470> data

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.270 

now<00:02:01.100> these<00:02:01.370> are<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.670> three<00:02:01.850> wires<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:03.280> we'll

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
now these are the three wires and we'll

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.380 
now these are the three wires and we'll
connect<00:02:04.610> our<00:02:04.850> power<00:02:05.620> and<00:02:06.620> which<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.700> could<00:02:08.270> be

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
connect our power and which is could be

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.020 
connect our power and which is could be
12<00:02:08.630> volt<00:02:08.869> or<00:02:09.050> 24<00:02:09.590> volt<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:10.280> depends<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.759> PT

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
12 volt or 24 volt it depends on the PT

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.690 
12 volt or 24 volt it depends on the PT
set<00:02:11.210> often<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.900> get<00:02:12.050> Peter<00:02:12.710> set<00:02:12.920> with<00:02:13.070> 24<00:02:13.520> volt

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
set often you get Peter set with 24 volt

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.030 
set often you get Peter set with 24 volt
and<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.080> power<00:02:15.320> supply<00:02:15.710> will<00:02:16.010> be

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
and so the power supply will be

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.740 
and so the power supply will be
connected<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:17.590> DC<00:02:18.590> lead<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:19.660> then<00:02:20.660> we

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
connected to this DC lead and then we

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.820 
connected to this DC lead and then we
would<00:02:20.870> connect<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.290> BNC<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.940> would<00:02:23.060> go<00:02:23.270> to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
would connect the BNC that would go to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.300 
would connect the BNC that would go to
this<00:02:24.830> one<00:02:25.070> which<00:02:25.430> will<00:02:25.640> carry<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.210> video<00:02:26.570> and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
this one which will carry the video and

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.860 
this one which will carry the video and
to<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> record<00:02:28.760> us<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.450> will<00:02:29.540> be<00:02:29.660> connected

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
to the record us so it will be connected

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
to the record us so it will be connected
to<00:02:30.110> DVR<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.690> then<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.110> data<00:02:33.290> now<00:02:33.830> if

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
to DVR and then you have the data now if

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.220 
to DVR and then you have the data now if
you<00:02:33.980> see<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.250> data<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:34.820> have<00:02:35.030> artists<00:02:35.930> point

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
you see the data we have artists point

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:46.800 
you see the data we have artists point
five<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.770> B<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:38.080> then<00:02:39.080> also<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.730> earth

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.100 

so<00:02:47.810> I've<00:02:47.930> connected<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:49.130> category<00:02:49.550> 5<00:02:49.760> cable

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
so I've connected the category 5 cable

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.830 
so I've connected the category 5 cable
to<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.230> data<00:02:51.410> cable<00:02:51.920> using<00:02:52.700> connector<00:02:53.660> block

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
to the data cable using connector block

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.670 
to the data cable using connector block
and<00:02:54.430> already<00:02:55.430> connected<00:02:55.820> video<00:02:56.720> cable<00:02:57.110> BNC<00:02:57.560> to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
and already connected video cable BNC to

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.990 
and already connected video cable BNC to
BNC<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.930> data<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.980> data<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.550> then<00:03:01.760> power

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
BNC and the data to data and then power

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.509 
BNC and the data to data and then power
to<00:03:02.150> pop<00:03:05.290> now<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.350> can<00:03:06.530> see<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.890> PD<00:03:07.220> set<00:03:07.400> is

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
to pop now you can see the PD set is

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.250 
to pop now you can see the PD set is
connected<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.950> IP<00:03:10.190> six<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:10.519> box<00:03:11.260> then

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
connected to the IP six this box then

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.979 
connected to the IP six this box then
from<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.830> ip66<00:03:13.400> box<00:03:13.670> we're<00:03:13.850> using<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.300> plastic

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
from the ip66 box we're using a plastic

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:27.920
