got<00:00:35.460> some<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:36.180> woodland<00:00:36.690> scenics<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
got some little woodland scenics up I

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.810 
got some little woodland scenics up I
think<00:00:38.969> they're<00:00:39.090> metal<00:00:39.239> trees<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.550> just

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
think they're metal trees so I'm just

doing a whole potpourri to use French of
stuff<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.789> methods<00:00:48.530> trying<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> decide<00:00:50.039> on

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
stuff of methods trying to decide on

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.760 
stuff of methods trying to decide on
trees<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.059> I'm<00:00:51.149> happy<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.899> then<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
trees and I'm happy with and then you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.189 
trees and I'm happy with and then you
know<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.010> bushes<00:00:53.370> probably<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.879> use<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
know for bushes probably just use a

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.650 
know for bushes probably just use a
standard<00:00:55.199> clump<00:00:55.680> foliage<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.480> from

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
standard clump foliage and get from

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.619 
standard clump foliage and get from
woodland<00:00:57.960> scenics<00:00:58.350> i<00:00:59.120> think<00:01:00.120> i'll<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.420> i'll

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
woodland scenics i think i'll do i'll

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
woodland scenics i think i'll do i'll
take<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> guy's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.800> particular<00:01:02.190> viewer

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
take that guy's a particular viewer

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.780 
take that guy's a particular viewer
suggestion<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:04.519> little<00:01:05.519> bit<00:01:05.670> more<00:01:05.880> over<00:01:06.420> here

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790

and then take my knife and put into a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.720 
and then take my knife and put into a
little<00:01:14.000> squiggly<00:01:15.000> cut<00:01:16.159> see<00:01:17.159> how<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.400> looks

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.290 

let<00:01:21.150> me<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.420> cut<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:23.030> squiggly<00:01:24.030> edge

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
let me do cut a little squiggly edge

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.970 
let me do cut a little squiggly edge
here<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.730> were<00:01:26.790> suggested<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.740> we'll

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
here is one we were suggested and we'll

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.790 
here is one we were suggested and we'll
see<00:01:29.130> how<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.280> turns<00:01:29.460> out

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.750 

see<00:01:37.800> how<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.980> did<00:01:38.160> it<00:01:38.370> their<00:01:40.340> main<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> edge

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
see how I did it their main in the edge

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.090 
see how I did it their main in the edge
a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:41.940> bit<00:01:42.150> rough<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:43.950> not<00:01:44.010> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a little bit rough so it's not a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.270 
a little bit rough so it's not a
perfectly<00:01:44.670> straight<00:01:44.970> line<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.100> give

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
perfectly straight line this will give

00:01:47.280 --> 00:02:00.800 
perfectly straight line this will give
that<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> shot<00:01:51.890> all<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:59.420> use<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> paintbrush

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
that a shot all right use the paintbrush

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.230 
that a shot all right use the paintbrush
and<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.620> opted<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.100> using<00:02:02.370> a<00:02:02.460> paint<00:02:02.700> brush<00:02:02.910> to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and I opted for using a paint brush to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.490 
and I opted for using a paint brush to
apply<00:02:03.510> my<00:02:04.380> glue<00:02:04.680> rather<00:02:05.280> than<00:02:05.460> an<00:02:05.580> eyedropper

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
apply my glue rather than an eyedropper

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.889 
apply my glue rather than an eyedropper
that's<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:08.510> it's<00:02:09.510> gonna<00:02:09.600> be<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> lot<00:02:09.840> more

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
that's because it's gonna be a lot more

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.250 
that's because it's gonna be a lot more
control<00:02:10.290> or<00:02:10.860> what's<00:02:11.130> going<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.990> or<00:02:12.990> what<00:02:13.110> I'm

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
control or what's going on or what I'm

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.030 
control or what's going on or what I'm
doing<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.900> not<00:02:16.080> sure<00:02:16.260> how<00:02:16.320> much<00:02:16.440> grass<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.890> want

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
doing and not sure how much grass I want

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.770 
doing and not sure how much grass I want
to<00:02:17.100> try<00:02:17.280> putting<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:17.940> there<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.390> might<00:02:18.630> do

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
to try putting up on there I might do

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:34.740 
to try putting up on there I might do
that<00:02:18.810> later

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:51.580 

Oh

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.140 

yeah<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.650> think<00:02:52.770> Maud<00:02:53.040> some<00:02:53.280> grass<00:02:53.520> going<00:02:54.000> up

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
yeah I think Maud some grass going up

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.140 
yeah I think Maud some grass going up
here<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.750> little<00:02:55.590> bit<00:02:55.770> lighter<00:02:56.010> though<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
here a little bit lighter though just a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.020 
here a little bit lighter though just a
little<00:02:57.330> bit<00:02:57.600> lighter<00:02:58.460> lighter<00:02:59.460> coating<00:02:59.970> of

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
little bit lighter lighter coating of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.600 
little bit lighter lighter coating of
grass<00:03:03.650> we'll<00:03:04.650> just<00:03:04.800> basically<00:03:05.190> give<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.520> a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
grass we'll just basically give it a

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.480 
grass we'll just basically give it a
really<00:03:05.850> quick<00:03:06.360> pass<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:07.709> applicator<00:03:08.280> because

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
really quick pass the applicator because

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:37.630 
really quick pass the applicator because
I<00:03:08.520> don't<00:03:08.700> want<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.180> don't<00:03:09.390> want<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.720> overdo<00:03:09.959> it

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.870 

they're<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:40.430> little<00:03:41.430> path<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:42.060> there<00:03:43.460> yeah<00:03:44.460> I

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
they're a little path in there yeah I

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:55.550 
they're a little path in there yeah I
think<00:03:45.600> that'll<00:03:45.960> work<00:03:53.600> good<00:03:54.600> enough<00:03:54.810> made<00:03:55.380> some

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
think that'll work good enough made some

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.120 
think that'll work good enough made some
shrubbery<00:03:55.860> some<00:03:56.190> bushes<00:03:56.430> up<00:03:56.730> there<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.770> it

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
shrubbery some bushes up there so and it

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.070 
shrubbery some bushes up there so and it
kind<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.340> curves<00:03:59.550> off<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.480> right<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.020> it

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
kind of curves off to the right so it

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.220 
kind of curves off to the right so it
makes<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.290> look<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:02.360> makes<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.510> looks<00:04:03.660> like<00:04:03.840> a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
makes it look like makes it looks like a

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.170 
makes it look like makes it looks like a
path<00:04:05.010> little<00:04:05.400> trail<00:04:06.770> and<00:04:07.770> I'm<00:04:07.860> going<00:04:08.160> off<00:04:08.340> up

some<00:07:30.509> of<00:07:30.539> the<00:07:30.659> glue<00:07:30.839> seep<00:07:31.110> into<00:07:31.259> the<00:07:31.319> gravel

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:32.419 
some of the glue seep into the gravel

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.439 
some of the glue seep into the gravel
probably<00:07:33.419> too<00:07:33.719> much<00:07:34.019> here<00:07:34.379> but<00:07:34.409> that's<00:07:34.649> okay

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:35.449 
probably too much here but that's okay

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:38.989 
probably too much here but that's okay
scrape<00:07:36.449> it<00:07:36.479> back<00:07:36.779> a<00:07:36.809> little<00:07:36.989> bit<00:07:37.849> once<00:07:38.849> it

00:07:38.989 --> 00:07:38.999 
scrape it back a little bit once it

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.749 
scrape it back a little bit once it
dries<00:07:39.709> but<00:07:40.709> I<00:07:40.739> want<00:07:41.009> to<00:07:41.099> get<00:07:41.219> the<00:07:41.339> effect<00:07:41.610> of

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 
dries but I want to get the effect of

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.729 
dries but I want to get the effect of
the<00:07:41.849> grass<00:07:42.059> encroaching<00:07:42.929> in<00:07:43.049> on<00:07:43.199> the<00:07:43.289> gravel

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:43.739 
the grass encroaching in on the gravel

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:48.259 
the grass encroaching in on the gravel
and<00:07:43.889> that<00:07:44.659> that<00:07:45.659> worked<00:07:45.839> out<00:07:45.959> pretty<00:07:46.019> good
