00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.609 
leaving spaces in between your lines to
later<00:01:08.670> fill<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.960> basically<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
later fill in and then basically you

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.170 
later fill in and then basically you
connect<00:01:10.950> all<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> dashes<00:01:11.610> together<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
connect all the dashes together to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
connect all the dashes together to
create<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.630> continuous<00:01:13.290> line<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
create one continuous line with this

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.620 
create one continuous line with this
technique<00:01:14.520> you're<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.060> making<00:01:15.240> less

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
is the technique for you draw an

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.330 
is the technique for you draw an
isosceles<00:01:44.450> triangle<00:01:45.110> on<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.710> outer<00:01:45.860> corner

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
isosceles triangle on the outer corner

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.490 
isosceles triangle on the outer corner
of<00:01:46.520> your<00:01:46.550> eyes<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.150> then<00:01:47.450> bring<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.290> line

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
of your eyes and then bring the line

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.200 
of your eyes and then bring the line
towards<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:48.980> inner<00:01:49.220> corners<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.880> your<00:01:49.970> eyes

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
towards the inner corners of your eyes

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.180 
towards the inner corners of your eyes
like<00:01:50.660> this<00:01:50.870> filling<00:01:51.680> them<00:01:51.800> in<00:01:51.950> for<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
like this filling them in for the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.890 
like this filling them in for the
complete<00:01:52.520> look<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.180> first<00:01:53.480> and<00:01:53.780> most

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
complete look the first and most

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.080 
complete look the first and most
important<00:01:54.500> step<00:01:54.680> for<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:54.950> technique<00:01:55.280> is<00:01:55.730> to

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
important step for this technique is to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.910 
important step for this technique is to
imagine<00:01:56.630> an<00:01:56.810> invisible<00:01:57.140> line<00:01:57.650> that's

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
imagine an invisible line that's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.160 
imagine an invisible line that's
continuing<00:01:58.760> from<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.090> outer<00:01:59.330> lower<00:01:59.780> lash

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
continuing from the outer lower lash

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.140 
continuing from the outer lower lash
line<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.130> where<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.430> line<00:02:01.610> should<00:02:01.640> flick

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
line this is where the line should flick

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.690 
line this is where the line should flick
up<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.290> great<00:02:03.650> way<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.830> create<00:02:04.250> an<00:02:04.400> even

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
up this is a great way to create an even

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.840 
up this is a great way to create an even
cat<00:02:05.119> liner<00:02:05.360> on<00:02:05.600> both<00:02:05.810> eyes<00:02:05.990> great<00:02:06.740> now<00:02:07.310> create

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
cat liner on both eyes great now create

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.940 
cat liner on both eyes great now create
the<00:02:08.030> other<00:02:08.179> line<00:02:08.450> for<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.750> triangle<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.260> from

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
the other line for the triangle and from

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.860 
the other line for the triangle and from
there<00:02:10.160> fill<00:02:10.520> in<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.670> triangle<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.360> continue

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
there fill in the triangle and continue

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.750 
there fill in the triangle and continue
to<00:02:12.050> form<00:02:12.350> your<00:02:12.470> line<00:02:12.650> until<00:02:13.130> everything<00:02:13.640> is

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
to form your line until everything is

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.710 
to form your line until everything is
connected

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.550 

Oh

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.530 

and<00:02:26.560> now<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.849> perfect<00:02:28.180> cat<00:02:28.329> liner

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and now you have the perfect cat liner

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.569 
and now you have the perfect cat liner
all<00:02:28.989> right<00:02:29.470> they're<00:02:29.709> a<00:02:29.739> technique<00:02:30.159> and<00:02:30.340> this

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
all right they're a technique and this

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.970 
all right they're a technique and this
is<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.909> one<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.269> do<00:02:31.360> almost<00:02:32.140> every<00:02:32.560> day<00:02:32.709> if<00:02:32.860> I'm

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
is the one I do almost every day if I'm

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.220 
is the one I do almost every day if I'm
using<00:02:33.129> liquid<00:02:33.400> liner<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:34.239> my<00:02:34.390> opinion<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:34.959> think

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
using liquid liner in my opinion I think

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.839 
using liquid liner in my opinion I think
this<00:02:35.379> is<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> fastest<00:02:36.159> way<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.340> line<00:02:36.700> your

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
this is the fastest way to line your

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.569 
this is the fastest way to line your
eyes<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.560> usually<00:02:38.560> like<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.739> start<00:02:38.890> my<00:02:39.310> line

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
eyes I usually like to start my line

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.240 
eyes I usually like to start my line
around<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.120> inner<00:02:40.299> corners<00:02:40.870> making<00:02:41.769> long

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
around the inner corners making long

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.220 
around the inner corners making long
strokes<00:02:42.819> like<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.060> towards<00:02:43.689> the<00:02:43.780> outer<00:02:44.019> edge

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
strokes like this towards the outer edge

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.479 
strokes like this towards the outer edge
and<00:02:44.470> from<00:02:45.400> there<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.849> wing<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.420> line<00:02:46.599> out<00:02:46.750> I

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
and from there I wing the line out I

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.890 
and from there I wing the line out I
create<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.609> second<00:02:49.060> wing<00:02:49.239> below<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.689> first

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
create the second wing below the first

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.890 
create the second wing below the first
one<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.170> just<00:02:50.260> did<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.859> I<00:02:51.370> fill<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:51.730> in<00:02:51.849> and<00:02:52.629> if

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
one I just did and I fill it in and if

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.289 
one I just did and I fill it in and if
I'm<00:02:53.049> in<00:02:53.079> a<00:02:53.230> Jedi<00:02:53.680> mood<00:02:53.920> I<00:02:54.129> can<00:02:54.370> usually<00:02:55.030> do<00:02:55.180> this

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
I'm in a Jedi mood I can usually do this

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.059 
I'm in a Jedi mood I can usually do this
entire<00:02:55.720> step<00:02:56.109> in<00:02:56.290> one<00:02:56.530> stroke

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
entire step in one stroke

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.059 
entire step in one stroke
so<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.060> technique<00:02:58.480> is<00:02:58.690> for<00:02:58.750> those<00:02:59.290> who<00:02:59.349> are

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
so this technique is for those who are

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.009 
so this technique is for those who are
wanting<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.549> more<00:03:00.670> thinner<00:03:01.120> more<00:03:01.540> natural

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
wanting a more thinner more natural

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.410 
wanting a more thinner more natural
looking<00:03:02.440> liquid<00:03:02.950> liner<00:03:03.250> look<00:03:03.519> get<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.120> long

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
looking liquid liner look get a long

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.720 
looking liquid liner look get a long
felt<00:03:04.840> or<00:03:05.079> a<00:03:05.139> brush<00:03:05.440> tip<00:03:05.680> liner<00:03:06.010> like<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.459> and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
felt or a brush tip liner like this and

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.940 
felt or a brush tip liner like this and
the<00:03:07.180> more<00:03:07.329> flexible<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.959> better<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.379> you're

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
the more flexible the better and you're

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.170 
the more flexible the better and you're
basically<00:03:09.190> just<00:03:09.310> going<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:09.670> create<00:03:09.879> a<00:03:09.970> line

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
basically just going to create a line

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.479 
basically just going to create a line
with<00:03:10.389> a<00:03:10.420> few<00:03:10.659> dabs<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.470> line<00:03:11.739> up<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:12.010> brush<00:03:12.220> so

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
with a few dabs so line up the brush so

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.429 
with a few dabs so line up the brush so
that<00:03:12.639> it's<00:03:12.819> parallel<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.480> your<00:03:13.569> eyes<00:03:13.780> like<00:03:14.170> so

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
that it's parallel to your eyes like so

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.250 
that it's parallel to your eyes like so
and<00:03:14.769> with<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.639> tip<00:03:15.849> place<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.810> brush<00:03:17.049> as

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
and with the tip place the brush as

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.229 
and with the tip place the brush as
close<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.950> lash<00:03:18.129> line<00:03:18.370> as<00:03:18.579> possible<00:03:18.639> and

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
close to the lash line as possible and

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.509 
close to the lash line as possible and
dab<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.019> brush<00:03:20.049> on<00:03:20.470> your<00:03:20.530> lash<00:03:20.950> line<00:03:20.980> like

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
dab the brush on your lash line like

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.599 
dab the brush on your lash line like
this<00:03:22.109> just<00:03:23.109> keep<00:03:23.319> dabbing<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.799> brush<00:03:24.010> keeping

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
this just keep dabbing the brush keeping

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.399 
this just keep dabbing the brush keeping
it<00:03:24.730> as<00:03:24.879> close<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.389> the<00:03:25.480> lash<00:03:25.629> line<00:03:25.659> as<00:03:25.959> possible

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
it as close to the lash line as possible

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.479 
it as close to the lash line as possible
remember<00:03:26.530> that's<00:03:26.799> really<00:03:27.040> important<00:03:27.370> and

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
remember that's really important and

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.309 
remember that's really important and
then<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.299> dab<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.599> brush<00:03:28.629> on<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.049> outer

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
then just dab the brush on the outer

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.839 
then just dab the brush on the outer
corners<00:03:29.739> of<00:03:29.769> your<00:03:30.010> eyes<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.519> create<00:03:30.639> that

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
corners of your eyes to create that
