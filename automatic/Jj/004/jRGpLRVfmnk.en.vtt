00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
at our first example we have the cube

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.429 
at our first example we have the cube
root<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.519> quantity<00:00:23.550> 2x<00:00:24.180> minus<00:00:24.750> 1<00:00:25.019> equals<00:00:25.350> 3

notice<00:00:26.189> how<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> first<00:00:26.699> step<00:00:26.939> has<00:00:27.090> already

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
notice how the first step has already

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.810 
notice how the first step has already
been<00:00:27.449> done<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.960> us<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.740> radical<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.250> isolated

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
been done for us the radical is isolated

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490 
been done for us the radical is isolated
on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.939> left<00:00:30.210> side<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> equation<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
on the left side of the equation and

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.100 
on the left side of the equation and
since<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> cube<00:00:32.610> root<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.570> undo

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
since we have a cube root we can undo

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.190 
since we have a cube root we can undo
the<00:00:34.140> radical<00:00:34.950> by<00:00:35.219> cubing<00:00:35.790> both<00:00:36.630> sides<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.970 
the radical by cubing both sides of the
equation<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.969> cube<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.930> cube<00:00:40.140> root<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.620> 2x

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
equation if we cube the cube root of 2x

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.819 
equation if we cube the cube root of 2x
minus<00:00:41.489> 1<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.690> will<00:00:42.840> simplify<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
minus 1 this will simplify to the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.029 
minus 1 this will simplify to the
radicand<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.610> 2x<00:00:44.969> minus<00:00:45.390> 1<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> right

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
radicand of 2x minus 1 and on the right

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.900 
radicand of 2x minus 1 and on the right
side<00:00:47.270> 3<00:00:48.270> cubed<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.960> equal<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.649> 3<00:00:49.950> times<00:00:50.280> 3<00:00:50.610> times

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
side 3 cubed is equal to 3 times 3 times

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.830 
side 3 cubed is equal to 3 times 3 times
3<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:52.079> 27<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:54.329> we'll<00:00:54.510> solve<00:00:54.660> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
3 or 27 and now we'll solve this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
3 or 27 and now we'll solve this
equation<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.469> x<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> we'll<00:00:56.850> add<00:00:57.090> 1<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.600> both

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
equation for x so we'll add 1 to both

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.920 
equation for x so we'll add 1 to both
sides<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.230> equation<00:00:58.710> so<00:01:01.190> we<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.309> 2x

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
sides of the equation so we have 2x

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
sides of the equation so we have 2x
equals<00:01:03.930> 28<00:01:04.850> divide<00:01:05.850> both<00:01:06.150> sides<00:01:06.450> by<00:01:06.630> 2<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:08.030> have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
equals 28 divide both sides by 2 we have

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
equals 28 divide both sides by 2 we have
x<00:01:09.270> equals<00:01:09.650> 14<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> check<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.830> will

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
x equals 14 and now to check this will

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.310 
x equals 14 and now to check this will
substitute<00:01:14.400> 14<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.479> X<00:01:15.600> into<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> original

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
substitute 14 for X into the original

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.039 
substitute 14 for X into the original
equation<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> we'll<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> cube<00:01:20.400> root<00:01:21.049> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
equation so we'll have the cube root of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.850 
equation so we'll have the cube root of
2<00:01:22.950> times<00:01:23.430> 14<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.479> would<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.630> 28<00:01:24.990> minus<00:01:25.560> 1

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
2 times 14 that would be 28 minus 1

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.170 
2 times 14 that would be 28 minus 1
that's<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.460> 27<00:01:27.380> equals<00:01:28.380> 3<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.180> since

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
that's going to be 27 equals 3 and since

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.770 
that's going to be 27 equals 3 and since
27<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> perfect<00:01:31.200> cube<00:01:31.880> since<00:01:32.880> 27<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.659> equal

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
27 is a perfect cube since 27 is equal

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
27 is a perfect cube since 27 is equal
to<00:01:33.960> 3<00:01:34.079> times<00:01:34.770> 3<00:01:35.070> times<00:01:35.100> 3<00:01:40.520> this<00:01:41.520> equation<00:01:42.030> is

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
to 3 times 3 times 3 this equation is

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.319 
to 3 times 3 times 3 this equation is
true<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.740> therefore<00:01:43.740> our<00:01:43.890> solution<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.640> x

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
true and therefore our solution is x

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.570 
true and therefore our solution is x
equals<00:01:45.780> 14

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.220 

let's<00:01:50.300> take<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.480> look<00:01:50.600> at<00:01:50.720> our<00:01:50.840> second<00:01:51.140> example

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
let's take a look at our second example

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.650 
let's take a look at our second example
on<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.890> next<00:01:51.920> slide<00:01:52.190> we<00:01:53.180> have<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.390> fourth

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
on the next slide we have the fourth

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.230 
on the next slide we have the fourth
root<00:01:53.930> of<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:54.470> quantity<00:01:54.620> x<00:01:55.040> squared<00:01:55.160> minus<00:01:55.850> 6x

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
root of the quantity x squared minus 6x

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.930 
root of the quantity x squared minus 6x
equals<00:01:56.750> two<00:01:57.020> again<00:01:58.010> notice<00:01:58.280> how<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.460> radical

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
equals two again notice how the radical

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.030 
equals two again notice how the radical
is<00:01:59.200> isolated<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.350> left<00:02:00.530> side<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:00.950> the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
is isolated on the left side of the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.740 
is isolated on the left side of the
equation<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:02.150> now<00:02:02.270> we're<00:02:02.420> going<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.600> raise

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
equation so now we're going to raise

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.330 
equation so now we're going to raise
both<00:02:02.780> sides<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.620> equation<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.280> power

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
both sides of the equation to the power

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.610 
both sides of the equation to the power
of<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.760> index<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.450> since<00:02:06.050> we<00:02:06.170> have<00:02:06.260> a<00:02:06.290> fourth

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
of the index and since we have a fourth

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.320 
of the index and since we have a fourth
root<00:02:06.860> we're<00:02:07.130> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.310> raise<00:02:07.460> both<00:02:07.820> sides<00:02:07.880> of

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
root we're going to raise both sides of

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.520 
root we're going to raise both sides of
the<00:02:08.450> equation<00:02:08.960> to<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.140> power<00:02:09.290> of<00:02:09.590> four<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.470> on

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.290 
the equation to the power of four so on
the<00:02:12.620> left<00:02:12.830> side<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:13.760> simplifies<00:02:14.270> perfectly

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
the left side this simplifies perfectly

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.110 
the left side this simplifies perfectly
to<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.320> radicand<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:16.070> x<00:02:16.280> squared<00:02:17.560> minus<00:02:18.560> 6x

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
to the radicand of x squared minus 6x

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.460 
to the radicand of x squared minus 6x
and<00:02:20.120> on<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.300> right<00:02:20.480> side<00:02:20.510> two<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.200> fourth

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
and on the right side two to the fourth

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.770 
and on the right side two to the fourth
would<00:02:22.220> be<00:02:22.250> two<00:02:22.550> times<00:02:22.880> two<00:02:23.180> times<00:02:23.210> two<00:02:23.660> times

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
would be two times two times two times

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.820 
would be two times two times two times
two<00:02:24.260> which<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.160> equal<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.550> 16<00:02:26.500> here<00:02:27.500> we<00:02:27.650> have<00:02:27.800> a

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
two which is equal to 16 here we have a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.070 
two which is equal to 16 here we have a
quadratic<00:02:28.130> equation<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.910> solve<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.810> we'll<00:02:29.930> set

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
quadratic equation to solve so we'll set

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.050 
quadratic equation to solve so we'll set
it<00:02:30.170> equal<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.410> zero<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:31.040> solve<00:02:31.640> by<00:02:31.850> factoring

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
it equal to zero and solve by factoring

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.480 
it equal to zero and solve by factoring
so<00:02:32.720> we'll<00:02:32.810> subtract<00:02:33.170> 16<00:02:33.710> on<00:02:33.920> both<00:02:34.100> sides<00:02:34.340> of

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
so we'll subtract 16 on both sides of

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.640 
so we'll subtract 16 on both sides of
the<00:02:34.550> equation<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.720> we<00:02:38.810> have<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.960> zero<00:02:39.320> on<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
the equation so we have a zero on the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.310 
the equation so we have a zero on the
right<00:02:39.830> side<00:02:40.160> left<00:02:41.150> side<00:02:41.270> we<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.690> x<00:02:41.900> squared

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
right side left side we have x squared

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.200 
right side left side we have x squared
minus<00:02:43.190> 6x<00:02:43.700> minus<00:02:44.080> 16<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.760> if<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:46.940> does<00:02:47.180> factor

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
minus 6x minus 16 so if this does factor

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.470 
minus 6x minus 16 so if this does factor
it'll<00:02:47.750> factor<00:02:47.870> into<00:02:48.230> two<00:02:48.530> binomial<00:02:49.100> factors

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
it'll factor into two binomial factors

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.940 
it'll factor into two binomial factors
the<00:02:50.480> first<00:02:50.720> terms<00:02:51.050> must<00:02:51.440> come<00:02:51.710> from<00:02:51.830> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
the first terms must come from the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.949 
the first terms must come from the
factors<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.280> x<00:02:52.490> squared<00:02:52.700> which<00:02:53.210> would<00:02:53.600> be<00:02:53.660> X

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
factors of x squared which would be X

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.620 
factors of x squared which would be X
and<00:02:54.320> X<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:54.980> now<00:02:55.880> we<00:02:55.940> want<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.270> factors<00:02:56.420> of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
and X and now we want the factors of

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.790 
and X and now we want the factors of
negative<00:02:56.989> 16<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:58.190> add<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.640> negative<00:02:58.790> 8<00:02:59.180> and

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
negative 16 that add to negative 8 and

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.650 
negative 16 that add to negative 8 and
since<00:03:00.800> negative<00:03:01.070> 8<00:03:01.430> times<00:03:01.670> 2<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.390> equal<00:03:02.630> to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
since negative 8 times 2 is equal to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.770 
since negative 8 times 2 is equal to
negative<00:03:02.870> 16<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.860> negative<00:03:04.790> 8<00:03:04.940> plus<00:03:04.970> 2<00:03:05.570> is

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
negative 16 and negative 8 plus 2 is

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.680 
negative 16 and negative 8 plus 2 is
equal<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:06.200> negative<00:03:06.410> 6<00:03:07.239> one<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.390> factors

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
equal to negative 6 one of the factors

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.040 
equal to negative 6 one of the factors
will<00:03:08.840> be<00:03:08.870> X<00:03:09.140> minus<00:03:09.410> 8<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.480> one<00:03:11.480> factor<00:03:11.870> will<00:03:11.989> be

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
will be X minus 8 and one factor will be

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.090 
will be X minus 8 and one factor will be
X<00:03:12.290> plus<00:03:12.560> 2<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:15.200> this<00:03:15.350> product<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.739> equal<00:03:15.980> to

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
X plus 2 so this product is equal to

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.640 
X plus 2 so this product is equal to
zero<00:03:16.370> when<00:03:16.610> X<00:03:16.790> minus<00:03:17.150> 8<00:03:17.360> is<00:03:17.510> equal<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.780> 0<00:03:18.080> or<00:03:18.380> x

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
zero when X minus 8 is equal to 0 or x

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.140 
zero when X minus 8 is equal to 0 or x
equals<00:03:18.800> 8<00:03:19.310> or<00:03:20.560> when<00:03:21.560> X<00:03:21.860> plus<00:03:22.130> 2<00:03:22.340> equals<00:03:22.670> 0

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
equals 8 or when X plus 2 equals 0

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.100 
equals 8 or when X plus 2 equals 0
or<00:03:23.209> when<00:03:23.720> x<00:03:23.900> equals<00:03:24.350> negative<00:03:24.709> 2<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:26.110> now

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
or when x equals negative 2 and now

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.600 
or when x equals negative 2 and now
we'll<00:03:27.230> perform<00:03:27.320> substitution<00:03:27.890> into<00:03:28.459> the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
we'll perform substitution into the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.100 
we'll perform substitution into the
original<00:03:28.760> equation<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.630> make<00:03:29.750> sure<00:03:29.989> that

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
original equation to make sure that

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.100 
original equation to make sure that
these<00:03:30.230> solutions<00:03:30.500> actually<00:03:31.160> work<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.840> when<00:03:32.959> X

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
these solutions actually work so when X

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.960 
these solutions actually work so when X
is<00:03:33.230> equal<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.500> 8<00:03:33.739> we<00:03:34.130> would<00:03:34.310> have<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.700> fourth

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
is equal to 8 we would have the fourth

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.260 
is equal to 8 we would have the fourth
root<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:36.970> 8<00:03:37.970> squared<00:03:38.540> at<00:03:38.660> 64<00:03:39.400> minus<00:03:40.400> 6<00:03:40.640> times<00:03:40.940> 8

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
root of 8 squared at 64 minus 6 times 8

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.010 
root of 8 squared at 64 minus 6 times 8
that's<00:03:41.300> 48

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
that's 48

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.460 
that's 48
well<00:03:42.709> 64<00:03:43.280> minus<00:03:43.550> 48<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.000> 16<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.020> that<00:03:45.080> fourth

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
well 64 minus 48 is 16 so that fourth

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.050 
well 64 minus 48 is 16 so that fourth
root<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.800> 16<00:03:46.040> equals<00:03:46.880> 2<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:48.290> since<00:03:49.190> 16<00:03:49.760> is

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
root of 16 equals 2 and since 16 is

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.060 
root of 16 equals 2 and since 16 is
equal<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.450> 2<00:03:51.320> to<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.440> fourth<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:54.590> is<00:03:54.800> true

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
equal to 2 to the fourth this is true

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.060 
equal to 2 to the fourth this is true
and<00:03:55.390> therefore<00:03:56.390> x<00:03:56.780> equals<00:03:56.959> 8<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.320> a<00:03:57.500> solution

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
and therefore x equals 8 is a solution

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.600 
and therefore x equals 8 is a solution
and<00:03:58.310> now<00:03:58.850> we'll<00:03:59.030> check<00:03:59.210> x<00:03:59.450> equals<00:03:59.570> negative<00:04:00.110> 2

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
and now we'll check x equals negative 2

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.370 
and now we'll check x equals negative 2
and<00:04:02.610> when<00:04:02.760> x<00:04:02.910> equals<00:04:03.240> negative<00:04:03.480> 2<00:04:03.930> we'd<00:04:04.200> have

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
and when x equals negative 2 we'd have

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.160 
and when x equals negative 2 we'd have
the<00:04:04.530> fourth<00:04:04.830> root<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.750> negative<00:04:06.750> 2<00:04:06.900> squared

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
the fourth root of negative 2 squared

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.440 
the fourth root of negative 2 squared
that's<00:04:07.200> 4<00:04:08.990> minus<00:04:09.990> 6<00:04:10.650> times<00:04:11.010> negative<00:04:11.280> 2<00:04:11.670> which

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
that's 4 minus 6 times negative 2 which

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.330 
that's 4 minus 6 times negative 2 which
would<00:04:12.570> be<00:04:12.630> minus<00:04:13.080> negative<00:04:13.410> 12<00:04:13.620> or<00:04:13.770> plus<00:04:14.010> 12

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
would be minus negative 12 or plus 12

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.319 
would be minus negative 12 or plus 12
equals<00:04:15.650> 2<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.220> notice<00:04:17.760> how<00:04:17.910> we<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
equals 2 and notice how we have the

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.590 
equals 2 and notice how we have the
fourth<00:04:18.600> root<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.870> 16<00:04:19.079> again<00:04:20.150> equals<00:04:21.150> 2<00:04:21.420> which

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
fourth root of 16 again equals 2 which

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.260 
fourth root of 16 again equals 2 which
we<00:04:21.780> know<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.079> true<00:04:22.380> from<00:04:22.680> above<00:04:22.980> and<00:04:23.270> therefore

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
we know is true from above and therefore

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.120 
we know is true from above and therefore
