00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.150
 The 150th anniversary of the present solder concert 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.470
 If you live in 2012 you will be 150 years old 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:22.110
 I play mainly on Debussy music 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:26.510
 Initially, everyone's probably most of Arabesque This is made to ask 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:30.780
 Though I think your Zonchi early works for Mr. Odovi 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:36.750
 I think the moonlight is a good song that you all know well 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:43.110
 And the reflection of water that is said to have established Dieu st 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:48.579
 This is how the water is beautifully lapped as it receives the light 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:53.079
 I choose to in this 1 Naa concert such my favorite songs 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:58.780
 The island of pleasure calms down per order 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:02.210
 Flax haired maiden é¯‰ many alternative cake walk etc 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.200
 Lined up in the era Dobissy wrote 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.619
 Every song is very pictorial and 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:15.730
 Full of color in a regular poetic 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:22.480
 I think you can enjoy the style that is different from other composition cars 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:26.380
 And finally the bc played last year until it was a good practice song 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:33.310
 Oh-I will play several songs from that practice song 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:36.460
 This is a very abstract style and totally different from previous vc familiarity 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:42.980
 Please enjoy that feeling 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:48.350
 On the other hand, there is also a party to play the Mozart's Turkish March song 's sky song 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.860
 This is probably the most famous of Mozart's piano sonatas, but 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.470
 Is 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:59.390
 At that time very unusual composition was said to be composition method 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:04.130
 Mozart was like a cymbal at that time or something, and in a minute 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.420
 This sounds like a toy piano with the things like make a miscellaneous 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:13.110
 It is said to have played a Turkish March 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.330
 Turkey was very exotic in Austria at that time, wasn't it? 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.690
 One movement is very kind 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.080
 It is the making of the main theme and parallel music 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:28.810
 Actually this song is called piano sonata 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:31.870
 I can't find your form in music theory 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.080
 The unusual work was most famous from now on 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.790
 I think that Mozart is also fresh 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.860
 It will be in the middle of the heat , but to be seen by everyone at this solder concert 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.000
 Also look forward to 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.000
 Thanking you in advance
