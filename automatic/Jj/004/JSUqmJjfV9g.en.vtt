00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
up that another neglected forklift for a

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.179 
up that another neglected forklift for a
pair<00:00:06.359> it's<00:00:07.109> actually<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> traded<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.099> other

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
pair it's actually a traded on the other

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.129 
pair it's actually a traded on the other
one<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.820> had<00:00:09.179> before<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.750> High<00:00:09.900> stuff

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
one that I I had before the High stuff

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.220 
one that I I had before the High stuff
now<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.130> finished<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.670> gone

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.779 

yeah<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:16.410> told<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:16.859> not<00:00:16.920> running<00:00:17.250> there's<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
yeah I'm told it's not running there's a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.140 
yeah I'm told it's not running there's a
ring<00:00:18.000> gear<00:00:18.150> problem<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.660> brakes<00:00:18.869> don't<00:00:19.050> work

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
ring gear problem the brakes don't work

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.349 
ring gear problem the brakes don't work
I<00:00:22.100> think<00:00:23.100> hydraulics<00:00:23.670> still<00:00:23.910> work<00:00:24.119> but

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
I think hydraulics still work but

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.290 
I think hydraulics still work but
obviously<00:00:25.019> they're<00:00:25.199> leaking<00:00:25.730> seal<00:00:26.730> their

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
obviously they're leaking seal their

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.220 
obviously they're leaking seal their
commander<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:27.869> out<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.580> room<00:00:30.590> so

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
commander that's out of that to room so

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.720 
commander that's out of that to room so
apparently<00:00:34.230> batteries<00:00:34.890> keep<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.309> flat<00:00:35.550> so

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
apparently batteries keep going flat so

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.959 
apparently batteries keep going flat so
I'd<00:00:35.850> say<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> old<00:00:36.329> man<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.630> probably<00:00:36.809> dead

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
I'd say the old man is probably dead

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.910 
I'd say the old man is probably dead
what<00:00:38.969> kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.270> motor<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.260> could<00:00:40.770> be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
what kind of motor is this could be

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.080 
what kind of motor is this could be
an<00:00:41.010> astronaut<00:00:41.370> theorists<00:00:41.820> motor<00:00:42.530> or<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> satin

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
an astronaut theorists motor or a satin

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
an astronaut theorists motor or a satin
not<00:00:45.090> sure<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> look<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> engine

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
not sure I have to look up the engine

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.090 
not sure I have to look up the engine
code<00:00:48.260> doesn't<00:00:49.260> look<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:49.980> oil

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
code doesn't look like it's had an oil

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.590 
code doesn't look like it's had an oil
change<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.550> any<00:00:50.700> under<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> bonnet

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
change or any under the bonnet

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.680 
change or any under the bonnet
maintenance<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.320> million<00:00:52.590> years<00:00:53.690> coolant

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
maintenance in a million years coolant

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.430 
maintenance in a million years coolant
leaking<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.610> thermostat<00:00:56.610> housing

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
leaking out of the thermostat housing

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.099 
leaking out of the thermostat housing
so<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:59.100> right<00:00:59.160> yeah<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.609> radio<00:00:59.969> looks<00:01:00.270> looks

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
so all right yeah that radio looks looks

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.969 
so all right yeah that radio looks looks
as<00:01:01.320> old<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.680> me<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.909> we'll<00:01:05.909> give<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:06.979> I'd

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
as old as me so we'll give it a go I'd

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.380 
as old as me so we'll give it a go I'd
say<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> brakes<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
say the brakes are really is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.420 
say the brakes are really is
there's<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> bottle<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.320> brake<00:01:10.619> fluid<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
there's a bottle of brake fluid on the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:22.149 
there's a bottle of brake fluid on the
back<00:01:11.729> permanently<00:01:12.710> handbrake

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
clicking under the bonnet here or under

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.800 
clicking under the bonnet here or under
the<00:02:33.560> control<00:02:33.980> panel<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.400> should<00:02:34.610> stay<00:02:34.850> the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the control panel I should stay the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.970 
the control panel I should stay the
clicking<00:02:36.170> under<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.410> bonnet<00:02:36.590> was<00:02:36.770> that

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
clicking under the bonnet was that

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.300 
clicking under the bonnet was that
really<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.860> flasher<00:02:40.610> unit<00:02:44.860> no<00:02:45.860> see<00:02:46.160> if<00:02:46.220> it

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
really the flasher unit no see if it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:03:07.740 
really the flasher unit no see if it
starts<00:02:46.670> again

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:28.270 

very<00:03:08.750> long<00:03:13.030> wanda<00:03:15.040> needs<00:03:16.040> ignition<00:03:16.610> work<00:03:27.280> and

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
very long wanda needs ignition work and

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:37.600 
very long wanda needs ignition work and
a<00:03:28.370> ring<00:03:28.550> gear<00:03:35.620> yeah<00:03:36.620> that's<00:03:37.100> probably<00:03:37.280> why<00:03:37.580> i

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
a ring gear yeah that's probably why i

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.120 
a ring gear yeah that's probably why i
was<00:03:38.000> told<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.300> was<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:39.530> stops<00:03:39.890> in<00:03:40.040> the
