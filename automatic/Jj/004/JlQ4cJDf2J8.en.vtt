comes with four point Android 4.1.2
which<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.190> strange<00:02:38.520> because<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.590> phone

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
which is strange because the the phone

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.270 
which is strange because the the phone
which<00:02:41.100> is<00:02:41.330> slightly<00:02:42.330> lower<00:02:43.320> than<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.130> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
which is slightly lower than this in the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.070 
which is slightly lower than this in the
in<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:44.910> same<00:02:45.120> family<00:02:45.570> which<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
in the in the same family which is the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.310 
in the in the same family which is the
desire<00:02:46.620> 601<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.730> comes<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.210> Android<00:02:48.630> 4.2

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
desire 601 that comes with Android 4.2

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.990 
desire 601 that comes with Android 4.2
so<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:50.010> strange<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.640> comes<00:02:50.880> with

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
so it's strange that this comes with

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.260 
so it's strange that this comes with
