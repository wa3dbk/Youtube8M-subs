can<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.100> see<00:04:14.280> this

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.640 

and<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.150> just<00:04:18.389> think<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.319> a<00:04:19.380> little

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
and I just think that this is a little

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.390 
and I just think that this is a little
more<00:04:19.949> um<00:04:21.470> special<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.650> guess<00:04:22.710> than<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.220> regular

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
more um special I guess than a regular

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.850 
more um special I guess than a regular
ponytail<00:04:24.060> but<00:04:24.270> it's<00:04:24.419> still<00:04:24.780> especially<00:04:25.770> if

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
ponytail but it's still especially if

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.550 
ponytail but it's still especially if
you<00:04:25.949> have<00:04:25.979> a<00:04:26.099> little<00:04:26.250> bit<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.490> shorter<00:04:26.910> pieces

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
you have a little bit of shorter pieces

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.350 
you have a little bit of shorter pieces
it<00:04:28.560> really<00:04:28.979> helps<00:04:29.430> keep<00:04:29.699> it<00:04:29.849> off<00:04:29.940> your<00:04:29.970> face

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
it really helps keep it off your face

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.170 
it really helps keep it off your face
especially<00:04:31.199> on<00:04:31.349> a<00:04:31.380> windy<00:04:31.830> day<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.699> hope<00:04:33.090> that
