00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I'm Center right up through there

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.400 
I'm Center right up through there
hopefully<00:00:15.420> just<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.960> right<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
hopefully just to the right of that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.500 
hopefully just to the right of that
little<00:00:16.710> hemlock<00:00:17.100> up<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.670> see<00:00:17.880> up<00:00:18.060> there<00:00:18.359> on

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
little hemlock up you see up there on

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.450 
little hemlock up you see up there on
the<00:00:18.570> left<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.770> cut<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.100> off<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the left and I cut that off at a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.450 
the left and I cut that off at a
diagonal<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.300> if<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.199> does<00:00:22.380> happen<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.830> hit

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
diagonal so if it does happen to hit

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.009 
diagonal so if it does happen to hit
right<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> edge<00:00:24.300> there<00:00:24.330> it'll<00:00:24.869> hopefully

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
right on the edge there it'll hopefully

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
right on the edge there it'll hopefully
kick<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.130> over<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.550> right<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.150> did<00:00:27.330> some

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
kick it over to the right and I did some

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.220 
kick it over to the right and I did some
cribbing<00:00:29.039> right<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:30.080> hopefully<00:00:31.080> it'll

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
cribbing right here hopefully it'll

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.020 
cribbing right here hopefully it'll
shear<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:31.949> over<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:32.759> as

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
shear this but over to the right as

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.970 
shear this but over to the right as
opposed<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.050> left<00:00:34.440> where<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
opposed to going to the left where the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.700 
opposed to going to the left where the
domestic<00:00:35.460> water<00:00:35.670> source<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.559> reason

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
domestic water source is and the reason

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.160 
domestic water source is and the reason

I put those little piles in there's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.630 
I put those little piles in there's
because<00:00:40.440> there's<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> water<00:00:40.890> line<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.309> goes<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
because there's a water line it goes to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.240 
because there's a water line it goes to
the<00:00:41.730> house<00:00:42.290> in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.680> ground<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.600> would<00:00:45.600> help<00:00:45.870> my

cinematographer Eric we're going to see
if<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> will<00:00:51.090> work<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:55.910> hopefully<00:00:56.910> this

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
