 saint martin on christopher froome 1 he 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.840
 could have left the turn one he was 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 off-side 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.110
 lille and the outgoing winner it was necessary 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 to remobilize as did Roman 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.899
 bardet too hat that's really 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.760
 of champion character his first 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.100
 victory in 2015 his fifth victory 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.219
 on the tour de France and it is 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.890
 demonstrative 110 long bravo bravo to 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.780
 vincenzo nibali who stands out here at the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.240
 cough the sybelles and he will come 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.720
 to die in 40 seconds 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.630
 nairo quintana who will get closer to 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.189
 just a little bit of the shirt 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.960
 yellow christopher froome a little bit of 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.210
 plume also for the little Colombian 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.920
 who definitely ensures his jersey 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.570
 white but will be the best youngster of 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 Tour de France will descend under the 3 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.030
 minutes in the overall standings it's going 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.680
 maybe give him some ideas for 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.620
 tomorrow's stage is perhaps made 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.010
 account 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.390
 maybe not if the period that his 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.040
 vision just now we will mark the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.780
 minds but maybe he's 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.670
 winnable on the last alpine stage 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.710
 he may not be untouchable 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.590
 British anyway that's the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.780
 second place for a kintana aero who 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.280
 ends in 43 seconds of vincenzo nibali 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.060
 and christopher froome that's wrong 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.310
 dropped big thing 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.310
 twenty seconds 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.689
 this is christopher froome who had when 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.549
 even lost a lot of teammate we are 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.050
 at 20 seconds so it will be a little bit 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.250
 more at the christopher froome third 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.410
 from step to cough 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.480
 it can be a good day your simon 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.480
