00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
decided where to react to the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.070 
decided where to react to the
architecture<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.580> there<00:02:42.849> is<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.080> dialogue

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
architecture so there is a dialogue

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.789 
architecture so there is a dialogue
between<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:45.629> layout<00:02:46.629> of<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.959> exhibition<00:02:47.080> the

displays of the exhibition and and the

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.890 
displays of the exhibition and and the
architecture<00:02:51.790> which<00:02:51.909> is<00:02:51.940> really<00:02:52.690> very

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
architecture which is really very

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.680 
architecture which is really very
interesting<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.980> then<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.360> small

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
interesting and then you have the small

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.990 
interesting and then you have the small
architectures<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.799> his<00:02:57.040> jewelry<00:02:57.730> pieces

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
architectures of his jewelry pieces

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.670

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
because he works in a very specific way

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.059 
because he works in a very specific way
-<00:03:02.849> he<00:03:03.849> understands<00:03:04.450> jewelry<00:03:05.170> as<00:03:05.409> something

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069
