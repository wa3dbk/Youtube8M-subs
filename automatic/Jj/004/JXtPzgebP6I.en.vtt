00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.200
 throughout history mankind 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.290
 has lived ambiguity between the lie and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.389
 the truth of it are part of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.299
 countless myths that revolve around 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.150
 many fields of our life including the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.789
 of the food the chicken has been 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.460
 victim of myths discrediting and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.150
 wrong information that the chicken is 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.619
 injected with false hormones that the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.660
 hormones accelerate their false growth 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.410
 that precocious puberty of children 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.660
 should the consumption of fake chicken is clear 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 that ignorance added to the lack of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.670
 information manage to distort the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.460
 true for many years we have heard 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.890
 absurd rumors product of the lack of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.120
 information and from a voice to a negative voice 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.120
 that has transcended generations 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.610
 actually the chicken is one of the 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.100
 most desired foods in all the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.469
 world with a high nutritional value with 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.110
 a significant content of vitamins and 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.270
 minerals an achievable price and a 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.190
 great culinary versatility for the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.850
 huge variety of preparations that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.290
 allow this if it is true 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.360
 scientists and international experts 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.060
 warn that the use of hormones in 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.100
 poultry industry is just a myth because 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.979
 that such hormones do not even 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.720
 exist in the market the chicken is a 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.210
 animal that he has throughout his 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.310
 breeding an extraordinary ability to 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.950
 growth due to which 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.570
 sacrifices being very young this makes 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.909
 impossible for hormones to be 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.020
 assimilated by the birds in a period of 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.299
 life so short in the 50s a 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.060
 chicken was fed for 100 days 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:52.360
 to reach a weight of 2.1 kilograms 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.600
 at the end of the 60's the time was reduced 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.649
 to 67 days and is currently ready 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.740
 to go to market between 42 and 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.049
 45 days this is possible only thanks to the 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.509
 breakthrough in crossing races like that 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.929
 like the right nutrition and the right 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.209
 management that birds receive 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.790
 as from the poultry farms daily 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.680
 go to market the thousands of chickens 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.200
 injecting the hormones would require 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.290
 complex processes and many people 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.780
 to do so the operating costs 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.359
 would rise to the point where the price 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.569
 final would be unpayable for most 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.889
 consumers what is true is 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.319
 that this myth has generated a great 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.389
 negative impact on the population because 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.730
 inhibits its consumption by depriving it of a 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.730
 valuable protein such as chicken 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.900
 the myth of hormones causes harm 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.540
 economic to the poultry industry 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.550
 organized that generates more than 500 thousand 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.710
 Direct and indirect jobs in 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.650
 Colombia' 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.500
 this false belief goes against the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.240
 I work with technological advances and 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.940
 commitment that the poultry sector has 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.860
 with the development of the country and with offering 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.660
 a high quality product to the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.010
 Colombians 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.260
 definitely the use of hormones 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.980
 in the chicken industry is a lie 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.370
 absurd that we must all fight for
