00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 the parents between today's explain will speak 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.410
 a bit about non - treatment options 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.870
 for osteoarthritis 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.580
 in joint degeneration and in column 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.740
 column as a whole 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.509
 osteoarthrosis indicates the degeneration of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.900
 any joint of the body that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.779
 due to overloading of sections, the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.529
 when there is an overload in the joint 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.199
 usually due to changes 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.380
 postural obesity repetitive efforts 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.480
 and inadequate physical inactivity beyond 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
 aging process 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.590
 the spine can also be 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.930
 affected by our arthrosis as 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.950
 shows the figure the spine 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.510
 has several joints that 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.600
 any joint of the body also 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.300
 may be subject to this 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 overload and it is this process of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.969
 of the spinal joints are called 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.390
 of intervertebral joints 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.360
 joints 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.199
 ziggy or apophis areas or joints 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.140
 ages as a minimally 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.810
 invasive to the column there is 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.299
 first, the blockade makes the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 blocking takes ages as the video shows 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.250
 a detail is a blockade carried out by 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.950
 needles with the visualization 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.950
 Direct copy radios ie a distance 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 x in real time where I will guide my 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.090
 needle into the inside of these 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.939
 here I am 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.560
 demonstrating in the representation 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.659
 schematic of the column 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.610
 once inside the joint I 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.670
 can inject a contrast that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.710
 contrast will ensure that the tip of the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.290
 needle is inside the joint 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.970
 there are two reasons for 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.220
 blockade is one of them is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.869
 diagnosis and another is therapeutic 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.470
 since I am with my glory 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.630
 inside the joint I can 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.520
 inject an anesthetic first 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.049
 I want to make a diagnosis that I 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.560
 I have some question I want to be sure. 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.020
 that articulation is the source of the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.759
 patient's problem is the cause of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.189
 object patient an anesthetic that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.870
 patient will report an improvement in their 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.630
 pain if the pain really comes 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.660
 place or I can also treat this 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.890
 inflamed joint 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.140
 altered by the injection of 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.810
 medications usually medications 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.030
 anti-inflammatory drugs a second 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.220
 non-surgical procedure also used 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.280
 for the treatment of osteoporosis in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.950
 column of inflammatory changes where 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.040
 so degenerative joint makes 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.920
 is the denervation procedure 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.210
 radiofrequency or ablation by 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.760
 radio frequency 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.680
 radiofrequency ablation is aimed at 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.840
 to aim to burn 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.410
 this little branch that I'm showing 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.160
 in the figure that is a branch responsible for 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.840
 obtaining painful information from 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.240
 age articulations 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.610
 or is the nerve that picks up these 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.130
 joints and they only have this function 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.410
 he has no motor function 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.960
 has no single motor function 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.570
 purpose is captured inside the 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.670
 of this joint through a needle 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.160
 also guided by copy radios and x-rays 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.320
 in real time and a device similar to 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.890
 This I can direct the tip of the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.680
 needle to this posterior primary branch 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.989
 this small branch of nerve and from 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.170
 hence make this nerve 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.360
 I warm up this nerve and that 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.180
 number will be disabled 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.080
 This is why I am trying to interrupt this 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.070
 of painful information and 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.580
 consequently pain relief for 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.580
 this patient
