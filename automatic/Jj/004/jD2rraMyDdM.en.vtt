you guys to a video of warfare as I know

you guys to a video of warfare as I know
some<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.960> probably<00:02:34.110> will<00:02:34.440> be<00:02:34.560> itching<00:02:34.770> to

see<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.910> myself<00:02:36.510> what<00:02:36.750> Gears<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.110> War<00:02:37.230> looks

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
see like myself what Gears of War looks

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.250 
see like myself what Gears of War looks
like<00:02:37.740> all<00:02:38.010> them<00:02:38.340> years<00:02:38.490> ago<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:39.030> 2002<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.110> then

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
like all them years ago in 2002 and then

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.870 
like all them years ago in 2002 and then
I<00:02:40.290> think<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.770> really<00:02:40.920> cool<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.400> strange<00:02:41.700> at

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
I think it's really cool but strange at

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.940 
I think it's really cool but strange at
the<00:02:41.910> same<00:02:42.150> time<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.630> see<00:02:42.840> an<00:02:43.050> earlier<00:02:43.530> buildup

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the same time to see an earlier buildup

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.010 
the same time to see an earlier buildup
or<00:02:44.100> Gears<00:02:44.340> boy<00:02:44.580> started<00:02:45.240> out<00:02:45.360> as<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.810> how

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
or Gears boy started out as and how

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.960 
or Gears boy started out as and how
different<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.460> final<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
different it is to the final of the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.150 
different it is to the final of the
design<00:02:48.450> which<00:02:48.660> ever<00:02:48.900> games<00:02:49.230> as<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.590> guys<00:02:49.740> can

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
design which ever games as you guys can

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.430 
design which ever games as you guys can
probably<00:02:50.280> work<00:02:50.610> out<00:02:50.850> by<00:02:51.030> now<00:02:51.210> took<00:02:51.540> 5<00:02:51.900> total

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
probably work out by now took 5 total

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.720 
been as successful as what gives war is
today<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:20.070> would<00:03:20.280> have<00:03:20.400> probably<00:03:20.610> not

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
today and I would have probably not

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.850 
today and I would have probably not
loved<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.270> franchise<00:03:21.720> like<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.110> do<00:03:22.170> Gears<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
loved the franchise like I do Gears of

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.200 
loved the franchise like I do Gears of
War<00:03:22.920> there's<00:03:23.190> nothing<00:03:23.550> like<00:03:23.670> years<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:23.970> war

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
War there's nothing like years of war

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.880 
War there's nothing like years of war
it's<00:03:24.450> just<00:03:24.660> awesome<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.110> guys<00:03:25.380> probably<00:03:25.740> know

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
it's just awesome you guys probably know

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.110 
it's just awesome you guys probably know
that<00:03:26.160> but<00:03:26.310> I<00:03:26.430> think<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.880> still<00:03:27.090> very

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
that but I think this is still very

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.790 
that but I think this is still very
exciting<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.930> pretty<00:03:28.050> cool<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.440> see<00:03:28.620> though

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
exciting and pretty cool to see though

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.740 
exciting and pretty cool to see though
as<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.460> shows<00:03:29.640> off<00:03:29.790> how<00:03:30.000> different<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.540> video

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
as it shows off how different a video

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.290 
as it shows off how different a video
game<00:03:30.990> can<00:03:31.260> change<00:03:31.290> over<00:03:31.950> time<00:03:32.160> drafting<00:03:33.090> so

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
game can change over time drafting so

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.270 
game can change over time drafting so
far<00:03:33.570> away<00:03:33.870> from<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.200> original<00:03:34.710> plans<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
far away from the original plans the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.130 
far away from the original plans the
game<00:03:35.490> had<00:03:35.730> at<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.970> beginning<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.540> end<00:03:36.840> at<00:03:37.020> the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
game had at the beginning and end at the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.020 
game had at the beginning and end at the
start<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.710> wanna<00:03:38.160> hear<00:03:38.310> from<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.490> guys<00:03:38.610> though
