 will help to make this technique you have 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.830
 that have a lighter tone until then 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.230
 darker until everyone is me 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.969
 brought two different textures of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.620
 which are the powder example and are the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:41.129
 creamy start with an appeasing and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.170
 lighten the skin while speaking illuminator 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.960
 We're talking about that product. 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.879
 and that in that goal on the skin but 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.500
 also have a technique you do not use 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.110
 the governor but if you wear a vest 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.699
 clearer that it gives the impression that your 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.770
 face was also that he put 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.340
 people take a lighter shade than your 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.500
 skin 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 In case I'm going to get this one, I'm going 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.930
 catch up with this role of collective that is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.700
 little one is getting more precise 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.250
 with him in the area of the guy said 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.580
 Spiegel'll get caught concealer will 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.080
 apply as if to die 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.900
 today you can apply here 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.060
 in the nose it applies well in this region here 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.460
 na center that nose 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.560
 only here on the other page with the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.890
 but he does not want to drop his nose. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:33.400
 You have tuned and it was also illuminated. 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.700
 solo attests as if it does one sees good 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.680
 left 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.000
 click the regions you want to lead 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.580
 forward 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.380
 You left the tone after you go. 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.450
 spread like a concealer 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.030
 normal understood why it will give a 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.280
 clarity on your skin a glow 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.170
 When you speak let's lighten the skin. 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.120
 not necessarily with that 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.620
 Bright Governor You Can Lighten 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.410
 Your skin, too. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.050
 you could use the name not at all proud 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.180
 could you if you want tenth day 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.340
 So it was the night we go to that said 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.820
 briozzo for here really a glow in the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.619
 skin 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.600
 If it's day, we'll have to wait for the 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.300
 collective that gives a goal too 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.670
 without getting that official thing is to leave 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.490
 the car could also have no concealer 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.170
 apply only the lighter powder that I also 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.970
 I do this but I found the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.440
 corrective before the glass for this 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.239
 It takes effect, but it's fine 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.450
 When you put it up, you go. 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:31.700
 and prolonged correction is the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.500
 his time is the lightest and you pass 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.720
 can then reinforce it in its 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700
 blush or afterwards see how it was 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.590
 walk all ready and I like this 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.170
 I will not reinforce technique now I 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.420
 could use a more heard tone this 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.280
 cream with a cat tongue brush that the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.620
 staff that will absorb better 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.470
 work with this product more than I 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.000
 I did not think I would prefer the powder because 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.650
 I prefer that I find it better to stop. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.330
 smoking than you could use a cream 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.220
 would make the same mark it 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.160
 Maria, the same way, just give me a little 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.920
 more work 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.410
 without smoking more than with the hypothesis 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.090
 to use is this one this dark tone I will 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.000
 take a light not to stay too long 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.520
 marked ok I can use offset 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.100
 the blushes and blush brush I can use 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.840
 the bike because it looks the size of it 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.880
 the area it will reach will be 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.630
 perfect I do not like that huge kabuki 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.520
 blush 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.710
 He did not count will be this size. 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.200
 so I want this I want a contour 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.810
 I need in the right region then when 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.730
 Minor transform option and stay 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.190
 that mess and mix everything 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.560
 after blessing yourself to do the 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.860
 contour in the area is seeing that it does not 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.160
 it is the shadow brush the shadow but it is 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.920
 the greater the zito I can apply and disappear 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.230
 rational rent I'll do my father 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.090
 by her husband wrote that where you 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.250
 want to film tintin a nose more 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.410
 which gives the impression that it is 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.500
 The colder it starts to make you go. 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.840
 see this come back here, you see that it has 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.490
 a nose bone 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.870
 he gives you have to mark exactly 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.420
 In this quick said the most 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.700
 You 're going to board this 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.630
 direction to manaus with nothing else but 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.239
 a shadow they are seeing which way 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.680
 this format with this shadow then 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.200
 told you will create a shadow 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.690
 illusory to show that it is more 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.120
 Thin than it is the shadow you wanted 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.640
 to knock or to spare 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.600
 and played for grandson 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:38.910
 she knows it 's a dunares revisit 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.280
 I do not like it, too, mark it here 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.530
 below you have to analyze the contour 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.150
 so interested so according to your 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.980
 face format seems not to have shaken 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.280
 the singer will make this mark here 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.610
 this one if you have a small face 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:06.680
 delicate people there is no need to 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:09.850
 include the cheek but start to fade 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.850
 like there's no tomorrow 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.210
 respect the fact you did not exceed 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.000
 the line with us 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:23.390
 this line has to be sub clear to 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.190
 intention of the very marked image well 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.080
 natural maybe you liked the tip 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.950
