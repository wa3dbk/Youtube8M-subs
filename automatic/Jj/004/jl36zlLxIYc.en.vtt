00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.650 

I<00:00:07.750> feel<00:00:08.500> all<00:00:08.889> the<00:00:09.070> reservoir<00:00:09.969> is<00:00:10.030> up<00:00:10.180> now<00:00:10.360> if

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 
I feel all the reservoir is up now if

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.049 
I feel all the reservoir is up now if
you<00:00:11.380> look<00:00:11.500> at<00:00:11.710> the<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:12.309> fryer<00:00:12.549> heads<00:00:12.879> if<00:00:13.000> you

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
you look at the the fryer heads if you

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.459 
you look at the the fryer heads if you
take<00:00:13.240> these<00:00:13.360> out<00:00:13.570> there's<00:00:13.780> a<00:00:13.840> low<00:00:14.049> and<00:00:14.410> a<00:00:14.440> high

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
take these out there's a low and a high

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.660 
take these out there's a low and a high
point<00:00:14.889> for<00:00:15.549> the<00:00:15.670> oil<00:00:16.050> we<00:00:17.050> talked<00:00:17.230> about<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
point for the oil we talked about the

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.880 
point for the oil we talked about the
heat<00:00:18.820> retention<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.480> thermal<00:00:19.810> mass<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.740> more

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
heat retention the thermal mass the more

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.679 
heat retention the thermal mass the more
oil<00:00:21.190> you<00:00:21.340> have<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.820> more<00:00:21.970> thermal<00:00:22.300> mass<00:00:22.480> you

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
oil you have the more thermal mass you

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.020 
oil you have the more thermal mass you
have<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:23.140> more<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.380> can<00:00:23.650> retain<00:00:23.950> heat<00:00:24.220> so<00:00:24.970> to

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
have the more you can retain heat so to

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.700 
have the more you can retain heat so to
make<00:00:25.150> this<00:00:25.330> a<00:00:25.390> fair<00:00:25.720> comparison<00:00:26.080> I<00:00:26.380> feel<00:00:26.530> each

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
make this a fair comparison I feel each

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.550 
make this a fair comparison I feel each
one<00:00:26.920> up<00:00:27.039> to<00:00:27.190> the<00:00:27.340> high<00:00:27.850> point<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.420> thermal<00:00:29.410> mass

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
one up to the high point of thermal mass

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.410 
one up to the high point of thermal mass
I<00:00:29.890> mean<00:00:30.220> it's<00:00:30.369> frozen<00:00:30.550> fries<00:00:30.850> for<00:00:31.090> this<00:00:31.180> test

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
I mean it's frozen fries for this test

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.400 
I mean it's frozen fries for this test
we're<00:00:31.630> going<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.810> put<00:00:31.930> them<00:00:32.050> in<00:00:32.110> all<00:00:32.230> three

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
we're going to put them in all three

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.740 
we're going to put them in all three
units<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.850> does<00:00:33.969> that<00:00:34.090> engine<00:00:34.390> that<00:00:34.420> gets<00:00:34.539> up

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
units so does that engine that gets up

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.290 
units so does that engine that gets up
to<00:00:34.930> repeat<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.649> show<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:36.820> difference<00:00:37.120> in<00:00:37.270> the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
to repeat the show the difference in the

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.959 
to repeat the show the difference in the
wattage<00:00:37.750> and<00:00:37.930> then<00:00:38.680> thermal<00:00:39.039> mass<00:00:39.250> of<00:00:39.850> the

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
wattage and then thermal mass of the

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.000 
wattage and then thermal mass of the
capacity<00:00:40.449> of<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.539> fryer<00:00:40.780> with<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.109> higher
