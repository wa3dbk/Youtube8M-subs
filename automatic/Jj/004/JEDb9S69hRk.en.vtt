00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
explain how to explain the controls that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.370 
explain how to explain the controls that
she's<00:01:05.430> using<00:01:05.610> over<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.140> game

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
she's using over there so this game

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.399 
she's using over there so this game
comes<00:01:07.619> packaged<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.579> wii<00:01:09.409> motionplus

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
comes packaged with the wii motionplus

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.679 
comes packaged with the wii motionplus
and<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.060> attachment<00:01:12.329> to<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> remote<00:01:13.430> it

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
and it is an attachment to the remote it

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.660 
and it is an attachment to the remote it
enhances<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.049> remote<00:01:16.380> sensitivity<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
enhances the remote sensitivity so it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
enhances the remote sensitivity so it
really<00:01:17.939> detects<00:01:18.450> your<00:01:18.600> positioning<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.140> your

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
really detects your positioning of your

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.020 
really detects your positioning of your
hand<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.149> it's<00:01:22.280> like<00:01:23.280> when<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.550> jab<00:01:23.790> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
hand and it's like when you jab it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.340 
hand and it's like when you jab it
detects<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.570> jabbing<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.200> can

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
detects that you're jabbing you can

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.430 
detects that you're jabbing you can
block<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:25.800> you're<00:01:25.950> playing<00:01:26.190> the<00:01:26.370> swordplay

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
block when you're playing the swordplay

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.920 
block when you're playing the swordplay
it's<00:01:28.440> very<00:01:28.770> sensitive<00:01:29.370> to<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.180> positioning

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it's very sensitive to the positioning

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.110 
it's very sensitive to the positioning
of<00:01:31.050> your<00:01:31.110> hand<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.010> what<00:01:32.340> angle<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.760> hand<00:01:32.940> is

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
of your hand and what angle your hand is

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.390 
of your hand and what angle your hand is
so<00:01:33.690> for<00:01:34.020> people<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.440> don't<00:01:34.920> really

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
so for people that don't really

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.490 
so for people that don't really
understand<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.600> difference<00:01:36.960> between<00:01:37.049> what

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
understand the difference between what

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.840 
understand the difference between what
the<00:01:37.620> wii<00:01:37.740> does<00:01:37.979> now<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.460> wii<00:01:38.580> remote

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the wii does now with the wii remote

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.050 
the wii does now with the wii remote
versus<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.930> add-on<00:01:40.610> provides<00:01:41.610> extra

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
versus what this add-on provides extra

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.399 
versus what this add-on provides extra
to<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.080> you<00:01:43.170> say<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to that what would you say the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.050 
to that what would you say the
difference<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.830> well<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.729> just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
difference is well it's it's just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.060 
difference is well it's it's just
speaking<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.080> technical<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.710> doesn't<00:01:47.010> help

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
speaking in technical it doesn't help

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.350 
speaking in technical it doesn't help
you<00:01:47.250> understand<00:01:47.760> it's<00:01:47.940> something<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.240> need

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you understand it's something you need

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.300 
you understand it's something you need
to<00:01:48.450> pick<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.930> actually<00:01:49.110> feel<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:50.100> see

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
to pick up and actually feel it to see

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.039 
to pick up and actually feel it to see
the<00:01:50.400> difference<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.940> you'll<00:01:51.119> see<00:01:51.299> Christine

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the difference like you'll see Christine

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
the difference like you'll see Christine
is<00:01:52.290> when<00:01:52.799> she<00:01:52.950> wants<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.190> power<00:01:53.400> up<00:01:53.670> she's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
is when she wants to power up she's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.430 
is when she wants to power up she's
flicking<00:01:54.450> her<00:01:54.540> wrist<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.320> would

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
flicking her wrist just like you would

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.010 
flicking her wrist just like you would
on<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.650> on<00:01:56.010> a<00:01:56.070> water<00:01:56.850> scooter<00:01:57.090> right

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020

we're seeing her playing that there and
so<00:02:01.840> what's<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.079> goal<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:03.460> title

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
so what's the goal of this title

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.940 
so what's the goal of this title

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
don't knock each other off then it's a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
draw and if you if you if you tie then

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.750 
draw and if you if you if you tie then
he<00:03:15.069> goes<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.489> sudden<00:03:15.819> death<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.579> much

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
he goes to sudden death and it's a much

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.740 
he goes to sudden death and it's a much
smaller<00:03:19.030> platform<00:03:19.600> so

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
smaller platform so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.330 
smaller platform so
and<00:03:20.990> again<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:21.650> takes<00:03:21.800> advantage<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.280> the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
and again this takes advantage of the

and again this takes advantage of the
wii<00:03:22.490> motionplus<00:03:22.820> as<00:03:23.090> well<00:03:23.240> right<00:03:23.450> correct<00:03:23.780> and

and again it really can sense the
position<00:03:39.020> in<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.200> posture<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.590> your<00:03:39.800> hand
