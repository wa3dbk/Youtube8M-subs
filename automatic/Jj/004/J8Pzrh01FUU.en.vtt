change these I use this up and down
that's<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.189> default<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.700> well<00:01:59.850> it'll<00:02:00.719> change

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that's the default as well it'll change

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.969 
that's the default as well it'll change
to<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.350> different<00:02:01.619> DPI<00:02:01.860> settings

or<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.790> Photoshop<00:02:14.790> even<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.960> really<00:02:16.470> makes<00:02:16.650> it

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
or a Photoshop even it really makes it

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.660 
or a Photoshop even it really makes it
really<00:02:18.240> makes<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.630> lot<00:02:18.840> more<00:02:18.900> precise<00:02:19.380> now

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
really makes it a lot more precise now

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.560 
really makes it a lot more precise now
let's<00:02:20.670> talk<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> drivers<00:02:21.390> because

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
let's talk about the drivers because

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.270 
let's talk about the drivers because
that's<00:02:21.810> what<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.530> razor<00:02:22.710> products<00:02:23.070> are<00:02:23.160> all

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
that's what the razor products are all

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.830 
that's what the razor products are all
about<00:02:23.490> now<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:23.970> can<00:02:24.210> upgrade<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.630> firmware

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
about now you can upgrade the firmware

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.140 
about now you can upgrade the firmware
on<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.410> device<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.640> you'll<00:02:26.850> be<00:02:26.970> able<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
on this device so you'll be able to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.730 
on this device so you'll be able to
update<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.540> actual<00:02:27.870> device<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> future

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
update the actual device in the future

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.960 
update the actual device in the future
which<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.010> cool<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.430> separates<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.940> from

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
which is cool and that separates it from

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.580 
which is cool and that separates it from
a<00:02:30.120> lot<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.390> mice<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.720> market<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
a lot of the mice in the market and the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.260 
a lot of the mice in the market and the
drivers<00:02:32.040> now<00:02:32.700> when<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.910> get<00:02:33.030> into<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
drivers now when you get into the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.460 
drivers now when you get into the
drivers<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> first<00:02:33.840> thing<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:33.990> notice<00:02:34.350> is

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
drivers the first thing you notice is

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.050 
drivers the first thing you notice is
that<00:02:34.500> all<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.070> buttons<00:02:35.340> are<00:02:35.490> programmable

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
that all the buttons are programmable

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.360 
that all the buttons are programmable
and<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:36.690> can<00:02:36.810> also<00:02:36.960> program<00:02:37.350> macros<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.250> can

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
and you can also program macros you can

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.890 
and you can also program macros you can
use<00:02:38.580> up<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.760> eight<00:02:38.970> different<00:02:39.210> keystrokes<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
use up to eight different keystrokes and

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.190 
use up to eight different keystrokes and
you<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.680> insert<00:02:40.980> 50<00:02:41.430> milliseconds<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.210> like<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
you can insert 50 milliseconds of like a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.920 
you can insert 50 milliseconds of like a
little<00:02:43.410> delay<00:02:43.740> in<00:02:43.950> between<00:02:44.220> each<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.640> like

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
little delay in between each if you like

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.020 
little delay in between each if you like
also<00:02:46.040> while<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.070> in<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.490> software<00:02:47.850> you're

you can adjust the individual

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.890 
you can adjust the individual
sensitivity<00:03:01.740> on<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.280> X<00:03:02.460> and<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.970> y<00:03:03.000> axis

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
sensitivity on the X and the y axis

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.270 
sensitivity on the X and the y axis
meaning<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.680> if<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.890> want<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.250> a

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
meaning that if you want to have a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.860 
meaning that if you want to have a
really<00:03:05.700> sensitive<00:03:06.030> mouse<00:03:06.270> when<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.570> look<00:03:06.750> up

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
really sensitive mouse when you look up

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.330 
really sensitive mouse when you look up
and<00:03:07.050> down<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.860> make<00:03:08.220> it

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
and down you can do that and make it

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.470 
and down you can do that and make it
slower<00:03:08.610> when<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.880> turn<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.270> you're<00:03:09.420> not

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
slower when you turn so you're not

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.480 
slower when you turn so you're not
spinning<00:03:09.810> all<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.990> time<00:03:10.140> or<00:03:10.350> vice<00:03:10.590> versa<00:03:10.920> so

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
spinning all the time or vice versa so

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.480 
spinning all the time or vice versa so
you<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.700> adjust<00:03:11.820> just<00:03:12.480> about<00:03:12.630> everything

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
you can adjust just about everything

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.800 
you can adjust just about everything
independently<00:03:14.490> which<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> nice<00:03:15.750> feature

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
independently which is a nice feature

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.410 
independently which is a nice feature
and<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:17.070> program<00:03:17.430> your<00:03:17.459> own<00:03:17.760> profile<00:03:18.240> so

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
and you can program your own profile so

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.270 
and you can program your own profile so
when<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.630> go<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.780> different<00:03:18.930> games<00:03:19.320> it'll<00:03:20.100> set

16-bit what's a 16-bit Mouse gives you a

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.180 
16-bit what's a 16-bit Mouse gives you a
much<00:03:48.450> wider<00:03:48.750> data<00:03:49.080> path<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.950> one<00:03:50.100> is

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
much wider data path and this one is

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.280 
much wider data path and this one is
capable<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.580> 60<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.030> 100<00:03:51.420> inches<00:03:51.720> per<00:03:51.930> second

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
capable of 60 to 100 inches per second

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.170 
capable of 60 to 100 inches per second
that's<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.530> lot<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.709> data<00:03:52.920> also<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.910> polling

that's a lot of data also the polling
rate<00:03:54.300> on<00:03:54.450> this<00:03:54.570> it'll<00:03:55.050> its<00:03:55.500> standard<00:03:56.040> 500<00:03:56.730> but

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
rate on this it'll its standard 500 but

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.250

is nice about the mouse there's 32k of

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.570 
is nice about the mouse there's 32k of
onboard<00:04:07.140> memory<00:04:07.380> now<00:04:07.950> what<00:04:08.130> does<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.340> mean

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
onboard memory now what does that mean

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.250 
onboard memory now what does that mean
well<00:04:08.850> allow<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.600> other<00:04:09.810> might<00:04:09.989> select<00:04:10.110> your

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
in the games the former performance was

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.100 
in the games the former performance was
nearly<00:05:57.169> perfect<00:05:57.680> i<00:05:58.150> actually<00:05:59.150> frankly<00:06:00.050> i

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
nearly perfect i actually frankly i

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.320 
nearly perfect i actually frankly i
think<00:06:00.169> i<00:06:00.320> like<00:06:00.470> the<00:06:00.650> feel<00:06:01.310> of<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.910> deathadder

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330

both<00:06:05.510> very<00:06:06.050> comfortable<00:06:06.500> mice<00:06:06.680> but<00:06:07.400> this<00:06:07.550> one

both very comfortable mice but this one

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.490 
both very comfortable mice but this one
was<00:06:07.970> a<00:06:08.000> little<00:06:08.180> smoother<00:06:08.810> in<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.169> games<00:06:09.380> that

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
was a little smoother in the games that

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.840 
was a little smoother in the games that
I<00:06:09.620> tried<00:06:09.890> out<00:06:10.040> so<00:06:10.340> i<00:06:10.370> was<00:06:10.490> playing<00:06:10.669> team

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850

I tried out so i was playing team
fortress<00:06:10.880> 2<00:06:11.450> and<00:06:11.690> it<00:06:12.290> was<00:06:12.530> a<00:06:12.560> little<00:06:12.860> easier<00:06:13.130> to

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
fortress 2 and it was a little easier to

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.190 
fortress 2 and it was a little easier to
get<00:06:13.370> you<00:06:13.940> know<00:06:14.030> clear<00:06:14.300> head<00:06:14.480> shots<00:06:14.720> and<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.050> did

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
get you know clear head shots and it did

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.630 
get you know clear head shots and it did
feel<00:06:15.380> a<00:06:15.440> little<00:06:15.770> smoother<00:06:16.250> all<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.550> way

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
feel a little smoother all the way

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.610 
feel a little smoother all the way
around<00:06:16.730> when<00:06:17.570> i<00:06:17.600> was<00:06:17.750> moving<00:06:17.810> this<00:06:18.169> mouse<00:06:18.380> on

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
around when i was moving this mouse on

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.740
