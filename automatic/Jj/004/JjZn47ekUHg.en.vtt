come<00:04:22.620> attached<00:04:23.100> when<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.060> power<00:04:24.270> supply<00:04:24.780> is

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
come attached when the power supply is

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.370 
come attached when the power supply is
shipped<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.550> can<00:04:26.730> then<00:04:26.970> detach<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:28.110> ones

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
shipped so you can then detach the ones

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.920 
shipped so you can then detach the ones
that<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.100> don't<00:04:29.370> need<00:04:29.670> and<00:04:29.970> just<00:04:30.000> leave<00:04:30.690> the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
that you don't need and just leave the

ones<00:04:31.200> connected<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.460> do<00:04:32.640> need<00:04:32.790> now<00:04:33.120> let

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
ones connected that you do need now let

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.430 
ones connected that you do need now let
me<00:04:33.420> disconnect<00:04:33.840> all<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.350> these<00:04:34.890> modular<00:04:35.820> leads

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
me disconnect all of these modular leads

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.720 
me disconnect all of these modular leads
to<00:04:37.440> show<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:39.410> what<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.620> power<00:04:40.890> supply<00:04:41.190> looks

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
to show you what a power supply looks

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:58.570 
to show you what a power supply looks
like<00:04:42.000> without<00:04:43.160> any<00:04:44.180> leads<00:04:45.950> attached<00:04:46.950> at<00:04:47.280> all

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.550 

there<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.700> have<00:04:59.850> it<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.570> at<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.200> back<00:05:01.380> of<00:05:01.500> the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
there you have it and at the back of the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.460 
there you have it and at the back of the
power<00:05:01.710> supply<00:05:01.860> they<00:05:02.700> do<00:05:03.240> illustrate<00:05:04.140> where

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
power supply they do illustrate where

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.460 
power supply they do illustrate where
all<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:05.100> these<00:05:05.220> different<00:05:05.820> module<00:05:06.450> leads<00:05:06.810> get

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
all of these different module leads get

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.880 
all of these different module leads get
connected<00:05:08.030> modular<00:05:09.030> leads<00:05:09.330> are<00:05:09.890> fantastic

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
connected modular leads are fantastic

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.280 
connected modular leads are fantastic

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
because you only need to use the ones

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.770 
because you only need to use the ones
