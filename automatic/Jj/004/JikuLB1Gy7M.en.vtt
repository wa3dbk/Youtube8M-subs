hey peoples okay we recently deleted a

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.560 
hey peoples okay we recently deleted a
challenge<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:25.310> we're<00:00:25.550> gonna<00:00:25.640> redo<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:26.180> because

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
challenge so we're gonna redo it because

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.630 
challenge so we're gonna redo it because
the<00:00:26.900> corrections<00:00:27.590> wasn't<00:00:27.920> you<00:00:28.040> it<00:00:28.310> was<00:00:28.340> an

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
the corrections wasn't you it was an

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.160 
the corrections wasn't you it was an
older<00:00:28.850> video<00:00:29.000> so<00:00:29.390> it<00:00:29.450> wasn't<00:00:29.720> getting<00:00:29.930> as<00:00:30.050> many

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
older video so it wasn't getting as many

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.930 
older video so it wasn't getting as many
views<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.680> we<00:00:30.740> thought<00:00:30.980> just<00:00:31.369> because<00:00:31.430> it<00:00:31.880> was

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
views and we thought just because it was

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.940 
views and we thought just because it was
one<00:00:32.480> of<00:00:32.510> her<00:00:32.660> crappy<00:00:32.960> or<00:00:33.170> videos<00:00:33.500> that

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
one of her crappy or videos that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.340 
one of her crappy or videos that
probably<00:00:34.400> her<00:00:34.880> first<00:00:35.120> challenge<00:00:35.660> video<00:00:36.110> hurt

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
probably her first challenge video hurt

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.270 
probably her first challenge video hurt
me<00:00:36.590> um<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:37.670> we<00:00:38.480> look<00:00:38.629> like<00:00:38.780> crap<00:00:38.989> in<00:00:39.200> it<00:00:39.290> may<00:00:40.220> be

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
me um but we look like crap in it may be

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.310 
me um but we look like crap in it may be
some<00:00:41.020> slight<00:00:42.020> flaws<00:00:42.379> in<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.770> video<00:00:42.980> yeah<00:00:43.550> um
