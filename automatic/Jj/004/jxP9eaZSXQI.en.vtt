even changing direction

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
even changing direction
as<00:01:12.920> simple<00:01:13.130> as<00:01:13.369> pushing<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:13.880> button

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
as simple as pushing a button

as simple as pushing a button
we<00:01:15.630> need<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> change<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.410> delay

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.620

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
so now the direction is moving from

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:46.429 
so now the direction is moving from
right<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:32.929> left<00:01:33.670> with<00:01:34.670> our<00:01:34.759> new<00:01:34.909> upset

that's going to look like that four

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:49.059 
that's going to look like that four
years<00:02:58.390> from<00:02:58.540> now<00:02:58.660> five<00:02:59.170> five
