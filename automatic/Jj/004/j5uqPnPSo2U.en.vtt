00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.240
 I tell you, shut up 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.760
 if you have certainly not caught your breath 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.740
 now you will know the reason for the horses that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.290
 are voted in pertuso I don't feel you 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.940

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.400
 feel enough 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.100
 here is not so obvious there is a 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.260
 legend that according to which beyond 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.910
 there is no opening for sacrifices 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.910
 death but a new world 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.750
 the legend says that when from the hole 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.250
 they will hear screams and shouts of joy 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.160
 then it will be the time when everyone 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.220
 will have to rejoin the animals and 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.950
 people in there diving 18 for 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.330

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.720

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.700
 my mother will arrive on the day and from the forum 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.420
 intense glow and following the three 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.490
 parrot 3 dive into a mythical world 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.410
 this new world would not want to do 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.880
