00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.519 

all<00:00:02.100> right<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:02.669> back<00:00:02.850> this<00:00:03.629> thing<00:00:03.689> has<00:00:04.200> been

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
all right we're back this thing has been

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.230 
all right we're back this thing has been
running<00:00:05.040> for<00:00:05.250> about<00:00:06.180> two<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.290> half<00:00:07.470> hours

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
running for about two and a half hours

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.049 
running for about two and a half hours
it<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:10.099> quite<00:00:11.099> warm<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.150> touch<00:00:12.300> maybe<00:00:14.059> 40

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
it is quite warm to the touch maybe 40

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.230 
it is quite warm to the touch maybe 40
Celsius<00:00:15.630> or<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.440> probably<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.010> bit<00:00:17.490> more<00:00:18.140> the

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
Celsius or so probably a bit more the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.160 
Celsius or so probably a bit more the
case<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.630> submitted

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.170 

to<00:00:25.320> watts<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.010> measured<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> drawing<00:00:26.789> from<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to watts I measured it drawing from the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.519 
to watts I measured it drawing from the
mains<00:00:27.710> however<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:30.090> not<00:00:30.359> shut<00:00:30.750> down<00:00:30.779> yet

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
mains however it is not shut down yet

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.420 
mains however it is not shut down yet
which<00:00:32.340> probably<00:00:32.840> means<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:35.040> owner<00:00:35.190> was

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
which probably means that the owner was

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.740 
which probably means that the owner was
seeing<00:00:35.750> intermittent<00:00:36.750> failure<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.559> not<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
seeing intermittent failure but not a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.049 
seeing intermittent failure but not a
consistent<00:00:40.550> rapid<00:00:41.550> failure<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:44.070> caps<00:00:44.820> in

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
consistent rapid failure so the caps in

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.200 
consistent rapid failure so the caps in
this<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.570> probably<00:00:46.280> dodgy<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.640> failing

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
this one are probably dodgy and failing

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.770 
this one are probably dodgy and failing
but<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:49.289> already<00:00:50.010> failed<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.090> since

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
but not already failed all the way since

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
but not already failed all the way since
it<00:00:52.050> does<00:00:52.289> manage<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> power<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> does

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
it does manage to power up and it does

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.819 
it does manage to power up and it does
seem<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.390> stable<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.530> sitting

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
seem to be stable when it's just sitting

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.250 
seem to be stable when it's just sitting
here<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.739> next<00:00:58.890> step<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.609> to<00:01:00.260> take

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
here so I think the next step is to take

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
here so I think the next step is to take
off<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.190> case<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> look<00:01:04.199> inside<00:01:05.060> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
off the case and have a look inside you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.620 
off the case and have a look inside you
can<00:01:06.090> tell<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.659> thing<00:01:06.869> has<00:01:06.990> been<00:01:07.140> hot<00:01:07.439> because

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
can tell this thing has been hot because

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.020 
can tell this thing has been hot because
when<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> tried<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.310> see<00:01:11.310> how<00:01:11.400> easy<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:12.000> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
when I tried to see how easy it was to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.469 
when I tried to see how easy it was to
take<00:01:12.210> off<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.290> rubber<00:01:13.590> foot<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.400> pulled<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.270> bit

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
take off the rubber foot I pulled a bit

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.030 
take off the rubber foot I pulled a bit
and<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.590> glue<00:01:16.890> thumb<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.820> came<00:01:18.060> unstuck<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
and the glue thumb they came unstuck and

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.899 
and the glue thumb they came unstuck and
this<00:01:20.040> rubber<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:21.409> brittle<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.189> ripped

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
this rubber is brittle it just ripped

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.350 
this rubber is brittle it just ripped
all<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.509> way<00:01:24.630> across<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.970> which<00:01:26.970> means

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
all the way across like that which means

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.310 
all the way across like that which means
that<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> pain<00:01:29.850> getting<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that it's going to be a pain getting the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.719 
that it's going to be a pain getting the
rest<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.600> bottom<00:01:33.600> off<00:01:34.040> I'm<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.340> try

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
rest of this bottom off I'm going to try

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.420 
rest of this bottom off I'm going to try
to<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.939> have<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:38.970> come<00:01:39.299> off<00:01:39.479> okay<00:01:41.840> it's

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
to do it and have it come off okay it's

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.069 
to do it and have it come off okay it's
so<00:01:44.430> much<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.939> getting<00:01:45.450> everything<00:01:45.659> off<00:01:45.930> in

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
so much for getting everything off in

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.889 
so much for getting everything off in
one<00:01:46.229> piece<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.860> rubber<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.600> brittle

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
one piece this rubber is really brittle

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
one piece this rubber is really brittle
and<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> glue<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.180> wrecked<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:53.640> is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and the glue is just wrecked so this is

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.459 
and the glue is just wrecked so this is
gonna<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.299> fun<00:01:55.850> save<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> trouble<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.719> me

gonna be fun save you the trouble of me

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.430 
gonna be fun save you the trouble of me
wrestling<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> rubber<00:01:59.969> foot

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.520 

well<00:02:05.250> I've<00:02:05.910> opened<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:08.240> carefully<00:02:09.240> as<00:02:09.530> I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
well I've opened it up as carefully as I

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.760 
well I've opened it up as carefully as I
could<00:02:10.860> even<00:02:11.670> though<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.960> result<00:02:13.320> is<00:02:13.530> still

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
could even though the result is still

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.600 
could even though the result is still
the<00:02:14.060> base<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.500> two<00:02:16.500> large<00:02:16.800> pieces<00:02:17.100> in<00:02:17.490> one

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
the base in two large pieces in one

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.930 
the base in two large pieces in one
small<00:02:18.120> piece<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:20.280> glue<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:21.260> wrapped

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
small piece and the glue just wrapped

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.440 
small piece and the glue just wrapped
and<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:25.290> here's<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:26.040> guts<00:02:26.310> have<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:28.070> full-size

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
and so here's the guts have a full-size

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.180 
and so here's the guts have a full-size
standard<00:02:30.450> hard<00:02:31.020> drive<00:02:31.700> with<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:33.740> serial<00:02:34.740> ata

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
standard hard drive with a serial ata

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.570 
standard hard drive with a serial ata
connector<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.450> motherboard<00:02:37.100> we<00:02:38.100> have<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
connector to the motherboard we have the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580 
connector to the motherboard we have the
power<00:02:39.000> supply<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.900> where<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.230> actual

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
power supply this is where the actual

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.390 
power supply this is where the actual
problem<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.840> over<00:02:42.840> here<00:02:43.290> way<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:43.800> go<00:02:43.980> Apple

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
problem is and over here way to go Apple

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.430 
problem is and over here way to go Apple
it<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> fan<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.570> goes<00:02:45.750> from<00:02:45.960> nowhere<00:02:46.410> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
it is a fan that goes from nowhere to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.670 
it is a fan that goes from nowhere to
nowhere<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.360> only<00:02:48.360> turns<00:02:48.600> on<00:02:48.840> when<00:02:49.500> this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
nowhere and only turns on when this

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.820 
nowhere and only turns on when this
thing<00:02:49.950> overheats<00:02:50.510> which<00:02:51.510> usually<00:02:52.380> with<00:02:52.530> Apple

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
thing overheats which usually with Apple

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.260 
thing overheats which usually with Apple
products<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.430> never<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.780> Apple's<00:02:55.170> opinion<00:02:55.620> and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
products is never in Apple's opinion and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.100 
products is never in Apple's opinion and
thus<00:02:57.440> this<00:02:58.440> thing<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.160> a<00:03:00.120> thermal<00:03:00.780> design

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
thus this thing is a thermal design

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.060 
thus this thing is a thermal design
nightmare<00:03:02.600> so<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:04.250> think<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.880> next<00:03:06.150> step<00:03:07.070> would

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
nightmare so I think the next step would

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.850 
nightmare so I think the next step would
be<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.900> pop<00:03:09.900> out<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.140> power<00:03:10.739> supply<00:03:11.220> here<00:03:11.640> and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
be to pop out the power supply here and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.960 
be to pop out the power supply here and
just<00:03:13.860> overall<00:03:14.700> have<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> look<00:03:15.450> at<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.970> I'm

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
just overall have a look at it so I'm

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.880 
just overall have a look at it so I'm
going<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:18.709> go<00:03:19.709> about<00:03:19.980> doing<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.890> get

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
going to go about doing that and get

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.550 
going to go about doing that and get
back<00:03:23.280> once<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.760> have<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.120> power<00:03:24.390> supply<00:03:24.630> out

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
back once I have the power supply out

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.880 
back once I have the power supply out
and<00:03:26.100> possibly<00:03:26.910> opened

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.280 

well<00:03:31.890> I've<00:03:32.370> opened<00:03:32.790> up<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.390> power<00:03:33.720> supply<00:03:34.230> as

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
well I've opened up the power supply as

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.070 
well I've opened up the power supply as
careful<00:03:34.950> as<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.190> can<00:03:35.570> except<00:03:36.570> for<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.900> fact

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
careful as I can except for the fact

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.990 
careful as I can except for the fact
that<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.590> now<00:03:38.370> cooked<00:03:38.910> plastic<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.190> very<00:03:41.190> very

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
that the now cooked plastic is very very

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.199 
that the now cooked plastic is very very
brittle<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.530> slightest<00:03:44.010> touch<00:03:44.310> even<00:03:44.970> with

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
brittle so the slightest touch even with

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.560 
brittle so the slightest touch even with
a<00:03:45.239> nice<00:03:45.840> sharp<00:03:46.170> knife<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.860> all<00:03:47.489> crumbled<00:03:48.420> into

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
tiny little bits and pieces so I'll have

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.440 
tiny little bits and pieces so I'll have
to<00:03:51.750> find<00:03:52.440> some<00:03:52.830> other<00:03:52.980> way<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.850> wrapping<00:03:54.390> it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
to find some other way of wrapping it

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.479

and there's no leakage but it's still

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.120

according to the symptoms it's still

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.490 
according to the symptoms it's still
intermittent<00:05:05.880> so<00:05:06.600> this<00:05:06.930> thing<00:05:07.200> could

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
intermittent so this thing could

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.930 
intermittent so this thing could
probably<00:05:07.980> benefit<00:05:08.700> from<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.419> recapping<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.940> I

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
probably benefit from a recapping and I

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.170 
probably benefit from a recapping and I
am<00:05:12.270> going<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.780> do<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:13.260> modification<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.850> fan

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
which I'll talk about next carefully you

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.480

pull this off to the side because the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.450 
pull this off to the side because the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
filter caps are still charged don't want

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:32.350 
filter caps are still charged don't want
to<00:05:23.550> mess<00:05:23.700> with<00:05:23.850> that<00:05:23.910> and<00:05:26.390> it's<00:05:27.390> over<00:05:28.040> here

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.350 

alright<00:05:33.360> there's<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.200> actual<00:05:34.919> time<00:05:35.850> capsule

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
alright there's the actual time capsule
now<00:05:37.080> it<00:05:37.229> has<00:05:37.410> this<00:05:37.590> fan<00:05:37.950> here<00:05:38.370> it's<00:05:38.550> a<00:05:38.700> decent

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
now it has this fan here it's a decent

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
really at the bottom it's just these

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.040 
really at the bottom it's just these
tiny<00:05:46.260> perforation<00:05:46.710> so<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.460> fan<00:05:47.669> runs<00:05:47.970> all<00:05:48.900> it

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
tiny perforation so the fan runs all it

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.590 
tiny perforation so the fan runs all it
really<00:05:49.290> does<00:05:49.500> when<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:50.040> case<00:05:50.790> is<00:05:51.000> on<00:05:51.150> that

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
really does when the case is on that

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.350 
really does when the case is on that
like<00:05:51.840> that<00:05:52.110> all<00:05:52.770> it<00:05:52.860> does<00:05:53.040> is<00:05:53.340> blow<00:05:54.030> hot<00:05:54.330> air

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
like that all it does is blow hot air

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.290 
like that all it does is blow hot air
from<00:05:54.810> here<00:05:55.200> across<00:05:55.800> here<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.220> back<00:05:56.700> again<00:05:56.940> and

from here across here and back again and
it<00:05:57.510> can't<00:05:57.780> really<00:05:57.870> do<00:05:58.260> anything<00:05:58.880> so<00:05:59.880> what<00:06:00.660> I'm

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
it can't really do anything so what I'm

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.550 
it can't really do anything so what I'm
going<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.050> be<00:06:01.169> doing<00:06:01.500> is<00:06:02.000> I<00:06:03.000> will<00:06:03.300> pull<00:06:04.200> the<00:06:04.320> fan

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
going to be doing is I will pull the fan

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.580 
going to be doing is I will pull the fan
off<00:06:04.880> cut<00:06:05.880> a<00:06:05.910> neat<00:06:06.240> little<00:06:06.419> intake<00:06:06.990> hole<00:06:07.260> on<00:06:07.500> the

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
off cut a neat little intake hole on the

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.580 
off cut a neat little intake hole on the
bottom<00:06:07.770> and<00:06:08.870> depending<00:06:09.870> on<00:06:09.960> whether<00:06:10.140> I<00:06:10.229> use

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
bottom and depending on whether I use

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.590 
bottom and depending on whether I use
the<00:06:10.800> base<00:06:11.010> plate<00:06:11.340> again<00:06:11.910> considering<00:06:12.510> the

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
the base plate again considering the

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.780 
the base plate again considering the
state<00:06:12.810> it's<00:06:12.990> in<00:06:13.169> I'll<00:06:13.410> put<00:06:13.440> a<00:06:14.340> hole<00:06:14.550> in<00:06:14.580> the

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
state it's in I'll put a hole in the

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.080 
state it's in I'll put a hole in the
base<00:06:14.940> plate<00:06:15.240> as<00:06:15.390> well<00:06:15.800> so<00:06:16.800> when<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.550> fan<00:06:17.760> runs

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
base plate as well so when the fan runs

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.290 
base plate as well so when the fan runs
it<00:06:18.479> sucks<00:06:18.870> in<00:06:19.110> cool<00:06:19.350> air<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:20.000> forces<00:06:21.000> it<00:06:21.150> out

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
it sucks in cool air and forces it out

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.450 
it sucks in cool air and forces it out
the<00:06:21.750> event<00:06:22.110> slot<00:06:22.440> at<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.710> top<00:06:22.979> of<00:06:23.340> the

the event slot at the top of the
enclosure<00:06:24.800> this<00:06:25.800> also<00:06:26.840> would<00:06:28.039> not<00:06:29.039> be<00:06:29.310> too

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
enclosure this also would not be too

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.920 
enclosure this also would not be too
useful<00:06:29.750> unless

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
useful unless

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.850 
useful unless
I<00:06:31.009> connected<00:06:32.009> the<00:06:32.220> fan<00:06:32.490> to<00:06:33.320> probably<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:34.590> five

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
I connected the fan to probably the five

volt line on the power supply which will
cause<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:37.800> fan<00:06:38.190> to<00:06:38.370> run<00:06:38.490> continuously<00:06:39.210> at<00:06:39.449> low

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
cause the fan to run continuously at low

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:45.439 
cause the fan to run continuously at low
speed<00:06:40.020> and<00:06:40.580> keep<00:06:41.580> the<00:06:41.759> unit<00:06:42.090> cool<00:06:44.030> all<00:06:45.030> right

speed and keep the unit cool all right
that's<00:06:46.020> about<00:06:46.320> all<00:06:46.590> I<00:06:46.710> can<00:06:47.220> do<00:06:47.400> for<00:06:47.430> now<00:06:48.030> except

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
that's about all I can do for now except

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.129 
that's about all I can do for now except
maybe<00:06:49.310> test<00:06:50.310> a<00:06:50.460> fan<00:06:50.699> on<00:06:50.940> a<00:06:50.970> 12<00:06:51.300> volt<00:06:51.570> source<00:06:51.810> to

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
maybe test a fan on a 12 volt source to

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:57.110 
maybe test a fan on a 12 volt source to
see<00:06:52.350> what<00:06:52.500> it<00:06:52.620> does<00:06:52.830> and<00:06:53.930> just<00:06:55.789> upload<00:06:56.789> this

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 
see what it does and just upload this

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.430 
see what it does and just upload this
and<00:06:57.180> tomorrow<00:06:58.220> get<00:06:59.220> on<00:06:59.370> with<00:06:59.580> the<00:06:59.729> actual

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
and tomorrow get on with the actual

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.499 
and tomorrow get on with the actual
testing<00:07:01.440> the<00:07:01.500> power<00:07:01.740> supply<00:07:02.130> no<00:07:02.759> actually

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:03.509 
testing the power supply no actually

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:05.839 
testing the power supply no actually
never<00:07:03.720> mind<00:07:03.990> I'll<00:07:04.800> make<00:07:05.009> another<00:07:05.280> video<00:07:05.490> of

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:05.849 
never mind I'll make another video of

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:08.089 
never mind I'll make another video of
testing<00:07:06.690> the<00:07:06.780> actual<00:07:07.139> voltage<00:07:07.590> on<00:07:07.800> the<00:07:07.889> power

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
testing the actual voltage on the power

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.879 
testing the actual voltage on the power
of<00:07:08.220> supply<00:07:08.520> later<00:07:08.789> so<00:07:09.690> that's<00:07:10.470> all<00:07:10.710> for<00:07:10.860> now

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889 
of supply later so that's all for now

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.820 
of supply later so that's all for now
thanks<00:07:11.669> for<00:07:11.729> watching
