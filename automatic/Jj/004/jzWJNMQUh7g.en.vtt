biggest challenge I think the the
biggest<00:04:30.430> challenge<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.180> is<00:04:31.389> looking<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.980> an

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
biggest challenge is is looking to an

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.270 
biggest challenge is is looking to an
uncertain<00:04:34.000> future<00:04:34.180> not<00:04:35.169> understanding<00:04:36.010> all

uncertain future not understanding all

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.879 
uncertain future not understanding all
of<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.550> things<00:04:36.760> that's<00:04:36.910> going<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.120> happen<00:04:37.889> in

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
of the things that's going to happen in

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.610 
of the things that's going to happen in
the<00:04:39.160> country<00:04:39.610> but<00:04:40.360> certainly<00:04:41.050> putting<00:04:41.530> that

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
the country but certainly putting that

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.300 
the country but certainly putting that
aside<00:04:41.910> we<00:04:42.910> feel<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:43.530> with<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.560> vision<00:04:45.100> that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
aside we feel that with the vision that

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.719 
aside we feel that with the vision that
Avinash<00:04:45.820> has<00:04:46.139> he<00:04:47.139> continues<00:04:48.040> to<00:04:48.070> bring<00:04:48.550> that

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
Avinash has he continues to bring that

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.180 
Avinash has he continues to bring that
vision<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.410> when<00:04:50.410> we're<00:04:50.560> sitting<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.979> meetings

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
vision to when we're sitting in meetings

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.640 
vision to when we're sitting in meetings
he<00:04:51.729> brings<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.180> vision<00:04:52.540> says<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.229> is<00:04:53.410> what

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
he brings that vision says this is what

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.040 
he brings that vision says this is what
we<00:04:53.860> can<00:04:54.070> accomplish<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:55.210> even<00:04:55.810> though<00:04:55.900> there

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
we can accomplish so even though there

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.750 
we can accomplish so even though there
may<00:04:56.200> be<00:04:56.229> challenges<00:04:56.889> that<00:04:57.010> we<00:04:57.160> face<00:04:57.430> in<00:04:57.639> this

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
may be challenges that we face in this

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.340 
may be challenges that we face in this
country<00:04:58.180> I<00:04:58.210> think<00:04:58.300> that<00:04:58.720> when<00:04:58.960> we<00:04:59.080> put<00:04:59.260> our

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
country I think that when we put our

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.680 
country I think that when we put our
minds<00:04:59.710> together<00:04:59.860> we<00:05:00.190> can<00:05:00.310> do<00:05:00.460> great<00:05:00.729> things

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
minds together we can do great things
