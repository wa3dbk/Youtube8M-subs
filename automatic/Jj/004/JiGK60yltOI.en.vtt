00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
here you've got letters logics and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.320

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
taken and you have another little key

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.390 
taken and you have another little key
here<00:02:42.239> you've<00:02:42.660> got<00:02:42.840> volume<00:02:43.110> controls<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.010> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
here you've got volume controls and a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.460 
here you've got volume controls and a
question<00:02:44.790> key<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.599> again<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.379> do

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
question key and again so you can do

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.089 
question key and again so you can do
vocabulary<00:02:47.160> numbers<00:02:47.640> logic<00:02:48.209> all<00:02:48.450> built<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.110> so

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
vocabulary numbers logic all built in so

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.300 
vocabulary numbers logic all built in so
it<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.220> pretty<00:02:50.489> similar<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.910> lot<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.060> little

Jake the Never Land pirates my wife is a
teacher<00:03:01.230> she<00:03:01.950> fully<00:03:02.519> approves<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
teacher she fully approves of it the

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.530 
teacher she fully approves of it the
screen<00:03:04.349> itself<00:03:04.800> isn't<00:03:05.129> very<00:03:05.370> bright<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.450> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
screen itself isn't very bright so you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.199 
screen itself isn't very bright so you
probably<00:03:06.959> saw<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:08.670> does<00:03:08.849> come<00:03:09.060> with

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
probably saw that it does come with

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.500 
probably saw that it does come with
batteries<00:03:10.160> the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
batteries the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.470 
batteries the
these<00:03:11.629> are<00:03:11.989> real<00:03:12.409> easy<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.890> see<00:03:13.159> so<00:03:13.879> I<00:03:13.909> kind<00:03:14.420> of

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
these are real easy to see so I kind of

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.240 
these are real easy to see so I kind of
give<00:03:14.599> me<00:03:14.659> a<00:03:14.750> lot<00:03:14.959> of<00:03:14.989> different<00:03:15.349> little<00:03:15.769> looks

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
give me a lot of different little looks

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.000 
give me a lot of different little looks
about<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:16.849> but<00:03:17.629> the<00:03:18.019> screen<00:03:18.140> it'd<00:03:18.560> be<00:03:18.680> nicer<00:03:18.980> if

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
about it but the screen it'd be nicer if

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.199 
about it but the screen it'd be nicer if
there's<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.250> little<00:03:19.489> bit<00:03:19.610> bigger<00:03:19.819> and<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.150> little

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
there's a little bit bigger and a little

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.020 
there's a little bit bigger and a little
bit<00:03:20.420> brighter<00:03:20.780> but<00:03:21.709> other<00:03:22.340> than<00:03:22.519> that<00:03:22.610> it's

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
bit brighter but other than that it's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.500 
bit brighter but other than that it's
pretty<00:03:23.180> good

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.119 

one<00:03:26.510> other<00:03:26.659> note<00:03:27.170> out<00:03:27.379> is<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.980> little

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
one other note out is that the little

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.149 
one other note out is that the little
mouse<00:03:28.519> doesn't<00:03:29.390> store<00:03:29.720> inside<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.040> even

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
mouse doesn't store inside of it so even

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.180 
mouse doesn't store inside of it so even
though<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:32.750> can<00:03:32.900> put<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.440> have<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:33.980> space

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
though you can put it you have the space

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.500 
though you can put it you have the space
underneath<00:03:34.579> it'd<00:03:34.879> be<00:03:34.970> nice<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.329> actually

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
underneath it'd be nice if it actually

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.369 
underneath it'd be nice if it actually
stored<00:03:35.989> there<00:03:36.260> which<00:03:37.010> it<00:03:37.159> doesn't<00:03:37.989> but<00:03:38.989> that's

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
stored there which it doesn't but that's

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.470 
stored there which it doesn't but that's
kind<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.370> minor<00:03:40.609> complaint<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:43.069> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
kind of a minor complaint to the to the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.270 
kind of a minor complaint to the to the
computer<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:44.690> my<00:03:44.870> final<00:03:45.049> verdict<00:03:45.500> on<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.769> I'm

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
computer so my final verdict on it I'm

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.800 
computer so my final verdict on it I'm
gonna<00:03:46.489> give<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:46.730> four<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.510> four<00:03:47.659> and<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:47.780> half

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
gonna give it four to four and a half

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.080 
gonna give it four to four and a half
stars<00:03:48.310> be<00:03:49.310> nice<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.670> screen<00:03:49.909> there's<00:03:50.060> a

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
stars be nice to the screen there's a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.360 
stars be nice to the screen there's a
little<00:03:50.269> bit<00:03:50.359> bigger<00:03:50.569> a<00:03:50.780> little<00:03:50.959> bit<00:03:51.049> brighter

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
little bit bigger a little bit brighter

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.069 
little bit bigger a little bit brighter
it'd<00:03:52.370> be<00:03:52.519> nice<00:03:52.700> if<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:53.120> Jake<00:03:53.389> voice<00:03:53.659> matched

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
it'd be nice if the Jake voice matched

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.629 
it'd be nice if the Jake voice matched
up<00:03:54.379> a<00:03:54.440> little<00:03:54.590> bit<00:03:54.709> better<00:03:54.829> with<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.190> show

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
up a little bit better with the show

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.180 
up a little bit better with the show
it<00:03:55.760> sounds<00:03:56.060> pretty<00:03:56.150> close<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:57.319> for<00:03:58.040> whatever

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
it sounds pretty close but for whatever

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.740 
it sounds pretty close but for whatever
reason<00:03:58.340> doesn't<00:03:58.790> sound<00:03:58.940> exactly<00:03:59.209> like<00:03:59.450> the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
reason doesn't sound exactly like the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.129 
reason doesn't sound exactly like the
show

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139
