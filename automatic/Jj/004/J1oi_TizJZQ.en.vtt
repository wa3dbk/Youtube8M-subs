we<00:00:00.480> talked<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.810> lot<00:00:01.050> about<00:00:01.199> nutrition<00:00:01.410> and

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
we talked a lot about nutrition and

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.139 
we talked a lot about nutrition and
overall<00:00:02.370> health

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
overall health

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.530

what<00:00:03.720> role<00:00:03.929> does<00:00:04.140> genetics<00:00:04.740> play<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:06.270> big

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
what role does genetics play in that big

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.660 
what role does genetics play in that big
picture<00:00:06.750> whether<00:00:07.140> it<00:00:07.379> be<00:00:07.890> related<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.309> our

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
picture whether it be related to our

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
picture whether it be related to our
nutrition<00:00:09.360> or<00:00:09.660> or<00:00:10.349> other<00:00:10.620> things<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.660> you<00:00:12.660> know

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
nutrition or or other things so you know

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.930 
nutrition or or other things so you know
all<00:00:13.019> smokers<00:00:13.799> don't<00:00:13.950> get<00:00:14.130> lung<00:00:14.280> cancer<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
all smokers don't get lung cancer and

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.550 
all smokers don't get lung cancer and
what<00:00:15.120> that<00:00:15.269> tells<00:00:15.599> us<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.139> there's<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
what that tells us is that there's a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.500 
what that tells us is that there's a
genetic<00:00:16.920> predisposition<00:00:17.150> does<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.300> say

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
genetic predisposition does that say

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.550 
genetic predisposition does that say
that<00:00:18.690> smoking<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.359> know<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.810> good<00:00:22.470> or

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
that smoking is is you know is good or

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.759 
that smoking is is you know is good or
bad

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
bad

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.060 
bad
if<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.039> smokings<00:00:23.430> bad<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.970> everybody<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
if it smokings bad for everybody but the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.040 
if it smokings bad for everybody but the
why<00:00:26.220> doesn't<00:00:26.550> everyone<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:27.300> an<00:00:27.480> uncle<00:00:27.869> that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
why doesn't everyone have an uncle that

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.140 
why doesn't everyone have an uncle that
lived<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.740> ever<00:00:28.949> smoke<00:00:29.310> depend<00:00:29.640> okay

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
lived to be what ever smoke depend okay

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.450 
lived to be what ever smoke depend okay
well<00:00:30.300> there's<00:00:30.990> certainly<00:00:31.590> genetic<00:00:32.070> factors

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
well there's certainly genetic factors

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.690 
well there's certainly genetic factors
so<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> usually<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> hear

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
so but but what I usually when I hear

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400 
so but but what I usually when I hear
that<00:00:35.940> though<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.540> how<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
that though is how I you know I have a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.930 
that though is how I you know I have a
you<00:00:37.770> know<00:00:37.860> family<00:00:38.129> history<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.460> heart<00:00:38.610> disease

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
you know family history of heart disease

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
you know family history of heart disease
or<00:00:38.969> something<00:00:39.450> well<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.350> just<00:00:40.379> means<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
or something well that just means you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.959 
or something well that just means you
have<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> eat<00:00:41.250> even<00:00:41.340> healthier<00:00:41.820> than

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
have to eat even healthier than

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
have to eat even healthier than
everybody<00:00:42.239> else<00:00:42.570> right<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.140> mean<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.410> means

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
everybody else right I mean that means

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
everybody else right I mean that means
that<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:45.539> people<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.899> get

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
that you know you some people can get

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
that you know you some people can get
away<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.649> carry<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.640> being<00:00:47.820> so

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
away with carry you know not being so

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.410 
away with carry you know not being so
great<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.950> eat

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
great but for you you have to eat

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.790 
great but for you you have to eat
exquisitely<00:00:51.420> healthy<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.079> combat<00:00:52.500> that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
exquisitely healthy to combat that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.850 
exquisitely healthy to combat that
genetic<00:00:53.219> predisposition<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.270> anything

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
genetic predisposition so of anything

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
genetic predisposition so of anything
you<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.980> people<00:00:56.579> family<00:00:56.910> histories<00:00:57.270> people

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
you know people family histories people

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
you know people family histories people
you<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.649> more<00:00:58.859> susceptible<00:00:59.219> then<00:00:59.670> do

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you know or are more susceptible then do

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.549 
you know or are more susceptible then do
they<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> eat<00:01:00.719> healthier<00:01:01.230> than

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
they just have to eat healthier than

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.039 
they just have to eat healthier than
kind<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.859> everybody<00:01:02.309> else<00:01:02.600> but<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> doesn't

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
kind of everybody else but it doesn't

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.250 
kind of everybody else but it doesn't
make<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> food<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.369> know<00:01:05.780> less<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> more<00:01:07.140> I

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
make the food you know less and more I

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
make the food you know less and more I
mean<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.650> foods<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.549> our<00:01:09.060> health

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
mean it's just foods are our health

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
mean it's just foods are our health
promoting<00:01:10.380> they're<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.950> health<00:01:11.159> promoting

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
promoting they're not health promoting

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.789 
promoting they're not health promoting
and<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.170> there's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.710> know

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and it's just that there's a you know

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
and it's just that there's a you know
kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.189> bell<00:01:14.460> curve<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.909> genetic

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
kind of a bell curve of genetic

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.260 
kind of a bell curve of genetic
susceptibility<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.740> example<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.460> said

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
susceptibility so for example I said

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.359 
susceptibility so for example I said
Nobel<00:01:18.540> Prize<00:01:18.810> Brown<00:01:19.439> Goldstein<00:01:19.890> went<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
Nobel Prize Brown Goldstein went to the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370 
Nobel Prize Brown Goldstein went to the
discovery<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> LDL<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.840> cholesterol

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
discovery of the LDL this cholesterol

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.469 
discovery of the LDL this cholesterol
receptor<00:01:22.860> some<00:01:23.040> people<00:01:23.340> are<00:01:23.640> able<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> clear

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
receptor some people are able to clear

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.940 
receptor some people are able to clear
cholesterol<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.049> fat<00:01:25.229> other<00:01:25.470> blood<00:01:25.710> better

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
cholesterol and fat other blood better

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.950 
cholesterol and fat other blood better
than<00:01:26.189> others<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.939> some<00:01:27.150> people<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.600> eat<00:01:27.750> 10

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
than others so some people can eat 10

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.240 
than others so some people can eat 10
eggs<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.320> day<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.890> bump<00:01:29.100> their

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
eggs a day and not bump their

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.420 
eggs a day and not bump their
cholesterol<00:01:29.430> at<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:30.650> whereas<00:01:31.650> other<00:01:31.920> people

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
cholesterol at all whereas other people

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.190 
cholesterol at all whereas other people
you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.939> even<00:01:33.299> just<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.780> lessen<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you know even just you know lessen the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530 
you know even just you know lessen the
naked<00:01:34.530> day<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.520> push<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:35.970> their<00:01:36.180> their

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
naked day can really push up their their

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.929 
naked day can really push up their their
cholesterol<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.470> bell<00:01:37.710> curve

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
cholesterol so there's this bell curve

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.960 
cholesterol so there's this bell curve
and<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.479> looking<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:40.500> why<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.850> know

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and so looking so that's why we you know

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.069 
and so looking so that's why we you know
can<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.930> know<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.470> Taylor<00:01:44.310> dives<00:01:44.659> to<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
can you know can can Taylor dives to you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.910 
can you know can can Taylor dives to you
know<00:01:46.250> people's<00:01:47.250> particular<00:01:47.759> biochemistry

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
know people's particular biochemistry

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.289 
know people's particular biochemistry
but<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.070> mean<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.340> general<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.850> mean<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
but I mean in general I mean but the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.420 
but I mean in general I mean but the
same<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.229> either<00:01:52.380> foods<00:01:53.159> are<00:01:53.310> either

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
same so it's either foods are either

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.840 
same so it's either foods are either
less<00:01:53.729> bad<00:01:54.000> or<00:01:54.409> more<00:01:55.409> bad<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.729> not

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
less bad or more bad right but it's not

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.940 
less bad or more bad right but it's not
like<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.210> some<00:01:57.390> people<00:01:57.780> bacon<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> awesome

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
like for some people bacon is awesome

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.249 
like for some people bacon is awesome
and<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.210> other<00:02:00.299> people<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.719> not<00:02:00.840> good<00:02:01.049> for

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and for other people it's not good for

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.830 
and for other people it's not good for
them<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.860> how<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.840> they

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
them and that's not how it's just they

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.050 
them and that's not how it's just they
may<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.130> more<00:02:05.130> or<00:02:05.159> less<00:02:05.310> genetically

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
may be more or less genetically

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.520 
may be more or less genetically
susceptible<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.990> cancer-causing

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
susceptible to the cancer-causing

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:16.400 
susceptible to the cancer-causing
effects<00:02:08.069> or<00:02:08.369> etc

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
