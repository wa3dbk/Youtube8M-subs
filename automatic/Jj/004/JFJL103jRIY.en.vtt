00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.410
 I admit I'm on the s 7 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.270
 may it be laid back a bit 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.610
 i really want to go to the bridge 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.760
 but please, please not thank you 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.800
 I just believe the way here 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.230
 i was just doing sports and there am 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.310
 but was michael box had to 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.780
 In any case, I do not know 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.600
 klinger when i'm just motivating men 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.950
 and I've got some set up for something 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.140
 play and then stop but that too 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.510
 then yes this topic 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.940
 Interested will probably only 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.830
 as apps are interesting and also days 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.320
 Of course, you like youtube own 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.110
 something in any case 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.660
 I have read from type 2 clicks 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.340
 has posted something and what was in it 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.140
 That was not going to grab that now 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.970
 kindly sg and tips but me 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.830
 anyway, it's only because I'm interested in that 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.210
 not really the player earlier 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:36.890
 Maybe it was not like that anymore 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:39.440
 and two diaz and where to think 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.670
 long because I do not really have 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:48.790
 good things 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.790
 and yes the diver we would have the un 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.680
 seat around that the board 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.070
 died and if it is somebody 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.320
 he can not harm that and that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.880
 Similarly, I would like to come to the topic 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.580
 it was once so deposited again 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.370
 were and at the spot kontron somehow 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.230
 Names are through the virgin bug by 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.730
 In 1817 somehow that was white on the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.060
 server goes and with it something 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.090
 made 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.590
 I do not know what and I have boxers 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.720
 then times by e mail and written 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.459
 then on skype if you did not 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.860
 could somehow fix it because it's real 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.440
 annoying if you like eyeglasses for example 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.170
 would like to record and as non premium 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.769
 all giggs 2 mania non premium was toni 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.880
 case and info brake that's real 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.160
 noticed if you have such a funny 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.440
 had names and you have the myth pong 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.810
 seen and one is the only one left 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.230
 bremen and stuff but it wanted now 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.250
 fixed 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.750
 you can see the youtube was not 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.350
 more in the spot so I say extra 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.400
 youtuber because the ip is so for me yes 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.430
 youtuber because i generally think i think so 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.109
 So that's what I record 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.340
 say now youtube as I hope 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.109
 you understand this a little bit could 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.169
 understand it 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.010
 and yes this time it simply through random 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:12.380
 Of course not hope 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.910
 the fight well the guy the right too 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:21.829
 in my round but then we want 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:27.560
 both easy for klien but that 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:30.200
 all kinds of what does me and yes I had 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.070
 box also asked if it would be possible that 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.500
 how to do it earlier 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.660
 the nicknames the nickname 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.859
 so get brought back for example 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.359
 which day you see that you see 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.650
 have gold and I hate one and clear 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.900
 under the stroke I can also in the point 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.079
 Write and I'm just more 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.530
 I can be here his fans 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.419
 if I do a flex am doing is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.350
 definitely really cool thing because there 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.519
 you just really can 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.480
 once play problems without attracting attention 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.579
 should stream 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.440
 it was earlier this bug that has become 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.540
 somehow got that is also 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.199
 but premium had them on 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.500
 fixed every case 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:07.790
 and therefore it brings nothing and yes before 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.750
 that will be again I will 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.359
 it probably only in the moment 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.980
 play and I just do it because yes 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.049
 So now I'm just normal 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.010
 I can play if I know 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.739
 not if we saw the last video 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.269
 I have there for example in the print home 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.320
 there you really saw that me 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.110
 Often times will be topped and 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.650
 I hope now and have it hard 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:33.710
 dollar like all fans will be right for 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.710
 people can but he has seen my god 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.510
 but i want to get out i want to get out 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:05:00.870
 a hit thank you and the old man 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:02.850
 that will be such a point again and knows 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.620
 not if that's a team but somehow 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.720
 they were so next to london and toni 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.640
 attacked no idea but that did 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.670
 It would have been a pity to me 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:20.510
 the people now is the corner and can 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:25.260
 then ok or so we could have old 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.450
 from 66 in tecdax here see in midfield 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.530
 and everything and yes this resort will pack 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.070
 1 so it will be part of the specials 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.450
 his 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.950
 Of course I would do several parts 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.350
 not just resource beck 100 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.940
 clear that we are a little bit longer part 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.270
 which I think I have one 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.560
 others still in planning and the others 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.900
 I have to look at me anyway 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.860
 If he had an idea but if I had that 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.160
 implement because it does not but you become 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.140
 learn early enough to say yes she is 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.990
 Rosberg there you have a pistol 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.870
 ties I'm sorry but I hope 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:03.830
 of course that we reach the 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.830
 In any case, we would have cool too 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:19.680
 that's not a pity but that 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:23.080
 I'm still hoping okay you can do it 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.720
 it attracts not happen so often that 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.890
 to finish myself by myself 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:31.840
 somehow with fn stb hard what the facc 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:37.750
 was the gadget in the end 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.000
 So you're that could come to me now 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.470
 But it was really funny when I was here 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.550
 and there was almost track role or yes ok 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.260
 but I do not say so 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.260
 lighter and rhine to the next
