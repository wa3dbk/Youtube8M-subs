00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the law that regulates the use of 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.990
 film not darkened glasses 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.570
 changed the famous that movie remains 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.610
 allowed but a good study in the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.990
 subject before installing your 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.719
 even following the rules of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.369
 transparency a trick can 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.130
 let out of the law 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.020
 do you use darkened 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.230
 of your car for the sake of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.859
 aesthetic safety comfort 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.019
 look is the question of aesthetics because I 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.000
 I like quite a lot and according to comfort 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.420
 really how much of the sun the whole time 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.820
 first because of comfort in the sun 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.469
 very strong and secure too 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.239
 according to my son how much more 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.329
 better dark 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.640
 whatever option you know exists 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.410
 a big chance the car is in 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.010
 irregular situation 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.420
 the national traffic council contran 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.629
 sets limits for transparency 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.460
 minimum of the glass film assembly and how 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.160
 the cars usually leave the factory 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.650
 with videos within that limit 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.180
 any vehicle that is applied goes 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.570
 let them out of parameters 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.500
 established by law 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:16.950
 but after all what establishes the law 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.680
 in accordance with resolution 254 of the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.610
 installing tinted films to 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.180
 transparency shall not be less than 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.040
 75% on the windshield and 70% colorless on 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.000
 colored windshield and glass 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.060
 front and 28% in the other 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.630
 reflective glass 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.909
 nor think the citizen who likes the car 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.090
 with the dark glasses you find in the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.100
 market a multitude of movies but 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.480
 you must be careful where you install the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.880
 may have problems with oversight 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.880
 the contran further determines that the film 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.370
 must necessarily have the seal that 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.220
 the level of transparency more 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.740
 Benchmarking fight effect can only be 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.750
 made with device luxmeter already 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.090
 homologated by denatran 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.820
 but few oversight agencies 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.790
 have the equipment in the country and 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.030
 inspection is done literally 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.820
 in the eye and uberlandia mines general 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.950
 the federal highway police makes use of the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.540
 that has become available in the state 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.770
 and every 10 cars inspected nine are 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.630
 notified 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.750
 the notice of infringement and can only be 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.440
 after plowing if the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.970
 growth 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.030
 I can not just find it 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.830
 That too dark film is to make 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.530
 a fine is drawing an infraction notice 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.960
 based on what I think the correct would be 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.370
 all the companies that make the 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.620
 placement of the film has a 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.870
 equipment to put 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.310
 that stamp on the exact value of 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.170
 transmutation memory of that of that 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.910
 Ovid public together often 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.700
 user goes to a store of this 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.950
 place film and there simply the owner 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.080
 of the store puts the seal that would 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.930
 allowed is more that non-stop 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.000
 it's happening with reality 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.090
 in SÃ£o Paulo last year the police 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.310
 has assembled almost 10,000 cars that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.940
 were in disagreement with the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.550
 law 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.550
 walking with car with films outside 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.780
 of the established standard is serious infringement 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.050
 with a fine of r $ 127 69 cents and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.140
 retention of the vehicle for regularization 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.970
 as a way of not harming the citizen 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.500
 install this equipment in your vehicle 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.650
 we do a check for 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.810
 perceiving the real 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.540
 transparency of the vehicle. 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.370
 approximate receives this film citizen 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.220
 that arrives here do not detran to do 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.380
 transfer survey and the second 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.980
 people are faced with this situation 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.110
 a dark film we guide him 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.430
 remove this equipment so that 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:01.790
 cause more risk to traffic or 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.280
 cars with very dark glasses please 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.640
 in the eyes of many people but can be 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.069
 been 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.780
 problem without mentioning that the 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.700
 film detrimental minutes 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.250
 visibility of the driver mainly 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.650
 at night and still complicates the life of 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.260
 third in car with dark glass 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.570
 stopped at the corner and asked that others 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.550
 drivers have an adequate view of the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.550
 crossing may even cause the accident
