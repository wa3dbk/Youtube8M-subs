00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.610 

my<00:00:00.329> name<00:00:00.450> is<00:00:00.510> Janssen<00:00:00.870> and<00:00:00.989> I'm<00:00:01.319> just<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.560> to

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
my name is Janssen and I'm just going to

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.080 
my name is Janssen and I'm just going to
tell<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.100> guys<00:00:02.190> how<00:00:02.399> the<00:00:02.460> sodium<00:00:03.060> potassium

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
tell you guys how the sodium potassium

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.980 
tell you guys how the sodium potassium
pump<00:00:03.449> works<00:00:03.810> it's<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.290> pretty<00:00:04.859> important

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
pump works it's a pretty important

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.540 
pump works it's a pretty important
physiological<00:00:07.250> mechanism<00:00:08.250> that's

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
physiological mechanism that's

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.360 
physiological mechanism that's
constantly<00:00:09.330> being<00:00:09.389> used<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.500> basically<00:00:11.040> it's

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
constantly being used so basically it's

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.459 
constantly being used so basically it's
a<00:00:11.460> protein<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.360> like<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.960> as<00:00:13.110> a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
a protein and I like to think of it as a

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.770 
a protein and I like to think of it as a
mouth<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.309> can<00:00:14.370> open<00:00:14.849> either<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> inside

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
mouth that can open either to the inside

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.130 
mouth that can open either to the inside
of<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.960> cell<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.779> the<00:00:18.779> inside

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
of a cell so this is that is the inside

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.650 
of a cell so this is that is the inside
of<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.859> cell<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.340> think<00:00:20.820> that's<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> muscle

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
of a cell I think that's like a muscle

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.290 
of a cell I think that's like a muscle
cell<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.230> nerve<00:00:22.380> cell<00:00:22.850> here's<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> outside

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
cell and nerve cell here's the outside

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.710 
cell and nerve cell here's the outside
and<00:00:25.189> basically<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.460> happens<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.480> got

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and basically what happens is it's got

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.230 
and basically what happens is it's got
three<00:00:28.109> locations<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.189> sodium<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.699> bind<00:00:29.910> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
three locations for sodium to bind and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.780 
three locations for sodium to bind and
two<00:00:31.230> locations<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:31.890> potassium<00:00:32.160> devine<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
two locations for potassium devine and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
two locations for potassium devine and
the<00:00:32.940> whole<00:00:33.090> point<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.930> sodium<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the whole point is to get sodium on the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
the whole point is to get sodium on the
outside<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> cell<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.030> potassium<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
outside of the cell and potassium to the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.319 
outside of the cell and potassium to the
inside<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> cell<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.969> how<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.180> does

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
inside of the cell and so how it does

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.540 
inside of the cell and so how it does
this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.809> when<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.860> form<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.460> it's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
this is when it's in this form and it's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
this is when it's in this form and it's
open<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.540> inside<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> cell

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
open to the the inside of the cell

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
open to the the inside of the cell
sodium<00:00:44.399> really<00:00:44.730> likes<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> come<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
sodium really likes to come in here and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
sodium really likes to come in here and
bind<00:00:45.899> these<00:00:46.230> little<00:00:46.500> spots<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.550> nice

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
bind these little spots here it's a nice

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.279 
bind these little spots here it's a nice
little<00:00:47.879> environment<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.539> sodium<00:00:48.809> bind<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
little environment for sodium bind it

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
little environment for sodium bind it
likes<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.239> have

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
likes to be in there and then we have

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.049 
likes to be in there and then we have
this<00:00:51.649> ATP<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.520> conformation

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this ATP so it's in this conformation

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.689 
this ATP so it's in this conformation
when<00:00:54.210> ATP<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> bound<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.460> basically<00:00:56.460> what

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
when ATP is bound and basically what

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
when ATP is bound and basically what
happens<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.559> ATP<00:00:58.559> gets<00:00:58.859> hydrolyzed<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.590> turns

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
happens is ATP gets hydrolyzed and turns

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.649 
happens is ATP gets hydrolyzed and turns
into<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:03.229> DP<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.700> lose<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> phosphate<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
into a DP and you lose a phosphate and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.810 
into a DP and you lose a phosphate and
by<00:01:07.380> breaking<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.979> phosphate<00:01:08.369> bond<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
by breaking this phosphate bond at the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.850 
by breaking this phosphate bond at the
end<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.090> ATP<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.990> release<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> small<00:01:10.470> amount<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
end of ATP you release a small amount of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.420 
end of ATP you release a small amount of
energy<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.720> causes<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.799> what

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
energy and so that causes that what

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390 
energy and so that causes that what
causes<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.450> happen<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.830> changes<00:01:17.369> shape

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
causes it to happen is it changes shape

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
causes it to happen is it changes shape
and<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> kind<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and you kind of think of it as so it's a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
and you kind of think of it as so it's a
its<00:01:19.979> open<00:01:20.340> mouth<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> bottom

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
its open mouth like that to the bottom

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
its open mouth like that to the bottom
and<00:01:21.540> breaking<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> ATP<00:01:22.590> molecule<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.100> kind

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and breaking that ATP molecule up kind

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.660 
and breaking that ATP molecule up kind
of<00:01:23.400> forces<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.450> open<00:01:24.720> up<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.930> top<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> at

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
of forces it open up the top and so at

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.030 
of forces it open up the top and so at
this<00:01:26.759> point<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.470> sodium's<00:01:28.470> bound<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
this point you have sodium's bound and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.030 
this point you have sodium's bound and
they<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> want<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.509> hop<00:01:30.659> off<00:01:31.040> they

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
they just kind of want to hop off they

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.960 
they just kind of want to hop off they
don't<00:01:32.189> want<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.369> be<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:32.700> anymore

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
don't want to be in there anymore

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
don't want to be in there anymore
because<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.329> shape<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> protein<00:01:33.900> doesn't

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
because the shape of the protein doesn't

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.950 
because the shape of the protein doesn't
agree<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.270> their<00:01:36.509> shape<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
agree with them but now their shape it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
agree with them but now their shape it
does<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.560> potassium<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.400> potassium<00:01:38.759> comes

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
does like potassium so potassium comes

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
does like potassium so potassium comes
into<00:01:39.450> binds<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.340> only<00:01:41.490> two<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.790> them

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
into binds and it's only two of them

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
into binds and it's only two of them
that<00:01:42.030> combine<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.509> every<00:01:42.780> three<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> three

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that combine so every three that three

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.160 
that combine so every three that three
sodium's<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:45.329> castings<00:01:45.840> come<00:01:46.020> in

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
sodium's that go out to castings come in

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.469 
sodium's that go out to castings come in
and<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:47.100> ATP<00:01:48.060> comes

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.289 

in<00:01:50.570> binds<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:51.680> again<00:01:52.009> and<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:52.970> happens

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
in binds to this again and what happens

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.770 
in binds to this again and what happens
is<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.939> reverts<00:01:55.939> back<00:01:56.240> into<00:01:56.509> its<00:01:56.630> normal

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
is it it reverts back into its normal

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.520 
is it it reverts back into its normal
state<00:01:57.400> potassium<00:01:58.400> pops<00:01:58.549> off<00:01:59.290> so<00:02:00.290> I'm<00:02:00.350> going<00:02:00.470> to

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
state potassium pops off so I'm going to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.670 
state potassium pops off so I'm going to
get<00:02:00.649> two<00:02:00.890> more<00:02:01.159> these<00:02:01.399> guys<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.850> here<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.680> you

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
get two more these guys in here and you

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.969 
get two more these guys in here and you
now<00:02:03.830> have<00:02:04.360> for<00:02:05.360> each<00:02:05.479> cycle<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.649> have<00:02:06.770> three

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
now have for each cycle you have three

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.740 
now have for each cycle you have three
three<00:02:07.430> sodium's<00:02:07.820> on<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.000> outside<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.600> two

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
three sodium's on the outside and two

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.779 
three sodium's on the outside and two
potassium<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.289> on<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.500> inside<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.610> what

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
potassium is on the inside and so what

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.670 
potassium is on the inside and so what
this<00:02:10.910> creates<00:02:11.239> is<00:02:11.510> what's<00:02:12.380> called<00:02:12.590> the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
this creates is what's called the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.940 
this creates is what's called the
diffusional<00:02:13.220> gradient<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:15.260> cells<00:02:15.620> can

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
diffusional gradient and the cells can

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.210 
diffusional gradient and the cells can
use<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.340> diffusional<00:02:16.910> gradient<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:18.220> for

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
use this diffusional gradient to for

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.910 
use this diffusional gradient to for
example<00:02:19.580> signal<00:02:20.140> they<00:02:21.140> can<00:02:21.290> use<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.560> like<00:02:21.739> in

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
example signal they can use it like in

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.320 
example signal they can use it like in
muscle<00:02:22.190> fibers<00:02:22.519> that<00:02:22.580> can<00:02:22.730> use<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.060> start

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
muscle fibers that can use it to start

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.090 
muscle fibers that can use it to start
the<00:02:25.480> cellular<00:02:26.480> machinery<00:02:27.110> for<00:02:27.440> contractions

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
the cellular machinery for contractions

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.009 
the cellular machinery for contractions
and<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:30.140> explain<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.420> I'll<00:02:32.420> take<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.750> nerve

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
and so to explain that I'll take a nerve

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.150 
and so to explain that I'll take a nerve
cell<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.890> example<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.260> have<00:02:36.500> let's<00:02:37.010> just

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
cell for example so you have let's just

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.900 
cell for example so you have let's just
pretend<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.730> an<00:02:37.850> axon<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:40.580> is

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
pretend this is an axon and this is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
pretend this is an axon and this is
again<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:41.959> outside<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.180> inside<00:02:44.600> and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
again this is outside this is inside and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.740 
again this is outside this is inside and
thanks<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:45.980> sodium<00:02:46.250> potassium<00:02:46.310> pump<00:02:46.910> we

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
thanks to the sodium potassium pump we

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.229 
thanks to the sodium potassium pump we
have<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:48.290> bunch<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.709> sodium<00:02:48.950> outside<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:52.239> we

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
have a bunch of sodium outside and we

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.030 
have a bunch of sodium outside and we
have<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.690> bunch<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:53.989> potassium<00:02:54.470> on<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.709> inside

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
have a bunch of potassium on the inside

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.890 
have a bunch of potassium on the inside
and<00:02:55.519> these<00:02:55.670> are<00:02:55.790> these<00:02:56.120> are<00:02:56.299> all<00:02:56.329> ions<00:02:56.690> they

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
and these are these are all ions they

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.990 
and these are these are all ions they
all<00:02:57.140> all<00:02:57.680> have<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> little<00:02:58.250> bit<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.489> charge<00:02:58.760> to

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
all all have a little bit of a charge to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.180 
all all have a little bit of a charge to
them<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.329> what<00:03:00.260> this<00:03:00.380> charge<00:03:00.680> does<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.070> it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
them and what this charge does is it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.280 
them and what this charge does is it
gives<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.459> membrane<00:03:01.940> an<00:03:02.180> actual<00:03:02.570> voltage<00:03:02.989> and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
gives the membrane an actual voltage and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.660 
gives the membrane an actual voltage and
it's<00:03:03.500> negative<00:03:03.950> because<00:03:04.280> there's<00:03:04.489> more

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
it's negative because there's more

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.819 
it's negative because there's more
positively<00:03:05.540> charged<00:03:05.900> sodium<00:03:06.230> ions<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.739> the

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
positively charged sodium ions on the

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.680 
positively charged sodium ions on the
outside<00:03:07.190> then<00:03:07.790> there<00:03:07.970> are<00:03:08.090> negatively

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
outside then there are negatively

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.479 
outside then there are negatively
charged<00:03:09.049> potassium<00:03:09.230> ions<00:03:09.620> in<00:03:09.769> it<00:03:09.890> on<00:03:10.040> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
charged potassium ions in it on the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.440 
charged potassium ions in it on the
inside<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.959> what<00:03:12.739> happens<00:03:13.100> is<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:14.269> nerve

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
inside and so what happens is in a nerve

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.820 
inside and so what happens is in a nerve
cell<00:03:14.780> we<00:03:15.709> have<00:03:15.970> specific<00:03:16.970> channels

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
cell we have specific channels

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.550 
cell we have specific channels
so<00:03:19.340> one<00:03:19.880> of<00:03:19.910> these<00:03:20.030> could<00:03:20.300> be<00:03:20.330> a<00:03:20.690> voltage-gated

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
so one of these could be a voltage-gated

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.500 
so one of these could be a voltage-gated
sodium<00:03:21.890> channel<00:03:22.520> the<00:03:23.120> other<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.450> a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
sodium channel the other is a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.780 
sodium channel the other is a
voltage-gated<00:03:23.810> potassium<00:03:24.110> channel<00:03:24.800> and<00:03:24.980> when

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
voltage-gated potassium channel and when

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.550 
voltage-gated potassium channel and when
the<00:03:25.910> start<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.210> a<00:03:26.240> nerve<00:03:26.720> impulse<00:03:27.110> comes<00:03:27.380> and

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
the start of a nerve impulse comes and

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.230 
the start of a nerve impulse comes and
reaches<00:03:27.830> axon<00:03:28.280> or<00:03:28.460> there's<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.760> bunch<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.120> these

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
reaches axon or there's a bunch of these

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.560 
reaches axon or there's a bunch of these
channels<00:03:29.780> these<00:03:30.680> things<00:03:30.950> open<00:03:31.310> up<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:32.300> you

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
channels these things open up and you

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.970 
channels these things open up and you
get<00:03:32.690> a<00:03:32.720> huge<00:03:33.080> influx<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.310> sodium<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:36.620> huge

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
get a huge influx of sodium and a huge

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.740 
get a huge influx of sodium and a huge
efj<00:03:37.610> lux<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:39.070> potassium<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:41.150> this<00:03:41.300> causes<00:03:41.540> the

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
efj lux of potassium and this causes the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.060 
efj lux of potassium and this causes the
membrane<00:03:41.900> potential<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.560> go<00:03:42.650> from<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:42.950> negative

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
membrane potential to go from a negative

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.220 
membrane potential to go from a negative
charge<00:03:43.520> to<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.760> positive<00:03:44.150> charge<00:03:44.330> and<00:03:44.630> this

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
charge to a positive charge and this

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.020 
charge to a positive charge and this
just<00:03:45.590> propagates<00:03:46.280> all<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:46.580> way<00:03:46.640> down<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.940> the

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
just propagates all the way down to the

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.180 
just propagates all the way down to the
cell<00:03:47.270> gets<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.110> end<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.350> a<00:03:48.410> cell<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.920> get

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
cell gets to the end of a cell you get

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.530 
cell gets to the end of a cell you get
calcium<00:03:49.490> calcium<00:03:50.210> influx<00:03:50.600> which<00:03:51.440> causes

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
calcium calcium influx which causes

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.280 
calcium calcium influx which causes
neurotransmitters<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.570> be<00:03:53.750> released<00:03:54.020> and

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
neurotransmitters to be released and

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.170 
neurotransmitters to be released and
then<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.650> repeats<00:03:55.070> again<00:03:55.490> until<00:03:55.760> it<00:03:55.850> reaches<00:03:56.150> a

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
then it repeats again until it reaches a

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.470 
then it repeats again until it reaches a
target<00:03:56.770> cell<00:03:57.770> or<00:03:58.040> location<00:03:58.820> muscle<00:03:59.180> another

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.100 
target cell or location muscle another
nerve<00:03:59.690> fiber<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:01.360> so<00:04:02.360> that's<00:04:02.630> why<00:04:02.810> you<00:04:02.870> need

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
nerve fiber and so that's why you need

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.720 
nerve fiber and so that's why you need
the<00:04:03.290> diffusional<00:04:03.680> gradients<00:04:04.190> because<00:04:04.520> you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
the diffusional gradients because you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.610 
the diffusional gradients because you
need<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:04.940> bunch<00:04:05.210> of<00:04:05.300> sodium<00:04:05.600> out<00:04:05.690> here<00:04:05.960> you<00:04:06.470> need

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
need a bunch of sodium out here you need

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.350 
need a bunch of sodium out here you need
a<00:04:06.710> bunch<00:04:06.860> of<00:04:06.890> potassium<00:04:07.100> in<00:04:07.430> here<00:04:07.640> or<00:04:08.120> else<00:04:08.270> you

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
a bunch of potassium in here or else you

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.150 
a bunch of potassium in here or else you
can't<00:04:08.570> get<00:04:08.750> that<00:04:08.960> flip<00:04:09.560> in<00:04:09.770> membrane

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
can't get that flip in membrane

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.300 
can't get that flip in membrane
potential<00:04:10.610> in<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.940> communication<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.310> so

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
potential in the communication and so

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.980 
potential in the communication and so
the<00:04:14.030> cool<00:04:14.210> thing<00:04:14.240> about<00:04:14.420> sodium<00:04:14.900> potassium

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
the cool thing about sodium potassium

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.259 
the cool thing about sodium potassium

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.810 
pumps sodium backed out and brings
potassium<00:04:36.800> back<00:04:36.950> in<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:37.310> that<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.550> can<00:04:37.669> have

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
potassium back in so that you can have

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.720 
potassium back in so that you can have

that same membrane potential and

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.490 
that same membrane potential and
something<00:04:40.730> interesting<00:04:40.990> when<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.080> go<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.260> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
something interesting when you go to the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.580 
something interesting when you go to the
dentist<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:44.660> doctor<00:04:44.990> gives<00:04:45.140> you<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.350> shot

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
dentist and the doctor gives you a shot

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.159 
dentist and the doctor gives you a shot
of<00:04:45.740> lidocaine<00:04:46.390> what<00:04:47.390> he's<00:04:47.600> doing<00:04:48.050> is<00:04:49.960> he<00:04:50.960> is

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
of lidocaine what he's doing is he is

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.730 
of lidocaine what he's doing is he is
blocking<00:04:52.240> this<00:04:53.410> voltage-gated<00:04:54.410> sodium

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
blocking this voltage-gated sodium

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.659 
blocking this voltage-gated sodium
channel<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:56.120> now<00:04:56.860> you<00:04:57.860> have<00:04:57.980> all<00:04:58.130> sodium

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
channel so now you have all sodium

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.610 
channel so now you have all sodium
outside<00:04:58.820> sodium<00:04:59.810> can't<00:05:00.050> get<00:05:00.230> through<00:05:00.380> there

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
outside sodium can't get through there

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.500 
outside sodium can't get through there
and<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.220> don't<00:05:01.460> get<00:05:01.640> a<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:03.500> nerve<00:05:03.919> impulse

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
and so you don't get a the nerve impulse

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.550 
and so you don't get a the nerve impulse
propagated<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.690> next<00:05:05.930> cell<00:05:06.080> which<00:05:06.350> means

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
propagated to the next cell which means

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.690 
propagated to the next cell which means
you<00:05:06.620> don't<00:05:06.800> feel<00:05:06.919> pain

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
you don't feel pain

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.070 
you don't feel pain
let's<00:05:08.630> hope<00:05:08.780> how<00:05:09.320> it's<00:05:09.500> applicable
