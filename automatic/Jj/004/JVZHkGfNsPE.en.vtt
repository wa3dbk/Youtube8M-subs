00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.480
 it's been a car myth since 1964 and 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.500
 here it is that finally arrives in europe 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.190
 I named the Ford Mustang I'm leaving for 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.470
 america 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.140
 I leave behind these memories 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.050
 all these American problems 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.230
 so obviously when we evoke 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.779
 American 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.109
 we imagine under his long hood a huge 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.460
 engine the famous big block well here it 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.050
 is not a v8 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.930
 although they are obviously available 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.320
 but it's a four- cylinder a 4 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.290
 cylinders of the family and ecoboost 2003 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.210
 displacement that develops anyway 3 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.059
 117 horses we do not try at all a 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.809
 power at a discount and frankly me 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.180
 this engine he will film life already then 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.160
 obviously there is a little bit of the myth that 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.220
 dehorned since there is not this 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.850
 haunting sound that just 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.730
 idling despite all the 4 cylinders at 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.070
 these benefits on the one hand it consumes 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.860
 still clearly month on the road I 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.170
 even managed to make nine liters 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.640
 same remarkable performance and then 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.340
 as low as it is still 5000 euros 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.750
 cheaper and there is not the super 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.940
 penalty of 8000 euros 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.240
 because with the v8 one reaches 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.130
 almost 300 grams of CO2 there in 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.940
 this convertible version 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.190
 we're at 184 g so you're doing it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.800
 calculation 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.380
 even if the price is still not 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.640
 very very expensive we start at 35000 euros 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.979
 for the coupe version and 37000 euros 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.250
 for the cabriolet version and well away 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.430
 price between the 4 cylinder and the v8 is 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.140
 still feels of course 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.509
 time lovers will also find 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.880
 fault relative to v8 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.160
 we lose a second in the exercise of 0 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.200
 at 100 we are at five seconds eight at 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.030
 place four seconds and frankly 8 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.340
 there is only the grumpy for 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.400
 denigrate this 4 cylinders or those who 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.080
 dream of a v8 without having the means to 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.750
 to offer it 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.820
 take for example at mazet mx 5 is there 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.770
 a 4 cylinder however it is a 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.010
 fantastic car 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.430
 and even if the mechanics are less noble 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.940
 it still remains a mustang and a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.440
 mustang 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.240
 it's also done for you and 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.610
 quietly when sitting 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.300
 behind the wheel where there is the famous 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.300
 mustang horse on the center of the hoop 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.180
 well we are immediately transposed 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.370
 on the other side of the Atlantic it's a 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.060
 sidereal jamming we are in 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.240
 arkansas 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.280
 we are in california we are in the kingdom 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.010
 united on is on an american law 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.880
 it's really a trip or and 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.430
 instant to the big horizons 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.840
 to the American great west 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.050
 and then there is still everything 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.650
 historical background with also 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.700
 movies like gullit same 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.220
 you have to know that France has 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.670
 even a privileged relationship with the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.030
 mustang 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.990
 it was particularly the time of the yéyés 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.380
 with stars that is if we had any 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.270
 a 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.670
 we obviously think of johnny hallyday 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.440
 but that was not the only reason why 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.920
 to go there is all that too 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.380
 integrate mentally when one is at 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.990
 his steering wheel go I'm still launching 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.880
 in a review of this mustang that 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.920
 regards the hood not why 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.720
 because first of all there is a handful 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.370
 to lock and unlock 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.930
 I wonder why they do not have 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.260
 is totally a system completely 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.030
 automated and on the other hand one can not 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.790
 not rolled while rolling or so 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.209
 really at very low speed and that 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.190
 frankly it's a bit of a pity 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.530
 and now we had 8 or 4 cylinders 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.530
 it remains undeniably 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.310
 basically a mustang and 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.080
 frankly I rarely took a foot 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.480
 like driving this car 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.060
 even without really rolling a really 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.330
 it's pleasure in its pure state but 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.239
 pure state and a pleasure that is not 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.350
 inaccessible and finally america 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.350
 it's not that far
