00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
here she gets side to side and up and

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.949 
here she gets side to side and up and
down<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:23.280> can<00:03:23.459> tilt<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.420> hinge<00:03:24.690> right

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
down you can tilt it on this hinge right

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.690 
down you can tilt it on this hinge right
here<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.680> then<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.010> whole<00:03:26.100> assembly<00:03:26.250> can

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
here and then the whole assembly can

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.520 
here and then the whole assembly can
just<00:03:26.880> slide<00:03:27.239> across<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.660> back<00:03:27.989> here<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.290> you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
just slide across the back here so you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.380 
just slide across the back here so you
can<00:03:28.650> put<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.980> gun<00:03:29.190> pretty<00:03:29.670> much<00:03:29.880> wherever<00:03:30.090> you

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
can put the gun pretty much wherever you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.810 
can put the gun pretty much wherever you
want<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.650> movie<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> really<00:03:32.459> free

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
want and in the movie is a really free

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.490 
want and in the movie is a really free
range<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.239> motion<00:03:33.299> with<00:03:33.750> that<00:03:33.900> gun<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.410> it's

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
range of motion with that gun and it's

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.069 
range of motion with that gun and it's
just<00:03:34.650> really<00:03:35.040> nice<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> be<00:03:35.640> able<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.120> get<00:03:36.930> that

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
just really nice to be able to get that

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.819 
just really nice to be able to get that
with<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.380> figure<00:03:37.829> as<00:03:38.420> I<00:03:39.420> mentioned<00:03:39.750> before

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
with the figure as I mentioned before

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.650 
with the figure as I mentioned before
unfortunately<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.040> belts<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.850> ammo<00:03:42.209> gets<00:03:42.510> in

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
unfortunately the belts of ammo gets in

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.979 
unfortunately the belts of ammo gets in
the<00:03:42.750> way<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.239> may<00:03:45.390> not<00:03:45.420> be<00:03:45.660> the

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
the way of that so it may not be the

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.199 
the way of that so it may not be the
best<00:03:46.230> option<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:47.220> stick<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.880> there<00:03:48.030> to

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
best option to stick it in there to

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.690 
best option to stick it in there to
permanently<00:03:48.780> or<00:03:48.959> also<00:03:49.230> be<00:03:49.350> hard<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.650> pose<00:03:49.890> for

the rest of the figures articulation we

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.310

to accommodate bending the hand back as

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.800 
to accommodate bending the hand back as
though<00:04:32.370> you're<00:04:32.520> going<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.700> do<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.789> plasma<00:04:33.570> blast

though you're going to do a plasma blast
you<00:04:34.050> could<00:04:34.169> actually<00:04:34.349> hinge<00:04:34.860> part<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.370> the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
you could actually hinge part of the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.659 
you could actually hinge part of the
armor<00:04:35.880> here

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
armor here

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.529

so<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.330> hand<00:04:37.539> can<00:04:37.749> move<00:04:37.930> freely<00:04:38.199> which<00:04:39.189> is<00:04:39.340> a

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
so the hand can move freely which is a

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.089 
so the hand can move freely which is a
phenomenal<00:04:40.539> touch<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.169> love<00:04:41.590> about<00:04:41.919> this

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
phenomenal touch that I love about this

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.730 
phenomenal touch that I love about this
figure<00:04:42.330> giving<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.449> such<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.870> great<00:04:44.169> range<00:04:44.439> and

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
figure giving it such a great range and

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.230 
figure giving it such a great range and
really<00:04:45.189> makes<00:04:45.370> up<00:04:45.520> for<00:04:45.669> a<00:04:45.699> lot<00:04:45.759> of<00:04:45.909> the<00:04:46.029> gripes

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
really makes up for a lot of the gripes

joint that we had on the three and
three-quarter<00:04:58.779> inch<00:04:58.930> figures<00:04:59.349> will<00:05:00.249> slide

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
three-quarter inch figures will slide

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.029 
three-quarter inch figures will slide
out<00:05:00.699> to<00:05:00.849> the<00:05:00.969> side<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.629> could<00:05:01.749> rotate<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.560> you

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
out to the side you could rotate it you

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.649 
out to the side you could rotate it you
can<00:05:03.099> rotate<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.639> whole<00:05:03.669> ball<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.389> then<00:05:04.479> move

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
can rotate the whole ball and then move

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.929 
can rotate the whole ball and then move
up<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.930> front<00:05:05.139> a<00:05:05.529> little<00:05:06.310> hindered<00:05:06.789> by<00:05:06.909> the

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
up the front a little hindered by the

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.640 
up the front a little hindered by the
way<00:05:07.090> it's<00:05:07.240> sculpted<00:05:07.749> for<00:05:07.930> doing<00:05:08.139> much<00:05:08.289> besides

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
way it's sculpted for doing much besides

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.550 
way it's sculpted for doing much besides
going<00:05:08.949> out<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.279> the<00:05:09.400> side<00:05:10.080> but<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.199> still<00:05:11.409> is

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
going out to the side but it still is

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.409 
going out to the side but it still is
serviceable<00:05:12.069> and<00:05:12.219> much<00:05:12.400> easier<00:05:12.969> to<00:05:13.120> maneuver

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
serviceable and much easier to maneuver

serviceable and much easier to maneuver
on<00:05:13.659> a<00:05:13.840> larger<00:05:14.289> figure<00:05:15.300> obviously<00:05:16.300> could

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
on a larger figure obviously could

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.140 
on a larger figure obviously could
swivel<00:05:16.689> up<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.139> upper<00:05:17.379> leg<00:05:17.789> bend<00:05:18.789> the<00:05:18.909> knee<00:05:19.029> at

two points the knee guard blocking out
the<00:05:23.199> knee<00:05:23.349> joint<00:05:23.650> which<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:23.919> really<00:05:24.279> nice<00:05:24.490> and

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
the knee joint which is really nice and

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.290 
the knee joint which is really nice and
then<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.289> can<00:05:26.529> bend<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.189> pivot<00:05:27.639> at<00:05:27.759> the<00:05:27.909> ankle

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
then you can bend and pivot at the ankle

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.909 
then you can bend and pivot at the ankle
warmachine<00:05:29.199> is<00:05:29.560> an<00:05:29.830> awesome<00:05:30.669> figure<00:05:31.599> I<00:05:31.870> was<00:05:32.560> so

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
warmachine is an awesome figure I was so

warmachine is an awesome figure I was so
psyched<00:05:33.219> to<00:05:33.400> pick<00:05:33.639> it<00:05:33.759> up<00:05:33.879> I<00:05:34.120> was<00:05:34.330> kind<00:05:34.509> of<00:05:34.659> iffy

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
psyched to pick it up I was kind of iffy
