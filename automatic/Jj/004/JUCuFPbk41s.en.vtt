00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
like when I was doing Carrick Sarah the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.230 
like when I was doing Carrick Sarah the
other<00:00:22.140> day<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.650> think<00:00:23.070> last<00:00:23.220> week<00:00:23.340> right<00:00:23.789> you

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
other day I think last week right you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.029 
other day I think last week right you
know<00:00:24.359> I'm<00:00:24.510> I'm<00:00:24.900> running<00:00:25.380> I'm<00:00:25.470> shooting<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
know I'm I'm running I'm shooting the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.250 
know I'm I'm running I'm shooting the
gun<00:00:26.220> everything<00:00:26.699> like<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.330> front<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
gun everything like that in front of the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.259 
gun everything like that in front of the
camera<00:00:28.590> you're<00:00:28.769> actually<00:00:28.920> doing<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.060> mean

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
camera you're actually doing that I mean

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.609 
camera you're actually doing that I mean
mind<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> prop<00:00:30.990> gun<00:00:31.019> but<00:00:31.500> you're

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
mind you it's a prop gun but you're

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.290 
mind you it's a prop gun but you're
still<00:00:31.859> actually<00:00:32.099> running<00:00:32.460> around<00:00:32.790> doing<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
still actually running around doing that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.319 
still actually running around doing that
so<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.110> easier<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> become<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.910> character

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
so it's easier to become the character

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.810 
so it's easier to become the character
and<00:00:36.690> feel<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.469> are<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> character<00:00:38.250> but

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and feel like you are the character but

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
and feel like you are the character but
when<00:00:38.969> you're<00:00:39.120> sitting<00:00:39.390> there<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:40.020> earphones

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
when you're sitting there with earphones

that<00:03:50.020> dark<00:03:50.650> origin<00:03:51.220> kind<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.850> sets<00:03:52.209> in<00:03:52.360> our

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
that dark origin kind of sets in our

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.170 
that dark origin kind of sets in our
minds<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.080> essentially<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.160> spine<00:03:54.820> of

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
minds is essentially the spine of

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.140 
minds is essentially the spine of
ultimately<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.890> great<00:03:57.160> questions<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.880> the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
ultimately the great questions of the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.850 
ultimately the great questions of the
star<00:03:58.360> crab<00:03:58.540> universe<00:03:58.930> will<00:03:59.230> be<00:03:59.260> unveiled

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
star crab universe will be unveiled

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.740 
star crab universe will be unveiled
overall<00:04:00.640> again<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.090> plays<00:04:01.270> out<00:04:01.420> over<00:04:01.480> three

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
overall again it plays out over three

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.360 
overall again it plays out over three
chapters<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.709> probably<00:04:02.920> could<00:04:03.340> have

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
chapters and I probably could have

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.920 
chapters and I probably could have
answered<00:04:03.550> that<00:04:03.880> with<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> third<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.690> words

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
answered that with a third of the words

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.610 
answered that with a third of the words
but<00:04:05.290> you<00:04:05.590> know<00:04:05.769> so<00:04:07.230> did<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.320> answer<00:04:08.470> that

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
but you know so did I answer that

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.740 
but you know so did I answer that
satisfactory<00:04:09.160> think<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.519> guys<00:04:09.640> gravy<00:04:10.269> all

my<00:04:15.400> question<00:04:15.879> was<00:04:15.910> i<00:04:16.329> was<00:04:16.600> wondering<00:04:17.019> is<00:04:17.230> the

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
my question was i was wondering is the

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.670 
my question was i was wondering is the
core<00:04:17.799> cast<00:04:18.160> sign<00:04:18.880> for<00:04:19.449> all<00:04:19.600> three<00:04:19.930> chapters<00:04:20.470> so

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
core cast sign for all three chapters so

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.100 
core cast sign for all three chapters so
the<00:04:20.829> voice<00:04:21.010> acting<00:04:21.519> continuity<00:04:22.270> is<00:04:22.449> right
