00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and stuff like that but what kind of was

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.920

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
two goals early kind just dropped us a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.880 
two goals early kind just dropped us a
bit<00:01:57.450> dropped<00:01:57.930> our<00:01:58.049> confidence<00:01:58.469> because<00:01:58.680> you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
bit dropped our confidence because you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.499 
bit dropped our confidence because you
know<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.070> were<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.189> such<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> high<00:01:59.670> there<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.360> we

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
know we were in such a high there and we

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.940 
know we were in such a high there and we
went<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> such<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> low<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.409> early<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> game

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
went to such a low so early in the game

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.770 
went to such a low so early in the game
you<00:02:02.100> know<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.759> held<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you know it's not like we held it in the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
you know it's not like we held it in the
second<00:02:04.140> half<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:04.799> get<00:02:05.219> bit

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
second half and then you know get bit

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.150 
second half and then you know get bit
more<00:02:05.820> intense<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.659> think<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.799> was<00:02:07.890> kind<00:02:08.099> of

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
more intense but I think it was kind of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.010 
more intense but I think it was kind of
a<00:02:08.220> downfall<00:02:08.640> now<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.420> boys<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
a downfall now I think the boys are a

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.730 
a downfall now I think the boys are a
bit<00:02:10.259> down<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.770> need<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.039> figure<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.520> out

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
bit down but we need to figure it out

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.680 
bit down but we need to figure it out
today<00:02:12.490> because<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.060> got<00:02:13.210> another<00:02:13.360> game<00:02:13.570> on

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
today because you got another game on

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.750 
today because you got another game on
Tuesday<00:02:13.870> right<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.230> can<00:02:14.380> either<00:02:14.530> drag<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.610> or

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
Tuesday right you can either drag on or

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.730 
Tuesday right you can either drag on or
else<00:02:15.850> can<00:02:16.150> keep<00:02:16.330> going<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.870> affect<00:02:17.380> us<00:02:17.530> even

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
else can keep going and affect us even

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.360 
else can keep going and affect us even
more<00:02:17.770> so<00:02:18.310> especially<00:02:19.060> just
