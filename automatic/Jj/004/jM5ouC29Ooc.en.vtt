00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
while the sand King XL I guess up to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.299 
while the sand King XL I guess up to
four<00:00:51.690> people<00:00:51.840> has<00:00:52.410> four<00:00:52.710> doors<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
four people has four doors and it's a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.920 
four people has four doors and it's a
little<00:00:53.399> bit<00:00:53.520> bigger<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.750> definitely

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
little bit bigger so that is definitely

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.569 
little bit bigger so that is definitely
a<00:00:55.230> lot<00:00:55.410> cooler<00:00:55.620> cuz<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.309> thing<00:00:56.460> is
