00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello everyone with you andrew channel less 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.529
 single horsepower 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.510
 I did not find a good review on youtube 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.990
 the tent you see now 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.530
 dead orion 2 so make my 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.039
 overview 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.770
 Now I will install it at this place and we 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.810
 with you about this tent let's talk in general 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.939
 and the whole tent is quite ordinary 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.289
 classic with a frame of two 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.750
 O fiberglass pipes 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.820
 declared specifications 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.910
 manufacturer fully comply 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.739
 truth, let's now discuss its advantages and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.559
 cons and so weight 2 kilograms 300 grams 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.600
 In my opinion definitely plus excellent 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.930
 suitable for cycling trips 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.050
 weekend and you are narrow in nature as 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.969
 all similar tents plus simplicity 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.550
 installation 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.340
 price average cost in stores 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.789
 hiking gear is 2500 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 rubles 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.940
 unambiguously + easy installation of an awning 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.000
 he just everything is done on Fastex what 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.890
 also very convenient and fast 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.780
 availability at the entrance duplicate mosquito 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.580
 mesh 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.189
 two additional windows for 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.520
 ventilation for summer operation is 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.189
 a definite plus is even a small one 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.799
 but still the vestibule will be enough for 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.100
 to put shoes into it or 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.470
 put an oversized backpack inside 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.049
 You can install a convenient shelf under 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.820
 flashlight or small personal items while at 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.000
 there are four small sides 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.360
 pocket under the little things well, and now about the minuses 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.880
 which certainly also is like not 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.100
 cool but inside will be closely two 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.850
 it's more like a tent for adults 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.890
 lorry 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.220
 for comfortable accommodation of one 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.000
 man and second like all chambers 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.070
 of this type is high sail 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.619
 So let's summarize in my opinion 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.530
 tent worth the money quality on 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.329
 solid four low weight accounted for 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.579
 pay for the impossibility of comfort 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.890
 accommodating two people as well as 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.539
 enhanced ventilation for the impossibility 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.000
 winter operation of this 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.370
 trays in general, in my opinion very 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.079
 A good copy for not extreme 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.250
 hikes 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.200
