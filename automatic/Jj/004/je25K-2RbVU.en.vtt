more tight and I wanted something more
loose<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.420> exactly<00:04:07.810> what<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.200> was

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
loose so this is exactly what I was

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.949 
loose so this is exactly what I was
really<00:04:08.709> looking<00:04:09.040> for<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:13.450> is<00:04:13.629> what<00:04:13.840> it

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
really looking for so this is what it

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.219 
really looking for so this is what it
looks<00:04:14.170> like

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
looks like

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.620 
looks like
it<00:04:17.229> seemed<00:04:17.590> like<00:04:17.829> it's<00:04:18.039> bleached<00:04:18.430> and<00:04:18.910> it<00:04:19.450> has

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
it seemed like it's bleached and it has

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.650 
it seemed like it's bleached and it has
like<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.930> slight<00:04:20.370> damp<00:04:21.370> feel<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.389> it<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:22.840> I<00:04:24.660> do

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
like a slight damp feel to it and I do

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.040 
like a slight damp feel to it and I do
not<00:04:25.780> have<00:04:26.080> like<00:04:26.320> any<00:04:26.560> smell<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.669> so<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.750> just

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
not have like any smell to it so it just

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.300 
not have like any smell to it so it just
feels<00:04:29.260> with<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.560> slight<00:04:29.919> bit<00:04:30.160> damp<00:04:30.580> but<00:04:31.080> um<00:04:32.310> so

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
feels with a slight bit damp but um so

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.250 
feels with a slight bit damp but um so
you<00:04:33.460> can<00:04:33.700> pass<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.150> anyway<00:04:37.139> so<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:40.180> think<00:04:40.570> I<00:04:40.720> may

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
you can pass it anyway so I think I may

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.200 
you can pass it anyway so I think I may
still<00:04:41.830> have<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.310> grind<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:43.000> and<00:04:43.300> probably

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
still have to grind it and probably

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.779 
still have to grind it and probably
bleach<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.599> closure<00:04:47.440> because<00:04:48.190> I'm<00:04:48.520> still
