00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
one but I'm just gonna go through like

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.039 
one but I'm just gonna go through like
different<00:01:31.950> events<00:01:32.460> where<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.729> think<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
different events where I think the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.560 
different events where I think the
chances<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.560> pretty<00:01:34.829> high<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.060> course<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
chances are pretty high so of course the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.590 
chances are pretty high so of course the
first<00:01:37.290> go<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> event<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> think<00:01:39.450> they're

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
first go to event that I think they're

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.760 
first go to event that I think they're
definitely<00:01:39.900> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> show<00:01:40.409> something

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
significant thing we got was at e3 so it

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.839 
significant thing we got was at e3 so it
kind<00:02:56.829> of<00:02:56.920> shows<00:02:57.099> that<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.430> know<00:02:57.519> kingdom

hearts<00:02:58.060> 3<00:02:58.299> at<00:02:58.569> least<00:02:59.200> as<00:02:59.409> the<00:02:59.560> trend<00:02:59.859> is<00:02:59.980> going

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
hearts 3 at least as the trend is going

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.879 
hearts 3 at least as the trend is going
right<00:03:00.400> now<00:03:00.609> really<00:03:01.150> never<00:03:01.420> skips<00:03:01.900> III<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:02.859> I

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
right now really never skips III so I

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.410 
right now really never skips III so I
think<00:03:03.069> we're<00:03:03.400> very<00:03:03.430> likely<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.939> see<00:03:04.180> something

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
think we're very likely to see something

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.440 
think we're very likely to see something
there<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.590> next<00:03:05.859> place<00:03:06.430> i<00:03:06.609> think<00:03:07.000> they<00:03:07.180> are

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
there the next place i think they are

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.979 
there the next place i think they are
bound<00:03:08.109> to<00:03:08.379> reveal<00:03:08.739> something<00:03:09.069> is<00:03:09.430> at<00:03:10.269> disney's

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
bound to reveal something is at disney's

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.349 
bound to reveal something is at disney's
d23<00:03:11.549> events<00:03:12.549> now<00:03:12.730> if<00:03:12.879> you<00:03:12.970> don't<00:03:13.150> know<00:03:13.239> what

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
disney d23 event is i think it's this

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.900 
disney d23 event is i think it's this
like<00:03:16.389> a<00:03:16.629> disney<00:03:16.959> event<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.669> happens<00:03:18.669> every

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
like a disney event that happens every

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.720 
like a disney event that happens every
two<00:03:19.389> years<00:03:19.840> so<00:03:20.680> yeah<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:20.980> wasn't<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:21.609> in

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
two years so yeah it wasn't there in

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.539 
two years so yeah it wasn't there in
2014<00:03:22.389> so<00:03:22.660> why<00:03:22.810> do<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:23.019> think<00:03:23.190> Kingdom<00:03:24.190> Hearts<00:03:24.220> 3

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
2014 so why do I think Kingdom Hearts 3

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.050 
2014 so why do I think Kingdom Hearts 3
will<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.180> at<00:03:25.299> d23<00:03:25.690> well<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.560> course<00:03:27.060> kingdom

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
hearts 2 e was at d23 2013 I believe it

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.220 
hearts 2 e was at d23 2013 I believe it
was<00:03:33.190> in<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.489> fall<00:03:33.699> and<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:34.060> think<00:03:34.329> d23<00:03:34.810> is

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
was in the fall and I think d23 is

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.809 
was in the fall and I think d23 is
always<00:03:35.560> gonna<00:03:35.680> be<00:03:35.829> like<00:03:35.949> around<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.340> August

probably<00:05:26.889> not<00:05:27.039> so<00:05:27.400> that's<00:05:27.580> why<00:05:27.699> I<00:05:27.759> think<00:05:27.940> it

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
probably not so that's why I think it

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.020 
probably not so that's why I think it
happened<00:05:28.840> last<00:05:29.080> d23<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:30.340> why<00:05:30.550> I<00:05:30.580> think<00:05:30.729> it's

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
happened last d23 and why I think it's

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.089 
happened last d23 and why I think it's
possible<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.569> happen<00:05:31.930> at<00:05:32.110> this<00:05:32.349> year's<00:05:32.590> d23

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
possible to happen at this year's d23

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.909 
possible to happen at this year's d23
and<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:34.210> last<00:05:34.419> event<00:05:34.780> that<00:05:35.020> I<00:05:35.050> think<00:05:35.440> is<00:05:35.680> in

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
and the last event that I think is in

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.390 
and the last event that I think is in
the<00:05:36.069> likelihood<00:05:36.729> for<00:05:36.880> Kingdom<00:05:37.180> Hearts<00:05:37.210> is
