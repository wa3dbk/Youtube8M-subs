reminded me of Angry Birds the game a
popular<00:00:28.680> app<00:00:28.859> on<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.640> phone<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.179> really

popular app on the phone I'm not really

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.389 
popular app on the phone I'm not really
sure<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:30.960> relevant<00:00:31.260> anymore<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.309> they

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
sure if it's relevant anymore but they

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.299 
sure if it's relevant anymore but they
go<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:33.510> summon<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.469> mob<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.130> want<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
go you know summon the mob you want to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.030 
go you know summon the mob you want to
shoot<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.640> press<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:35.969> button<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:37.890> can

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
shoot just press this button as you can

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.080 
shoot just press this button as you can
see<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> create<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.730> little<00:00:38.820> bit<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.000> an

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
see I create a little bit of an

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.920 
see I create a little bit of an
animation<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.210> customize<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
animation so you can customize the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
animation so you can customize the
direction<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.530> angle<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
direction and angle that you want to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
direction and angle that you want to
shoot<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> mob<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.989> by<00:00:46.079> simply<00:00:46.530> pressing

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
shoot the mob just by simply pressing

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.150 
shoot the mob just by simply pressing
these<00:00:47.100> buttons<00:00:47.160> I'm<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.930> reduce<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
these buttons I'm going to reduce the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
these buttons I'm going to reduce the
angle<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.050> first<00:00:52.320> demonstration

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
angle just for the first demonstration

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
angle just for the first demonstration
so<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> pig<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.480> slowly

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
so you can see the pig is slowly

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.069 
so you can see the pig is slowly
floating<00:00:55.050> down<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.890> model<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.899> slingshot<00:00:57.899> in

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
floating down to model the slingshot in

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.150 
floating down to model the slingshot in
real<00:00:58.260> life

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
real life

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.840 
real life
so<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.320> I've<00:01:01.320> hit<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> limit<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.550> order<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so the I've hit the limit so in order to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.189 
so the I've hit the limit so in order to
shoot<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.359> need<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> press<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.140> button

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
shoot I just need to press this button

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.609 
shoot I just need to press this button
right<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.460> boom<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.720> pig<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.170> flying

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
right here and boom the pig is flying

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.399 
right here and boom the pig is flying
into<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> sky<00:01:09.229> very<00:01:10.229> good<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.260> this

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
into the sky very good so I can do this

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.899 
into the sky very good so I can do this
as<00:01:13.500> many<00:01:13.530> times<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.159> let's<00:01:14.400> do

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
as many times as I want so let's do

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.330 
as many times as I want so let's do
another<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:16.799> press<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.130> button

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
another one here to press this button

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.899 
another one here to press this button
which<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.060> bring<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> up<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.909> basically

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
which will bring it up and basically

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
which will bring it up and basically
it's<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.420> shot<00:01:21.740> roughly<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it's going to be shot roughly to the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.550 
it's going to be shot roughly to the
ground<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.150> press<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.780> button<00:01:24.930> again<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
ground so press this button again and it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
ground so press this button again and it
gets<00:01:25.650> shot<00:01:25.920> downwards<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.299> fairly

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
gets shot downwards so it is fairly

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.410 
gets shot downwards so it is fairly
straight<00:01:27.810> forward<00:01:28.549> not<00:01:29.549> very<00:01:29.759> accurate<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
straight forward not very accurate the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.870 
straight forward not very accurate the
mathematics<00:01:30.930> new<00:01:31.079> years<00:01:31.290> were<00:01:31.409> very<00:01:31.650> lazy<00:01:31.920> not

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
mathematics new years were very lazy not

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.190 
mathematics new years were very lazy not
gonna<00:01:33.030> really<00:01:33.479> sure<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.780> could<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.020> used

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
gonna really sure I could have used

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.690 
gonna really sure I could have used
calculus<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> differential

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
calculus you know a differential

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.670 
calculus you know a differential
calculus<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.509> find<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> gradient<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.530> then

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
calculus to find the gradient and then

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
calculus to find the gradient and then
the<00:01:37.799> curve<00:01:38.070> I'm<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the curve I'm not going to do that so

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.590 
the curve I'm not going to do that so
I'm<00:01:39.869> gonna<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.350> more<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.729> pig<00:01:41.970> it's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I'm gonna do one more so the pig it's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
I'm gonna do one more so the pig it's
actually<00:01:42.810> called<00:01:42.990> bird<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:44.159> show<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
actually called bird I can show you that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.780 
actually called bird I can show you that
right<00:01:44.610> now

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
right now

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.999 
right now
in<00:01:45.659> fact<00:01:45.869> actually<00:01:46.350> what<00:01:46.470> I'm<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
in fact actually what I'm going to do is

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.330 
in fact actually what I'm going to do is
not<00:01:47.939> use<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.390> pig<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.350> let's<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.220> can

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
not use a pig but let's see I can

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.310 
not use a pig but let's see I can
actually<00:01:50.369> change<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.060> let's<00:01:52.049> use<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> creeper

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
actually change this let's use a creeper

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.550 
actually change this let's use a creeper
whoops<00:01:55.320> there<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:55.920> go

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
whoops there we go

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
whoops there we go
alright<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.750> what<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.380> actually<00:02:02.450> kind

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
alright so what do I do is actually kind

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.380 
alright so what do I do is actually kind
of<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.350> most<00:02:04.909> extreme<00:02:05.909> angle

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
of make it the most extreme angle

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.999 
of make it the most extreme angle
possible<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.799> shoot<00:02:07.950> him

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
possible so I'm going to shoot him

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.350 
possible so I'm going to shoot him
towards<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.090> command<00:02:09.509> blocks<00:02:09.780> behind<00:02:10.020> me<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
towards the command blocks behind me so

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.910 
towards the command blocks behind me so
there<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.420> go<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.690> most<00:02:12.870> extreme<00:02:13.170> angle

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
there we go the most extreme angle

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.210 
there we go the most extreme angle
and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.190> booms<00:02:14.490> out<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:16.709> my<00:02:16.890> render<00:02:17.190> distance

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and then booms out of my render distance

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.300 
and then booms out of my render distance
and<00:02:17.810> where<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.020> whisker<00:02:19.590> oh<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.190> go

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and where the whisker oh there we go

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.330 
and where the whisker oh there we go
yeah<00:02:20.849> oh<00:02:20.880> he<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.680> he's<00:02:22.680> called<00:02:22.920> aside<00:02:23.160> now

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
yeah oh he is so he's called aside now

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.600 
yeah oh he is so he's called aside now
yeah<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.270> wanted<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.569> eliminate<00:02:25.220> them<00:02:26.220> from

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
yeah so I wanted to eliminate them from

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.110 
yeah so I wanted to eliminate them from
the<00:02:27.030> group<00:02:27.270> over<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.520> by<00:02:29.520> changing<00:02:30.000> their

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the group over here by changing their

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.860 
the group over here by changing their
name<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.540> very<00:02:31.550> complicated<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:33.510> redstone

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
name so very complicated the redstone

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.390 
name so very complicated the redstone
here<00:02:34.080> don't<00:02:34.800> agree<00:02:34.950> throw<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.250> too<00:02:35.310> much

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
here don't agree throw it in too much

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.449 
here don't agree throw it in too much
detail<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.780> basic<00:02:37.080> gist<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.500> the

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
detail but the basic gist of it is the

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.180 
detail but the basic gist of it is the
first<00:02:38.700> thing<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.989> animation<00:02:40.500> which<00:02:40.890> was

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
first thing is the animation which was

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.979 
first thing is the animation which was
recorded<00:02:41.550> with<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.090> sling<00:02:42.330> objective<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
recorded with the sling objective and

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.880 
recorded with the sling objective and
finishes<00:02:43.950> after<00:02:44.220> 66<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:46.110> they're<00:02:46.620> given

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
finishes after 66 and then they're given

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.680 
finishes after 66 and then they're given
custom<00:02:47.190> motion<00:02:47.489> depending<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.540> angle

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
custom motion depending on the angle

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.140 
custom motion depending on the angle
chosen<00:02:49.470> using<00:02:50.430> all<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.700> these<00:02:50.819> command<00:02:51.120> blocks

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
chosen using all of these command blocks

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.509 
chosen using all of these command blocks
here<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.480> kind<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.260> complicated<00:02:52.650> but<00:02:53.310> very

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
here so kind of complicated but very

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.199 
here so kind of complicated but very
much<00:02:53.640> worth<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.030> very<00:02:54.870> entertaining<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.209> let's

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
much worth it very entertaining so let's

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.770 
much worth it very entertaining so let's
do<00:02:57.360> one<00:02:57.510> more

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
do one more

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.380 
do one more
without<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.650> creeper<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.069> time<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.640> I

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
without the creeper this time and I

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.880 
without the creeper this time and I
don't<00:03:00.569> know<00:03:00.660> let's<00:03:01.290> do<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:02.120> guardian<00:03:03.860> did<00:03:04.860> I

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
don't know let's do a guardian did I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
nonetheless this is a proof of concept

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.500 
nonetheless this is a proof of concept
