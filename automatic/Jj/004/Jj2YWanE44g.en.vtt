00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 three and a half seconds kd well in general 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.970
 no this is anyway you 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.250
 case of 3 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.429
 yes I get on the run from the guard all 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.160
 Then if you calculate q5 -5 damage there 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.109
 per minute count Eugene please 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.330
 what will he do then with one and 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.430
 second tank combined square-5 addition 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.269
 of this parameter that apt-5 are leaving for 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.070
 map kill all the best tank but again 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.420
 same most important this tank as its except 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.400
 its performance is use on 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.720
 certain parts of the maps and here we have 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.520
 here by trial and error 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 three moves and shared in the form of these 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.820
 positions not just used here 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.649
 there somewhere from and somewhere around a dozen well 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.670
 thank you very much for the characteristics but 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.170
 practice we see 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.180
 and once again there you saw that 100 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 dozens well, well, how would I be but not 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.719
 put it on them that's how to try 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.850
 there look for the perfect start for 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.230
 team battle is there too 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.969
 characteristics characteristic at the very 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.800
 In fact you can us 90 just cool 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.480
 wager this may be just 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.219
 when u steffi on ruinberg on 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.899
 bottom base dozens of just myself where 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.390
 you should have shown but we saw that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 arcade coped with it very easily and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.520
 there unity who usually know everything 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.570
 all these nuances they could not do anything 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.140
 make against arcade 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 they barely escaped contact center should 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.350
 against toda la human 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.210
 it sorted out the center of the map as well 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.520
 come on controversial but we have a choir 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.009
 departure here again I am teams on the score 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.770
 disappointed here I will say as they are 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.720
 parted widely this again df this 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.280
 just again deft commands nose core i5 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.049
 devyainostykov under the mountain I do not think I 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 I think that you see such a falcon on 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.490
 fritz i see where the flag is i believe 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 that they are still fit downhill 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.640
 stop looking there is no arcade in 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.110
 start and then go on the attack why 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.220
 then I think it will be exactly sins 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.479
 inside this transform strategy yet either 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.670
 either apple or will still attack 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.320
 the flash will not go top get shot 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.409
 put Persha infoy ie since 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.820
 the ostrich broke the radio station there 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.369
 written according to even that is 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.810
 falcon and there are cliffs see the points clearly 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.420
 where are well and here is the position 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.130
 far which 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.530
 which tells all the difference 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.429
 teams on slope 1 tank 2 tank two t1 and 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 3 under the mountain this df is a dev even though the crowd 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.880
 1391 have just been playing 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.110
 objects to foot or glory meetings 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.110
 the next bar will be by 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.820
 more interesting there fights 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.710
 Well, I would be interested to know exactly because 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.780
 those that really a break to smell 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.610
 will either happen what team 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.140
 weplay here they are in the ground and hard to 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.060
 tried to attack now tried 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.430
 Attack 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.020
 all Daniel in Tijuana will not pass 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.640
 three cards you know about before that 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.070
 try to do and try to really you 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.680
 do something interesting to them just here in 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.560
 one moment they will be lucky they will guess 10 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.930
 and all the next part of our show 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.450
 start looking yes rhinoceros could three 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.790
 Graces while absolutely they are cities from you 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.190
 so hard fire with which you are many 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.500
 teams have not been played so many times 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.440
 in a row stand in such a defy it 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.750
 Well, let's think about what team plan 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.320
 Nashorna in general is what's the idea 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.490
 idea 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.040
 and that's exactly the first two cards 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.730
 will play for a draw will remain n and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.320
 stop for immediately fall out look mean 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.510
 mines 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.730
 it means the mines remain well in general there 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.830
 it is said we will watch we wait 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.960
 some kind of aggressive action from teams 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.730
 but I have a pause in the north 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.800
 at least this top five nobody 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.870
 moves shooter with best adviser falcon 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.550
 Oberst pressed at 9 all and pause went 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.190
 show you the FORTRAN Ivan Schultz is 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.080
 well publish please please 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.170
 here she herself Schultz does not see us squad 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.310
 closer then masking looked ahtung 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.700
 position well well threw up cool threw 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.959
 the trees became a bunch of such specially 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.520
 disguised and and became on such 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.530
 exalted to give back to 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.420
 center if anything goes so small 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.550
 safe for a bunch of notes in general are kid 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.600
 something to say naiad general stand and i 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.150
 also stand here is amazing 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.000
 paradox team falcon 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.530
 give a sprig here look wipley can 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.350
 blinds shooting through breakthrough 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.990
 already yurka mole nt1 drove up to arrogant in 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.880
 x-ray chick became good 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.820
 position taken i think warm ones will try 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.860
 now something else interesting to arrange 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.510
 total dates sumatra there is a scheme 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.130
 fossa that float to work bye 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.850
 blinds to try out positions that can 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.160
 them at the office 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.200
 zasvety betray total will leave the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.530
 this line will surely be here because you're here 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.940
 he counters the third 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.440
 in order to leave you could wear 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.000
 he makes some space for himself 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.100
 Well, time is less and less 2 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.720
 minutes 50 seconds friends and we in my 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.690
 need someone to start an attack either 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.350
 let's go to the next card differently 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.000
 indeed we will live to see 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.220
 tiebreak allowed rivers sing there 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.110
 tears someone will have to attack we judge 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.500
 will have to take a bunch of damage 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.450
 I hope but now guys are doing 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.950
 should home we discussed this so they 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.230
 just a thousand it will only give because i 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.090
 I repeat once more my friends reminded me before 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.840
 The first thing I talked about is the two series from 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.460
 five matches 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.640
 maybe 3 series need to win two 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.380
 series but if after five cards each 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.520
 draw series goes extra card 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.800
 if there's another extra draw 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.410
 card if there is a draw goes tie break here 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.060
 on the sandy river at assault who 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.790
 the one who defends is chosen by the team 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.130
 which is for the previous 5 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.140
 it turns out the map dealt more damage a 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.140
 this is tt hastily at the moment 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.680
 I remember the mines and in general, so far 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.980
 what 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.290
 tt us corn du they lived on a tiebreak 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.840
 drag the match against and everything is fine there and 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.140
 stuffed more damage will stay cards and 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.170
 six more guys and another 6 well, hardly 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.560
 of course well maybe maybe a guy 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.930
 our such principled straight is not at all 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.060
 okay since you don't attack us either 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.060
 don't we stop our whole go 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.700
 variants and so there is going to stand 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.380
 well, look everything minutes deny all attacks 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.380
 already there they went to the principle of me 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.810
 it seems not even go not planned 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.940
 nothing much even on the cliff can go 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.980
 on principle we are now convinced of this 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.170
 that no one wants to risk it 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.000
 first seca and here's your screen for now 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.810
 I turn on something on the site 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.200
 brought quotas on which card they last 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.120
 time 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.300
 played up to each other that's very 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.080
 interesting now I'll see come on come on 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.120
 this match let's tell you all this 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.490
 information letters while watching for 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.529
 By arrangement of rhinos they are wide here 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.389
 front stretched out 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.119
 at its base the exit from behind the slide goes on 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:40.499
 the very fact that the cat oh-she-she-she poor 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:43.619
 hey harry got 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:44.339
 oh and burns it happens just rely 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.079
 put out 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:48.089
 reservation there is schultz already getting off the slide 

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:50.279
 But this time patterns 42 late main 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:53.339
 that the Korea team and it will still need 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.289
 catch the catch kill 40 seconds 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:57.509
 this is yes in the center 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.189
 no pushing as a result of trying 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.199
 humana for stove he gets to break through 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:03.929
 and human just leave the lighthouse they 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:06.340
 continue on the new water for 30 seconds and 

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:08.210
 nashorna somehow 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.770
 paused but the guys understood me 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.710
 that time is nothing in candles 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.719
 then you can look for everything again 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.509
 played by guy we will look for 

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:19.819
 rhinoceros which are worth cost and 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:21.169
 stand oh generally visible humana which 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:23.659
 apparently Schultz and will try 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:26.270
 work 9 seconds before the end of the round 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:28.849
 us draw 3 card in a row first set 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:31.250
 pretty marochnik and so far but at the end 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.229
 at the end can be funny so here 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.539
 cards we had a score of 30 remind 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:36.979
 go play you played in the ruinberg mines 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:39.110
 and nsk and ruinberg was already 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:42.849
 burma burrows as a suicide 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.849
 And on ruinberg won in 5 minutes
