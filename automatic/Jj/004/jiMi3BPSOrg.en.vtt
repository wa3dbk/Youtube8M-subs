money especially on a controller because

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.820 
money especially on a controller because
I<00:00:14.720> didn't<00:00:14.990> know<00:00:15.050> if<00:00:15.200> I<00:00:15.290> was<00:00:15.380> going<00:00:15.530> to<00:00:15.590> like<00:00:15.800> it

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
I didn't know if I was going to like it

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.920 
I didn't know if I was going to like it
or<00:00:16.070> be<00:00:16.189> able<00:00:16.250> to<00:00:16.400> figure<00:00:16.550> it<00:00:16.670> out<00:00:16.850> of<00:00:17.539> course<00:00:17.779> I

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
or be able to figure it out of course I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.439 
or be able to figure it out of course I
did<00:00:18.140> and<00:00:18.350> so<00:00:19.070> I<00:00:19.099> ended<00:00:19.429> up<00:00:19.519> with<00:00:19.910> one<00:00:20.300> of<00:00:20.390> the

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
did and so I ended up with one of the

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.169 
did and so I ended up with one of the
cheapest<00:00:20.869> controllers<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:21.439> can<00:00:21.589> find<00:00:21.859> on

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
cheapest controllers you can find on

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.739 
cheapest controllers you can find on
cheap<00:00:23.179> lights<00:00:23.419> comm<00:00:23.960> I<00:00:24.349> got<00:00:24.710> it<00:00:24.859> for<00:00:25.390> $100<00:00:26.390> even

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:26.749 
cheap lights comm I got it for $100 even

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.769 
cheap lights comm I got it for $100 even
and<00:00:27.140> it's<00:00:27.890> called<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.189> Acrobat<00:00:28.759> and<00:00:29.089> it<00:00:29.569> seems

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
and it's called the Acrobat and it seems

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.419 
and it's called the Acrobat and it seems
to<00:00:29.960> work<00:00:29.989> really<00:00:30.109> well<00:00:30.380> so<00:00:30.829> eventually<00:00:31.220> I

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
to work really well so eventually I

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.970 
to work really well so eventually I
might<00:00:31.609> upgrade<00:00:31.819> to<00:00:32.689> a<00:00:32.720> little<00:00:33.050> bit<00:00:33.170> nicer<00:00:33.649> unit

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
might upgrade to a little bit nicer unit

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.340 
might upgrade to a little bit nicer unit
maybe<00:00:34.130> inhalation<00:00:34.850> or<00:00:35.060> or<00:00:35.570> something<00:00:36.200> lines

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
maybe inhalation or or something lines

maybe inhalation or or something lines
are<00:00:36.560> here's<00:00:37.370> our<00:00:37.550> unit<00:00:37.880> right<00:00:38.000> here<00:00:38.060> and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
are here's our unit right here and

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.220 
are here's our unit right here and
pretty<00:00:40.430> much<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:40.760> chain<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.390> DMX<00:00:41.810> is

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
pretty much the chain of the DMX is

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.400 
pretty much the chain of the DMX is
starting<00:00:42.710> right<00:00:42.980> here<00:00:43.760> on<00:00:43.880> the<00:00:43.970> back<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.480> the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
starting right here on the back and the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.600 
starting right here on the back and the
cable<00:00:45.770> is<00:00:45.890> running<00:00:46.250> up<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:50.000> Galaxian<00:00:50.720> 3d

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
cable is running up to the Galaxian 3d

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.080 
cable is running up to the Galaxian 3d
and<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.790> next<00:00:53.240> is<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.780> four<00:00:54.050> bar<00:00:54.820> okay<00:00:55.820> and

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
and the next is the four bar okay and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.020 
and the next is the four bar okay and
then<00:00:56.240> from<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.630> four<00:00:56.900> bar<00:00:57.140> we're<00:00:57.590> going<00:00:58.030> all

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
then from the four bar we're going all

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.760 
then from the four bar we're going all
the<00:00:59.270> way<00:00:59.300> over<00:00:59.829> to<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:02.030> Tri<00:01:02.300> phase<00:01:02.650> from<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
the way over to the Tri phase from the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.340 
the way over to the Tri phase from the
Tri<00:01:04.009> phase<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:05.059> going<00:01:05.180> up<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:07.159> Revo<00:01:07.460> to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
Tri phase it's going up to the Revo to

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.480 
Tri phase it's going up to the Revo to
then<00:01:09.350> over<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.950> Aloha<00:01:10.690> then<00:01:11.690> up<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.950> X

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
then over to the Aloha then up to the X

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.630 
then over to the Aloha then up to the X
can<00:01:13.880> plus<00:01:14.300> and<00:01:14.630> then<00:01:15.440> from<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.830> X<00:01:15.980> can<00:01:16.250> plus

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
can plus and then from the X can plus

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.860 
can plus and then from the X can plus
all<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.270> way<00:01:17.360> down

look frost this is where they link

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.190 
look frost this is where they link
together<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.100> into<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.370> other<00:01:22.520> triphase

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
together and into the other triphase

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.450 
together and into the other triphase
then<00:01:24.200> over<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.940> Revo<00:01:26.270> three<00:01:26.860> then<00:01:27.860> over<00:01:28.220> to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
are the same right here and I have all

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.940 
are the same right here and I have all
their<00:01:44.120> addresses<00:01:44.390> on<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.159> backs<00:01:46.369> as<00:01:46.640> well

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
their addresses on the backs as well

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.130 
their addresses on the backs as well
right<00:01:48.950> now<00:01:49.100> this<00:01:49.430> is<00:01:49.549> what<00:01:49.700> we<00:01:49.790> have<00:01:50.000> going<00:01:50.659> on

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
way over there everybody shut this door

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.300 
way over there everybody shut this door
so<00:01:58.490> it's<00:01:58.610> easier<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.970> see<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.180> program

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
so it's easier to see the program

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.710 
so it's easier to see the program
there's<00:02:01.310> one<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.700> programs<00:02:02.150> that<00:02:02.270> are<00:02:02.420> in

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
there's one of the programs that are in

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.830 
there's one of the programs that are in
one<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.800> banks<00:02:04.190> there's<00:02:04.640> 30<00:02:05.210> banks<00:02:05.479> all

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
one of the banks there's 30 banks all

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.790 
one of the banks there's 30 banks all
together<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.440> this

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
together on this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.910 
together on this
and<00:02:06.890> there's<00:02:07.729> eight<00:02:08.830> different<00:02:10.480> programs<00:02:11.920> on

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
and there's eight different programs on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.190 
and there's eight different programs on
each<00:02:13.100> one<00:02:13.840> now<00:02:16.450> go<00:02:17.450> ahead<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.780> take<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.959> look

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
each one now go ahead and take a look

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.600 
each one now go ahead and take a look
I'm<00:02:18.380> gonna<00:02:18.500> press<00:02:18.739> different<00:02:18.980> buttons<00:02:19.190> and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
I'm gonna press different buttons and
