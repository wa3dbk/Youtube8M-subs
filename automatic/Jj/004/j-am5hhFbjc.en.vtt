00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
on let's go and create it so if you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.170 
on let's go and create it so if you
remember<00:00:47.579> correctly<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.140> last<00:00:49.350> tutorial

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
remember correctly in my last tutorial

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.340 
remember correctly in my last tutorial
using<00:00:51.180> two<00:00:51.379> levers<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.890> had<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:54.110> wire<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> up

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
using two levers I had you wire it up

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860 
using two levers I had you wire it up
using<00:00:55.620> what's<00:00:55.920> called<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.430> xor<00:00:57.059> gate<00:00:57.090> well

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
using what's called an xor gate well

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.150 
using what's called an xor gate well
that<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.410> xor<00:00:59.039> gate<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.460> no<00:00:59.670> longer<00:01:00.090> needed

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
that the xor gate is no longer needed

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
that the xor gate is no longer needed
what<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.309> need<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.780> use<00:01:04.170> what's<00:01:04.409> called

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
what we need to do is use what's called

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.550 
what we need to do is use what's called
a<00:01:04.739> t<00:01:05.129> flip-flop<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.260> very

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
a t flip-flop and these are not very

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.679 
a t flip-flop and these are not very

block right here here's your start block
so<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.730> block<00:02:54.000> right<00:02:54.060> here<00:02:54.299> you're<00:02:55.140> gonna<00:02:55.260> go

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
so this block right here you're gonna go

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.509 
so this block right here you're gonna go
redstone<00:02:58.250> block<00:02:59.540> porch<00:03:00.650> okay<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:02.370> with

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
redstone block porch okay so now with

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.190 
redstone block porch okay so now with
that<00:03:03.510> song<00:03:04.190> redstone<00:03:05.190> redstone<00:03:05.670> redstone<00:03:06.569> on

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
that song redstone redstone redstone on

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.129 
that song redstone redstone redstone on
the<00:03:07.470> top<00:03:07.680> coming<00:03:08.190> down<00:03:08.370> okay

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
the top coming down okay

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:16.759 
the top coming down okay
block<00:03:10.910> torch<00:03:13.519> redstone<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:15.180> redstone<00:03:16.049> so<00:03:16.709> you

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
block torch redstone and redstone so you

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.349 
block torch redstone and redstone so you
create<00:03:17.220> kind<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.549> like<00:03:17.609> this<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:19.019> um<00:03:20.239> what<00:03:21.239> is

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
create kind of like this this um what is

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.530 
create kind of like this this um what is
that<00:03:21.389> like<00:03:21.599> a<00:03:21.769> wave<00:03:22.769> kind<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.609> food<00:03:24.030> coming

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
that like a wave kind of food coming

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.059 
that like a wave kind of food coming
down<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:25.709> up<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.099> then<00:03:26.370> back<00:03:26.579> in<00:03:26.910> here<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.590> if

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
down and up and then back in here so if

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.659 
down and up and then back in here so if
if<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:30.720> pattern<00:03:31.200> helps<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.680> remember<00:03:32.400> this

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
if the pattern helps you remember this

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.430 
if the pattern helps you remember this
then<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.599> wave<00:03:33.780> alright

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
then it's a wave alright

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.400 
then it's a wave alright
and<00:03:34.970> this<00:03:35.970> right<00:03:36.180> here<00:03:36.389> is<00:03:36.569> your<00:03:36.599> T<00:03:37.049> flip-flop

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
and this right here is your T flip-flop

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.150 
and this right here is your T flip-flop
this<00:03:37.889> is<00:03:38.040> complete<00:03:38.400> your<00:03:39.359> output<00:03:40.169> your<00:03:40.709> output

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
this is complete your output your output

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.339 
this is complete your output your output
is<00:03:41.370> right<00:03:41.849> here<00:03:42.239> okay<00:03:42.599> this<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.799> torch<00:03:44.130> this

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
is right here okay this this torch this

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.309 
is right here okay this this torch this
redstone<00:03:46.349> this<00:03:46.799> redstone<00:03:47.340> or<00:03:47.880> even<00:03:48.319> this

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
redstone this redstone or even this

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.039 
redstone this redstone or even this
torch<00:03:49.709> and<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.220> redstone<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.790> would<00:03:50.880> work

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
torch and this redstone that would work

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.870 
torch and this redstone that would work
too<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.319> guess<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.829> always<00:03:53.040> used<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.609> one<00:03:53.760> right

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
too I guess I always used this one right

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.000 
too I guess I always used this one right
here<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:55.769> your<00:03:56.160> input<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:58.680> block

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
here and then your input is this block

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.110 
here and then your input is this block
right<00:03:59.669> here<00:04:00.200> so<00:04:01.200> if<00:04:01.410> we<00:04:01.560> went<00:04:01.709> ahead<00:04:01.859> and<00:04:02.120> wired

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
right here so if we went ahead and wired

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.830 
right here so if we went ahead and wired
out<00:04:03.450> something<00:04:03.989> like<00:04:04.079> this

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
out something like this

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.930 
out something like this
with<00:04:06.840> two<00:04:07.530> buttons<00:04:08.210> like<00:04:09.210> this<00:04:10.520> it's<00:04:11.520> gonna<00:04:11.700> be

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
with two buttons like this it's gonna be

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.180 
with two buttons like this it's gonna be
that<00:04:12.420> easy<00:04:12.480> take<00:04:13.170> note<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.710> torch<00:04:14.040> over

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
that easy take note of that torch over

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.490 
that easy take note of that torch over
there<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.610> torch<00:04:14.820> is<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.150> right<00:04:15.630> pressing<00:04:16.410> it

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
there that torch is on right pressing it

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.830 
there that torch is on right pressing it
once<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.400> torch<00:04:17.609> goes<00:04:17.850> off<00:04:18.030> press<00:04:18.720> it

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
once and the torch goes off press it

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:27.070 
once and the torch goes off press it
again<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.739> torch<00:04:19.980> goes<00:04:20.190> on<00:04:20.540> off<00:04:21.540> on<00:04:23.390> off<00:04:24.390> on

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.350 

and<00:04:28.080> as<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:29.070> can<00:04:29.190> see<00:04:29.250> actually<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:29.970> probably

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
and as you can see actually I probably

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.690 
and as you can see actually I probably
should<00:04:30.540> have<00:04:30.660> told<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.020> stare<00:04:31.290> at<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.700> two

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
should have told you to stare at the two

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.300 
should have told you to stare at the two
doors<00:04:32.940> from<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.930> beginning<00:04:34.320> but<00:04:34.590> yeah<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
doors from the beginning but yeah the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.820 
doors from the beginning but yeah the
doors<00:04:35.550> are<00:04:35.730> opening<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.390> closing<00:04:36.620> with<00:04:37.620> each

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
doors are opening and closing with each

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.820 
doors are opening and closing with each
press<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.820> button<00:04:39.950> so<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:41.400> think<00:04:41.760> that's<00:04:42.420> it

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
press of a button so I think that's it

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.520 
press of a button so I think that's it
a<00:04:43.860> T<00:04:44.430> flip-flop<00:04:44.670> kind<00:04:45.390> of<00:04:45.450> complex<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:46.380> might

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
a T flip-flop kind of complex you might

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.520 
a T flip-flop kind of complex you might
want<00:04:46.680> to<00:04:46.740> watch<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.130> few<00:04:47.580> times<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.840> had<00:04:49.500> to

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
want to watch this a few times I had to

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.560 
want to watch this a few times I had to
put<00:04:49.770> it<00:04:49.830> together<00:04:49.950> about<00:04:50.280> four<00:04:50.760> times<00:04:51.060> before

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
put it together about four times before

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.710 
put it together about four times before
it<00:04:51.630> was<00:04:51.750> committed<00:04:52.170> to<00:04:52.550> memory<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:54.420> was<00:04:54.660> a
