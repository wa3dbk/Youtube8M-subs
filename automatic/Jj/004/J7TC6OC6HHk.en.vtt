00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello everyone on meshuggah and today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.450
 we have a little rest from the branch today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.679
 ride t-14 is a little american 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.110
 premium t. 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.480
 it has recently taken out of the game but the video I 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.400
 did decide to remove whether they say they will suddenly withdraw 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.289
 somewhere there will be some kind of action well or else 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.119
 some case to buy it 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.210
 but so that you know that she is total herself 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.300
 represents more than 100th level and already 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.689
 Now I understand what to go here on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.149
 square 8 by 9 it makes no sense we got to 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.719
 six levels and how these six 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 the role of the 44-ka expelled t-150 will sweep us away 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.610
 2 splashes and will not even notice but s2 or s3 is not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.950
 the essence is important our tank armor is but 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.410
 sixes and click like nuts therefore 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.690
 it makes no sense to go there I need a place 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.120
 somewhere quieter where possible will 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.039
 the enemies are weaker well we are his level and i 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.260
 I decide to go to the center of the map there to me 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.969
 will be comfortable enough but for now I 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.059
 crawling there we'll talk a little bit 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.239
 a gun 75 millimeter gun m3 we have you 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.540
 mouse 92 breakdown 110 damage to scalers 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.750
 127 breakdown 110 damage and but also bombs 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.150
 38 just 75 damage would be a bundle very 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.000
 wide therefore cock of land mines I drive maybe 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.259
 You can also see that I am useful. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.720
 swapped armor piercing 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.369
 substage because tank plays 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.380
 plus or minus to zero a 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.900
 I donâ€™t suck on the bosses 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.960
 want nalu brought out i usually get 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.170
 happy to find here thirty 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.430
 Four which farmit or bends on 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.920
 land mines that you 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.540
 one of the two may even both at once and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 naturally take it without much 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.570
 regrets 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.460
 the instrument has a nice touch this is information 2 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.090
 seconds just well and good 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.409
 fire rate of dpm 1732 is enough 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.829
 solid for level five 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.840
 Of the minuses, well, of course, breakdown 127 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.360
 Golda is not very much and now 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.180
 see how I can not break through the q-220 in 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.520
 it is quite soft mask but not for 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.100
 my podkaliberov have to aim 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.079
 right that very area with a cup of tea 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.970
 trying to shoot at me i decide that 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.220
 I 'd better take him first 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.800
 still need first from the minus table 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.040
 I already then shoot with heavyweight 11 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.930
 it is somehow more honest will of the tunnels 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.230
 modules, too, I would put here to send 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.440
 or 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.510
 and the valve and the stereo tubes are mixing here in 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.270
 principle do not need a valve will give us more 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.840
 more dpm and a little more review 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.790
 this car only needs its review 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.430
 330 this is extremely small therefore pipes are mast 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.220
 finally got me 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.200
 punch kv-220 stably guy and 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.450
 apparently trying to target the edge of my tower 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.160
 naturally does not succeed in this because 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.500
 that he has a barrel kretova well 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.630
 several times it's for sure he's already trying 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.740
 somewhere project to shoot did not take out 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.050
 d but all in vain 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.230
 armored to armored is not very good 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.660
 here with tilts it turns out about 120 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.060
 or so here is 150 millimeters given 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.640
 ki here this zone is vulnerable well and machine gunner 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.830
 also the same as the edges of the tower but if you 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.750
 move as I am now a hundred to pierce you 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.330
 will not be so easy especially the fifth 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.730
 level well, and such as square-220 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.950
 you can see that I am guessing the movement 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.230
 enemy cords they all went up and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.120
 and crushed all our allies without any 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.940
 the rest although there are not many tanks 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.100
 it was I first thought to go help with 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.410
 the attack of the enemy base tom realized that 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.790
 Nasharil is already passing away and soon 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.760
 I will have a chance in total 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.780
 shoot a balcony 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.580
 the only thing I want to skip 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.489
 enemies as far away as possible to 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.820
 they did not think to come here to me 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.380
 what else is there from the good traits of this tank 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.660
 we have quite a good momentum 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.310
 I wanted to say that he is straight meteor but 15 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.760
 horsepower per ton it's full of yourself 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.549
 cheerfully maximal 34 just but we have no place 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.620
 straight move not have to 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.549
 this level and it is fully felt 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.220
 comfortable chance of fire 20 percent but 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.049
 rarely do you let your enemies go 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.900
 in the stern if you were surrounded then rather 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.400
 just decide how you put out the selenite 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.720
 so they were stranglers 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.000
 replace with a shark but it's a little bit 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.040
 A little expensive, I honestly pas 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.620
 que perdi started waiting until by opponents 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.600
 will pass but unfortunately found r44 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.160
 for me this is an extremely unpleasant target 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.140
 because he is with a blunt trunk and there 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.780
 breakdown far beyond 200 it even breaks 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.270
 eights in the forehead of the body so me 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.240
 he tried a little bit to play with him 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.520
 in the clinch but here is extremely close radar 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.020
 good angles are therefore nothing and 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.450
 hope he calmly distinguishes and 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.280
 gets me well and on this all my 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.490
 allies will take over the base and we are now 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.919
 move on to the results it turned out 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.960
 main gauge with 1 then list from to 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.520
 classiness master 2105 damage 1155 experience and 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.410
 clean for this he is not quite 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.180
 a good bar for me my team 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.060
 did not have time to shoot at all because 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.310
 I went to the district and no one there really 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.650
 and did not meet on silver it turned out 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.740
 give wargaming to 13,000 s right 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.260
 account and without a premium account all 35 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.300
 the fact is that the kv-220 is too hard 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.190
 the opponent is even for our gold therefore 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.590
 it took a lot and not all was with 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.720
 Damage itself is also pretty good 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.220
 there is some armor that saves from 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.900
 classmates with cars with not very 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.060
 good breakthrough is not bad 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.250
 mobility is the only thing turning 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.200
 left-right tank reluctantly therefore in 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.030
 maneuverable combat need to be careful and 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.820
 opponents too close to yourself not 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.760
 allow in general is played around in 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.490
 0s straight account and if you do not have a weight 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.289
 to farm and crews for Americans 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.660
 then it is quite a normal such 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.060
 working version can also be nice 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.849
 relax tonight if the plums are on i'm 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.890
 Iâ€™m not fed up with order 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.370
 that the tank is right on heaven among all 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.140
 work in level 5, I would definitely choose 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.150
 Churchill well and between him and their server 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.450
 probably would lean more towards excelsior 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.880
 at 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.569
 he somehow seemed to be moving 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.059
 by acceptance 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.490
 maybe this is purely subjective but mine 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:59.520
 impressions are his was a meshuggah 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.889
 Like-Dislike Subscription Sold All Like 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.389
 you know, and on this all the luck in the randomness 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.869
 and see you soon 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.869
 happily
