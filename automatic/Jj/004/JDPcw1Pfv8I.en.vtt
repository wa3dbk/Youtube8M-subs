00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
learning process we've empowered our

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.660 
learning process we've empowered our
children<00:02:12.230> to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
children to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.370 
children to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
take more ownership of their learning

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.830 
take more ownership of their learning
and<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:15.370> help<00:02:15.610> them<00:02:15.790> achieve<00:02:15.970> goals<00:02:16.450> for

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and we help them achieve goals for

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.760 
and we help them achieve goals for
themselves<00:02:16.959> based<00:02:17.800> on<00:02:18.130> their<00:02:18.819> data<00:02:19.739> when<00:02:20.739> I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
themselves based on their data when I

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.430 
themselves based on their data when I
saw<00:02:21.280> our<00:02:21.640> kids<00:02:22.300> in<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.750> turnaround<00:02:23.230> zone

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
saw our kids in the turnaround zone

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440 
saw our kids in the turnaround zone
performing<00:02:24.190> at<00:02:24.400> significantly<00:02:25.180> higher

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
performing at significantly higher

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.600 
performing at significantly higher
levels<00:02:25.900> then<00:02:26.500> they<00:02:26.980> had<00:02:27.130> done<00:02:27.340> previously

that made me a true believer that tap
could<00:02:31.120> be<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.720> system<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.319> we<00:02:32.440> use<00:02:32.470> to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
could be the system that we use to

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.270 
could be the system that we use to
really<00:02:33.400> make<00:02:33.730> significant<00:02:34.540> gains<00:02:34.860> all<00:02:35.860> of<00:02:36.160> the
