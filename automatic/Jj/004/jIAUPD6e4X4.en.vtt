shoulder the other measurement that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.850 
shoulder the other measurement that
you'll<00:03:06.060> need<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.510> across<00:03:06.870> from<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
you'll need is the across from the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.730 
you'll need is the across from the
across<00:03:08.250> front<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.700> basically<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:10.260> curve<00:03:10.530> of

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
across front is basically the curve of

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.940 
across front is basically the curve of
the<00:03:10.890> armhole<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:14.220> other<00:03:14.400> curve<00:03:15.500> in<00:03:16.500> this

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
the armhole to the other curve in this

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.930 
the armhole to the other curve in this
case<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.490> is<00:03:17.700> 13<00:03:19.250> similarly<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.400> take<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.760> at

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
case it is 13 similarly you take it at

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.850 
case it is 13 similarly you take it at
the<00:03:21.000> back<00:03:23.150> from<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.360> armhole<00:03:24.870> curve<00:03:25.140> together

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
the back from the armhole curve together

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.560 
the back from the armhole curve together
on<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.310> curve<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:29.730> measurement<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.390> back

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
on one curve the measurement of the back

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.720 
on one curve the measurement of the back
is<00:03:30.810> usually<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.440> little<00:03:31.650> more<00:03:32.460> than<00:03:32.640> a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
is usually a little more than a

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.140 
is usually a little more than a
measurement<00:03:33.030> on<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.360> front<00:03:34.820> then<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:35.850> come

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.520 
sure that that a goes over the phyllis
part<00:05:21.100> of<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.550> bust<00:05:21.790> if<00:05:22.540> it<00:05:22.780> slides<00:05:23.080> down<00:05:23.260> to

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
part of the bust if it slides down to

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.010 
part of the bust if it slides down to
the<00:05:23.620> side<00:05:23.890> you<00:05:24.040> get<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.400> wrong<00:05:24.610> measurement<00:05:25.150> so

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
the side you get a wrong measurement so

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.830 
the side you get a wrong measurement so
from<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.470> shoulder<00:05:26.890> point<00:05:27.220> over<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.270> phyllis

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
from the shoulder point over the phyllis

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.300 
from the shoulder point over the phyllis
part<00:05:29.220> right<00:05:30.220> below<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.670> bust<00:05:31.740> then<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:33.130> have

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
part right below the bust then you have

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.110 
part right below the bust then you have
your<00:05:33.430> baseline<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.560> then<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:36.820> need<00:05:37.000> the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
your baseline and then you need the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.480 
your baseline and then you need the
length<00:05:37.330> of<00:05:37.540> the<00:05:37.660> government<00:05:38.050> suppose<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:39.310> is<00:05:39.460> a

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
length of the government suppose it is a

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.670 
length of the government suppose it is a
top<00:05:39.840> your<00:05:40.840> length<00:05:40.990> of<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.200> now<00:05:41.320> it<00:05:41.470> will<00:05:41.560> be

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
top your length of the now it will be

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.470 
top your length of the now it will be
twenty<00:05:41.920> five<00:05:41.950> something<00:05:42.880> wrong<00:05:43.090> curve<00:05:43.300> will

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
twenty five something wrong curve will

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.260 
twenty five something wrong curve will
be<00:05:43.630> 38<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:44.920> if<00:05:45.310> it's<00:05:45.460> a<00:05:45.520> full<00:05:45.700> length<00:05:45.850> garment

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
be 38 and if it's a full length garment

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.380 
be 38 and if it's a full length garment
you<00:05:46.390> take<00:05:46.660> it<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.020> floor<00:05:47.860> or<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:49.180> take<00:05:49.360> a

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
you take it to the floor or you take a

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.170 
you take it to the floor or you take a
coil<00:05:49.690> or<00:05:50.190> with<00:05:51.190> a<00:05:51.220> person<00:05:51.610> wearing<00:05:51.760> that<00:05:51.970> he<00:05:52.120> is

that they will normally be wearing with
the<00:05:54.790> government<00:05:55.150> and<00:05:55.300> take<00:05:55.420> it<00:05:55.600> to<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:56.260> choke

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
the government and take it to the choke

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.930 
the government and take it to the choke
point<00:05:56.740> they're<00:05:56.950> comfortable<00:05:58.860> now<00:05:59.860> now<00:06:00.730> that

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
you might also need a base to knee

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.880 
you might also need a base to knee
measurement<00:06:55.220> in<00:06:56.150> some<00:06:56.510> cases<00:06:56.810> like<00:06:57.530> a<00:06:57.590> to

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
need an inseam measurement which is

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.690 
need an inseam measurement which is
basically<00:07:05.590> the<00:07:06.590> measurement<00:07:07.100> from<00:07:07.250> the<00:07:07.340> inner

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700

basically the measurement from the inner
side<00:07:08.000> of<00:07:08.240> the<00:07:08.500> leg<00:07:09.500> which<00:07:10.430> is<00:07:10.550> the<00:07:10.790> bottom<00:07:11.270> this

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
side of the leg which is the bottom this

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.320 
side of the leg which is the bottom this
is<00:07:11.930> your<00:07:12.200> inseam<00:07:12.530> mission<00:07:15.610> so<00:07:16.610> these<00:07:17.000> are<00:07:17.210> the

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330 
is your inseam mission so these are the
