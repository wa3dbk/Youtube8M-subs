00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.040
 our second session we're going to see the 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.309
 number line and the order in the numbers 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.309
 whole 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.630
 let's pass the number line 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.559
 storyteller 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.670
 ah 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.239
 we take as reference the 0 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.439
 we locate the 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:11.399
 to the right to the right of 0 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.399
 we place the positives 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.619
 4 and so on 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.510
 enough 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.720
 you more infinity are usually put as 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.220
 infinity opens to the left 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.210
 of steel we will locate the negatives 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.380
 minus one 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.380
 at least 2 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 3 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.260
 at least 4 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.260
 so on what will you tell me 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.190
 kevin to the least infinite 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.270
 as we said to the left 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.830
 and these are going to be the integers 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.730
 more negative integers 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.730
 with 0 to the right 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.200
 and they're going to be the integers 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.620
 the positive integers 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.620
 the 0 is the neutral because it has no sign 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.470
 the 0 is the neutral 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.410
 you will not have known this the number line 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.890
 Let's say 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.319
 what 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.600
 of the numbers that are towards 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:03.690
 the right are going to be older 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.690
 those on the left are smaller 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.590
 let's take two points 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.519
 the 2 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.519
 with the pse 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.920
 2 with 0 we will not compare 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.849
 at zero 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.849
 two 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.019
 let's say that 0 is less than 2 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.819
 because all those who are towards the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.540
 left are going to be smaller than those that 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.230
 they are on the right 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.340
 showing that we can take serious 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.340
 at least 3 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.079
 with the minus 1 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.739
 - 3 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.290
 in Peru
