00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.719
 I'll start by saying a little about me, it's just 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 So, if you know my name, it's Marcelo. 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.879
 I have 13 year old clove videos or I started 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 record videos 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.190
 It's because there's nothing to do other than 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.640
 watch tv watch play 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:59.070

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.140
 random games and games that I never 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.390

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:31.350
 random channel pattern that is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.869
 suffocated in codina said that only the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.820

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.939

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.420

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.470
