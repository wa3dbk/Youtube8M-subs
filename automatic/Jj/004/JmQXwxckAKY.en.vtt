00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.140
 and well guilloton I hope you 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.780
 of course go for a kama species 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.020
 and this time it's okay it's going to be a 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.640
 any new tip you will not have 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.869
 not surely had to see very often on 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.779
 youtube finally I think she is not 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.190
 still out I'm the first to do 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.170
 already before starting it will be a 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.830
 Gamma trick of basing on the dock 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.350
 so I'm going to do several averages 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.460
 euros kama bush according to people 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.280
 in our accounts it is according to the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.930
 people who do the multifoot and so 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.120
 give you some figures here are some 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.780
 very simple things that boil down to 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.149
 hard for the moment and that's it so 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.320
 what is this trick that's all 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.050
 just a drop 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.790
 as I already told you about a 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.450
 some resources so for now 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.700
 there is only one 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.130
 after that differs depending on the servers but 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.440
 for my only one is the most important 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.940
 it is the purple fabric while for 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.509
 take you will see that the price of 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.140
 50 an island or even 60 miles we will say 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.660
 for 10 and 1 million that together we get 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.460
 must be about 600 thousand percent 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.880
 but you see the price still enough 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.720
 up those 4000 units and look on 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.940
 Presseurop 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.760
 so first have to go out on 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.540
 boats maj the age markers and the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.439
 europe rate and 2 still basic 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.380
 10 to 15% 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.680
 and if you put prospecting on 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.680
 day 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.470
 I have 157 which is not huge 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.020
 we will see with 200 prospecting because 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.400
 that most often it is from there 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.610
 happens is stopped still disappointed 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:51.010
 prospecting with the dragons of a good 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:56.950
 fight about alex shortened his 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.110
 small so for now there is that 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.190
 this resource 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.060
 I 'm going with a little bit I'm sorry 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.880
 so fabric why who is here because 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.640
 that or tissue value we do not know the same 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.310
 palm and noble bone the look of fabrics 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.970
 so take the locker room for at 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.750
 about 200 prospecting drop rate 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.420
 will be almost 50% the 28 to 42% 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.890
 so what is practically 40 50% this 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.350
 which is interesting enough when you 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.570
 see that the dante practically not 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.860
 automatic but one out of two if you 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.860
 take several blunders in a fight 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.260
 there may be I think with 200 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.420
 prospecting by itself 2 3 what you 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.480
 still makes six and five deserved 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.790
 carla fifteen miles we'll say against 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.330
 which is quite slow so imagine you 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.080
 you play as a team 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.770
 we will already say useless a team of 4 on 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.940
 will make an average of 2.10th for 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.370
 clean to anyone - rhymes of four 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.220
 we will say that they drop each so 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.710
 who is still fighting 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.080
 to say if excusing me by 10 24 billion 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.060
 by combal if you have 4 characters it's 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.230
 a pump fabric is the only one that's 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.920
 certainly sure there are more than 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.440
 4,6 to several boats 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.750
 so it can go up to if there is 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.700
 four boats in a fight that can 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.930
 go up I think at 6.17 she 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.470
 was about 6-7 8/10 that is what 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.030
 did 50 someone still gave me 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.360
 then if the eight month victim like 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.690
 me what I do bassoues does eight 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.660
 both say the e10 fabric it makes 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.080
 80 what do i do 8 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.000
 we will say fabric 10 bat simply 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.360
 sixty thousand ten times but he 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.820
 served 69 in one like me you do 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.209
 case my part good music that can 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.030
 not annoying funny that part 60 minutes 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.709
 cama just in a fight so long 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.170
 ramp and 10 leave you a collector 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.819
 on the area 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.849
 on the map on which you drop and 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.560
 it's all benefit so the craft in 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.569
 why why give you a drop and that 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.950
 well yes it smells because it's there 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.640
 a new invocation portion of the 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.389
 collector 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.489
 it only takes one but taxes 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.500
 are selling but really like 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.850
 buns sense hyper fast so that's 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.710
 what is the most expensive in the craft 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.050
 after it's my server there have been some 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.240
 things that also wanted to cost too 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.150
 it was expensive seeds of discord 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.330
 have a little disappointed and the feces 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.440
 sustainable so we'll look quickly 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.360
 I already have fangs so I think they 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.350
 were 1 60 miles they went back down 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.020
 at 7000 so it's true that I lost 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.620
 a lot of value on the server on 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.729
 your servers and tell me how much is worth 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.430
 by says it's better because it takes 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.370
 cold fight in the crash 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.440
 if I 'm not mistaken it's his 8 and the 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.900
 ranges of discord that I was from europe 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.800
 - the ubs which was worth a lot 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.470
 more expensive can now it had to 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.070
 still 60 mines and they went down to 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.600
 14 thousand 5 after that depends on the servers 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.919
 sometimes it's more interesting to drop 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.410
 and grain seeds of discord 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.150
 and crunches duras or skin tissue or 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.090
 the three are interesting so what 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.820
 do you to that arm and just in 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.320
 being light especially as its season but 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.350
 really really really fast 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.560
 right in the prism of alliance so 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.450
 it's all good and europe's rate 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.780
 for the three are almost the same 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.669
 thing 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:38.979
 there we can see that the seeds are draped 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:39.780
 at 28 39 39 oars 28.39 so Europe 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.470
 herself 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.460
 so there are no worries at this level 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.990
 that's all for this video sung we have 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.730
 does a little math a gachi calculus 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.550
 for a team of 4 going to europe and 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.640
 during his a hard fight to be ready 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.560
 thirty seconds will tell the field of 30 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.610
 seconds which is pretty huge with 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.780
 even diop it might say is that 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.120
 I would only have 10 seconds and in eight 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.450
 stages of the zones tell us 30 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.180
 seconds of small averages so 30 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:17.240
 seconds a fight and makes you in 30 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:19.190
 seconds for cardboard to say go 28 15 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.190
 thousand cases my fifteen kilometers in 30 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.720
 seconds and in a minute I'm going 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.670
 do complex calculations and therefore do not 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.040
 do not worry I do not know if I 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.620
 I was wrong to say 15 minutes in 30 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:40.220
 seconds in a mine 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:43.150
 there is still a second no good we're going 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.070
 leave but what a lot of sand but 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.110
 his sphere 30000 this is a minute we have 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.130
 well here is sixty so in one 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.320
 time you can make yourself a million 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.669
 August 1 and a half million in a cam 1 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.350
 hour is in scout differs a lot 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.360
 sometimes you are wrong much more 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.460
 many times and not much less 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.440
 but a little less much less to 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.910
 ehpad europe and zero during a fight 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.700
 it is to be 4 1 which is enough 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.530
 logic 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.350
 if you are all alone that divides is 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.770
 taken by four so what to do 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.760
 still 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.430
 four hundred and fifty thousand cases my 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.360
 pain which is not nothing and if you 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.800
 do that we will say during 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.050
 eighties if you have both of 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.870
 do this for four hours 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.940
 so its 6.5 in you feel that's it 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.680
 walk for everyone it's not a 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.340
 asus that reserves is that level on 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.410
 all scholarships 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.020
 it's really but very nice to be I 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.320
 believe it's I believe that 270 even 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.900
 not the stage as of October 30 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:39.370
 because finally problem and here you are 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.990
 that's all for this video I think about 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.000
 nothing else to add is a trick 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.730
 works for the benefit of which mans 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.990
 year according to his backhand on to tell me 

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.880
 in the comments what will think 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.380
 the prices of your servers and all the 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.270
 rest is safe this Thursday see you soon 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.270
 for a nice video chat 

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.429
