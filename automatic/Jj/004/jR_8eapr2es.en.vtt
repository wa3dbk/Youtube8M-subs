00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
minor gear and this miter gear that's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.779 
minor gear and this miter gear that's
what<00:01:45.719> changes<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.259> direction<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:47.310> gear<00:01:47.669> is

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
what changes the direction this gear is

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.639 
what changes the direction this gear is
always<00:01:48.029> moving<00:01:48.209> in<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.599> same<00:01:48.779> direction<00:01:48.840> so

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
always moving in the same direction so

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.129 
always moving in the same direction so
we<00:01:50.189> switch<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.759> pulley<00:01:50.999> from<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:51.869> side<00:01:52.109> to

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
we switch the pulley from one side to

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:55.399 
we switch the pulley from one side to
the<00:01:52.380> other<00:01:52.499> using<00:01:53.489> these<00:01:53.639> cams<00:01:53.999> which<00:01:54.929> changes

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the other using these cams which changes

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.769 
the other using these cams which changes
the<00:01:55.619> output<00:01:55.889> direction<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.299> black<00:01:57.509> pulley

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:57.779 
the output direction of the black pulley

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:00.289 
the output direction of the black pulley
so<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.950> continue<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.489> push<00:01:59.669> down<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.149> my

past<00:04:38.880> each<00:04:39.330> other<00:04:39.510> in<00:04:39.720> one<00:04:39.870> direction<00:04:40.050> and

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
past each other in one direction and

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.770 
past each other in one direction and
when<00:04:40.680> we<00:04:40.800> go<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.160> other<00:04:41.190> direction<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:42.570> can

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
when we go the other direction it can

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.990 
when we go the other direction it can
lock<00:04:42.960> up<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.290> system<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.160> right<00:04:44.370> now<00:04:44.550> as<00:04:44.850> I'm

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
lock up the system so right now as I'm

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.090 
lock up the system so right now as I'm
turning<00:04:45.330> this<00:04:45.480> pulley<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.169> can<00:04:46.590> feel<00:04:46.890> that

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
turning this pulley I can feel that

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.950 
turning this pulley I can feel that
there<00:04:47.310> is<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.460> low<00:04:47.790> being<00:04:48.150> put<00:04:48.360> on<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.540> system

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
there is a low being put on the system

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.560 
there is a low being put on the system
and<00:04:49.200> eventually<00:04:50.040> we<00:04:50.220> will<00:04:50.370> break<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.940> little

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
and eventually we will break the little

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.200 
and eventually we will break the little
teeth<00:04:52.440> on<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:53.280> cams<00:04:54.060> or<00:04:54.480> on<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.810> pulley<00:04:56.210> now

we'll<00:04:57.330> go<00:04:57.450> over<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.750> couple<00:04:57.900> issues<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.800> watch

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
we'll go over a couple issues to watch

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.870 
we'll go over a couple issues to watch
out<00:04:59.250> for<00:04:59.490> the<00:05:00.150> first<00:05:00.360> issue<00:05:00.600> is<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.880> the

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
out for the first issue is the the

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.390 
out for the first issue is the the

gearbox is very loose left to right it's

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.920 
gearbox is very loose left to right it's
loose<00:05:28.890> because<00:05:29.460> we're<00:05:29.820> not<00:05:30.030> fully<00:05:30.360> engaged<00:05:30.570> in

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
loose because we're not fully engaged in

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.350

as<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:34.290> can<00:05:34.440> see<00:05:34.590> from<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:34.950> top<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.790> gears

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
as you can see from the top the gears

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.860 
as you can see from the top the gears
could<00:05:36.840> be<00:05:36.990> in<00:05:37.140> either<00:05:37.320> direction<00:05:38.010> so<00:05:38.910> just

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
could be in either direction so just

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.960 
could be in either direction so just
because<00:05:40.020> the<00:05:40.350> drive<00:05:40.560> pulley<00:05:40.830> is<00:05:41.250> sloppy<00:05:41.700> in

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
because the drive pulley is sloppy in

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.580 
because the drive pulley is sloppy in
this<00:05:42.090> position<00:05:42.570> does<00:05:43.110> not<00:05:43.290> mean<00:05:43.410> something

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
this position does not mean something

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.620 
this position does not mean something
that's<00:05:43.830> wrong<00:05:44.070> if<00:05:44.340> you<00:05:44.460> continue<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.090> move<00:05:45.420> the

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
that's wrong if you continue to move the

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.860 
that's wrong if you continue to move the
gear<00:05:45.840> around<00:05:46.170> the<00:05:47.070> unit<00:05:47.400> will<00:05:47.580> fully<00:05:48.510> shift

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
gear around the unit will fully shift

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.500 
gear around the unit will fully shift
into<00:05:49.170> position<00:05:49.650> as<00:05:49.980> you<00:05:50.730> continue<00:05:51.210> to<00:05:51.240> move

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
into position as you continue to move

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.760 
into position as you continue to move
from<00:05:51.810> reverse<00:05:52.490> back<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.700> forward<00:05:54.380> again<00:05:55.380> the

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
from reverse back to forward again the

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.190 
from reverse back to forward again the
pulley<00:05:56.010> gets<00:05:56.310> into<00:05:56.670> a<00:05:56.700> tight<00:05:57.120> position<00:05:57.390> again

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
pulley gets into a tight position again

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.890 
pulley gets into a tight position again
so<00:05:58.620> looseness<00:05:59.250> on<00:05:59.640> the<00:05:59.730> pulley<00:05:59.970> likely<00:06:00.660> means

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
so looseness on the pulley likely means

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.110 
so looseness on the pulley likely means
the<00:06:01.080> unit<00:06:01.350> is<00:06:01.440> in<00:06:01.650> Reverse<00:06:02.070> not<00:06:02.790> that<00:06:02.970> there's

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
the unit is in Reverse not that there's

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.920 
the unit is in Reverse not that there's
something<00:06:03.300> wrong<00:06:05.390> the<00:06:06.390> other<00:06:06.510> potential

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930

neutral<00:06:43.830> position<00:06:44.300> when<00:06:45.300> I<00:06:45.330> turn<00:06:45.660> the<00:06:45.840> pulley

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
neutral position when I turn the pulley

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.900 
neutral position when I turn the pulley
nothing<00:06:46.530> happens<00:06:46.890> the<00:06:47.220> pulley<00:06:47.430> is<00:06:47.640> free

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
nothing happens the pulley is free

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.510 
nothing happens the pulley is free
spinning<00:06:48.210> if<00:06:49.200> you<00:06:49.350> look<00:06:49.530> up<00:06:49.740> you<00:06:49.920> remember<00:06:50.340> the

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
spinning if you look up you remember the

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.580 
spinning if you look up you remember the
gears<00:06:50.850> are<00:06:51.210> not<00:06:51.270> interfacing<00:06:52.110> they're<00:06:52.320> in<00:06:52.440> the

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
gears are not interfacing they're in the

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.020 
gears are not interfacing they're in the
third<00:06:52.800> in<00:06:52.920> between<00:06:53.310> the<00:06:53.520> forward<00:06:53.790> and<00:06:53.940> the

third in between the forward and the
reverse<00:06:54.090> direction<00:06:54.800> so<00:06:55.800> that<00:06:56.430> doesn't<00:06:56.610> mean

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
reverse direction so that doesn't mean

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.640 
reverse direction so that doesn't mean
anything<00:06:57.000> is<00:06:57.390> wrong<00:06:57.600> with<00:06:57.780> the<00:06:57.900> gearbox<00:06:58.080> is

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
anything is wrong with the gearbox is

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.740 
anything is wrong with the gearbox is
just<00:06:59.250> that<00:06:59.400> we're<00:06:59.520> turning<00:06:59.760> the<00:07:00.030> output<00:07:00.480> gear

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
just that we're turning the output gear

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.130 
just that we're turning the output gear
we<00:07:00.990> should<00:07:01.200> be<00:07:01.350> turning<00:07:01.620> the<00:07:02.460> input<00:07:02.850> gear<00:07:03.140> the

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.140 
we should be turning the input gear the

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.100 
we should be turning the input gear the
other<00:07:04.290> thing<00:07:04.530> that<00:07:04.560> can<00:07:04.800> happen<00:07:05.010> is<00:07:05.490> we<00:07:06.450> we<00:07:06.930> can

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
other thing that can happen is we we can

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.100 
other thing that can happen is we we can
have<00:07:07.920> a<00:07:07.950> problem<00:07:08.490> that<00:07:08.520> we<00:07:08.730> turn<00:07:09.090> the<00:07:09.840> black

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
have a problem that we turn the black

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:11.470 
have a problem that we turn the black
pulley<00:07:10.410> in<00:07:10.740> the<00:07:10.980> rear

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480 
pulley in the rear

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.990 
pulley in the rear
direction<00:07:12.080> so<00:07:12.860> I'll<00:07:13.010> move<00:07:13.160> the<00:07:13.370> cams<00:07:13.610> through

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
direction so I'll move the cams through

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.540 
direction so I'll move the cams through
their<00:07:14.120> normal<00:07:14.480> positions<00:07:15.220> reversing<00:07:16.220> them

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
their normal positions reversing them

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.810 
their normal positions reversing them
back<00:07:16.760> to<00:07:16.940> forward<00:07:17.210> if<00:07:18.050> I<00:07:18.830> now<00:07:19.040> turn<00:07:19.340> this<00:07:19.550> bully

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820 
back to forward if I now turn this bully

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.700 
back to forward if I now turn this bully
in<00:07:20.090> the<00:07:20.390> wrong<00:07:20.720> direction<00:07:21.080> which<00:07:21.560> is

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
in the wrong direction which is

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.370 
in the wrong direction which is
clockwise<00:07:22.330> you'll<00:07:23.330> see<00:07:23.600> I'm<00:07:23.750> trying<00:07:24.080> to<00:07:24.230> move

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
clockwise you'll see I'm trying to move

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.490 
clockwise you'll see I'm trying to move
the<00:07:24.560> cams<00:07:24.830> past<00:07:25.540> the<00:07:26.540> points<00:07:26.930> of<00:07:27.050> the<00:07:27.140> pivot

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
the cams past the points of the pivot

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.070 
the cams past the points of the pivot
the<00:07:28.250> problem<00:07:28.640> with<00:07:28.790> this<00:07:28.940> is<00:07:29.210> the<00:07:29.420> geometry

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
the problem with this is the geometry

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.260 
the problem with this is the geometry
between<00:07:30.560> the<00:07:30.830> pivot<00:07:31.040> and<00:07:31.280> the<00:07:31.370> cams<00:07:31.700> is

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
between the pivot and the cams is

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.180 
between the pivot and the cams is
supposed<00:07:32.780> to<00:07:32.870> slide<00:07:33.260> past<00:07:33.290> each<00:07:33.800> other

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.190 
supposed to slide past each other

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.430 
supposed to slide past each other
if<00:07:34.310> those<00:07:34.850> two<00:07:35.150> points<00:07:35.480> hook<00:07:35.870> on<00:07:36.080> each<00:07:36.110> other

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
if those two points hook on each other

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.470 
if those two points hook on each other
because<00:07:36.830> they're<00:07:36.980> going<00:07:37.250> in<00:07:37.370> Reverse<00:07:37.700> you<00:07:38.120> can

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:38.480 
because they're going in Reverse you can

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.330 
because they're going in Reverse you can
cause<00:07:38.630> damage<00:07:39.110> to<00:07:39.140> the<00:07:39.320> unit<00:07:39.650> so<00:07:40.100> by<00:07:40.280> turning

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:40.340 
cause damage to the unit so by turning

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.040 
cause damage to the unit so by turning
this<00:07:40.820> output<00:07:41.330> pulley<00:07:41.570> in<00:07:41.720> the<00:07:41.780> wrong

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.050 
this output pulley in the wrong

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.610 
this output pulley in the wrong
direction<00:07:42.350> we<00:07:43.010> can<00:07:43.850> lock<00:07:44.090> up<00:07:44.360> right<00:07:44.690> now<00:07:44.870> this

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:45.620 
direction we can lock up right now this

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.680 
direction we can lock up right now this
is<00:07:45.980> starting<00:07:46.220> to<00:07:46.460> get<00:07:46.580> stress<00:07:47.060> on<00:07:47.300> it<00:07:47.330> I<00:07:47.540> can

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:47.690 
is starting to get stress on it I can

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.400 
is starting to get stress on it I can
feel<00:07:47.930> because<00:07:48.200> the<00:07:48.920> two<00:07:49.300> points<00:07:50.300> are<00:07:50.420> engaging

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.410 
feel because the two points are engaging

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.010 
feel because the two points are engaging
in<00:07:51.740> the<00:07:51.860> wrong<00:07:52.070> direction<00:07:52.340> if<00:07:53.240> I<00:07:53.390> continue<00:07:53.900> to
