of the hoof coming out of there
you<00:01:51.310> know<00:01:51.429> within<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.789> last<00:01:52.380> 60<00:01:53.380> days<00:01:53.410> or<00:01:54.130> so

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
you know within the last 60 days or so

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.930 
you know within the last 60 days or so
is<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.849> way<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.090> looks<00:01:55.330> like<00:01:55.569> was<00:01:55.810> when

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
is the way it looks like was when

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.910 
is the way it looks like was when
probably<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.030> most<00:01:58.319> stressful<00:01:59.319> insult

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
probably the most stressful insult

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.460 
probably the most stressful insult
occurred<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.670> her<00:02:00.849> we<00:02:01.810> have<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.929> chance<00:02:02.259> of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
occurred to her we have a chance of

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.010 
occurred to her we have a chance of
bringing<00:02:03.429> her<00:02:03.490> back<00:02:03.670> around<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:04.539> little

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
bringing her back around a little

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.600 
bringing her back around a little
quicker<00:02:05.349> since<00:02:05.619> she<00:02:05.800> hasn't<00:02:06.009> been<00:02:06.340> under

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
quicker since she hasn't been under

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.580 
quicker since she hasn't been under
these<00:02:06.759> conditions<00:02:07.360> for<00:02:07.599> for<00:02:08.110> such<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> long

these conditions for for such a long

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.770 
these conditions for for such a long
period<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.190> time<00:02:09.250> we<00:02:10.149> probably<00:02:10.330> want<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.690> get

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
period of time we probably want to get

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.750 
period of time we probably want to get
her<00:02:10.869> caught<00:02:11.080> up<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.380> her<00:02:11.530> on<00:02:11.770> her<00:02:11.980> vaccinations

organs then we may not be able to get
the<00:02:43.980> weight<00:02:44.159> on<00:02:44.400> her<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.290> want<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:47.159> you

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the weight on her that we want when you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.979 
the weight on her that we want when you
talk<00:02:47.430> about<00:02:47.459> nutrition<00:02:48.030> with<00:02:48.329> these<00:02:48.480> guys<00:02:48.689> and

talk about nutrition with these guys and

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.789 
talk about nutrition with these guys and
that<00:02:49.230> are<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:49.680> debilitated<00:02:50.519> like<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.799> you

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
that are so debilitated like this you

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.819 
that are so debilitated like this you
really<00:02:53.099> have<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.579> careful<00:02:54.470> when<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.590> start

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
really have to be careful when you start

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.740 
really have to be careful when you start
putting<00:02:56.040> them<00:02:56.220> on<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.030> nutrition<00:02:57.599> program

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
putting them on a on a nutrition program

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.140 
putting them on a on a nutrition program
for<00:02:58.470> them<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.709> gain<00:02:58.920> weight<00:02:59.159> because<00:02:59.909> you<00:03:00.000> can

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
for them to gain weight because you can

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.709 
for them to gain weight because you can
really<00:03:00.389> overdo<00:03:00.870> them<00:03:01.099> too<00:03:02.099> fast<00:03:02.480> with<00:03:03.480> too

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
really overdo them too fast with too

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.490 
really overdo them too fast with too
much<00:03:03.900> feed<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:04.469> she<00:03:05.099> starts<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.609> settle<00:03:05.819> in<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
much feed as she starts to settle in and

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.970 
much feed as she starts to settle in and
you're<00:03:07.500> sure<00:03:07.829> that<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:09.150> know<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.560> blood<00:03:10.799> work

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
you're sure that you know the blood work

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.879 
you're sure that you know the blood work
looks<00:03:11.010> okay<00:03:11.840> then<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:12.989> can<00:03:13.109> start<00:03:13.349> adding<00:03:13.560> in

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
looks okay then we can start adding in

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.399 
looks okay then we can start adding in
some<00:03:14.239> some<00:03:15.239> concentration<00:03:15.840> something<00:03:16.260> like

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
some some concentration something like

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.500 
some some concentration something like
an<00:03:16.530> equine<00:03:16.799> senior<00:03:17.280> but<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.269> have

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
an equine senior but it's going to have

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.319 
an equine senior but it's going to have
all<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:20.010> nutrients<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.760> she's

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
all of the the nutrients that she's

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.559 
all of the the nutrients that she's
going<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.659> need<00:03:22.310> especially<00:03:23.310> for<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.549> horse<00:03:24.090> of

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
going to need especially for a horse of

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.589 
going to need especially for a horse of
her<00:03:24.870> age<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.519> if<00:03:26.519> we<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.909> feed<00:03:27.090> her<00:03:27.209> multiple

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
her age and if we can feed her multiple

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.869 
her age and if we can feed her multiple
times<00:03:27.750> during<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.859> day<00:03:29.069> it's<00:03:29.459> probably<00:03:29.639> going

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
times during the day it's probably going

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.110 
times during the day it's probably going
to<00:03:29.939> be<00:03:30.000> better<00:03:30.269> off<00:03:30.889> than<00:03:31.889> than<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:32.340> one<00:03:32.819> or

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
to be better off than than just one or

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.189 
to be better off than than just one or
even<00:03:33.480> two<00:03:34.280> feedings<00:03:35.280> my<00:03:35.790> day<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:36.930> way

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
even two feedings my day and that way

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.930 
even two feedings my day and that way
she's<00:03:37.650> able<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:38.010> eat<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.159> little<00:03:38.400> bit<00:03:38.609> as<00:03:38.879> she

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
she's able to eat a little bit as she

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.250 
she's able to eat a little bit as she
wants<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:41.010> can<00:03:41.459> do<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.790> all<00:03:41.970> day<00:03:42.000> long<00:03:42.389> so

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
wants and can do that all day long so

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.140 
wants and can do that all day long so
we're<00:03:43.470> probably<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:44.099> to<00:03:44.159> start<00:03:44.579> her<00:03:44.699> off<00:03:44.760> on

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
we're probably going to start her off on

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.119 
we're probably going to start her off on
just<00:03:45.449> a<00:03:45.510> couple<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.870> pounds<00:03:46.199> of<00:03:46.319> equine<00:03:46.620> senior

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
just a couple of pounds of equine senior

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.839 
just a couple of pounds of equine senior
and<00:03:47.810> gradually<00:03:48.810> build<00:03:49.019> her<00:03:49.260> up<00:03:49.519> half<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.639> pound

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
and gradually build her up half a pound

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.229 
and gradually build her up half a pound
increments<00:03:51.269> at<00:03:51.659> a<00:03:51.690> time<00:03:51.959> until<00:03:52.400> we're<00:03:53.400> getting

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
increments at a time until we're getting

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.140 
increments at a time until we're getting
her<00:03:54.419> the<00:03:54.720> energy<00:03:55.379> that<00:03:55.560> she<00:03:55.620> needs<00:03:56.069> now<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:57.120> a

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
her the energy that she needs now for a

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.920 
her the energy that she needs now for a
horse<00:03:57.659> to<00:03:57.930> gain<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.949> pound<00:03:59.699> you<00:04:00.389> need<00:04:00.599> to<00:04:00.720> feed

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
horse to gain a pound you need to feed

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.430 
horse to gain a pound you need to feed
them<00:04:01.579> about<00:04:02.579> 6,000<00:04:03.419> calories<00:04:03.599> as<00:04:04.049> a<00:04:04.079> rule<00:04:04.319> of

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
them about 6,000 calories as a rule of

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.099 
them about 6,000 calories as a rule of
thumb<00:04:04.500> just<00:04:04.949> 6,000<00:04:05.609> calories<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:06.269> top<00:04:06.659> of<00:04:06.900> what

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
thumb just 6,000 calories on top of what

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.729 
thumb just 6,000 calories on top of what
her<00:04:07.260> maintenance<00:04:07.620> is<00:04:08.150> so<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:10.049> know<00:04:10.169> a<00:04:10.199> half<00:04:10.530> a

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
her maintenance is so you know a half a

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.920 
her maintenance is so you know a half a
pound<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.669> gain<00:04:11.940> per<00:04:12.209> day<00:04:12.389> is<00:04:12.569> going<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.750> be
