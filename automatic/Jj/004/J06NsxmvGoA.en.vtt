00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 Well, no 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.640
 good guys today we are going to make a 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.710
 makeup that you have asked me from 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.410
 a long time ago and is to recreate the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.300
 anime style this Japanese animation so 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.099
 characteristic with very very eyes 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.500
 great as you see this technique that you use 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.270
 It is very easy to do and very very natural 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.039
 in quotation marks so all the 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.330
 passionate anime can you wear this 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.949
 makeup every day without any 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.480
 problem so let's start with 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.730
 this makeup and I remind you to continue 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.350

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.760

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.320
 you can see all the new tutorials 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.020
 on Tuesdays and the times we're going to start 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.060
 with this makeup the anime 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.860
 let's start and you'll see that it's very 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.570
 easy to do let's first create 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.680
 a little bit of intensity the banana with 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.680
 a more matte color 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.800
 let's put the eyeliner we're going to create 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.780
 first in shadow and then you do not repair 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 We will do in eyeliner or whatever you want 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.470
 we are going to do two effects to create the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.509
 effect of larger eyes is the first 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.880
 to be a triangle in the outer zone 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.040
 of the eyeliner quite thick but not very 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.540
 elongated and then we will extend the line 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.310
 lower eyelashes a little bit more 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.310
 down to create a rounder effect 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 the step we are going to do now is going to be 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.710
 give a touch a little more drawing 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.140
 encouraged for that let's intensify 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.180
 slightly the banana creating a soft 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 black line in the fair area of the cut 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.630
 of the banana 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.829
 use the eyeliner that you like most, either 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.229
 in cream gel in pill what 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.969
 you want to use normally this goes 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.200
 to give a more polished effect and more 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.200
 detailed of this line 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.850
 a touch that never fails to give a 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.170
 The biggest eye is to apply a 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.590
 clear pencil on the water line 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.590
 lower 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.259
 one of the pretty valid options is 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.970
 apply lower false eyelashes 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.620
 but I think that giving a very 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.810
 light eyelash drawing with 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.860
 eyeliner I think it's enough let's 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.860
 pass us our eyebrows 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.319
 I have opted for red eyebrows because 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.000
 I'm going to wear a red wig but you can 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.400
 adapt it to the type of wig you want 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 Take pink blue green whichever you want 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.660
 As false eyelashes I will opt for 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.580
 some corner ones from the corner to give 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.930
 that attention in the outermost part and 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.930
 Make the eye look bigger 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.500
 our face routine and concealer and 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.510
 powder is exactly the same as 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.459
 always that applies to some products 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.200
 that have a good coverage to give 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.769
 a more porcelain and wrist finish 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.769
 to the face 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.970
 the blusher is the one that gives the 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.920
 freshness and color to the face we are going to 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.810
 opt for a pink color and blur it 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.230
 well to continue with this effect of 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.230
 doll 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.950
 a natural lips a wig and some 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.630
 contact lenses with a wider diameter and a 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.380
 black edge for an eye effect more 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.380
 large we're done 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.200
 you liked it as you have seen the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.240
 final touches of the contact lenses and the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.040
 wig gives the touch completely 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.420
