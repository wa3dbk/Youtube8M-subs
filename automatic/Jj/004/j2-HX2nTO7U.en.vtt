00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone so today 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.109
 it's to talk to you about a little bug 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.570
 so we're going to do we're going to get into 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.400
 the river here it is simple 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.859
 would just need a pharaoh of a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.800
 such end of the match as pharaoh of the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:28.109
 shovel and an object interests so here 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.680
 you go to a corner you take 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:37.250
 your open 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:40.200
 they can therefore exceed the desolate one 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.170
 just a little confused it has to be 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.120
 well tight so that's how you got 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.820
 could see it from 5.2 in this video 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.820
 you insert your your object here is 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.770
 Then you tried to dig and 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.770
 it's very complicated all the time 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.390
 ok good so that's it makes me a bug 1 and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.150
 I confirm 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.150
 here you are taking your mask 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.770
 here it is called and you will run there 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:31.310
 lost until then falling mom or 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:31.310
 mental has fallen into the water if the good 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:55.470
 is how balloon now that's it 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.610
 so we are now you have to 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.719
 remove your mask as you want 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.460
 here and you are in the river so 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.799
 how to get out that's all that then for 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.709
 go out you approach the be of a 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.720
 edge of either a tax like you 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.370
 want and you run and but here is the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.940
 buggy the pumps and does everything 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.530
 simply 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.629
 and that's after you're in your 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.840
 town so voila here it is 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.160
 return to your life peacefully 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.870
 and if you want to go back into the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.760
 river must do it again a second 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.640
 time and you can do it as much 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:40.099
 time you want or on horseback or 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.099
