that your goal becomes clear on food
plots<00:01:36.159> for<00:01:36.399> deer<00:01:36.549> for<00:01:36.789> example<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.329> can<00:01:37.479> go

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
plots for deer for example you can go

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.629 
plots for deer for example you can go
and<00:01:37.779> you'll<00:01:37.899> find<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.499> whole<00:01:39.009> list<00:01:39.399> of

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:39.639 
and you'll find a whole list of

questions answer them honestly your

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:44.190 
questions answer them honestly your
goals<00:01:42.459> become<00:01:42.670> defined<00:01:43.209> now<00:01:43.749> all<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.109> a<00:01:44.170> sudden

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
goals become defined now all of a sudden

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.910 
goals become defined now all of a sudden
we<00:01:45.009> can<00:01:45.249> start<00:01:45.609> developing<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.359> plan<00:01:46.920> habitat

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
we can start developing a plan habitat

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.559 
we can start developing a plan habitat
improvement<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.490> very<00:01:48.729> much<00:01:48.969> like<00:01:49.179> being<00:01:49.479> a

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
improvement is very much like being a

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.379 
improvement is very much like being a
carpenter<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:50.349> carpenter<00:01:51.279> has<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.520> whole<00:01:51.880> big

tool chest to choose from and habitat

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.059 
tool chest to choose from and habitat
improvement<00:01:56.200> there's<00:01:56.380> all<00:01:56.590> sorts<00:01:56.979> of

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
improvement there's all sorts of

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.219 
improvement there's all sorts of
different<00:01:57.569> improvements<00:01:58.569> that<00:01:58.929> we<00:01:59.049> can

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
different improvements that we can

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.649 
different improvements that we can
choose<00:01:59.439> from<00:01:59.709> a<00:02:00.240> carpenter<00:02:01.240> isn't<00:02:01.450> going<00:02:01.599> to
