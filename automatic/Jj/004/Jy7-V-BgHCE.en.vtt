00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.110
 there's a very good attitude here just that 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.569
 commenting and good today I bring you one 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.910
 SME screen as good first video 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.650
 that I already have prerecorded that as 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.590
 you know I'm home I'm now 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.010
 same I will be in Madrid in the do not start 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.109
 in the morning today it is travel day 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.940
 by madrid giving a spin and such we 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.490
 We will go to the hotel to see how the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.740
 advance how will ride and all that but 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.660
 well I bring this screen theme against 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.099
 holy moly team although I think that 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.320
 they're complicated I think I think it 's 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.929
 pick up but good is an octane map 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.550
 and although I already know that I have a little 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:37.929
 fed up with the octane map the truth 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.100
 is that it is of the last limits that I 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.960
 are already possible from the train and I 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.460
 I wanted to get rid of it and it's a job 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.379
 that the truth comes out very well and I want 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.489
 that you see how I move as he asked the 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.190
 I support the truth I am continually 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.510
 catching respawn there's even some that 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.920
 again good I'm out of bullets I'm going to 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.959
 neutralize in the flag so that it adds 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.119
 less points without changing the rest then 

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:56.619
 also change the backup and start 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.329
 respond on the other side so it's clear 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:01.149
 a complete this although it is cut you go 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.590
 to like and good to tell us that what today 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.650
 start the 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.110
 madrid- not start the journey from 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.920
 tomorrow I'll be on the lan are the days 3 4 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.120
 and 5 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.540
 that is to say then I am in this video 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.610
 last morning and the next I'll be in 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.930
 the hotel that is will celebrate if you want 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.270
 the good video is the island hotel of the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.770
 Garena in alcalá de henares if you want 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.180
 the video the ticket information and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.440
 such I leave it in the description by 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 Madrid series and you want to give a 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.320
 return to spend whatever it is that is 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.360
 besides they also ride apart from the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.860
 good ride is over online games 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.410
 fifa and all that and apart from montan 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.030
 Also simulators games 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.590
 careers and I think he also set the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.690
 new generation things for you to try 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.860
 and aside the last good day everyone says 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.780
 do lot lots but the last day 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.280
 they are going to do a lot of draws that the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.440
 idea is that I was encouraged they said that so 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.330
 less one in three people get along 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.490
 some kind of surprise prize 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.899
 and what looks good if 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.140
 you want to pass so I leave the video in 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.729
 the description and well let's talk a 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.680
 little bit of feelings with the team 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.759
 start tomorrow land and this shows the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.820
 I have to tell you how it is 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.020
 playing very little this is the only day it 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.780
 I could say that we were playing a 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.610
 good time about 23 hours although it is 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.250
 this game is very slow nexus one for 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.440
 to play 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.850
 people usually fall sometimes because in 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.240
 Private items no services 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.890
 sometimes dedicated people in the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.920
 games and put the rules coz sport 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.750
 it takes a lot to start the games 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.770
 It's not hard to play the game like that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.930
 they have to go use a little 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.150
 so that it goes better because in the end 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.560
 play with people between you have to 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
 invite them all a lot of people 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.070
 to get the part and then to invite 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.570
 to the game open the game so that it 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.620
 unite closed so that now no one is 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.410
 a little bit Boston so I do not know I'm going to 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.450
 tell you also in this video we're going for 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.910
 there is video the program that is going to 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.950
 see during these days that I'm not in 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.750
 home you will have videos every day 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.260
 that is, until he returns until day 6 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.150
 which is the day of kings and you are going to have 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.290
 first place this competitive employment that 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.480
 I'm recording now the second 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.790
 then you are going to have a new road series 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.739
 to the infected the truth is that a 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.320
 double episode quite cool and with 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.690
 surprise in that video I do not say more and 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.700
 in addition you are also going to have 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.160
 the next part the last part of the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.560
 heavy duty guide that I wanted 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.500
 finish it now and leave everything finished so 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.400
 You are going to have the guidance of your rifles 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.200
 light machine guns and pistols that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.700
 as you will remember how you will remember and 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.260
 I said in the same video the first the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.720
 first part is a life that serves you 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.860
 also for any type of mode 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.960
 normal game so if those players 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.480
 of competitive whatever it is because I see it would be 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.100
 because you will find the subject of 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.470
 rifles and submachine guns to know until 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.750
 what stay they kill and all that and for 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.210
 last the last day a day 5 I have 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.330
 let another example of competitive this 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.410
 time since the attack is the map of 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.060
 freight I think it's if the frei map 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.290
 which is like a train on the train tracks 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.940
 in the middle and such that it is a map that 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.260
 I'm particularly bad at it 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.030
 it can be said that you get the one that best 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.020
 it gives me and front is the worst 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.510
 gives so I'm going to have a little bit of 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.620
 contrast there and possibly already as 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.120
 they saw methane octane greenpeace that 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.160
 I do not know if I have one or two left but let's go 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.810
 that I will have already more in primary 2 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.210
 I will try as I tell you when I come back from the 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.200
 lnd record something live without but not 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.209
 as I said right now 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.400
 we obviously want to see if 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.930
 we would play to win the lnd but now 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.060
 we know very well that there are many teams 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.590
 in a much better way than we are 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.640
 a very sudden wing and we also know 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.620
 not all teams have been 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.970
 play them as much as they want as per 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.470
 example we who had the game 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.420
 plus 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.250
 good is recording we will try to give 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.720
 a little cane before going to see 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.490
 if we can play some before anything 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.590
 to take a little more time and 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.360
 all that, so I hope we 're given 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.970
 well if you want to go to say hello yes 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.740
 we will be as much as iván business 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.870
 we will be around if you want to help and 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.580
 you want to see us play and all that and the 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.050
 that you ask me if I could record something 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.550
 of lnd that is some videoblog or what 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.740
 I 'm not given to record videoblogs 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.450
 I do not like it but hear if I encourage myself 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.950
 same record and about if I'm going to record the 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.570
 I really do not know if they are going to 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.000
 leave but I do not like to tell 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.230
 with the catcher because I would have to 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.910
 take her to see half had to buy 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.290
 a card and I do not have that right now 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.330
 I can not go buy a card because 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.310
 I do not have time not to organize 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.780
 all the preparations of the trip do 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.220
 the videos good to make miniatures 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.170
 today life and all that is not a little 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.590
 mess so I will not be able to record 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.020
 nothing except if I encourage some videoblog and 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.310
 well here you have the death chamber the 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.930
 true that a very good departure in 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.980
 As for positioning I hope that you 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.300
 have liked where the video as the 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.370
 comment has been liked then let me
