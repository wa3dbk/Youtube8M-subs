00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.540
 good the project with present to 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:09.260
 continuation 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.440
 I'm doing a caterpillar robot like you see 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.020
 the caterpillars in the chains and to our 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.710
 video explain how he had done it with 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.710
 3d printer 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.460
 besides the chain 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.119
 and then gear 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:34.150
 who sees and here is a base against 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.970
 4 mm plating for home 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.990
 all the elements so that the robot 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.570
 work correctly as you see here not 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.760
 I have powered the engines are thrown 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.820
 advice brought to Cervo one in each 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.120
 wheel 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.600
 and loving in front what brings me 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.989
 as I go here from one and valued strongly 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.989
 to the wheel 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.320
 the structure here has helped me 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.420
 as I say to observe and to erase the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.970
 battery a lipo and rechargeable battery 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.970
 of 11 as a volt 900 milliamps 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.900
 the pile passes the row prison to 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:26.810
 again the switch here 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.250
 from here on the switch and the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.940
 switch 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.420
 then feeder as we come thousand 780 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.040
 57 800 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.220
 and I like and can not feed 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.270
 directly the egos for the consumption that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.380
 have 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.020
 They carry a small diode to tell me that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.340
 They are running a capacitor 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.399
 of true and little more the deer here is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 they feed the 7 805 the 11 as a 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.440
 volt the steps to 5 volts for 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.200
 feed the brains the engines 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.270
 to the chain or element directly as 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.300
 you see here the plate ruined the 11 as 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.710
 one volt 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.770
 and in another one in another video or I'll put it 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.880
 in operation for you to see 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.830
 good 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.640
 may be the project in which 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.250
 mixed pieces 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.840
 It was built with 3d printer with 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.060
 plywood and all doing it from one 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.989
 compact shape 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.989
 as you see 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.959
 and I 'll get sensors 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.580
 I pointed it out in future videos 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.920
 I hope you like that you like me 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.160
 like to subscribe to my side and give the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.160
 line
