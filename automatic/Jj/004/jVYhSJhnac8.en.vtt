was actually my first career was

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.020 
was actually my first career was
building<00:00:08.610> racecars<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:10.219> there's<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.340> project

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
building racecars and there's a project

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.030 
building racecars and there's a project
that<00:00:12.450> many<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.780> us<00:00:12.900> want<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.200> do<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.650> kind<00:00:13.889> of

prototyping<00:00:16.949> CNC<00:00:17.609> Mills<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.869> very

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
prototyping CNC Mills but it's very

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.609 
prototyping CNC Mills but it's very
costly<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.770> get<00:00:20.100> these<00:00:20.279> precision<00:00:21.060> components

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
costly to get these precision components

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.290 
costly to get these precision components
so<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> want<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> show<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.160> how<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> did<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.029> rear

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
so I want to show you how I did a rear

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.140 
so I want to show you how I did a rear
suspension<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:25.980> my<00:00:26.160> race<00:00:26.400> cars<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
suspension on one of my race cars and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.250 
suspension on one of my race cars and
how<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.199> use<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.510> use<00:00:30.510> lower<00:00:30.869> cost

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
how we can use that to use lower cost

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
how we can use that to use lower cost
parts<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.790> high<00:00:33.030> precision<00:00:33.739> CNC<00:00:34.910> XYZ

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
parts to have high precision CNC XYZ

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
parts to have high precision CNC XYZ
tables<00:00:36.739> this<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> back<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> car<00:00:39.320> this

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
tables this is the back of the car this

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.010 
tables this is the back of the car this
is<00:00:40.530> where<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.980> rear<00:00:41.430> axle<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.390> so

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
is where that rear axle would be so

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.500 
is where that rear axle would be so
right<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> center<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.510> this

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
right in the center of this this

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.369 
right in the center of this this
assembly<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.469> rear<00:00:46.680> axle<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:49.350> wheel

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
assembly is the rear axle and the wheel

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.720 
assembly is the rear axle and the wheel
would<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.399> here

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
would be right in here

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.410 
would be right in here
like<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.730> I'm<00:00:53.820> showing<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.329> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
like this so what I'm showing here is a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.510 
like this so what I'm showing here is a
wats<00:00:54.750> link<00:00:55.199> suspension<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.250> this

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
wats link suspension and the way this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.099 
wats link suspension and the way this
works<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.800> there's<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.969> solid<00:01:00.359> frame<00:01:00.660> through

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
works is there's the solid frame through

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.500 
works is there's the solid frame through
here<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.620> there's<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> pivot<00:01:02.699> point<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.390> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
here and there's a pivot point that is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.899 
here and there's a pivot point that is
mounted<00:01:04.580> securely<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.650> frame<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.640> runs

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
mounted securely on the frame it runs

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
mounted securely on the frame it runs
forward<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.840> called<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.200> birdcage

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
forward to a thing called the birdcage

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.750 
forward to a thing called the birdcage
which<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> floating<00:01:13.130> bearing<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.369> floats

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
which is a floating bearing that floats

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.050 
which is a floating bearing that floats
around<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.390> axle<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.400> then<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:17.909> another

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
around the axle and then there's another

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
around the axle and then there's another
pivot<00:01:18.540> here<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.770> free<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.189> float

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
pivot here so it can be free to float

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.060 
pivot here so it can be free to float
and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> bottom<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.799> birdcage

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and then at the bottom of this birdcage

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.030 
and then at the bottom of this birdcage
assembly<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.060> floating<00:01:24.540> around<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.560> axle

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
assembly that's floating around the axle

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.690 
assembly that's floating around the axle
is<00:01:26.299> another<00:01:27.299> rod<00:01:28.110> assembly<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.950> runs<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
is another rod assembly that runs up and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
is another rod assembly that runs up and
securely<00:01:30.060> attaches<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.930> Frank<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.340> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
securely attaches to Frank so if you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.550 
securely attaches to Frank so if you
look<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.479> how<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.320> rear

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
look at this you can see how the rear

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.219 
look at this you can see how the rear
end<00:01:34.770> can't<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.280> forward<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:35.790> backwards<00:01:36.270> now

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
end can't go forward or backwards now

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.510 
end can't go forward or backwards now
there's<00:01:37.439> some<00:01:37.560> other<00:01:37.680> bars<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
there's some other bars in the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.130 
there's some other bars in the
suspension<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.750> into

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
suspension that I'm not going to go into

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800 
suspension that I'm not going to go into
right<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> focus<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.479> how

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
right now but I want to focus on how

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.550 
right now but I want to focus on how
this<00:01:43.229> birdcage<00:01:44.030> suspension<00:01:45.030> works<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.570> also

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
this birdcage suspension works I also

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560 
this birdcage suspension works I also
want<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.890> point<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.340> where<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.640> spring<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.180> in

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
want to point out where the spring is in

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.520 
want to point out where the spring is in
this<00:01:49.220> system<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:51.290> on<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:53.009> lower<00:01:54.170> control<00:01:55.170> arm

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
this system on on this lower control arm

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.200 
this system on on this lower control arm
I<00:01:55.799> would<00:01:56.759> weld<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.680> triangular<00:01:58.680> bar<00:01:59.119> called<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I would weld a triangular bar called the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.990 
I would weld a triangular bar called the
candle<00:02:00.630> leaver<00:02:00.810> bar<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.549> hook<00:02:02.759> on

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
candle leaver bar and this would hook on

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.700 
candle leaver bar and this would hook on
and<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.990> welded<00:02:04.350> solid<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.100> then

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
and be welded solid and then

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.260 
and be welded solid and then
there<00:02:05.799> would<00:02:05.890> be<00:02:05.920> a<00:02:06.040> coilover<00:02:06.580> spring<00:02:07.120> in

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
there would be a coilover spring in

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.980 
there would be a coilover spring in
shock<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:08.470> would<00:02:08.590> be<00:02:08.740> compressed<00:02:09.190> between

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
shock that would be compressed between

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.860 
shock that would be compressed between
the<00:02:10.990> frame<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:11.880> this<00:02:12.880> assembly<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.690> is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
the frame and this assembly this is

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.199 
the frame and this assembly this is
really<00:02:14.170> important<00:02:14.760> because<00:02:15.760> we're<00:02:16.060> going<00:02:16.090> to

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
really important because we're going to

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.030 
really important because we're going to
use<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.569> same<00:02:16.810> thing<00:02:17.110> when<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.319> do<00:02:17.530> our<00:02:17.560> CNC

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
use the same thing when we do our CNC

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.809 
use the same thing when we do our CNC
table<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.500> when<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> rear<00:02:20.860> end<00:02:21.069> goes<00:02:21.220> up<00:02:21.430> in

but<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.940> equivalent<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.420> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
but this is the equivalent to the the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.210 
but this is the equivalent to the the
racecar<00:03:12.410> chassis<00:03:12.920> suspension<00:03:13.150> so<00:03:14.150> in<00:03:14.480> here<00:03:14.960> is

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
racecar chassis suspension so in here is

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.210 
racecar chassis suspension so in here is
this<00:03:16.220> pivot<00:03:17.030> point<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.780> black<00:03:18.110> spot<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.710> up

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
this pivot point this black spot and up

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.960 
this pivot point this black spot and up
here<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.880> an<00:03:20.510> upper<00:03:20.840> linkage<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.310> equal

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
here is an upper linkage that is equal

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.450 
here is an upper linkage that is equal
to<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.720> distance<00:03:23.960> to<00:03:24.410> this<00:03:24.590> pivot<00:03:24.920> point<00:03:24.950> so

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
to the distance to this pivot point so

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.700 
to the distance to this pivot point so
you<00:03:25.550> can<00:03:25.700> see<00:03:26.000> there's<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.930> pivot<00:03:27.110> point<00:03:27.260> over

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
you can see there's a pivot point over

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.010 
you can see there's a pivot point over
here<00:03:28.130> there's<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.820> pivot<00:03:29.000> point<00:03:29.120> over<00:03:29.540> here<00:03:29.570> and

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
here there's a pivot point over here and

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.410 
here there's a pivot point over here and
I've<00:03:30.770> extended<00:03:31.220> this<00:03:31.810> lever<00:03:32.810> arm<00:03:33.230> out<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:35.120> that

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
I've extended this lever arm out so that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.960 
I've extended this lever arm out so that
we<00:03:35.570> can<00:03:35.600> have<00:03:35.930> mechanical<00:03:36.560> advantage<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.280> a

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
we can have mechanical advantage and a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.930 
we can have mechanical advantage and a
reduction<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:39.050> motion<00:03:39.740> so<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.430> big<00:03:40.730> motion

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
reduction in motion so a big motion

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.470 
reduction in motion so a big motion
makes<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.750> much<00:03:41.930> smaller<00:03:42.320> motion<00:03:42.800> over<00:03:43.100> here<00:03:43.480> so

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
makes a much smaller motion over here so

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.390 
makes a much smaller motion over here so
we<00:03:45.050> take<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.320> look<00:03:45.620> at<00:03:45.740> this<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.100> can<00:03:46.130> see<00:03:46.370> I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
we take a look at this you can see I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.160 
we take a look at this you can see I
described<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.210> marks<00:03:47.540> on<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:49.700> piece<00:03:49.970> of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
described the marks on this piece of

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.590 
described the marks on this piece of
board<00:03:51.170> of<00:03:51.440> where<00:03:52.130> these<00:03:52.400> arms<00:03:52.880> are<00:03:53.000> moving<00:03:53.390> up

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
board of where these arms are moving up

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.210 
board of where these arms are moving up
and<00:03:53.780> down<00:03:54.010> you<00:03:55.010> can<00:03:55.070> see<00:03:55.490> that<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:57.590> center<00:03:57.980> rod

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
and down you can see that the center rod

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.340 
and down you can see that the center rod
is<00:03:58.670> rotating<00:03:59.480> around<00:03:59.600> that<00:03:59.930> pivot<00:04:00.230> point

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
is rotating around that pivot point

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.860 
is rotating around that pivot point
again<00:04:01.250> I'm<00:04:01.400> just<00:04:01.580> using<00:04:01.760> duct<00:04:02.150> tape<00:04:02.240> here<00:04:02.660> so

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
again I'm just using duct tape here so

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.800 
again I'm just using duct tape here so
it's<00:04:03.020> not<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.800> moat<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.250> perfect<00:04:04.790> joints<00:04:05.660> in

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
it's not the moat the perfect joints in

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.560 
it's not the moat the perfect joints in
here<00:04:06.050> what<00:04:06.860> a<00:04:06.890> lot<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.160> people<00:04:07.340> at<00:04:07.850> home<00:04:08.210> try<00:04:08.510> to

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
here what a lot of people at home try to

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.410 
here what a lot of people at home try to
use<00:04:08.810> for<00:04:09.230> making<00:04:09.770> CNC<00:04:10.460> machines<00:04:10.910> or<00:04:11.180> there's

open-source but they use these threaded

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.670 
open-source but they use these threaded
rods<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:21.820> something<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:22.940> can<00:04:23.120> go<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.810> you

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
rods and something you can go to the you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.520

know home improvement store and pick up

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.320 
know home improvement store and pick up
it's<00:04:27.710> just<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:27.980> long<00:04:28.160> threaded<00:04:28.550> rod<00:04:28.850> and<00:04:29.240> then

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
it's just a long threaded rod and then

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.180 
it's just a long threaded rod and then
you<00:04:29.419> put<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.630> nut<00:04:29.870> on<00:04:29.900> it<00:04:30.080> but<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.800> can<00:04:30.950> see

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
you put a nut on it but you can see

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.040 
you put a nut on it but you can see
almost<00:04:31.700> anything<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.360> get<00:04:32.540> is<00:04:32.690> going<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.900> have

almost anything you get is going to have

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.520 
almost anything you get is going to have
a<00:04:33.080> lot<00:04:33.350> of<00:04:33.380> play<00:04:33.770> in<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.750> threads<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:36.020> know

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
a lot of play in the threads you know

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.080 
a lot of play in the threads you know
people<00:04:37.370> go<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.700> do<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.880> lot<00:04:38.150> of<00:04:38.180> effort<00:04:39.169> to<00:04:39.200> put

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
people go and do a lot of effort to put

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.580 
people go and do a lot of effort to put
opposing<00:04:41.090> nuts<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.750> put<00:04:41.960> pressure<00:04:42.320> between

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
opposing nuts and put pressure between

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.280 
opposing nuts and put pressure between
them<00:04:42.980> to<00:04:43.070> take<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.400> backlash<00:04:43.880> out<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:45.050> this

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
them to take the backlash out of this

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.420 
them to take the backlash out of this
this<00:04:46.220> assembly<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:48.320> what<00:04:48.500> I'm<00:04:48.620> proposing<00:04:49.010> is

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
this assembly so what I'm proposing is

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.150 
this assembly so what I'm proposing is
that<00:04:49.490> we<00:04:49.730> use<00:04:50.120> this<00:04:50.510> lever<00:04:51.380> arm<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:52.870> amplify

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
that we use this lever arm to amplify

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.490 
that we use this lever arm to amplify
the<00:04:55.160> motion<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:55.640> you<00:04:55.669> travel<00:04:56.210> perhaps<00:04:57.080> twice

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
the motion so you travel perhaps twice

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.700 
the motion so you travel perhaps twice
as<00:04:57.770> far<00:04:58.010> on<00:04:58.280> this<00:04:58.490> rod<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:59.060> move<00:04:59.360> the<00:05:00.140> distance

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
as far on this rod to move the distance

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.760 
as far on this rod to move the distance
of<00:05:00.919> one<00:05:01.490> out<00:05:01.970> on<00:05:02.600> your<00:05:02.630> workpiece

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
of one out on your workpiece

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.540 
of one out on your workpiece
and<00:05:04.810> by<00:05:05.810> doing<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.169> you<00:05:07.099> know<00:05:07.160> every<00:05:07.370> time

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
and by doing that you know every time

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.960 
and by doing that you know every time
you<00:05:07.729> double<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:09.620> ratio<00:05:10.099> you're<00:05:10.460> going<00:05:10.819> to

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
you double the the ratio you're going to

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.749 
you double the the ratio you're going to
have<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:12.500> slop<00:05:13.060> now<00:05:15.009> part<00:05:16.009> of<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.250> reason

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
have the slop now part of the reason

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.260 
have the slop now part of the reason
that<00:05:17.500> I'd<00:05:18.500> like<00:05:18.770> to<00:05:18.949> turn<00:05:19.160> things<00:05:19.430> into<00:05:19.729> rotary

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
that I'd like to turn things into rotary

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.300 
that I'd like to turn things into rotary
motion<00:05:20.780> instead<00:05:21.169> of<00:05:21.229> linear<00:05:21.710> motion<00:05:22.009> and

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
motion instead of linear motion and

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.570 
motion instead of linear motion and
using<00:05:22.669> cross<00:05:23.090> slides<00:05:23.569> and<00:05:24.259> these<00:05:25.160> really

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
using cross slides and these really

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.760 
using cross slides and these really
expensive<00:05:25.930> recirculating<00:05:26.930> ball<00:05:26.960> screws<00:05:27.530> is

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
expensive recirculating ball screws is

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.730 
expensive recirculating ball screws is
there's<00:05:28.759> a<00:05:29.120> lot<00:05:29.509> of<00:05:29.660> sources<00:05:30.110> for<00:05:30.319> precision

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
there's a lot of sources for precision

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.309 
there's a lot of sources for precision
bearings<00:05:31.430> things<00:05:32.030> like<00:05:32.210> VCRs<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:32.960> hard

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
bearings things like VCRs and hard

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.980 
bearings things like VCRs and hard
drives<00:05:33.620> have<00:05:34.099> bearings<00:05:34.699> that<00:05:34.849> are<00:05:35.150> you<00:05:35.930> know

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
drives have bearings that are you know

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.309 
drives have bearings that are you know
incredibly<00:05:36.860> incredibly<00:05:37.490> precise<00:05:38.000> you<00:05:38.990> know<00:05:39.050> I

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 
incredibly incredibly precise you know I

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.140 
incredibly incredibly precise you know I
mean<00:05:39.919> if<00:05:39.979> you've<00:05:40.130> ever<00:05:40.280> taken<00:05:40.460> apart<00:05:40.849> a<00:05:40.940> hard

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
mean if you've ever taken apart a hard

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.300 
mean if you've ever taken apart a hard
drive<00:05:41.389> you<00:05:41.569> can<00:05:41.720> see<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.229> there<00:05:42.860> is<00:05:42.889> very

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
drive you can see that there is very

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.460 
drive you can see that there is very
little<00:05:43.430> backlash<00:05:44.240> in<00:05:44.539> any<00:05:44.720> of<00:05:44.870> these<00:05:44.960> bearings

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
little backlash in any of these bearings

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.460 
little backlash in any of these bearings
or<00:05:45.889> in<00:05:46.130> a<00:05:46.250> VCR<00:05:46.819> the<00:05:47.060> head<00:05:47.270> on<00:05:47.419> it<00:05:47.539> is<00:05:47.659> extremely

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
or in a VCR the head on it is extremely

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.580 
or in a VCR the head on it is extremely
precise<00:05:48.889> so<00:05:49.190> we<00:05:49.310> can<00:05:49.460> harvest<00:05:50.180> these<00:05:50.690> these

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
precise so we can harvest these these

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.379 
precise so we can harvest these these
bearings<00:05:52.099> or<00:05:52.280> these<00:05:52.430> assemblies<00:05:53.000> and<00:05:53.150> use

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
bearings or these assemblies and use

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.450 
bearings or these assemblies and use
these<00:05:54.280> now<00:05:56.319> there's<00:05:57.319> one<00:05:57.470> other<00:05:57.500> concept<00:05:58.280> I'd

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
these now there's one other concept I'd

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.790 
these now there's one other concept I'd
like<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:58.909> throw<00:05:59.659> out<00:05:59.930> there<00:06:00.169> real<00:06:00.380> quick<00:06:00.590> while

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
like to throw out there real quick while

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.920 
like to throw out there real quick while
I'm<00:06:00.860> talking<00:06:01.130> about<00:06:01.190> CNC<00:06:01.849> machines<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:02.569> using

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
I'm talking about CNC machines and using

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.830 
I'm talking about CNC machines and using
precision<00:06:03.349> bearings<00:06:04.039> oh<00:06:04.750> here's<00:06:05.750> another

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
precision bearings oh here's another

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.659 
precision bearings oh here's another
assembly<00:06:06.620> I<00:06:06.650> thought<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:06.860> would<00:06:07.069> show<00:06:07.280> this<00:06:07.490> is

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
assembly I thought I would show this is

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.600 
assembly I thought I would show this is
called<00:06:07.880> a<00:06:07.940> heim<00:06:08.150> joint<00:06:08.509> this<00:06:09.320> is<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.530> rod<00:06:10.340> end

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
called a heim joint this is a rod end

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.339 
called a heim joint this is a rod end
bearing<00:06:11.120> and<00:06:11.270> this<00:06:11.419> is<00:06:11.539> what<00:06:11.659> I<00:06:11.690> would<00:06:11.930> use<00:06:12.139> on

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
bearing and this is what I would use on

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:13.959 
bearing and this is what I would use on
the<00:06:12.440> racecar<00:06:12.860> Tina<00:06:13.159> got<00:06:13.400> some<00:06:13.610> of<00:06:13.699> my<00:06:13.789> old

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:13.969 
the racecar Tina got some of my old

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.020 
the racecar Tina got some of my old
racecar<00:06:14.479> grease<00:06:14.780> on<00:06:14.990> it<00:06:15.159> but<00:06:16.159> this<00:06:16.550> is<00:06:16.610> another

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
racecar grease on it but this is another

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.390 
racecar grease on it but this is another
option<00:06:17.599> two<00:06:18.139> rotary<00:06:18.770> bearings<00:06:19.130> and<00:06:19.250> these

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
option two rotary bearings and these

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.850 
option two rotary bearings and these
actually<00:06:19.610> work<00:06:19.940> very<00:06:20.270> nice<00:06:20.509> because<00:06:20.960> they<00:06:21.199> are

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
actually work very nice because they are

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.700 
actually work very nice because they are
bearing<00:06:22.159> in<00:06:22.719> multiple<00:06:23.719> angles<00:06:24.139> so<00:06:24.409> you<00:06:24.440> don't

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
bearing in multiple angles so you don't

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.450 
bearing in multiple angles so you don't
have<00:06:24.949> to<00:06:25.130> have<00:06:25.280> as<00:06:25.460> precise<00:06:27.280> alignment<00:06:28.280> on

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
have to have as precise alignment on

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.920 
have to have as precise alignment on
them

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
them

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.129 
them
so<00:06:30.930> okay<00:06:31.289> now<00:06:32.000> we<00:06:33.000> have<00:06:33.180> a<00:06:33.330> lot<00:06:33.569> of<00:06:33.599> computing

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
so okay now we have a lot of computing

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.589 
so okay now we have a lot of computing
power<00:06:34.199> and<00:06:34.770> a<00:06:35.550> lot<00:06:35.729> of<00:06:35.759> smart<00:06:36.060> people<00:06:36.240> in<00:06:36.479> the

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
power and a lot of smart people in the

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:37.939 
power and a lot of smart people in the
chat<00:06:36.840> room<00:06:37.020> and<00:06:37.199> everywhere<00:06:37.560> else<00:06:37.620> and

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
chat room and everywhere else and

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.740 
chat room and everywhere else and
watching<00:06:38.250> these<00:06:38.340> videos<00:06:38.699> there's<00:06:39.479> another

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
watching these videos there's another

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.390 
watching these videos there's another
concept<00:06:40.349> we<00:06:40.919> can<00:06:41.039> do<00:06:41.220> we<00:06:41.580> can<00:06:41.610> have<00:06:42.080> instead<00:06:43.080> of

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
concept we can do we can have instead of

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.999 
concept we can do we can have instead of
using<00:06:44.400> all<00:06:44.639> of<00:06:44.699> this<00:06:45.349> linkage<00:06:46.349> in<00:06:46.560> here<00:06:46.860> and

might<00:07:06.599> be<00:07:06.780> a<00:07:06.900> little<00:07:07.110> bit<00:07:07.319> better<00:07:07.500> to<00:07:08.220> show<00:07:08.479> so

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
might be a little bit better to show so

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.029 
might be a little bit better to show so
we<00:07:11.130> have<00:07:11.220> a<00:07:11.250> precision<00:07:11.669> bearing<00:07:12.330> on<00:07:12.720> point<00:07:13.169> we

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 
we have a precision bearing on point we

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.730 
we have a precision bearing on point we
have<00:07:14.190> a<00:07:14.220> rod<00:07:14.630> that<00:07:15.630> gives<00:07:15.840> us<00:07:16.020> the<00:07:16.169> reduction

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
have a rod that gives us the reduction

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.360 
have a rod that gives us the reduction
we<00:07:17.610> have<00:07:17.819> our<00:07:18.090> threaded<00:07:19.080> rod<00:07:19.289> and<00:07:19.650> our<00:07:20.159> motor

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
we have our threaded rod and our motor

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.070 
we have our threaded rod and our motor
that's<00:07:20.759> pushing<00:07:21.030> this<00:07:21.270> thing<00:07:21.419> back<00:07:21.630> and<00:07:21.810> forth

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
that's pushing this thing back and forth

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.770 
that's pushing this thing back and forth
so<00:07:23.069> this<00:07:23.219> thing<00:07:23.400> describing<00:07:23.940> an<00:07:24.060> arc<00:07:24.270> back<00:07:24.539> and

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
so this thing describing an arc back and

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.969 
so this thing describing an arc back and
forth<00:07:24.990> now<00:07:25.830> we<00:07:25.889> could<00:07:26.159> have<00:07:26.370> on<00:07:26.639> top<00:07:26.879> of<00:07:27.090> this<00:07:27.300> a

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:27.979 
forth now we could have on top of this a

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:31.249 
forth now we could have on top of this a
platform<00:07:28.979> which<00:07:29.789> has<00:07:29.819> another<00:07:30.629> one<00:07:30.960> of<00:07:31.080> these

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259 
platform which has another one of these

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:33.529 
platform which has another one of these
rods<00:07:31.620> that's<00:07:32.159> driving<00:07:32.580> another<00:07:32.819> platform<00:07:33.150> and

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 
rods that's driving another platform and

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:37.100 
rods that's driving another platform and
the<00:07:33.599> other<00:07:33.810> axis<00:07:34.409> back<00:07:35.130> and<00:07:35.370> forth<00:07:35.900> we<00:07:36.900> can

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
the other axis back and forth we can

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.860 
the other axis back and forth we can
have<00:07:37.199> computer<00:07:37.710> control<00:07:38.419> correct<00:07:39.419> for<00:07:39.780> the

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
have computer control correct for the

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.460 
have computer control correct for the
arc<00:07:40.169> that<00:07:40.860> is

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:41.470 
arc that is

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.820 
arc that is
being<00:07:41.800> created<00:07:42.280> so<00:07:42.660> that<00:07:43.660> might<00:07:44.470> be<00:07:44.590> another

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:44.830 
being created so that might be another

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.550 
being created so that might be another
option<00:07:45.280> for<00:07:45.310> us
