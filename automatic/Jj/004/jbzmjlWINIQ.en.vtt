00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello in touch olga kokhanova and 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.179
 today we will learn to recruit 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.780
 additional 1 so in work happens 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.090
 often 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.330
 here are knitted and really it is not quite 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.359
 ready well see already more connected 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.699
 how much is all we have I really 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.350
 I see in 4 additions very thin nothing but 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.349
 you think that this is one thread here 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.560
 we need to make additional loops 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.930
 because I'm starting to knit now 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.410
 I had these loops on the neck 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.510
 recruited and here I am so knit knitting that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.980
 had to close the edge as well 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 sometimes it happens but we are not about 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.430
 mouth talking about an extra row 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.890
 so that it looks good to us 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.789
 need to type loops right here 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.570
 let's take a knitting needle and here 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.180
 us edge 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.850
 we need him to be neat 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.119
 see what part of the edge will be inside 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.390
 how knitting will go this way or that way u 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.939
 us right side over here 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.479
 traceable drawing clearly here he is 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:21.659
 lost and now we have a thread where a number of leads 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.659
 ended there lures to have stopped what 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.670
 we do we understand that the face should 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.930
 to be more beautiful 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.970
 so we are from the front 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.290
 we select but since here shock at first 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.729
 it is necessary to poke a seam in order not to be 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.729
 Kira's holes due to the collar 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.329
 and so on we recruit but 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.880
 at least in this case we are not 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.880
 see how many loops we had 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.759
 done and not trying to get into each 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.090
 specifically 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.880
 because the rows here were also shortened 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.000
 cashier collar we just dial 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.220
 loops so that knitting 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.860
 laid down beautifully it means that they are not 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.970
 should be too much and should not 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 be little yes here at this stage were 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.040
 I need to look right here 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.140
 no, here too, nothing is easy 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.350
 draw out loops just take 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.230
 we push the needle we catch the thread and 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.170
 pulling it out there will be no purl and 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.360
 front for a start but this one 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.900
 look here knitting went on with us 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.269
 the canvas goes naturally over here it 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.019
 canvas here and if possible 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.370
 ugly scar he will be from the inside 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.070
 everything will look outside now 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.700
 fall a little bit over here be smooth 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.980
 absolutely look our canvas 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.109
 when we get the loops we will 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.910
 assume that this is our typeset as 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.310
 as if he is the very first as if we have not 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.519
 there was another knitting and in the next row 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.859
 we will build a drawing here 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.410
 look here the knot turned out 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.780
 due to the shortened ranks it was I 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.690
 I think that you can eat it here 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.350
 so here is this whole bundle just inside 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.680
 remove the same now show again 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.190
 Iâ€™ll go through one more loop 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.120
 goes this side over here over this 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.620
 the lines from this place are a little bit down and 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.600
 here to level this one 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.540
 tubercle 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.639
 we had him just this loop i had we 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:42.850
 knit him down here a little bit 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:45.100
 and we therefore align so well here 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.139
 Further we look where it is more convenient for us to pick up 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.170
 loop but try extreme loops 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.350
 observe here they are extremely loop well 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.810
 visible they look not on the front side 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.200
 nina 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:02.739
 at night they look exactly to the side in 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:06.680
 butt and style here we are pushing them 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.680
 knitting needles pull out the thread and all we have 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.800
 it turns out we choose how much we need 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.019
 loops and keep working creating 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.910
 drawing as I said on this our 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.910
 lesson over thanks for your attention
