00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.020 
pisses me off when I'm trying to make
videos<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.799> video<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> looks<00:01:44.700> really

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
videos and a video kind of looks really

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.240 
videos and a video kind of looks really
muddy<00:01:45.299> compared<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> actual<00:01:46.320> PC<00:01:46.829> quality

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
muddy compared to the actual PC quality

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.969 
muddy compared to the actual PC quality
so<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.360> we're<00:01:48.840> actually<00:01:49.170> gonna<00:01:49.740> do

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
so right here we're actually gonna do

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.760 
so right here we're actually gonna do
these<00:01:50.159> blue<00:01:50.490> lasers<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.090> reverse<00:01:51.810> order<00:01:52.170> now<00:01:52.740> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
these blue lasers in reverse order now I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.980 
these blue lasers in reverse order now I
think<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> chance<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> mess

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
think you actually get a chance to mess

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
think you actually get a chance to mess
up<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.219> click<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
up right here because I click that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.789 
up right here because I click that
little<00:01:57.000> button<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.960> didn't<00:01:58.290> take<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
little button and it didn't take so I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.319 
little button and it didn't take so I
clicked<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.369> next<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> clicked<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
clicked one next to it and I clicked the

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.300 
clicked one next to it and I clicked the
other<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.229> actually<00:02:01.439> got<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
other one and I actually got it in the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.819 
other one and I actually got it in the
right<00:02:02.579> order<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.210> basically<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.500> to

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
right order so basically all you have to

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.200 
right order so basically all you have to
do<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.219> coming<00:02:05.579> through<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.850> solve<00:02:06.090> this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
do when coming through to solve this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.449 
do when coming through to solve this
Rubik's<00:02:06.450> Cube<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> reverse

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
Rubik's Cube is to do it in the reverse

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.449 
Rubik's Cube is to do it in the reverse
order<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.959> blue<00:02:10.229> lasers<00:02:10.770> shoot<00:02:11.069> at<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
order that the blue lasers shoot at and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.530 
order that the blue lasers shoot at and
that's<00:02:11.910> very

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
that's very

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.720 
that's very
simple<00:02:12.930> because<00:02:13.049> now<00:02:13.469> we're<00:02:14.040> not<00:02:14.280> only<00:02:14.519> able

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
simple because now we're not only able

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.880 
simple because now we're not only able
to<00:02:14.909> grab<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.719> tile<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.530> need<00:02:16.680> for

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
to grab that one tile that you need for

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.979 
to grab that one tile that you need for
