00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
know where this is sold but it was

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.210 
know where this is sold but it was
tagged<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.780> 99<00:01:28.140> cents<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.619> then<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.829> got<00:01:28.950> twenty

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220

percent<00:01:29.460> off<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:30.990> was

percent off of that so I think this was

percent off of that so I think this was
like<00:01:31.320> seventy-nine<00:01:31.829> cents<00:01:32.100> after<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.579> dream
