00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:14.490
 I can be who I want, not who 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.560
 You want me to be running corn 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.650
 forces to have a beer 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.859
 I'm not going to church, I'm more 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.109
 I hope you're with me even in 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.810
 poor things that were good 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.570
 today do not even make sense to find your 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.570
 way you have to be lost 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.120
 I'm still alone and I still think about 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 ball that day and will see who else 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.870
 flat flight 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.340
 You're not like the flowers that show each other. 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.340
 in the spring 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.000
 I want to see you here with me the feeling 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.000
 old 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 and you are not like the flowers that are 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.850
 show in the spring 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.199
 So here I want me feeling 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.199
 war 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:42.700
 I you, whom I want, not who you are. 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.819
 wants me to be in the corners of society 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.609
 rolls a lot of poetry to express 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:52.780
 I'll feel the sea air I do not have to 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:56.380
 to be accepted in the society of 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.620
 my city the raul without any 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.270
 freedom 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.250
 and you're not like the flowers you 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.250
 show in the spring 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.410
 I want you with me feeling at 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.180
 candle 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.650
 the ocean is like the flowers that turned out 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.650
 in the spring 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.040
 I want to see you here with me the feeling 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.040
 candle
