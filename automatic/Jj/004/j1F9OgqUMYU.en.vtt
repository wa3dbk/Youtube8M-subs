market<00:01:45.450> everything<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> was<00:01:46.560> white<00:01:46.829> was

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
market everything that was white was

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.120

think that that's the key factor is just

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.759 
think that that's the key factor is just
finding<00:03:17.180> what<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.420> love<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.780> do<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.410> I

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:36.979 
through all those numbers it's kind of

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.270 
through all those numbers it's kind of
weird<00:07:37.190> but<00:07:37.789> it's<00:07:38.510> just<00:07:38.660> really<00:07:38.960> don't<00:07:39.320> don't
