just<00:01:08.280> trying<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.939> make<00:01:09.119> sure<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:10.590> hardest

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

position of all jumping last in the team

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.550 
position of all jumping last in the team
when<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.640> team<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.240> leading<00:01:15.810> into<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
when your team are leading into the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.030 
when your team are leading into the
final<00:01:16.979> round<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.580> he<00:01:18.420> survives<00:01:19.020> by<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> skin

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
final round but he survives by the skin

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.030 
final round but he survives by the skin
of<00:01:20.220> his<00:01:20.490> teeth<00:01:20.549> from<00:01:21.479> 30<00:01:21.869> points<00:01:22.350> ahead<00:01:22.470> they

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
of his teeth from 30 points ahead they

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.800 
of his teeth from 30 points ahead they
end<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.490> five<00:01:24.060> points<00:01:24.479> ahead

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
end up just five points ahead
