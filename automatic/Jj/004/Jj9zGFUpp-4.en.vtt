having<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> same<00:00:25.859> problem<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.609> left

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.269 
having the same problem with that left
rear<00:00:27.359> tire<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:28.920> because<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
rear tire and we think it's because of

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.189 
rear tire and we think it's because of
some<00:00:29.580> debris<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> track<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.900> could<00:00:31.080> have

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
some debris on the track that could have

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.810 
some debris on the track that could have
been<00:00:31.289> caused<00:00:31.529> by<00:00:31.679> Mark<00:00:32.040> Webber's<00:00:32.430> collision

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
