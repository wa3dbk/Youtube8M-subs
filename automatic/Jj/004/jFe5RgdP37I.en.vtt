00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.309
 and so guys shorter maza as you can see 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.750
 I'm already dressed a little differently the whole thing in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.410
 the volume that I write down this here 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 addition to the third release nodule in 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 another day because as you remember yes 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.880
 we have an unsolved problem left 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.039
 did not open the safe and not three you 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.130
 some time to understand how all the same 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.219
 find him and then I realized one interesting 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.989
 I thing something which was wrong and I was wrong water 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.630
 when remember when it was final 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.860
 screensaver titles there showed such all 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.230
 but everything can change 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 remember the secret hidden north of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.160
 mills south of the creek and i first 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.789
 thought it was about the boxes about the very 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.440
 this box is that the secret is hidden here 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.110
 technical data is actually the same 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.190
 not north of the mill and not south of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.420
 brook here is wild brook here is where melissa and here 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 I did nâ€™t do things first I somehow mentally 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.350
 I somehow compared the middle for what 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.119
 I thought about the bag and then I thought so north 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580
 from the mill this here and by the way you 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.689
 north we have here russia class here on 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:23.970
 north is shorter north of the mill 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:27.180

 distinguish between past and present 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.900
 and also sees horrible creatures however 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.410
 this disorder has nothing 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.820
 common with schizophrenia danielle insane 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.320
 he needs treatment in 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.440
 specialized institution for 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.260
 mentally ill criminals 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.110
 the execution was carried out by gustav dolberg 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.610
 to his credit it was 4 executions in the past 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.380
 year he had to spend executed 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.210
 the infamous mind liza himself 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.530
 who was accused of killing four 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.419
 babies, be patient 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.210
 but we took our own lives 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.810
 execution of the sentence since then 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.700
 system significantly improve danielle 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.400
 svensen was calm throughout 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.200
 process despite being slightly shaken 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.240
 hands so typical phenomena for 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.030
 of criminals he was no different from 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.740
 ordinary young man yet he 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.160
 cried out loud when put his 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.169
 head 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.620
 but then quickly restored his 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:39.099
 composure brief prayer sharp 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.599
 powerful swing and it's all over 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.389
 lighting grenades reported last 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.750
 Daniel's words were not to be killed. 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.460
 myself 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.919
 then nothing would have happened at that 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.409
 while I write this letter to you already 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.749
 no longer alive but i'm not even born yet 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:01.039
 but we have a connection beyond the limits of life and 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:02.909
 death space and time 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.419
 the impossible was made possible by 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:09.839
 annual walk but watching always 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.179
 winning even though you're still 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.839
 didn't go through the gap they feel 

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:16.949
 need 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:20.729
 they need sacrifices as i wish 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.139
 so there was another way I'm sorry but for 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.289
 she still has hope 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.889
 you can save her you know what you 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.889
 should do
