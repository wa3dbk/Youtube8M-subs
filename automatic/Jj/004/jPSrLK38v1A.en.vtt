00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.869 

so<00:00:00.210> we're<00:00:00.750> going<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.159> pick<00:00:02.159> out<00:00:02.280> a<00:00:02.310> motherboard

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
so we're going to pick out a motherboard

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.370 
so we're going to pick out a motherboard
and<00:00:03.030> kind<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.240> look<00:00:03.389> at<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.570> specifications

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
and kind of look at the specifications

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.260 
and kind of look at the specifications
that<00:00:04.589> determine<00:00:05.490> how<00:00:05.640> good<00:00:05.700> one<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> board

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
that determine how good one on the board

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.169 
that determine how good one on the board
is<00:00:07.130> motherboard<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.250> basically<00:00:08.670> where<00:00:08.940> you

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
is motherboard is basically where you

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.970 
is motherboard is basically where you
plug<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.450> everything<00:00:09.990> every<00:00:10.290> component<00:00:10.650> that

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
plug in everything every component that

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.509 
plug in everything every component that
you<00:00:11.280> buy<00:00:11.490> separately<00:00:12.059> into<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:13.469> what<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.400> have

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
you buy separately into so what you have

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.010 
you buy separately into so what you have
to<00:00:14.610> remember<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> motherboard<00:00:15.420> there<00:00:15.870> are

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
to remember with a motherboard there are

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.200 
to remember with a motherboard there are
very<00:00:16.320> very<00:00:16.830> cheap<00:00:17.250> motherboards<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.000> may

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
very very cheap motherboards that may

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.099 
very very cheap motherboards that may
seem<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.570> good<00:00:18.869> deal<00:00:19.189> by<00:00:20.869> Japanese<00:00:21.869> or

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
seem like a good deal by Japanese or

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.519 
seem like a good deal by Japanese or
Taiwanese<00:00:22.320> startups<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:24.000> there<00:00:24.240> are

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
Taiwanese startups and then there are

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.439 
Taiwanese startups and then there are
really<00:00:25.529> good<00:00:25.859> well-known<00:00:26.369> ones<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:27.000> Abbott

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
really good well-known ones like Abbott

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.160 
really good well-known ones like Abbott
and<00:00:27.480> Asus<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:29.070> are<00:00:29.599> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> brand<00:00:30.929> name

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and Asus that are kind of brand name

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.870 
and Asus that are kind of brand name
that<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.560> want<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.949> kind<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.250> steer<00:00:32.460> towards

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that you want to kind of steer towards

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.750 
that you want to kind of steer towards
if<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.120> building<00:00:33.300> your<00:00:33.570> own<00:00:33.719> motherboard

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
if you're building your own motherboard

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.470 
if you're building your own motherboard
the<00:00:35.760> question<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.800> building<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.309> PC<00:00:39.180> itself

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the question is for building a PC itself

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.080 
the question is for building a PC itself
so<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.140> taking<00:00:40.770> out<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.489> equation

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
so this is taking out of the equation

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.440 
so this is taking out of the equation
Dell<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.840> HP<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.070> all<00:00:44.250> those<00:00:44.430> things<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.239> can

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
Dell and HP and all those things you can

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.760 
Dell and HP and all those things you can
use<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.690> components<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.320> inside<00:00:46.410> those

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
use the components that are inside those

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.290 
use the components that are inside those
computers<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.399> basically<00:00:48.149> you're

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
computers but basically you're

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.160 
computers but basically you're
essentially<00:00:48.629> you're<00:00:48.750> building<00:00:49.050> your

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
essentially you're building your

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
essentially you're building your
brand-new<00:00:49.980> computer<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> new

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
brand-new computer with a new

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.490 
brand-new computer with a new
motherboard<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.730> I'm<00:00:53.730> gonna<00:00:53.910> bring<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.110> this

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
motherboard so I'm gonna bring up this

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
motherboard so I'm gonna bring up this
motherboard<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> kind<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.730> give<00:00:56.879> you

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
motherboard here to kind of give you

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.060 
motherboard here to kind of give you
some<00:00:57.030> ideas<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.379> these<00:00:58.559> things<00:00:58.800> look

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
some ideas of what these things look

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760 
some ideas of what these things look
like<00:00:59.300> on<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.359> motherboard

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
like on a motherboard

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.670 
like on a motherboard
these<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.340> PCI<00:01:02.670> slots<00:01:03.000> those<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.719> standard

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
these are PCI slots those are standard

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.010 
these are PCI slots those are standard
kind<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.339> slots<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.820> expansion<00:01:06.420> that's<00:01:06.840> been

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
kind of slots for expansion that's been

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.140 
kind of slots for expansion that's been

dictates how many memory modules you can
put<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.280> also<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.180> type<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> motherboard

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
put in also the type of the motherboard

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.760 
put in also the type of the motherboard
depend<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.030> dictates<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.810> type<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> memory

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
depend of dictates what type of memory

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.800 
depend of dictates what type of memory
that<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.250> use<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.700> speed<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> operates

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
that you can use what speed it operates

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.350 
that you can use what speed it operates
at<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> low-end

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
at so if you get a low-end

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.889 
at so if you get a low-end
motherboard<00:01:49.500> it'll<00:01:49.829> only<00:01:49.920> allow<00:01:50.280> say<00:01:50.899> 667

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
motherboard it'll only allow say 667

AMD went to make sure it has the right
AMD<00:02:28.270> socket<00:02:28.840> socket<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.160> what<00:02:30.340> they<00:02:30.490> call<00:02:30.730> it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
AMD socket socket a is what they call it

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.180 
AMD socket socket a is what they call it
also<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.500> want<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.710> make<00:02:32.830> sure<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.040> has<00:02:33.160> the

also you want to make sure it has the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.010 
also you want to make sure it has the
right<00:02:33.310> onboard<00:02:33.640> connectors<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:34.810> well

right onboard connectors for you as well

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.650 
right onboard connectors for you as well
so<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.400> want<00:02:36.580> onboard<00:02:36.970> audio<00:02:37.120> instead<00:02:37.570> of

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
so if you want onboard audio instead of

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.240 
so if you want onboard audio instead of
by<00:02:37.780> an<00:02:37.930> audio<00:02:38.200> card<00:02:38.530> make<00:02:38.800> sure<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.070> has<00:02:39.220> that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
by an audio card make sure it has that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.000 
by an audio card make sure it has that
there<00:02:39.870> make<00:02:40.870> sure<00:02:40.900> if<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.410> want<00:02:41.590> onboard

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
there make sure if you want onboard

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.890 
there make sure if you want onboard
video<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.790> don't<00:02:42.940> really<00:02:43.060> care<00:02:43.150> about<00:02:43.390> 3d

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
video and you don't really care about 3d

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.810 
video and you don't really care about 3d
graphics<00:02:44.680> because<00:02:44.830> onboard<00:02:45.280> videos<00:02:45.580> not

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
graphics because onboard videos not

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.750 
graphics because onboard videos not
really<00:02:46.810> game<00:02:47.110> worthy<00:02:47.410> stuff<00:02:47.920> I'm<00:02:48.490> gonna<00:02:48.580> make

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
really game worthy stuff I'm gonna make

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.700 
really game worthy stuff I'm gonna make
sure<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.060> has<00:02:49.210> it<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.840> but<00:02:50.350> make<00:02:50.500> sure<00:02:50.530> it

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
sure it has it on here but make sure it

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.130 
sure it has it on here but make sure it
has<00:02:50.860> many<00:02:51.340> USB<00:02:51.730> ports<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.150> you've<00:02:52.300> one<00:02:52.570> on<00:02:52.840> here

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
has many USB ports as you've one on here

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.650 
has many USB ports as you've one on here
so<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:53.800> you<00:02:53.920> want<00:02:54.190> four<00:02:54.580> USB<00:02:54.910> ports<00:02:55.060> are<00:02:55.480> eight

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
so if you want four USB ports are eight

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.940 
so if you want four USB ports are eight
USB<00:02:56.140> ports<00:02:56.440> something<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:56.770> how<00:02:56.890> many

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
USB ports something on how many

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.390 
USB ports something on how many
expansion<00:02:58.380> how<00:02:59.380> much<00:02:59.530> expansion<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.070> intend

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
on doing in the future

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.970 
on doing in the future
you're<00:03:01.780> gonna<00:03:01.870> make<00:03:02.020> sure<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.410> has<00:03:02.590> it's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
you're gonna make sure it has it's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.490 
you're gonna make sure it has it's
capable<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.520> supporting<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:04.180> if<00:03:05.020> it<00:03:05.200> has<00:03:05.380> an
