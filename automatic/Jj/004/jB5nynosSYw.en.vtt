00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:14.490
 a lot of questions about live combat 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:20.060
 applied did not apply tried need not 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:23.970
 model do by virtue of my 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.340
 professional activities eastern 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.269
 martial arts yes of course something 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.809
 it turned out like there ahav knife know how 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.950
 keep a direct and reverse grip like 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.219
 how to own questions for all that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.820
 I think the knife fight specific knowledge 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:50.090
 and I think that not the best fashion went 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.399
 recently on a knife fight 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.340
 too much here these here in stabbing 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.340
 street and especially office Crimea here 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.090
 appeared both on the internet and on the street and in 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.350
 any gate every bunny game well 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:12.560
 let's somehow without it anyway 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:15.840
 doing knife fighting you learn to kill 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.900
 engaging against you cultivating yourself 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.710
 you do stretching you do you 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.070
 learn qatar it's beautiful it's interesting 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 and this somehow march warrior did not fly 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.799
 doing knife fights 98 instructors 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.820
 out of a hundred 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.890
 you are taught how to pierce a man and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.880
 pierce him so that he ask for 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.880
 expression closed his eyes 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 I do not think that this fashion is interesting and this 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.649
 fashion correctly knife you need to carry 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.670
 as a utilitarian tool for 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.170
 fulfillment 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.060
 daily tasks and do knife 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.580
 We are going to look for someone to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.189
 return to the side of it well, at least 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.429
 unworthy of the guys will go to 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.989
 take care of yourself take care of multiples 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.450
 go thai boxing 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:18.180
 leave the knife fight to specialists and 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.330
 terrorist units everyones 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.220
 special forces everything else 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.660
 if you touch the application philosophy by clicking 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.720
 the principle is probably my views too 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.280
 vary greatly with all clicking cheeks i 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:38.880
 against lethal use our mine 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.519
 opinion that if you never know you were squeezed 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.130
 google and it so happened that her husband get 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.519
 steam and you are here get your hands 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.690
 and apply when asked me 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:55.819
 advice what to do i always say friends 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.010
 go by way of maximum blood loss and 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.930
 minimal internal damage 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.579
 bodies 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.930
 if you have the opportunity to more 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:09.150
 times widely cut in order to 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.140
 weakened by blood loss adversary a cell 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.609
 you could help him you could 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:20.840
 call medics and pass it on 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:24.359
 it will be right what you start 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.620
 kill in the first scripture says not 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.150
 kill in the second excuse me but 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.220
 pulling out but you have to understand that 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.290
 anyway you got into 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.350
 grievous bodily 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:45.840
 cases of lethal injection prick 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:50.050
 and this is a completely different time frame 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:54.460
 so use need to war with 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.500
 corridors and not against the man knife 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.570
 it is an everyday tool all 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.570
 leave the rest to others
