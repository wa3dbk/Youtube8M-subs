00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
fairly encapsulate it and then at that

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.640 
fairly encapsulate it and then at that
point<00:03:49.330> in<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.840> process<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.320> this<00:03:50.530> is

this do you look at the game as a whole
and<00:03:59.740> balance<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.130> system<00:04:00.610> out<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.090> then<00:04:01.210> the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
and balance the system out and then the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.610 
and balance the system out and then the
characters<00:04:01.840> kind<00:04:02.020> of<00:04:02.080> fall<00:04:02.260> into<00:04:02.530> these

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
characters kind of fall into these

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.720 
characters kind of fall into these
predetermined<00:04:03.190> shades<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.520> take<00:04:03.640> the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
predetermined shades you take the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.910 
predetermined shades you take the
opposite<00:04:04.090> tack<00:04:04.270> which<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.320> balance<00:04:05.560> the

way<00:04:06.550> that<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.790> characters<00:04:07.120> themselves

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
way that the characters themselves

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.700 
way that the characters themselves
behaving<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:07.960> the<00:04:08.050> game<00:04:08.170> system<00:04:08.470> sort<00:04:08.620> of

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
behaving in the game system sort of

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.690 
behaving in the game system sort of
takes<00:04:08.860> shape<00:04:09.010> that<00:04:09.220> way<00:04:09.310> so<00:04:09.370> there's<00:04:09.610> two

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
takes shape that way so there's two

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.220 
takes shape that way so there's two
different<00:04:09.850> schools<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.660> thought<00:04:10.720> on<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.050> and

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
different schools of thought on that and
