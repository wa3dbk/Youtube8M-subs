you

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:06.760 
you

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.049 
you
alright<00:00:07.760> so<00:00:08.059> it's<00:00:08.420> a<00:00:08.980> set<00:00:09.980> giant<00:00:10.370> robotic<00:00:10.700> arm

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
alright so it's a set giant robotic arm

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.830 
alright so it's a set giant robotic arm
it's<00:00:11.510> got<00:00:11.750> a<00:00:11.780> 3<00:00:12.440> steppers<00:00:13.010> in<00:00:13.160> it<00:00:13.280> that<00:00:14.000> control

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
it's got a 3 steppers in it that control

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.960 
it's got a 3 steppers in it that control
the<00:00:15.099> bx<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:17.240> why<00:00:17.480> and<00:00:17.840> the<00:00:17.930> z<00:00:18.529> axis<00:00:18.670> so<00:00:19.670> it<00:00:19.820> goes

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
the bx the why and the z axis so it goes

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.290 
the bx the why and the z axis so it goes
up<00:00:20.300> it<00:00:20.779> goes<00:00:20.810> out<00:00:21.230> and<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:22.160> the<00:00:22.550> claw<00:00:22.789> goes<00:00:23.060> in

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
up it goes out and the the claw goes in

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.599 
up it goes out and the the claw goes in
and<00:00:23.510> out<00:00:23.570> one<00:00:24.470> of<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:25.070> developers

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
and out one of the the developers

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.540 
and out one of the the developers
upstairs<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:26.390> RD<00:00:26.750> came<00:00:27.410> up<00:00:27.529> with<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:27.710> Bluetooth

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
upstairs and RD came up with a Bluetooth

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.460 
upstairs and RD came up with a Bluetooth
stack<00:00:28.850> that<00:00:29.150> interface<00:00:29.570> to<00:00:29.779> the<00:00:29.810> wiimote<00:00:30.230> and

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
stack that interface to the wiimote and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.900 
stack that interface to the wiimote and
turn<00:00:30.800> it<00:00:30.920> into<00:00:31.039> a<00:00:31.160> bunch<00:00:31.369> of<00:00:31.490> really<00:00:31.670> nice

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
turn it into a bunch of really nice

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.660 
turn it into a bunch of really nice
neatly<00:00:32.360> written<00:00:32.629> vis<00:00:33.110> so<00:00:33.980> from<00:00:34.220> there<00:00:34.400> I<00:00:34.430> was

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
neatly written vis so from there I was

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.460 
neatly written vis so from there I was
able<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.970> integrate<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.809> wiimote<00:00:36.290> into

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
able to integrate the wiimote into

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.979 
able to integrate the wiimote into
labview<00:00:37.220> and<00:00:37.430> from<00:00:37.790> there<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:38.269> was<00:00:38.690> able<00:00:38.840> to

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
labview and from there I was able to

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.110 
labview and from there I was able to
control<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:39.649> robotic<00:00:40.219> arm<00:00:40.340> with<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.700> wiimote

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
control the robotic arm with the wiimote

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.830 
control the robotic arm with the wiimote
this<00:00:41.960> VI<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:42.590> wrote<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.940> controls<00:00:44.690> the

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
this VI that I wrote it controls the

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.860 
this VI that I wrote it controls the
stepper<00:00:45.559> motors<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.129> velocity<00:00:46.610> mode<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.059> it

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
stepper motors and velocity mode and it

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.840 
stepper motors and velocity mode and it
takes<00:00:48.110> inputs<00:00:48.710> from<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.980> wiimotes<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:49.550> if<00:00:49.700> I

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
takes inputs from the wiimotes so if I

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.049 
takes inputs from the wiimotes so if I
pressed<00:00:50.450> up<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.710> arm<00:00:51.920> goes<00:00:52.129> up<00:00:52.160> if<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:52.820> press

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
pressed up the arm goes up if I press

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.869 
pressed up the arm goes up if I press
left<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.899> arm<00:00:54.050> goes<00:00:54.260> left<00:00:54.620> but<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.460> beauty<00:00:55.789> of

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
left the arm goes left but the beauty of

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.000 
left the arm goes left but the beauty of
LabVIEW<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.539> parallel<00:00:56.960> ISM<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.530> the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
LabVIEW and the parallel ISM of the the

LabVIEW and the parallel ISM of the the
control<00:00:58.340> loops<00:00:58.550> is<00:00:58.730> that<00:00:58.879> if<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.059> want<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.270> go<00:00:59.390> up

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
control loops is that if I want to go up

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.080 
control loops is that if I want to go up
and<00:00:59.750> left<00:01:00.219> that's<00:01:01.219> pretty<00:01:01.520> easy<00:01:01.579> too<00:01:01.940> i<00:01:01.969> just

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
and left that's pretty easy too i just

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.869 
and left that's pretty easy too i just
press<00:01:02.360> up<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.809> left<00:01:03.110> on<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.500> control<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:04.610> as<00:01:04.640> a

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
press up and left on the control so as a

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.510 
press up and left on the control so as a

little side project I pick the pick the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.480 
little side project I pick the pick the
arm<00:01:07.850> up<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.680> started<00:01:09.680> interfacing<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.369> with

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
arm up and started interfacing it with

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.660 
arm up and started interfacing it with
our<00:01:10.610> new<00:01:10.790> hardware<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:11.780> now<00:01:12.200> I'm<00:01:12.500> driving<00:01:13.189> the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
our new hardware so now I'm driving the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.700 
our new hardware so now I'm driving the
stepper<00:01:14.119> motors<00:01:14.540> with<00:01:14.840> one<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.140> our<00:01:15.260> stepper

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
stepper motors with one of our stepper

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.440 
stepper motors with one of our stepper
motor<00:01:15.950> drives<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.729> using<00:01:17.119> one<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.299> our

stepper motor controllers the PCI 73 54

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.160 
stepper motor controllers the PCI 73 54
to<00:01:22.130> control<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.210> stepper<00:01:23.420> motors<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.020> then

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
to control the stepper motors and then

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.710 
to control the stepper motors and then
i'm<00:01:24.259> using<00:01:24.380> LabVIEW<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.189> to<00:01:26.090> control<00:01:26.600> the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
i'm using LabVIEW to to control the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.020 
i'm using LabVIEW to to control the
interface<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:28.130> wiimote<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.850> what

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
interface and the wiimote is what

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.749 
interface and the wiimote is what
actually<00:01:29.799> provides<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:31.009> control<00:01:31.369> the

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
actually provides the control the

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.030 
actually provides the control the
robotic<00:01:32.330> arm<00:01:32.479> was<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.810> side<00:01:33.110> project<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.830> picked

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
robotic arm was a side project I picked

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.819 
robotic arm was a side project I picked
up<00:01:34.189> about<00:01:34.460> two<00:01:34.729> months<00:01:34.880> ago<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:36.170> took<00:01:36.350> me<00:01:36.500> a

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
up about two months ago and it took me a

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.789 
up about two months ago and it took me a
Friday<00:01:37.670> afternoon<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:38.840> get<00:01:39.049> it<00:01:39.200> up<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.439> going

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
Friday afternoon to get it up and going

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.319 
Friday afternoon to get it up and going
with<00:01:40.009> LabVIEW<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.610> just<00:01:40.759> telling<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.180> go

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
with LabVIEW and just telling it to go

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.319 
with LabVIEW and just telling it to go
to<00:01:41.390> program<00:01:41.869> positions<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.880> then<00:01:43.880> later<00:01:44.090> on<00:01:44.210> I

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
to program positions and then later on I

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.690 
to program positions and then later on I
decided<00:01:44.780> I'd<00:01:44.960> turn<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.320> into<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.619> demo<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:46.220> a

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
decided I'd turn it into a demo and a

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.550 
decided I'd turn it into a demo and a
couple<00:01:46.909> of<00:01:47.090> hours<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.600> all<00:01:47.720> I've<00:01:47.900> spent<00:01:48.170> on<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
couple of hours is all I've spent on the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.190 
couple of hours is all I've spent on the
the<00:01:48.920> wiimote<00:01:49.250> part<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.360> wiimote<00:01:50.869> V<00:01:51.079> is

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
the wiimote part of it the wiimote V is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.929 
the wiimote part of it the wiimote V is
that<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.799> developer<00:01:52.369> made<00:01:52.549> those<00:01:52.820> are
