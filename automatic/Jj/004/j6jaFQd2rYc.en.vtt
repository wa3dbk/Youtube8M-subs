for<00:01:10.380> iOS<00:01:10.560> 8.4<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:12.330> actually<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.409> back<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
for iOS 8.4 and then actually go back to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.630 
for iOS 8.4 and then actually go back to
iOS<00:01:14.040> 8.3<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:16.439> might<00:01:16.650> won't<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.220> able<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
iOS 8.3 you might won't be able to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.399 
iOS 8.3 you might won't be able to
restore<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.960> an<00:01:19.080> older

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
restore it because it's an older

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560 
restore it because it's an older
firmware<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.340> Apple<00:01:20.640> does<00:01:20.790> let<00:01:21.060> I'm

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
firmware and Apple does let I'm

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.260 
firmware and Apple does let I'm
restoring<00:01:21.900> back<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.670> fingers<00:01:24.060> so

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
restoring back up on all the fingers so

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
restoring back up on all the fingers so
that's<00:01:24.509> why<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> did<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.340> backup

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
that's why I did not do it the backup

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.200 
that's why I did not do it the backup
listener<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.930> necessary<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.210> after

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
listener is necessary to do it so after

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:40.149 
listener is necessary to do it so after
that<00:01:32.299> go<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.600> these<00:01:33.900> websites<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:38.159> here
