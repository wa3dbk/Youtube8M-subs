00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.140
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.970
 youtube friends we play today 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.629
 again borderlands 2 for the playstation 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.910
 3 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.040
 And it is today about the backpack 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.899
 lynch then I wanted to show you 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.309
 because I would often look for it 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.750
 addressed and he always has it 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.579
 It was called such a big thing 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.890
 pressure says that's for sure 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.930
 shit or is not character or 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.720
 sunny and what is not a courage character 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.059
 just normal trick what actually 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.670
 logically, that's what I'm going to do to you now 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:08.830
 show here moment sees my backpack 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:14.830
 so from 521 to 27 I would be with you 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:16.720
 us then 27 27 practical and I am 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.810
 also full I can not pick up 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.360
 I have four demonstratively here 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.710
 were thrown out 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.640
 as you can see, I can no longer 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.560
 forever they only know exchange but that 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.990
 We do not want to if no exchanges 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.250
 good weapons against good week from the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.560
 We sure do not want that to make sense 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.319
 and purpose what you will show now 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.300
 definitely 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:44.349
 you can work on any automat 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.520
 the trick is to have the four weapons where 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:50.050
 you have to sell you have to sell 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.520
 it will be done now as I said 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.520
 At each automat is the choice here 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:02:01.599
 problem is if you are with one 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.940
 backpack takes a few short 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:07.420
 seconds mission could scroll down 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.759
 it takes the higher backpack is all the more 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.750
 takes longer 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.390
 as you can see i am coming in right now 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:19.500
 not down but it works the same 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.500
 Just wait a minute and then it works 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.439
 and also a tick longer 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.380
 so now we are working 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.380
 completely down 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.670
 Of course it takes a bit because 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.670
 I also have a lot 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.790
 here are the artifacts 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:59.910
 klaas knot grenades mod signs and her 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.710
 down here are the four weapons 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.600
 these are the four weapons with one 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.640
 tick off where I'm handy 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.520
 the tumor is now equipped here 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:20.940
 sell and then on top l1 again 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:23.730
 repurchase guns like you see 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.800
 the weapons are all gone whoever said them 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.800
 The weapons are in return in the backpack 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.270
 Now you can practically arm again 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.970
 cancel 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.010
 four pieces fast same works 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.780
 Also with glass must or grenades or 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.780
 nice that way 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:57.760
 Notice the same thing we do 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.650
 sell here and that's practically it 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.000
 Trick on the whole we can 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.010
 drive endlessly 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.400
 He always knows how to pick up weapons 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.300
 Sell was on sale and that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.270
 then lands in the backpack every time 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:17.890
 It may show a little bit again here 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:21.370
 I also run rare rockets for hours 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:25.920
 used for how it had that 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:33.880
 finally the rocket launcher of the 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:38.410
 Master goes from tlc to small 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:42.120
 showing effect hangs on must 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.120
 you again just out and back in and 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.780
 again waiting for you, too 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.180
 already happened that the indication of the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.180
 but spins well 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.939
 this one not so wild 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.880
 right away it would have to work that me 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.880
 can down 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.169
 Now I can go down again 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.969
 As I said the story we can 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.509
 I have unlimited faith 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:43.490
 character with 700 backpack places 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.770
 that's my main character that's too 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.879
 a form a main character of the whole 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.379
 say but I play main lines limit 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:57.020
 euro here I do the again 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:06:01.960
 weapon-sell then buy back again 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:06.400
 you see in the bottom right in the backpack 500 25 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:10.400
 26 27 28 29 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.930
 All weapons are back in the backpack and 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.289
 You can do it all over again 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.289
 float 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:21.710
 this trick does not work 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:22.669
 with skins picking up your child though skins 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.339
 And sell 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.469
 then it could pick up like the kid and 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:31.659
 why sell 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:35.240
 but you are not allowed to have too many skins in it 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:37.490
 visum testify in the automate because 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.569
 The things remain at which in the automat 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:42.770
 and then they disappear 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:44.509
 I believe from 24 or 36 articles in the 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:49.520
 automat then they disappear if you 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:53.930
 more than one makes one where 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.310
 character has with 600 700 it goes skins 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.069
 unfortunately not like that 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:03.050
 this is only about automatic not automatic 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:06.080
 pain shit that works on the pc so 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:10.009
 had a character with lots of skins 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.779
 which works on the pc and it is 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:15.520
 actually a not a character 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:17.960
 Worker character with skins handy 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:23.120
 so that's about it already from 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:25.759
 I'll say a little tutorial 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:28.839
 next time your kids and 83 and 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.839
 thanks for turning on
