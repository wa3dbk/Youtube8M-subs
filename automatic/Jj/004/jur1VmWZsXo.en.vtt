signs<00:03:27.720> join<00:03:28.380> signs<00:03:28.710> now<00:03:29.010> we'll<00:03:29.220> update

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
signs join signs now we'll update

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.670 
signs join signs now we'll update
correctly<00:03:30.180> they<00:03:30.660> will<00:03:30.810> save<00:03:31.050> correctly<00:03:31.560> in

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
correctly they will save correctly in

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.950 
correctly they will save correctly in
their<00:03:31.800> science<00:03:32.190> config<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:32.910> they<00:03:33.810> will

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
their science config and they will

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.470 
their science config and they will
display<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.440> proper<00:03:34.740> information<00:03:35.480> before

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
display the proper information before

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.680 
display the proper information before
they<00:03:37.080> only<00:03:37.890> worked<00:03:38.400> when<00:03:38.670> they<00:03:38.820> were<00:03:38.880> used<00:03:39.360> if

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
they only worked when they were used if

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.690 
they only worked when they were used if
they<00:03:40.380> weren't<00:03:40.620> used<00:03:40.950> they<00:03:41.160> wouldn't<00:03:41.460> spawn

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
they weren't used they wouldn't spawn

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.010 
they weren't used they wouldn't spawn
they<00:03:41.910> wouldn't<00:03:42.150> display<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.870> correct

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
they wouldn't display the correct

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.920 
they wouldn't display the correct
information<00:03:43.400> or<00:03:44.400> that<00:03:44.760> stuff<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.480> I've<00:03:45.720> gone

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
information or that stuff so I've gone

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.350 
information or that stuff so I've gone
and<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.380> fixed<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:46.920> they<00:03:47.160> now<00:03:47.280> save<00:03:47.580> they<00:03:48.240> had

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
and I fixed that they now save they had

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.460 
and I fixed that they now save they had
split<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.780> correct<00:03:48.990> information<00:03:49.170> I've

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
split the correct information I've

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.610 
split the correct information I've
actually<00:03:49.590> changed<00:03:49.890> him<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.160> bit<00:03:50.340> but<00:03:51.620> that's

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
actually changed him a bit but that's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.110 
actually changed him a bit but that's
about<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:54.380> as<00:03:55.380> far<00:03:55.530> as<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.800> guns<00:03:56.010> go<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.520> have

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
about it as far as the guns go I have

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.030 
about it as far as the guns go I have
finally<00:03:57.660> added<00:03:59.270> full-on<00:04:00.380> firing<00:04:01.380> rates<00:04:01.590> for

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
finally added full-on firing rates for

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.810 
finally added full-on firing rates for
the<00:04:02.130> guns<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:03.060> should<00:04:03.240> see<00:04:03.450> here<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.780> second

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
the guns you should see here in a second

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.630 
the guns you should see here in a second
what<00:04:05.820> actually<00:04:06.090> looks<00:04:06.330> like<00:04:06.570> but<00:04:06.930> um<00:04:07.370> guns<00:04:08.370> now

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
what actually looks like but um guns now

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.870 
what actually looks like but um guns now
have<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.880> firing<00:04:09.240> rate<00:04:09.510> they<00:04:10.580> vary<00:04:11.580> from<00:04:11.700> each

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
have a firing rate they vary from each

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.550 
have a firing rate they vary from each
gun<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:12.540> customize<00:04:13.020> them<00:04:13.230> in<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
gun so you can customize them in the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.340 
gun so you can customize them in the
config<00:04:13.980> just<00:04:14.220> like<00:04:14.340> any<00:04:14.490> other<00:04:14.670> gun<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.350> it's

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
config just like any other gun and it's

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.140 
config just like any other gun and it's
bringing<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.980> guns<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.340> much<00:04:17.520> closer<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.880> be

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
bringing the guns that much closer to be

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.090 
bringing the guns that much closer to be
able<00:04:18.210> full<00:04:18.540> customizable<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.650> fully

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
able full customizable and fully

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.950 
able full customizable and fully
different<00:04:20.549> there<00:04:21.090> are<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.330> many<00:04:21.419> shieff<00:04:21.780> right

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
different there are so many shieff right

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.860 
different there are so many shieff right
here<00:04:22.230> this<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:23.010> me<00:04:23.220> holding<00:04:24.120> down<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.720> right

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
here this is me holding down the right

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.780 
here this is me holding down the right
right<00:04:25.530> mouse<00:04:25.710> button

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
right mouse button

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.400 
right mouse button
for<00:04:27.180> those<00:04:27.300> three<00:04:27.420> shots<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.900> see<00:04:28.050> all<00:04:28.170> I<00:04:28.200> got

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
for those three shots you see all I got

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.140 
for those three shots you see all I got
three<00:04:28.440> off<00:04:28.800> before<00:04:29.370> I've<00:04:29.460> gotten<00:04:29.730> like<00:04:29.850> seven

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
three off before I've gotten like seven

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.290 
three off before I've gotten like seven
or<00:04:30.210> eight<00:04:30.350> but<00:04:31.640> so<00:04:32.640> the<00:04:32.760> guns<00:04:32.940> are<00:04:33.030> now<00:04:33.150> more

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
or eight but so the guns are now more

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.240 
or eight but so the guns are now more
balanced<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.840> bit<00:04:33.990> and<00:04:34.230> they<00:04:34.560> are<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.830> that<00:04:35.070> much

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
balanced a bit and they are it that much

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.430 
balanced a bit and they are it that much
more<00:04:35.430> unique<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:38.270> besides<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.420> guns<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.990> have

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
more unique and besides the guns I have

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.340 
more unique and besides the guns I have
also<00:04:40.740> done<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:41.010> lot<00:04:41.160> of<00:04:41.700> coding<00:04:42.180> kind<00:04:42.900> of<00:04:42.990> behind

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
also done a lot of coding kind of behind

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.400 
also done a lot of coding kind of behind
the<00:04:43.440> scenes<00:04:43.830> stuff<00:04:44.900> where<00:04:45.900> I've<00:04:46.110> kind<00:04:46.380> of

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
the scenes stuff where I've kind of

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.880 
the scenes stuff where I've kind of
reformatted<00:04:47.010> everything<00:04:47.430> redid<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.090> so<00:04:48.990> from

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
reformatted everything redid it so from

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.930 
reformatted everything redid it so from
a<00:04:50.010> playing<00:04:50.220> standpoint<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.700> might<00:04:50.850> not

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
a playing standpoint you might not

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.550 
a playing standpoint you might not
notice<00:04:51.120> too<00:04:51.330> much<00:04:51.510> but<00:04:52.140> from<00:04:52.290> a<00:04:52.380> coding

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
notice too much but from a coding

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.060 
notice too much but from a coding
standpoint<00:04:52.890> it's<00:04:53.100> much<00:04:53.280> much<00:04:53.460> better

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
standpoint it's much much better

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.490 
standpoint it's much much better
and<00:04:56.070> speaking<00:04:56.460> of<00:04:56.520> coding<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.990> whole<00:04:58.170> thing

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
and speaking of coding the whole thing

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.180 
and speaking of coding the whole thing
is<00:04:58.650> open-source

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190
