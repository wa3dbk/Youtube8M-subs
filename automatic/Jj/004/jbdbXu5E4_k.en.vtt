00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.620 
capture the roads but the thing about a
rose<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.040> some<00:01:44.310> real<00:01:44.490> instrument<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
rose is some real instrument and the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.480 
rose is some real instrument and the
thing<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:45.990> always<00:01:46.200> great<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> real

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
thing that's always great about a real

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.190 
thing that's always great about a real
instrument<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.180> every<00:01:48.570> note<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.990> not

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
instrument is that every note is not

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.289 
instrument is that every note is not
uniform<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.729> some<00:01:50.939> notes<00:01:51.119> are<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
uniform right this some notes are a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.850 
uniform right this some notes are a
little<00:01:51.329> bit<00:01:51.570> more<00:01:51.600> dead<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.439> those<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> are

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
little bit more dead so those that are

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
little bit more dead so those that are
bright<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.369> ring<00:01:53.640> some<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.390> those<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.540> little

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
bright they ring some of those a little

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.630 
bright they ring some of those a little
flat<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.320> know<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.399> gives<00:01:56.549> an

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
flat you know that's what gives an

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.920 
flat you know that's what gives an
instrument<00:01:57.060> character<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.689> gives<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
instrument character that's what gives a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
instrument character that's what gives a
saxophonist<00:01:58.469> character<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.340> every<00:02:00.000> note

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
saxophonist character is that every note

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
saxophonist character is that every note
is<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> different<00:02:00.960> thing<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> synthesizer

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
is a different thing on the synthesizer

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.889 
is a different thing on the synthesizer
every<00:02:02.880> note<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.149> basically<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.689> same<00:02:03.840> thing

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
every note is basically the same thing

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.680 
every note is basically the same thing
it<00:02:04.290> doesn't<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.799> same

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
it doesn't have the same

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.970 
it doesn't have the same
and<00:02:06.080> it's<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.230> same<00:02:06.410> thing<00:02:06.590> with<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.800> road

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
and it's the same thing with the road

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.320 
and it's the same thing with the road
when<00:02:07.220> you're<00:02:07.370> sitting<00:02:07.640> there<00:02:07.670> at<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> roads

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330

first of all each one sounds different
every<00:02:11.060> rose<00:02:11.270> has<00:02:11.300> its<00:02:11.540> own<00:02:11.780> character<00:02:12.200> they're

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
every rose has its own character they're

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.500 
every rose has its own character they're
guys<00:02:12.590> who<00:02:12.890> insist<00:02:13.550> on<00:02:13.730> creating<00:02:14.150> their<00:02:14.300> own

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
guys who insist on creating their own
