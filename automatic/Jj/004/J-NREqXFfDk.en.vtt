00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.050
 and 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.259
 good today we're going to prepare a stew of 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.910
 pork rib with potatoes and you'll see 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:21.180
 which is a very easy stew to make 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.489
 that apart is even more good from a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.169
 overnight or whether we can do 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.969
 and the next day it will still be better 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.029
 because it will have settled all the 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:32.899
 flavors and we eat a lot and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.230
 of people to do it we're going to need 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.140
 pork rib after potatoes you can 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.789
 do calculations are pretty much 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:47.249
 four pieces of meat per person and 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.649
 about two medium potatoes per person 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:54.589
 also think it's worth dish 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:59.609
 only dish after two medium tomatoes 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:01.620
 scratched and unnatural or you can if 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.269
 you want you can have the tomato ejected 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.960
 entitled natural then 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.320
 6 tablespoons or so after an onion 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.200
 median 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.850
 salt oil a little half a glass more 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.630
 or less white wine with garlic and parsley 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.550
 and then water came to make the stew 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 and a little flour to flour 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:37.850
 the ribs in the first place 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.850
 we will start putting to be to our 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 ribs 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.909
 we have put oil all that would be the 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.340
 bottom of the pot and now while good 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.799
 when it's hot when we go 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.799
 adding the ribs 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.960
 let's go on claiming that we can go 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.700
 putting the ribs 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.220
 above all we are interested we put the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.190
 flour so that it is sealed if we want 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.090
 we could do it without the flour but 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.090
 Well, you're better 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.050
 we are going to leave them until they are 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.420
 golden when we see what we do 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.250
 to go leaving nothing the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 we will take out and we will reserve them 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.260
 when I have removed the meat we are going to 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.260
 Add 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.680
 with the onion 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.610
 we put a little salt now that 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.450
 we have a little bit of diet you 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.410
 we add the tomato 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.069
 and we continue to suffer 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.239
 we will also put you 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.239
 a little salt 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.390
 and so we'll let it go 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.390
 browning 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.230
 while 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:32.450
 While they are fried , we go to 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.630
 go sharing what potatoes are 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.090
 We are interested potatoes not break 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.680
 cut the ones before to break them 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.400
 what we are going to do is we nail him the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.870
 knife and we make a doll game and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.560
 not between that aggression that we have left 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.030
 irregularly rotated because like this and not 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.310
 cut them normal that would be more 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.910
 nice because in this way loose more 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.680
 the starch and we are interested in letting go 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.800
 enough of the drum so that if the sauce 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.350
 we got more thick 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.770
 we nail the doll game knife and 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.880
 breaks 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.880
 and we will salt them 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:21.769
 we have the sofrito done 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:24.540
 we will add the potatoes that we have broken 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.990
 and we will mix them well 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.990
 ah 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.750
 and then we will add the rib 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.560
 that we had reserved and the same 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.560
 we will mix well 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.800
 and at the last moment we add the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.800
 came with the stirred and parsley 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.949
 and we leave a few minutes to finish 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.840
 that mix well 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.500
 I've spent a few minutes we'll take the 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.230
 Water 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.470
 we have to completely cover the 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.660
 potatoes and ribs once what 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.180
 we have all the potatoes the ribs 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.210
 well covered we will leave it to live fire 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.410
 until it starts boiling in the 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.240
 at which point it starts to boil 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.460
 we will go down to medium heat and 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.920
 Let cook until the potatoes and 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.870
 the ribs are tender no longer 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.080
 we have boiling then we will lower the 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.900
 fire at medium heat is now 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.689
 advisable to cover it so that it does not 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.719
 we escape so much the steam 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:13.099
 as you can see we have the sauce 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:16.449
 thickened if we puncture the potatoes are 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:19.099
 already tender and the meat also then 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:24.529
 we are interested that we have juice for 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:27.349
 that this one is more good we stopped it and already 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:30.649
 we can eat it good since we have 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:33.889
 our delicious potatoes with rib 

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:38.389
 of pork you see that it does not have much 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:40.459
 complication and come out very good I hope 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.979
