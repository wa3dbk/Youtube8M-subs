that's what I did I took it home and
what<00:01:42.689> I'm<00:01:42.780> using<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.200> rechargeable<00:01:43.680> batteries

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
what I'm using is rechargeable batteries

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.609 
what I'm using is rechargeable batteries
the<00:01:45.750> batteries<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.259> inside<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> little

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the batteries go inside a little

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
the batteries go inside a little
compartment<00:01:47.250> right<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> side<00:01:47.909> one

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
compartment right here on the side one

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.609 
compartment right here on the side one
thing<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:48.990> about<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.380> battery

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
thing I don't like about the battery

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.050 
thing I don't like about the battery
compartment<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.369> once<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.670> try<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
compartment is that once you try to the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.789 
compartment is that once you try to the
door<00:01:51.299> off<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.780> kind<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> hard<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> take<00:01:52.619> out

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
door off it's kind of hard to take out

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.710 
door off it's kind of hard to take out
you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.030> kind<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.240> hard<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.479> put<00:01:54.659> on

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you know and it's kind of hard to put on

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.410 
you know and it's kind of hard to put on
and<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:56.130> instruction<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> batteries

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
and the instruction of the batteries

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.880 
and the instruction of the batteries
it's<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.990> weird<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.380> first<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> really

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
it's kind of weird at first you really

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.160 
it's kind of weird at first you really
don't<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.130> how<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.520> them<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.170> then

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
don't know how to put them in and then

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.100 
don't know how to put them in and then
actually<00:02:01.500> doing<00:02:01.619> he<00:02:02.119> turned<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
actually doing he turned it on but you

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.780 
actually doing he turned it on but you
know<00:02:04.229> since<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.979> accidentally<00:02:05.369> turned<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.700> on

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
know since I accidentally turned it on

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
know since I accidentally turned it on
let<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:06.420> go<00:02:06.540> ahead<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> there's<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> flash

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
let me go ahead and there's the flash

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.520 
let me go ahead and there's the flash
right<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.340> don't<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.670> you've<00:02:08.789> seen<00:02:08.819> it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
right there don't know if you've seen it

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.770 
right there don't know if you've seen it
but<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:11.430> probably<00:02:11.550> didn't<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.480> know<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
but you probably didn't but you know the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.000 
but you probably didn't but you know the
flash<00:02:13.020> still<00:02:13.260> works<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.680> used

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
flash still works I used

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.890 
flash still works I used
all<00:02:14.159> night<00:02:14.400> last<00:02:14.610> night<00:02:14.879> at<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> little<00:02:15.360> Club<00:02:15.510> I

all night last night at a little Club I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.860 
all night last night at a little Club I
got<00:02:16.200> some<00:02:16.379> sample<00:02:16.980> pictures<00:02:17.129> I'm<00:02:17.549> put<00:02:17.790> up<00:02:17.939> but

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
got some sample pictures I'm put up but

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.119 
got some sample pictures I'm put up but
before<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.170> put<00:02:19.349> those<00:02:19.470> up<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.829> you<00:02:19.950> go<00:02:20.040> ahead

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
before I put those up and you go ahead

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.940 
before I put those up and you go ahead
and<00:02:20.250> finish<00:02:20.489> going<00:02:20.760> over<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> flash<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.709> right

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and finish going over to flash so right

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.160 
and finish going over to flash so right
here<00:02:23.159> you<00:02:23.280> can<00:02:23.430> extend<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:24.000> flash<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.049> can

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
here you can extend the flash so you can

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.690 
here you can extend the flash so you can
let's<00:02:25.739> say<00:02:25.829> you<00:02:25.890> zoomed<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.430> 55

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
let's say you zoomed in at 55

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210 
let's say you zoomed in at 55
millimeters<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.049> extend<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.769> 55

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
millimeters so you can extend it to 55

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.440 
millimeters so you can extend it to 55
and<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> flash<00:02:29.670> will<00:02:29.909> flash

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and the flash will flash

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.479 
and the flash will flash
you<00:02:30.540> know<00:02:30.629> they<00:02:30.840> extend<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.290> flash<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.709> 55<00:02:32.129> or

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
you know they extend the flash to 55 or

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.850 
you know they extend the flash to 55 or
even<00:02:33.180> 70<00:02:33.540> but<00:02:33.959> what<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.079> don't<00:02:34.319> like<00:02:34.440> about<00:02:34.500> this

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
even 70 but what I don't like about this

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.949 
even 70 but what I don't like about this
is<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.489> feels<00:02:35.909> kind<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.269> weird<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.930> it

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
is that it feels kind of weird and it

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.390 
is that it feels kind of weird and it
feels<00:02:37.200> kind<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.470> like<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.799> break

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
feels kind of like in a break

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.420 
feels kind of like in a break
now<00:02:39.329> what<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.690> thing<00:02:40.079> does<00:02:40.319> have<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.340> be

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
now what this thing does have just to be

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.899 
now what this thing does have just to be
a<00:02:41.459> $60<00:02:42.000> flash<00:02:42.180> which<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.659> real<00:02:42.870> good<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.909> you

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
a $60 flash which is real good is you

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.229 
a $60 flash which is real good is you
know<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.269> tilt<00:02:45.599> functionality<00:02:46.079> is<00:02:46.530> swivel

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
know the tilt functionality is swivel

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.610 
know the tilt functionality is swivel
that<00:02:48.239> right<00:02:48.540> there<00:02:48.750> doesn't<00:02:48.959> fly<00:02:49.230> get<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.379> break

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
that right there doesn't fly get a break

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.819 
that right there doesn't fly get a break
you<00:02:50.400> know<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.790> feels<00:02:51.000> real<00:02:51.299> good<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.560> and

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
you know it feels real good you know and

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.250 
you know it feels real good you know and
I<00:02:53.730> got<00:02:53.909> some<00:02:54.090> real<00:02:54.239> good<00:02:54.359> pictures<00:02:54.780> with<00:02:55.019> this

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
I got some real good pictures with this

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.250 
I got some real good pictures with this
in<00:02:56.190> front<00:02:56.609> right<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:56.790> it's<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.840> red<00:02:58.019> light

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
in front right here it's the red light

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.039 
in front right here it's the red light
which<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.769> lot<00:02:58.889> of<00:02:58.920> flashes<00:02:59.370> have<00:02:59.659> so<00:03:00.659> it<00:03:00.900> can

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
which a lot of flashes have so it can

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.780 
which a lot of flashes have so it can
help<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.319> out<00:03:01.379> help<00:03:01.829> your<00:03:01.980> lens<00:03:02.280> out<00:03:02.579> with

help you out help your lens out with
autofocus<00:03:03.389> but<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.200> also<00:03:04.319> depends<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:04.799> what

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
autofocus but it also depends on what

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.710 
autofocus but it also depends on what
lens<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.400> know<00:03:05.879> if<00:03:06.030> you're<00:03:06.180> using<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.510> cheap
