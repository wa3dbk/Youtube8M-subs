separate<00:01:21.509> width<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.900> absolutely<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
separate width is absolutely not the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.480

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
in historically and they're all the rest

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.510 
in historically and they're all the rest
of<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.600> yes<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.130> great<00:01:38.310> thing<00:01:38.460> to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
these holidays in I actually disagree

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.860 
these holidays in I actually disagree
with<00:04:31.770> him<00:04:31.890> I<00:04:32.300> thought<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.450> sounds<00:04:33.660> kind<00:04:33.840> of

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
with him I thought it sounds kind of

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.620 
with him I thought it sounds kind of
crazy<00:04:34.020> right<00:04:34.970> but<00:04:35.970> what<00:04:36.180> they're<00:04:36.300> doing<00:04:36.330> is

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
crazy right but what they're doing is

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.390 
crazy right but what they're doing is
they're<00:04:36.690> trying<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:37.140> make<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.470> more<00:04:37.650> inclusive

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
they're trying to make it more inclusive

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.450 
they're trying to make it more inclusive
and<00:04:39.080> that's<00:04:40.080> what<00:04:40.320> life's<00:04:40.590> about<00:04:40.770> being<00:04:41.220> more

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
and that's what life's about being more

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.480 
and that's what life's about being more
inclusive<00:04:41.870> it's<00:04:42.870> actually<00:04:43.020> why<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.800> still

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
inclusive it's actually why I do still

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.190 
inclusive it's actually why I do still
celebrate<00:04:45.090> Christmas<00:04:45.570> even<00:04:45.900> though<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.050> don't
