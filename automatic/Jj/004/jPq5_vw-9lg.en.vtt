00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
so this is one of those things where you

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.010 
so this is one of those things where you
think<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.150> will<00:03:29.270> make<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.600> much<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:29.840> a

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.600 
think it will make that much of a
difference<00:03:30.050> but<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.650> really<00:03:30.980> does<00:03:31.250> it

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
difference but it really does it
