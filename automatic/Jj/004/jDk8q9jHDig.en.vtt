00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.470
 Well, I've always liked the 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.330
 music of the moment that my friends 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.030
 they opened a bar that is the legal deposit 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.000
 in hospitals that is still open 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.790
 and that continues to carry the same line 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.370
 there they put me as they said that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.070
 is going by emerging opportunities 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.900
 to click on the bikini 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.150
 and click on other rooms in Barcelona 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.460
 but good everything more than anything because I 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.650
 he liked music and after all 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.350
 among the group of colleagues and friends 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.930
 I always sent from the cabin 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.780
 I'm starting to get more interested in the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.350
 music by Manchester groups all 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.809
 today it's like two years of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 to soak up well of musical culture and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.700
 say why not because you can not 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.280
 capture this out then they gave a 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.040
 opportunity I remember in wilde cimpar and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.649
 I started there doing video and I dedicated myself 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.840
 all life to music and the bass player of 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:21.030
 my group that I was wearing at that time 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.330
 the super sonic told me you want to learn 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.300
 to think and I started to click there 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.490
 and there I started to teach what had to be 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.430
 know the basics then I became a 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.550
 little curious in my house to see what I could 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.900
 learn on my own and thus start 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.010
 it was all like a little bit of chance 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.850
 because I played the guitar in a group 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.350
 and well, I had done some radio 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.410
 radio things on independent radios 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.390
 and this and once I was in a local 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.250
 who was going because he said that he had 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.380
 it was Easter and they told me you want 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.650
 put you here during Holy Week I 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.229
 I said coincidentally that he could not 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.290
 back I stayed from there I went somewhere else 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.880
 in another place they saw me and until now 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.250
 I was in a place where the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.770
 people from the benicÃ ssim festival 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.750
 they gave and they said that for the festival of 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.950
 to gain a foothold in an industry that 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.860
 is right now in good is to be a 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.050
 complicated moment is quite difficult and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.760
 more now because it's a profession that at 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.910
 After all, anyone can 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.160
 do because it's not really necessary 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.780
 much knowledge simply that that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.019
 you like the music that you want 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.110
 share what you like and good 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.310
 intention since I was little I liked it a lot 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.709
 record while from these of the roadstead 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.290
 dieter and I always liked seeing 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.900
 to dance to people then I think it was 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.910
 the reason a mixture of chance that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.190
 There is no such friend who told me 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.459
 because you do not mess around and the idea is 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.950
 that we people do not look for 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.959
 but 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.000
 the guys who now make kylie sisters 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.800
 I had a session called friday's 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.680
 in 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.570
 pirandello 2 and how he had read our 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.880
 blog and they liked a bit the kind of 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.130
 music that we played and knew we have 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.710
 punched at parties of friends all 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.260
 family since they offered us and started 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.970
 going well was not all hard the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.390
 principle but everything that comes after 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.630
 which is, after all, the industry of 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.520
 world of the night the music industry and 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.890
 the world dj in general that's hard 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.140
 it's hard because there's a lot of competition and 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.610
 there are good people and bad people with all 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.310
 the places 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.840
 I started doing war maps and little by little 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.720
 I was getting more desire for 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.269
 for innovating by looking for things and practicing 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.239
 and every time I liked it more became 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.980
 in a profession I unfortunately do not 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.280
 I have had the talent to set up a group 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.560
 and the opportunity with which I am satisfied 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.890
 with DJing bands songs 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.489
 man the interesting thing about this is that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.200
 when in the end it ends up being dj everything 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.180
 what you win is for you when you are in a 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.739
 group all you earn is for 8 to 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.769
 end do not take out more than for ropes 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.599
 when all these songs do not bark 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.519
 as many styles as you can 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.370
 put me in my sessions for the same 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.370
 I put you a rockabilly that one of 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.030
 May I be from Davos 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.070
 or techno then I like it to be 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.840
 a dense palette because I also 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.220
 I really like to see how people dance and 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.190
 is evolving according to the styles that 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.160
 you put them I always wanted to put the 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.370
 music that I listened to at home can 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.380
 share it and before you even click 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.210
 the legal deposit mounted my parties of 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.000
 friends came home at home 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.230
 I punctured 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.180
 portable record player can live if 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.410
 depends on the case in my case, good I do not 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.970
 I can complain because I'm doing what 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.400
 I like it and I prefer to do this 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.970
 to be 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.240
 or in an office or on a construction site for me 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.009
 this is a dream come true is a 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.559
 question of how much dj earn but 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.569
 you can live on them and I have to 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:10.610
 depend aspirations and or to solve 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.099
 my expenses to live like a band-aid 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.680
 more must have my work in the 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:18.110
 McDonald's or in a supermarket I have it 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.689
 like dj the truth that I would not change it 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.180
 for nothing but I think that when 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.559
 you reach a level, I do not tell you how 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.960
 the one that I have but good as the one 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:28.639
 It has kind and people so you can 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.039
 live you can live but you always have 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.659
 that is also immersed in other things 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.589
 not so doing collaborations with 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:38.899
 people or remixes or working as is 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:41.210
 in my case also with the producer and 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:43.699
 doing work for them to get there 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.370
 to live from this in Spain is very difficult 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.539
 it's easier to destroy I have lived the 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.949
 experience in other countries because 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.319
 also click in england and in 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.120
 france and such and there is more support for 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:56.240
 people who are starting clubs 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.509
 they program more varied people each end 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.099
 of week here in Spain we have the idea 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.409
 is from the resident that all purposes 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.330
 week click the same people do not know 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.559
 does not give opportunity to new people and 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.539
 then it is difficult because 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:09.880
 promoters do not risk promoters 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.790
 they are safe 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.830
 we have here a stranger or homeboy 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.930
 Well, that convoy that at least I know 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.820
 of what goes independently that the 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.130
 unknown can be much better in 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.500
 Spanish of musical culture really 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.280
 until 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.830
 until 70 there was no musical culture 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.710
 and the earth at 60 listened to the 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.840
 cheers most families 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.090
 in Spain, privileged people 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.760
 the beatles listened to many people believe 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.800
 that night is the most and that everything 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.270
 it works and then the day does not come and you 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.460
 realize that many of the things in the 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.990
 night they were fake many of the people that 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.020
 you know at night because they never go to 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.100
 be your friends a lot of what the 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.170
 behavior that is to be worn 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.920
 at night because our behavior 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.040
 so 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.360
 if you are responsible, you hold the money 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.220
 it's a bit secondary, it always comes in handy 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.820
 and while they do not have to look for another 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.400
 thing better but good that I do not have either 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.950
 great luxuries is obviously the first 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.020
 international master level but at 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:14.800
 scope 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.680
 also had already after being dj be very 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.830
 very very good really if it can be a 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.260
 future option but if your vocation more 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.680
 well it's a hobby it 's complicated is 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.680
 complicated
