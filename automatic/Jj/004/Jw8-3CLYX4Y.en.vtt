00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hey people cool that he says it today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.820
 the first consequence of the thought coach 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.880
 news i tell you what this me 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.519
 week has inspired oppressed braid 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.080
 and let it be so to my thoughts 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.580
 Participate it will be totally cool if you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 me your opinion down here to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.880
 would leave and I just put 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.029
 let's go headline 1 has me totally 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.490
 tied it is about a mysterious 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.160
 great predator if you are a predator 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.660
 think what think first then clearly white 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.280
 shark 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.140
 so far, one thought white sharks while the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.879
 greatest hunter but far from the ocean 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.129
 the American smithsonian institute 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.969
 which has nothing to do with the institute of bones too 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.879
 I think also has a white 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.989
 hai equipped with a transmitter and 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.110
 dismiss this 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.610
 that's what you basically wanted to learn how 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.399
 the animal behaves like his 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.550
 life circumstances are stupid and so on 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.739
 only the transmitter was on a beach 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.049
 washed up and you have the data 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.500
 selected and it leaves only one 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.900
 conclusion 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.780
 the animal has not lost the transmitter 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 but it was eaten itself 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.380
 it is assumed because the animal has 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.869
 So also the body temperature measured 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.180
 The body temperature rose incredibly 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.340
 at and five to seven degrees during that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.750
 animal dives deeper which is unusual 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.880
 because everyone is the ever dipped 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.400
 if you dive deeper it will 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.400
 usually not warmer 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.530
 that's why you do not believe the animal 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.380
 is immersed independently but in the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.140
 stomach of another animal is dipped 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.140
 so it was eaten that's for me 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.240
 a sensation because I also thought in 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.640
 ok white egg big there is nothing 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.590
 other but apparently there is very well 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.390
 what else is the gea group he has 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.170
 an idea what could that be 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.030
 be animal 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.000
 Let me have your opinion there and that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:05.520
 comments headline number 2 class 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.369
 secret service weapons chefs camera 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.140
 should at that time sometime in confused of 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.890
 World War II committed suicide 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.350
 to have 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.630
 he was in the range of an arms ss general 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.580
 circa and was responsible for the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.519
 development of miracle weapons and so far 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.489
 one thought on statements of his staff 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.019
 Driver lifeguard would have somewhere before 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.420
 Prague in a small cozy 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.390
 which committed suicide 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.940
 now has the editorial of zdf history 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.959
 but research and employed 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.810
 has discovered 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.170
 then there is evidence that this man 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.569
 no even walk to but with 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.340
 kissed by the americans 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.200
 in america you have him then 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.180
 It probably will not be a process 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.860
 but made and exchanged his 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.780
 Findings against freedom 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.040
 later on you will have that with us too 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.510
 from brown and other German 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.019
 but made the scientists 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.150
 difference is very clear 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.739
 Hans Kammler was bloodied 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.390
 hands because he was planning on 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.280
 auschwitz involved what wernher of 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.070
 brown and others were not 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.230
 of course you could say okay data 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.630
 but she knows how to do it 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.609
 on the subject of moral as always with you 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.450
 that's okay if he does his party 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:26.390
 or is that questionable your opinion 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.040
 below in the comments to this I feel 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.829
 Report 3 is from no lesser 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.880
 as bill gates will tweet that 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.739
 No joke has one yourself 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.540
 twitter account I'll pack you down in 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.440
 the comments also model information 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.829
 Be a link to his account 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.859
 he tweeted that china in the 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:50.549
 last two years more cement 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.440
 has consumed as the usa throughout 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.900
 Twentieth century you can 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.180
 to imagine that means first 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.780
 then you think ok our circle verden 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.840
 No wrong cement or consumption 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.970
 certain materials will always be 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.060
 always serves as an indicator for that 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.580
 how developed or how strong 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.670
 an economy grows when one 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.750
 it looks okay then 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:20.579
 China is actually booming you can me 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.199
 I do my own research 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.540
 the link below purely from which book 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.310
 now wants to have taken this statistic 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.340
 I find that fascinating and shows 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:34.199
 actually okay in the east is something 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:38.389
 and quite the next message 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:42.030
 comes from the e3 what do I have to hear there 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.590
 quite a lot on the trunk of 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.080
 old titles 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.940
 Honestly, what should that be 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.210
 topping the summit was for 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.220
 me a new tomb raider completely honest 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.430
 it suffices i do not always want people 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.680
 Games 23 784 3 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.750
 I want to gamble new title to 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.169
 can and does not always have any 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:08.070
 continuation of successful things which 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.900
 my most interwoven was mario 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.520
 maker that was always one of mine 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.440
 little dream that you really such a 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.700
 tool has his own mario 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.919
 can knit levels 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.150
 I think that's really exciting 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.740
 why can you also make friends and others 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.229
 people the access you can make 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.669
 also say economy best and 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.440
 Can I let off steam there? 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.349
 but it is only how do you find the 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.330
 games of the e3 is worth it I have to 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.860
 honestly say I have no idea 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.050
 why anyone at all 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.910
 to buy nextgen console 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.530
 why should i use my xbox man or 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.300
 buy a playstation 4 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.910
 I do not see the milestones yet 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.050
 me and from which oven have been lured 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:49.080
 how do you see that your opinion down below 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.370
 the last opinion with last message 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.440
 I was busy with myself 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.220
 Of course, a bit pressed 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.650
 actually it's about the iraq the 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.479
 Troops are now withdrawn 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.950
 the troops of americans and like you 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.710
 you may have heard about the land 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.700
 now a civil war is torn there is 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.650
 this one terror organization in the 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.590
 Now the reason for taking over 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.650
 really wanted and was this whole 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.800
 use of 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.960
 Ricans in vain if one of the 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.669
 interests of criminal industries 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.710
 you have to look 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:28.330
 the intervention in the iraq was a 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.509
 shot highly questionable against 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.990
 any mysterious 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:34.169
 weapons of mass destruction never 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.090
 have been found 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.820
 so that was not even given and 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.870
 this whole operation is careful 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.770
 estimate after a billion dollars 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.870
 tasted 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.070
 That's money you can do now 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.500
 place as you like 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.340
 Personally, I find a completely different one 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:58.720
 number pretty oppressive namely 1450 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:01.510
 in this mission 1450 mostly stem 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.850
 young american soldiers and one 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.840
 unknown number of Iraqi civilians 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.930
 and soldiers 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.340
 for what for that there again 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.260
 bloody terror starts 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.860
 I have to say congratulations 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:16.570
 usa for effective stabilization 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.240
 a whole region 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.729
 you can go on doing that well 

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.680
 the first thoughts were coach news like 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:26.349
 Did you like this is a format 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.120
 what appeals to you is enough 

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.440
 interested not concern me 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.570
 thumbs up gives me thumbs down 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.639
 I am completely the same, I am glad 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.270
 of course , thumb up and do yours 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.380
 opinion with 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.380
 Until next time
