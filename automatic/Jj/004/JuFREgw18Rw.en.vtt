how<00:02:09.729> we<00:02:09.849> like<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:12.120> now<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.300> you've<00:02:13.390> broken

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
how we like it now that you've broken

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.120 
how we like it now that you've broken
the<00:02:14.650> fourth<00:02:14.920> wall<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:16.270> be<00:02:16.960> able<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.380> fly

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
the fourth wall and not be able to fly

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.230 
the fourth wall and not be able to fly
back<00:02:18.280> up<00:02:18.460> let's<00:02:19.270> see

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
back up let's see

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.780 
back up let's see
fly<00:02:21.080> back<00:02:21.290> up<00:02:21.440> or<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.070> can<00:02:22.250> get<00:02:22.520> back<00:02:22.670> up

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
fly back up or you can get back up

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.240 
fly back up or you can get back up
legitly<00:02:23.500> imagine<00:02:24.500> that<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.710> is<00:02:24.770> all<00:02:24.920> legit

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
legitly imagine that this is all legit

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.640 
legitly imagine that this is all legit
not<00:02:25.520> orange<00:02:25.940> wool<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:27.170> don't<00:02:27.320> use<00:02:27.560> your

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
not orange wool you don't use your

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.310 
not orange wool you don't use your
interval<00:02:27.950> obviously<00:02:28.520> if<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.730> don't<00:02:28.880> want<00:02:29.060> to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
interval obviously if you don't want to

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.750 
interval obviously if you don't want to
I'm<00:02:30.320> just<00:02:30.500> going<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.650> mark<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.070> middle<00:02:31.340> like

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
I'm just going to mark the middle like

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.890 
I'm just going to mark the middle like
that<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:34.870> if<00:02:35.870> we<00:02:36.140> do<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.470> then<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:38.690> know<00:02:38.870> that

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that and if we do this then we know that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.590 
that and if we do this then we know that
that's<00:02:39.440> our<00:02:39.620> center<00:02:39.860> point<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.180> now<00:02:41.330> what<00:02:41.510> you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
that's our center point so now what you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.620 
that's our center point so now what you
want<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.200> make<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:44.080> flat<00:02:45.080> area<00:02:45.350> up<00:02:45.770> here<00:02:45.800> I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
want to do is make a flat area up here I

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.650 
want to do is make a flat area up here I
like<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.810> go<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:49.700> can<00:02:49.850> really<00:02:50.060> go<00:02:50.180> however<00:02:50.390> big

the main point this is a beginner's
guide<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.280> basically<00:03:01.610> me<00:03:01.850> making<00:03:02.450> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
guide this is basically me making the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.870 
guide this is basically me making the
simplest<00:03:03.800> thing<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.160> can<00:03:04.220> think<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.640> on

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
simplest thing that I can think of on

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.540 
simplest thing that I can think of on
how<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.330> make<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.570> mobs<00:03:05.960> honor<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:06.650> do<00:03:07.190> love

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
how to make a mobs honor I do love

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.740 
how to make a mobs honor I do love
minecraft<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.180> all<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.330> technical<00:03:08.690> stuff

minecraft and all the technical stuff
but<00:03:09.050> I'm<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.290> not<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.500> smart<00:03:09.740> and<00:03:10.300> yeah<00:03:11.300> I

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
but I'm just not that smart and yeah I

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.120 
but I'm just not that smart and yeah I
don't<00:03:12.800> have<00:03:13.250> that<00:03:13.340> much<00:03:13.550> patience<00:03:13.880> either<00:03:14.090> so

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
don't have that much patience either so

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.740 
don't have that much patience either so
I'm<00:03:16.130> just<00:03:16.280> going<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.490> fast<00:03:17.330> forward<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.630> bit

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
I'm just going to fast forward a bit

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:39.210 
I'm just going to fast forward a bit
three<00:03:18.050> year

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.890 

okay<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:40.280> now<00:03:40.610> that<00:03:40.640> you've<00:03:40.970> gotten<00:03:41.390> your

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
okay so now that you've gotten your

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.320 
okay so now that you've gotten your
platforms<00:03:42.680> done<00:03:42.860> I'm<00:03:43.070> I<00:03:43.520> just<00:03:43.850> in<00:03:43.970> five<00:03:44.150> by

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
platforms done I'm I just in five by

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.900 
platforms done I'm I just in five by
five<00:03:44.510> because<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:44.900> like<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:46.460> make

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
five because I like that you can make

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.600 
five because I like that you can make
your<00:03:47.150> hole<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.810> ground<00:03:47.960> here<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.610> you're

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
your hole in the ground here and you're

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.650 
your hole in the ground here and you're
going<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.760> need<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:50.000> make<00:03:50.180> finish<00:03:50.510> the

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
going to need to make finish the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.840 
going to need to make finish the
channels<00:03:50.990> for<00:03:51.170> water<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.730> obviously<00:03:52.730> you

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
channels for water and obviously you

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.040 
channels for water and obviously you
need<00:03:53.000> your<00:03:53.150> channels<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.570> be<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.690> little<00:03:53.870> bit

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
need your channels to be a little bit

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.170 
need your channels to be a little bit
low<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.320> ground<00:03:54.560> or<00:03:55.280> lower<00:03:55.490> so<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:55.970> they

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
low in the ground or lower so that they

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.230 
low in the ground or lower so that they
will<00:03:56.300> actually<00:03:56.770> make<00:03:57.770> water<00:03:58.040> flow<00:03:58.390> and<00:04:01.090> if<00:04:02.090> you

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
will actually make water flow and if you

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.290 
will actually make water flow and if you
do<00:04:02.390> this<00:04:03.400> actually<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.730> know<00:04:04.820> what<00:04:04.880> we<00:04:05.060> can<00:04:05.180> go

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
do this actually you know what we can go

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.070 
do this actually you know what we can go
a<00:04:05.330> little<00:04:05.450> farther<00:04:05.660> than<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:07.930> should<00:04:08.930> just

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
a little farther than that should just

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.660 
a little farther than that should just
imagine<00:04:09.530> that<00:04:09.709> these<00:04:09.950> go<00:04:10.220> out<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.430> little

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
imagine that these go out a little

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.510 
imagine that these go out a little
farther<00:04:11.470> because<00:04:12.470> water<00:04:12.739> can<00:04:12.860> travel<00:04:13.190> i<00:04:13.310> think

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
farther because water can travel i think

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.060 
farther because water can travel i think
it's<00:04:13.640> seven<00:04:13.910> blocks<00:04:14.350> yeah<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.770> can<00:04:15.920> travel

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
it's seven blocks yeah you can travel

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.409 
it's seven blocks yeah you can travel
seven<00:04:16.459> blocks<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:20.000> can<00:04:20.180> make<00:04:20.269> your

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
seven blocks so you can make your

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.230 
seven blocks so you can make your
platform<00:04:20.840> seven<00:04:21.260> by<00:04:21.380> seven<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:22.100> you<00:04:22.910> should

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
platform seven by seven and you should

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.360 
platform seven by seven and you should
be<00:04:23.270> good<00:04:23.419> or<00:04:23.750> even<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:24.710> think<00:04:24.950> eight<00:04:25.130> by<00:04:25.340> eight

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
be good or even I think eight by eight

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.670 
be good or even I think eight by eight
works<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:27.070> put<00:04:28.070> water<00:04:28.280> here<00:04:29.200> back<00:04:32.530> then<00:04:33.530> we

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
works and put water here back then we

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.850 
works and put water here back then we
will<00:04:33.890> have<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.630> nice<00:04:37.270> water<00:04:38.270> flow<00:04:38.540> and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
will have a nice water flow and

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.610 
will have a nice water flow and
basically<00:04:39.860> if<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.520> stop<00:04:40.940> flying<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.960> pushes<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
basically if I stop flying it pushes the

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.950 
basically if I stop flying it pushes the
mobs<00:04:42.830> right<00:04:43.160> out<00:04:43.340> over<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:44.240> hole<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.720> they

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
mobs right out over the hole and they

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.380 
mobs right out over the hole and they
fall<00:04:45.169> to<00:04:45.320> their<00:04:45.770> deaths<00:04:46.040> so<00:04:46.940> that's<00:04:47.120> pretty

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
fall to their deaths so that's pretty

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.170 
fall to their deaths so that's pretty
good<00:04:47.690> pretty<00:04:48.380> good<00:04:48.530> and<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.370> will<00:04:49.940> fast<00:04:50.090> forward

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
good pretty good and I will fast forward

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.830 
good pretty good and I will fast forward
until<00:04:50.479> the<00:04:50.660> completion<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.440> mob<00:04:51.710> trap<00:04:52.840> or

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
until the completion of the mob trap or

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:15.129 
until the completion of the mob trap or
until<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.350> collision<00:04:54.710> of<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.830> first<00:04:55.130> part

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
realized I balls that up so that is

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.960 
realized I balls that up so that is
spectacular<00:07:07.740> but<00:07:08.740> there<00:07:08.889> you<00:07:08.979> go<00:07:09.039> that's<00:07:09.789> your

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
spectacular but there you go that's your

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.610 
spectacular but there you go that's your
mob<00:07:10.570> spawner<00:07:10.930> and<00:07:11.410> it<00:07:11.860> only<00:07:11.979> takes<00:07:12.280> probably

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
mob spawner and it only takes probably

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.110 
mob spawner and it only takes probably
three<00:07:14.620> or<00:07:14.650> four<00:07:14.770> stacks<00:07:15.280> and<00:07:15.520> cobblestone<00:07:15.849> to

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
three or four stacks and cobblestone to

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.779 
three or four stacks and cobblestone to
complete<00:07:17.639> minus<00:07:18.639> the<00:07:18.789> walls<00:07:18.970> probably<00:07:19.479> six<00:07:20.789> a

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:21.789 
complete minus the walls probably six a

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:24.779 
complete minus the walls probably six a
total<00:07:22.479> so<00:07:22.930> yeah<00:07:23.380> that's<00:07:23.770> pretty<00:07:24.099> good<00:07:24.669> I

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:24.789 
total so yeah that's pretty good I

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:28.260 
total so yeah that's pretty good I
suppose<00:07:24.849> and<00:07:25.919> I'm<00:07:26.919> going<00:07:27.460> to<00:07:27.490> be<00:07:27.669> making<00:07:27.820> part
