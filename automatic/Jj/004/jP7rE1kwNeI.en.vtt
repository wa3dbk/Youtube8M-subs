00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
possible every level can be get it you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.779 
possible every level can be get it you
can<00:00:39.079> like<00:00:39.350> see<00:00:39.620> how<00:00:39.680> high<00:00:39.860> I<00:00:39.890> go<00:00:40.129> you<00:00:40.309> can<00:00:40.460> get

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:40.789 
can like see how high I go you can get

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.450 
can like see how high I go you can get
out<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.030> every<00:00:41.570> map<00:00:41.750> with<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.070> we've

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
out of every map with this so we've

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.180 
out of every map with this so we've
tried<00:00:43.640> on<00:00:43.879> a<00:00:43.910> lot<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.559> maps<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.860> countless

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
tried on a lot of maps and countless

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.400 
tried on a lot of maps and countless
places<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.850> using<00:00:47.120> sliders<00:00:47.329> shotgun<00:00:47.930> you

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
places and using sliders shotgun you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.959 
places and using sliders shotgun you
just<00:00:48.590> got<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:48.770> make<00:00:48.859> sure<00:00:48.920> that<00:00:49.219> one<00:00:49.399> person<00:00:49.910> is

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
just got to make sure that one person is

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:51.400 
just got to make sure that one person is
a<00:00:50.059> lower<00:00:50.210> level<00:00:50.480> than<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:50.960> person<00:00:51.289> getting

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
a lower level than the person getting

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.439 
a lower level than the person getting
launched<00:00:51.829> out<00:00:51.980> or<00:00:52.219> it<00:00:52.640> will<00:00:52.730> kill<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:53.390> you

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
launched out or it will kill you and you

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.110 
launched out or it will kill you and you
won't<00:00:53.600> go<00:00:53.719> as<00:00:53.870> high<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.640> lower<00:00:55.789> level

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
won't go as high so the lower level

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.610 
won't go as high so the lower level
person<00:00:56.390> has<00:00:56.539> to<00:00:56.660> use<00:00:56.780> just<00:00:56.930> Elijah's<00:00:57.260> shotgun

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
person has to use just Elijah's shotgun

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.869 
person has to use just Elijah's shotgun
as<00:00:57.739> far<00:00:57.890> as<00:00:57.980> I<00:00:58.070> know<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:58.309> can<00:00:58.460> only<00:00:58.579> do<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:58.820> with

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
as far as I know you can only do it with

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.310 
as far as I know you can only do it with
slight<00:00:59.090> shock<00:00:59.359> unless<00:00:59.750> you<00:00:59.870> have<00:00:59.960> another<00:01:00.140> gun

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
slight shock unless you have another gun

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.919 
slight shock unless you have another gun
with<00:01:00.530> massive<00:01:00.980> kickback<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.670> his<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.719> here's

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
with massive kickback like his so here's

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.479 
with massive kickback like his so here's
another<00:01:03.140> example<00:01:03.260> I'll<00:01:03.829> show<00:01:03.859> you<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.129> few<00:01:04.400> of

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
another example I'll show you a few of

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.950 
another example I'll show you a few of
these<00:01:04.580> because<00:01:04.790> it's<00:01:05.239> just<00:01:05.390> incredible<00:01:05.900> on

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
these because it's just incredible on

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.630 
these because it's just incredible on
how<00:01:06.530> many<00:01:06.680> places<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.100> can<00:01:07.189> get<00:01:07.340> out<00:01:07.490> with

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
how many places you can get out with

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.160 
how many places you can get out with
this<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.030> can<00:01:08.150> explore<00:01:08.509> so<00:01:08.810> much<00:01:09.020> with

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
this and you can explore so much with

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.320 
this and you can explore so much with
the<00:01:09.860> map<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.400> there's<00:01:10.759> really<00:01:10.850> nothing<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.210> do

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
the map and there's really nothing to do

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.969 
the map and there's really nothing to do
when<00:01:11.479> you're<00:01:11.600> like<00:01:11.689> level<00:01:11.990> 50<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:12.619> this<00:01:12.830> is

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
when you're like level 50 so this is

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.969 
when you're like level 50 so this is
what<00:01:13.460> occupies<00:01:14.330> me<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:14.780> far<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:15.710> can<00:01:15.860> see

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
what occupies me so far and you can see

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.649 
what occupies me so far and you can see
that<00:01:16.189> we<00:01:16.400> just<00:01:16.430> did<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.700> one<00:01:16.880> first<00:01:17.090> try<00:01:17.420> it's

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
that we just did that one first try it's

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.940 
that we just did that one first try it's
not<00:01:17.689> too<00:01:17.960> hard<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.350> there<00:01:18.560> might<00:01:18.710> take<00:01:18.829> a<00:01:18.860> few

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
not too hard I there might take a few

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.429 
not too hard I there might take a few
tries<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.360> can<00:01:20.509> see<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:21.140> are<00:01:21.259> out<00:01:21.409> of

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
tries but you can see that we are out of

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.289 
tries but you can see that we are out of
the<00:01:21.560> map<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.100> we<00:01:22.490> could<00:01:22.610> go<00:01:22.700> explore<00:01:23.119> I'll<00:01:23.210> let

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
the map and we could go explore I'll let

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.730 
the map and we could go explore I'll let
you<00:01:23.420> guys<00:01:23.570> explore<00:01:23.750> most<00:01:24.170> these<00:01:24.259> places<00:01:24.560> I

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
you guys explore most these places I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.859 
you guys explore most these places I
don't<00:01:24.890> want<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.220> I<00:01:25.430> don't<00:01:26.360> want<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.600> show<00:01:26.750> all

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
don't want to I don't want to show all

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.600 
don't want to I don't want to show all
that<00:01:26.900> because<00:01:27.320> its<00:01:27.500> own<00:01:27.890> unless<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.280> guys<00:01:28.400> see

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
that because its own unless you guys see

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.429 
that because its own unless you guys see
that<00:01:28.640> for<00:01:28.850> yourself<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:29.930> is<00:01:30.049> headstone

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
that for yourself so this is headstone

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.370 
that for yourself so this is headstone
mine<00:01:30.680> now<00:01:30.920> we're<00:01:31.159> on<00:01:31.250> one<00:01:31.430> side<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:32.000> they<00:01:32.990> jump

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
mine now we're on one side and they jump

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.109 
mine now we're on one side and they jump
and<00:01:33.619> get<00:01:34.130> out<00:01:34.250> this<00:01:34.399> is<00:01:34.549> actually<00:01:34.850> one<00:01:34.970> of<00:01:35.000> the

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
and get out this is actually one of the

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.490 
and get out this is actually one of the
better<00:01:35.270> maps<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.720> do<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:35.930> on<00:01:36.049> if<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.259> want<00:01:36.320> to

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
better maps to do it on if you want to

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.580 
better maps to do it on if you want to
try<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:36.740> one<00:01:37.040> that<00:01:38.030> all<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.780> ground<00:01:39.380> over

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
try this one that all that ground over

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.139 
try this one that all that ground over
there<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.860> whites<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.520> stuff<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.030> can

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
there that whites and stuff you can

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.730 
there that whites and stuff you can
actually<00:01:41.240> go<00:01:41.479> on<00:01:41.689> that<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.140> it<00:01:42.229> goes<00:01:42.380> for<00:01:42.710> a

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
actually go on that and it goes for a

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.530 
actually go on that and it goes for a
very<00:01:43.280> very<00:01:43.399> long<00:01:43.640> distance<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.270> don't<00:01:44.420> want

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
very very long distance you don't want

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.490 
very very long distance you don't want
to<00:01:44.600> fall<00:01:44.719> down<00:01:44.750> here<00:01:45.020> it's<00:01:45.200> kind<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.350> like<00:01:45.469> a

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
to fall down here it's kind of like a

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.280 
to fall down here it's kind of like a
little<00:01:45.649> prison<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.250> whatever<00:01:47.079> that<00:01:48.079> is

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
little prison but whatever that is

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.109 
little prison but whatever that is
probably<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:49.040> best<00:01:49.310> maps<00:01:49.579> are<00:01:49.670> doing<00:01:49.820> on<00:01:49.939> so

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
probably the best maps are doing on so

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.609 
probably the best maps are doing on so
far<00:01:50.329> I<00:01:50.360> haven't<00:01:50.570> charted<00:01:50.930> on<00:01:51.049> many<00:01:51.320> I've<00:01:51.500> only

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
far I haven't charted on many I've only

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.190 
far I haven't charted on many I've only
tried<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.009> on<00:01:52.159> a<00:01:52.520> few<00:01:52.939> probably<00:01:53.570> like<00:01:53.840> four<00:01:54.140> or

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
tried it on a few probably like four or

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.130 
tried it on a few probably like four or
five<00:01:54.259> different<00:01:54.590> areas<00:01:55.159> but<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.090> a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
five different areas but this is a

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.660 
five different areas but this is a
probably<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.439> best<00:01:57.680> glitch<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.159> game<00:01:58.189> so

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
probably the best glitch in the game so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.190 
probably the best glitch in the game so
again<00:01:58.939> you<00:01:59.090> want<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.270> use<00:01:59.329> sledges<00:01:59.630> shotgun<00:02:00.110> if

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
again you want to use sledges shotgun if

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.990 
again you want to use sledges shotgun if
you<00:02:00.289> can<00:02:00.560> find<00:02:00.799> it<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:01.159> just<00:02:01.369> go<00:02:01.460> kill<00:02:01.670> sledge

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
you can find it so just go kill sledge

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.340 
you can find it so just go kill sledge
like<00:02:02.210> really<00:02:02.450> quick<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.780> playthrough<00:02:03.229> or

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
like really quick on a playthrough or

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.870 
like really quick on a playthrough or
something<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.890> then<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.369> want<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.549> use<00:02:04.610> this

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
something and then you want to use this

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.700 
something and then you want to use this
shock<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.360> keep<00:02:05.539> it<00:02:05.689> and<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:05.930> really<00:02:06.259> good<00:02:06.439> so

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
shock and keep it and is really good so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.170 
shock and keep it and is really good so
and<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.009> can<00:02:07.070> even<00:02:07.250> get<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.460> places<00:02:07.729> like<00:02:07.909> this

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
and you can even get to places like this

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.790 
and you can even get to places like this
so<00:02:08.240> thanks<00:02:08.899> guys<00:02:08.930> for<00:02:09.050> watching<00:02:09.259> I<00:02:09.590> hope<00:02:09.619> you
