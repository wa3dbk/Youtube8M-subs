positioning<00:00:54.650> for<00:00:54.710> bone<00:00:55.159> storm<00:00:55.489> phase

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
positioning for bone storm phase

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.179 
positioning for bone storm phase
controlling<00:00:57.260> bone<00:00:57.379> storm<00:00:57.650> is<00:00:57.799> really<00:00:58.040> the

00:00:58.179 --> 00:00:58.189 
controlling bone storm is really the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:01.299 
controlling bone storm is really the
entire<00:00:58.510> difficulty<00:00:59.510> of<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.689> fight<00:01:00.250> so<00:01:01.250> you

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
entire difficulty of the fight so you

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:02.710 
entire difficulty of the fight so you
can<00:01:01.489> see<00:01:01.610> there's<00:01:01.820> three<00:01:02.000> smoke<00:01:02.269> positions

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
can see there's three smoke positions

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.660 
can see there's three smoke positions
they're<00:01:03.199> not<00:01:03.320> exact<00:01:03.799> they're<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:04.460> kind<00:01:04.640> of

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
they're not exact they're just kind of

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.700 
they're not exact they're just kind of
general<00:01:05.030> positions<00:01:05.479> there's<00:01:05.930> one<00:01:05.990> where<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:06.439> am

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
general positions there's one where I am

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.850 
general positions there's one where I am
and<00:01:06.950> then<00:01:07.189> two<00:01:07.400> behind<00:01:07.790> morrow<00:01:08.360> guard<00:01:08.630> and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
and then two behind morrow guard and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.850 
and then two behind morrow guard and
these<00:01:09.860> are<00:01:10.040> positions<00:01:10.189> for<00:01:10.670> bone<00:01:10.850> storm<00:01:11.860> so

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
these are positions for bone storm so

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.840 
these are positions for bone storm so
the<00:01:13.009> two<00:01:13.159> behind<00:01:13.400> marg<00:01:13.700> are<00:01:13.909> for<00:01:14.240> healers<00:01:14.540> only

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
the two behind marg are for healers only

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.030 
the two behind marg are for healers only
so<00:01:16.850> when<00:01:17.000> bone<00:01:17.150> storm<00:01:17.420> starts<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.740> healers

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
so when bone storm starts the healers

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.950 
so when bone storm starts the healers
stay<00:01:19.280> in<00:01:19.400> those<00:01:19.549> relative<00:01:20.240> positions<00:01:20.659> and

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
stay in those relative positions and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.230 
stay in those relative positions and
then<00:01:21.500> you'll<00:01:21.680> see<00:01:21.920> what<00:01:22.579> I<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:22.700> did<00:01:22.909> there<00:01:23.210> is

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
then you'll see what I just did there is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.750 
then you'll see what I just did there is
run<00:01:23.630> out<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.020> left<00:01:24.259> away<00:01:25.250> from<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.550> raid

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
run out to the left away from the raid

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.530 
run out to the left away from the raid
as<00:01:26.540> soon<00:01:26.780> as<00:01:26.840> bone<00:01:27.020> storm<00:01:27.320> started<00:01:27.770> and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
as soon as bone storm started and

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.340 
as soon as bone storm started and
simultaneously<00:01:29.540> you<00:01:29.720> can't<00:01:29.930> really<00:01:30.050> see<00:01:30.140> it

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
simultaneously you can't really see it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.410 
simultaneously you can't really see it
but<00:01:30.440> on<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.770> opposite<00:01:31.100> side<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.430> room<00:01:31.670> our

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
but on the opposite side of the room our

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.360 
but on the opposite side of the room our
death<00:01:32.630> knight<00:01:32.840> did<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.080> same<00:01:33.260> thing<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:34.220> he's

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
death knight did the same thing and he's

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.120 
death knight did the same thing and he's
just<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.730> normal<00:01:34.850> dps<00:01:35.480> spec<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.620> gear<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.040> all

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
just a normal dps spec and gear and all

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.700 
just a normal dps spec and gear and all
that<00:01:37.450> but<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.570> reason<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.050> do<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:39.440> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
that but the reason that we do this and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.070 
that but the reason that we do this and
you<00:01:39.950> saw<00:01:40.130> morrow<00:01:40.400> gar<00:01:40.640> picked<00:01:40.940> me<00:01:41.120> to<00:01:41.479> charge

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
you saw morrow gar picked me to charge

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.960 
you saw morrow gar picked me to charge
and<00:01:42.950> there<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.159> picked<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.430> death<00:01:43.610> knight<00:01:43.820> to

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
and there you picked the death knight to

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.760 
and there you picked the death knight to
charge<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:47.180> then<00:01:47.300> he's<00:01:47.390> back<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.570> me<00:01:47.870> so

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
charge so and then he's back to me so

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.070 
charge so and then he's back to me so
the<00:01:49.400> reason<00:01:49.760> that<00:01:49.790> he<00:01:50.120> does<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.600> if<00:01:50.900> you

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
the reason that he does that if you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.560 
the reason that he does that if you
don't<00:01:51.229> know<00:01:51.290> where<00:01:51.500> is<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.040> his<00:01:52.880> target

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
don't know where is that his target

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.390 
don't know where is that his target
selection<00:01:54.020> during<00:01:54.140> bone<00:01:54.440> storm<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.280> know

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
selection during bone storm you know

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.910 
selection during bone storm you know
meaning<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.790> person<00:01:56.090> he<00:01:56.180> charges<00:01:56.570> toward

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
meaning the person he charges toward

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.010 
meaning the person he charges toward
which<00:01:57.920> occurs<00:01:58.220> every<00:01:58.520> seven<00:01:59.390> or<00:01:59.479> so<00:01:59.600> seconds

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
which occurs every seven or so seconds

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.810 
which occurs every seven or so seconds
is<00:02:00.430> based<00:02:01.430> almost<00:02:02.060> entirely<00:02:02.570> on<00:02:02.810> range<00:02:03.820> that

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
is based almost entirely on range that

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.180 
is based almost entirely on range that
is<00:02:05.030> your<00:02:05.360> distance<00:02:05.960> from<00:02:06.080> morrow<00:02:06.710> garners

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
is your distance from morrow garners

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.839 
is your distance from morrow garners
model<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.780> if<00:02:09.170> there<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.739> valid<00:02:10.099> player

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
model so if there is a valid player

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.000 
model so if there is a valid player
valid<00:02:11.690> target<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.260> not<00:02:12.470> within<00:02:12.680> his

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
valid target that is not within his

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.270 
valid target that is not within his
current<00:02:13.489> bone<00:02:13.670> storm<00:02:14.030> melee<00:02:14.420> range<00:02:15.040> he<00:02:16.040> will

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
current bone storm melee range he will

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.009 
current bone storm melee range he will
prefer<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.970> pick<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.299> target<00:02:17.689> to<00:02:17.780> charge

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
prefer to pick that target to charge

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.929 
prefer to pick that target to charge
after<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.549> design<00:02:21.939> mechanic

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
after and this is just a design mechanic

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.990 
after and this is just a design mechanic
from<00:02:23.299> lizards<00:02:23.689> so<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.110> he<00:02:25.099> can't<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.400> pick

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
from lizards so that he can't just pick

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.580 
from lizards so that he can't just pick
the<00:02:26.120> same<00:02:26.330> target<00:02:26.780> that's<00:02:26.989> right<00:02:27.110> next<00:02:27.349> to<00:02:27.409> him

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
the same target that's right next to him

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.850 
the same target that's right next to him
and<00:02:27.709> rape<00:02:27.890> them<00:02:28.069> really<00:02:28.670> quick

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
and rape them really quick

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.190 
and rape them really quick
so<00:02:30.860> because<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.700> if<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.600> were<00:02:32.720> able<00:02:32.870> to

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
so because of this if you were able to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.260 
so because of this if you were able to
get<00:02:33.650> a<00:02:33.680> player<00:02:33.980> outside<00:02:34.520> of<00:02:34.640> melee<00:02:34.820> range<00:02:35.120> of

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
get a player outside of melee range of

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.440 
get a player outside of melee range of
him<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:36.290> player<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.590> almost<00:02:37.060> always<00:02:38.060> going

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
him that player is almost always going

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.410 
him that player is almost always going
to<00:02:38.510> be<00:02:38.570> picked<00:02:39.040> immediately<00:02:40.040> or<00:02:40.420> before

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
to be picked immediately or before

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.950 
to be picked immediately or before
anyone<00:02:41.720> else<00:02:41.810> if<00:02:42.110> their<00:02:42.860> voluntary<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.540> as<00:02:44.900> you

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
anyone else if their voluntary so as you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.790 
anyone else if their voluntary so as you
saw<00:02:45.290> as<00:02:45.920> soon<00:02:46.160> as<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.610> ran<00:02:47.030> out<00:02:47.240> early<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:48.710> as

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
saw as soon as I ran out early just as

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.440 
saw as soon as I ran out early just as
bone<00:02:48.980> storm<00:02:49.250> was<00:02:49.340> casting<00:02:49.790> all<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.270> raid

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
bone storm was casting all the raid

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.000 
bone storm was casting all the raid
that's<00:02:50.720> normally<00:02:51.080> stacked<00:02:51.350> up<00:02:51.500> behind<00:02:51.770> them

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
that's normally stacked up behind them

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.490 
that's normally stacked up behind them
are<00:02:52.670> still<00:02:53.000> within<00:02:53.150> melee<00:02:53.420> range<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.320> they're

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
are still within melee range so they're

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.800 
are still within melee range so they're
invalid<00:02:55.040> targets<00:02:55.430> he<00:02:55.910> won't<00:02:56.060> pick<00:02:56.270> them<00:02:56.480> first

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
invalid targets he won't pick them first

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.810 
invalid targets he won't pick them first
and<00:02:57.140> there<00:02:57.800> he<00:02:57.890> goes<00:02:57.920> again<00:02:58.130> he<00:02:58.370> doesn't<00:02:58.670> pick

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
and there he goes again he doesn't pick

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.160 
and there he goes again he doesn't pick
them<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.590> our<00:03:01.240> positioning<00:03:02.240> for<00:03:02.300> bone<00:03:02.840> storm

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
them so our positioning for bone storm

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.650 
them so our positioning for bone storm
really<00:03:03.800> relies<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.490> that<00:03:04.970> knowledge<00:03:05.180> if

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
really relies on that knowledge if

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.830 
really relies on that knowledge if
you're<00:03:06.530> out<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.710> that<00:03:06.860> 25-yard<00:03:07.820> AE<00:03:08.210> range<00:03:08.660> or

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
you're out of that 25-yard AE range or

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.680 
you're out of that 25-yard AE range or
so<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.800> chances<00:03:10.160> are<00:03:10.340> he<00:03:10.610> won't<00:03:10.730> pick<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.180> to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
so the chances are he won't pick you to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.490 
so the chances are he won't pick you to
run<00:03:11.870> after<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:13.720> myself<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.990> the<00:03:15.110> death<00:03:15.290> knight

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
run after so myself and the death knight

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.830 
run after so myself and the death knight
formed<00:03:15.890> two<00:03:16.040> points<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:16.730> then<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.570> rest<00:03:17.720> of

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
formed two points and then the rest of

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.870 
formed two points and then the rest of
the<00:03:17.900> raid<00:03:18.050> forms<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.860> third<00:03:19.070> point<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.580> a<00:03:19.670> very

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
the raid forms the third point of a very

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.080 
the raid forms the third point of a very
large<00:03:20.060> triangle<00:03:20.480> system<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.940> then<00:03:22.940> within

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
large triangle system and then within

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.790 
large triangle system and then within
that<00:03:23.210> third<00:03:23.600> point<00:03:23.930> where<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> trade

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
that third point where the a trade

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.230 
that third point where the a trade
members<00:03:25.160> are<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.520> can<00:03:25.670> see<00:03:25.820> there's<00:03:26.000> three

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
members are you can see there's three

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.720 
members are you can see there's three
smokes<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:27.440> form<00:03:27.740> a<00:03:27.890> smaller<00:03:28.190> triangle

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
smokes that form a smaller triangle

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.510 
smokes that form a smaller triangle
within<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.210> larger<00:03:29.540> triangle<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.400> as<00:03:31.400> I

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
within the larger triangle and as I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.040 
within the larger triangle and as I
mentioned<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.940> two<00:03:32.120> back<00:03:32.330> smokes<00:03:32.690> behind

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
mentioned the two back smokes behind

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.630 
mentioned the two back smokes behind
morrow<00:03:33.290> guards<00:03:33.590> position<00:03:34.010> or<00:03:34.160> for<00:03:34.340> healers

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
morrow guards position or for healers

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.450 
morrow guards position or for healers
only<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.870> we<00:03:35.960> use<00:03:36.080> three<00:03:36.290> healers<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.010> two<00:03:37.070> on

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
only and we use three healers so two on

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.670 
only and we use three healers so two on
one<00:03:37.670> smoke<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.240> one<00:03:38.360> on<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.540> other<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:39.140> then

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
one smoke and one on the other and then

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.580 
one smoke and one on the other and then
the<00:03:39.770> smoke<00:03:40.520> closest<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.180> me<00:03:41.360> is<00:03:41.690> used<00:03:42.410> by<00:03:42.560> our

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
the smoke closest to me is used by our

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.580 
the smoke closest to me is used by our
range<00:03:42.920> dps<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.780> our<00:03:44.780> melee<00:03:45.080> will<00:03:45.290> sort<00:03:45.500> of

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
range dps and our melee will sort of

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.530 
range dps and our melee will sort of
spread<00:03:45.890> around<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:47.000> range<00:03:47.240> dps

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
spread around that that range dps

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.580 
spread around that that range dps
location<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.180> reason<00:03:50.360> for<00:03:50.570> this<00:03:50.690> is<00:03:51.020> as

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
location so the reason for this is as

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.550 
location so the reason for this is as
you<00:03:52.010> can<00:03:52.190> logically<00:03:52.520> guess<00:03:53.110> morrow<00:03:54.110> gar<00:03:54.350> will

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
you can logically guess morrow gar will

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.490 
you can logically guess morrow gar will
pick<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:55.250> raid<00:03:55.460> members<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.570> charge<00:03:56.840> after<00:03:57.260> he

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
pick the raid members to charge after he

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.930 
pick the raid members to charge after he
charges<00:03:57.830> myself<00:03:58.220> for<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.520> death<00:03:58.700> money

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
charges myself for the death money

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.750 
charges myself for the death money
because<00:03:59.660> they're<00:04:00.380> now<00:04:00.620> not<00:04:01.040> within<00:04:01.250> my<00:04:01.370> range

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
because they're now not within my range

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.090 
because they're now not within my range
and<00:04:02.030> they're<00:04:02.150> valid<00:04:02.330> targets<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.920> he

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
and they're valid targets but he

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.630 
and they're valid targets but he
basically<00:04:04.250> has<00:04:05.770> five<00:04:06.770> targets<00:04:07.100> that<00:04:07.400> he<00:04:07.520> can

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
basically has five targets that he can

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.850 
basically has five targets that he can
select<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.180> art<00:04:08.330> dealers<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.020> if<00:04:09.590> he<00:04:09.650> does

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
select the art dealers and if he does

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.220 
select the art dealers and if he does
that<00:04:09.890> he'll<00:04:10.760> go<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.240> back<00:04:11.390> smoke<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.020> the

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
that he'll go to the back smoke and the

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.650 
that he'll go to the back smoke and the
two<00:04:12.410> healer<00:04:13.160> positions<00:04:13.580> are<00:04:14.000> not<00:04:14.270> in<00:04:14.480> danger

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
two healer positions are not in danger

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.840 
two healer positions are not in danger
and<00:04:15.050> can<00:04:15.260> they<00:04:15.380> can<00:04:15.740> remain<00:04:16.160> stationary<00:04:16.670> the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
and can they can remain stationary the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.349 
and can they can remain stationary the
entire<00:04:17.120> time<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.600> keep<00:04:18.170> healing<00:04:18.380> and

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
entire time and keep healing and

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.540 
entire time and keep healing and
likewise<00:04:20.359> if<00:04:20.510> he<00:04:20.600> picks<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:21.020> of<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.170> healers

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
likewise if he picks one of the healers

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.730 
likewise if he picks one of the healers
the<00:04:22.550> other<00:04:22.850> healer<00:04:23.270> location<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.470> people

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
the other healer location the people

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.500 
the other healer location the people
there<00:04:24.950> can<00:04:25.340> stay<00:04:25.610> stationary<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.300> keep

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
there can stay stationary and keep

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.310 
there can stay stationary and keep
healing<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:28.070> really<00:04:28.610> it's<00:04:29.420> it's<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:30.140> most

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
healing so really it's it's the most

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.650 
healing so really it's it's the most
efficient<00:04:31.040> setup<00:04:31.190> that<00:04:31.430> we<00:04:31.520> found<00:04:31.760> for<00:04:32.060> this

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
efficient setup that we found for this

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.260 
efficient setup that we found for this
fight<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.920> there<00:04:34.130> can<00:04:34.280> still<00:04:34.370> be<00:04:34.490> issues<00:04:34.970> and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
fight and there can still be issues and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.240 
fight and there can still be issues and
in<00:04:35.990> fact<00:04:36.140> I<00:04:36.320> think<00:04:36.380> we<00:04:36.590> have<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.740> couple<00:04:36.919> deaths

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
in fact I think we have a couple deaths

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.190 
in fact I think we have a couple deaths
just<00:04:37.850> before<00:04:38.180> we<00:04:38.360> kill<00:04:38.540> them<00:04:38.660> get<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.020> kill

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
just before we kill them get the kill

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.140 
just before we kill them get the kill
here

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
here

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.470 
here
because<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:41.020> spike<00:04:41.200> damage<00:04:42.240> combined<00:04:43.240> with

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
because of spike damage combined with

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.660 
because of spike damage combined with
the<00:04:44.350> spin<00:04:44.650> if<00:04:44.830> he's<00:04:44.950> right<00:04:45.070> on<00:04:45.130> top<00:04:45.370> of<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.580> is

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
the spin if he's right on top of you is

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.330 
the spin if he's right on top of you is
pretty<00:04:45.910> hip<00:04:46.120> heavy<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.900> if<00:04:47.860> you're<00:04:47.980> not<00:04:48.100> aware

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
pretty hip heavy and if you're not aware

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.420 
pretty hip heavy and if you're not aware
of<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.580> damage<00:04:49.180> from<00:04:49.360> his<00:04:49.840> bone<00:04:50.050> storm<00:04:50.430> scales

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
of the damage from his bone storm scales

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.040 
of the damage from his bone storm scales
based<00:04:51.730> on<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.030> distance<00:04:52.390> you<00:04:52.480> are<00:04:52.690> from<00:04:52.900> from

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
based on the distance you are from from

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.350 
based on the distance you are from from
the<00:04:53.110> center<00:04:53.350> of<00:04:53.410> his<00:04:53.470> model<00:04:54.030> so<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.240> does

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
the center of his model so it does

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.390 
the center of his model so it does
around<00:04:55.570> 2,000<00:04:56.170> physical<00:04:56.590> when<00:04:57.130> you're<00:04:57.250> on<00:04:57.340> the

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
around 2,000 physical when you're on the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.210 
around 2,000 physical when you're on the
outside<00:04:57.760> edge<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.300> scaled<00:04:59.200> up<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.440> 11,000<00:05:00.130> or

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
outside edge and scaled up to 11,000 or

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.440 
outside edge and scaled up to 11,000 or
so<00:05:00.400> when<00:05:00.730> you're<00:05:00.850> right<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.120> center<00:05:01.420> of

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
so when you're right in the center of

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.950 
so when you're right in the center of
his<00:05:01.600> model<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.340> can<00:05:03.460> be<00:05:03.550> very<00:05:03.580> very<00:05:04.150> high<00:05:04.450> if

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
his model so it can be very very high if

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.400 
his model so it can be very very high if
you're<00:05:05.080> now<00:05:05.200> watching<00:05:05.590> for<00:05:05.950> that<00:05:07.020> at<00:05:08.020> any<00:05:08.140> rate

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
you're now watching for that at any rate

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.140 
you're now watching for that at any rate
so<00:05:08.710> that's<00:05:08.860> how<00:05:09.010> we<00:05:09.040> handle<00:05:09.460> bone<00:05:09.580> storm<00:05:09.910> and

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
so that's how we handle bone storm and

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.760 
so that's how we handle bone storm and
we<00:05:10.210> found<00:05:10.360> this<00:05:10.540> to<00:05:10.960> work<00:05:11.110> much<00:05:11.350> better<00:05:11.380> than

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
we found this to work much better than

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.380 
we found this to work much better than
sort<00:05:12.040> of<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.220> chaos<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.820> just<00:05:13.120> kind<00:05:13.270> of

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
sort of the chaos of just kind of

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.220 
sort of the chaos of just kind of
general<00:05:13.750> spread<00:05:14.080> out<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:16.210> other<00:05:16.300> thing<00:05:16.630> his

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
general spread out the other thing his

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.260 
general spread out the other thing his
bone<00:05:17.470> spikes<00:05:17.740> happened<00:05:18.220> during<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.610> storm<00:05:18.880> so

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
bone spikes happened during the storm so

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.540 
bone spikes happened during the storm so
you<00:05:19.360> just<00:05:19.450> have<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.660> deal<00:05:19.810> with<00:05:19.930> those<00:05:20.140> and

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
you just have to deal with those and

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.500 
you just have to deal with those and
then<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.670> also<00:05:21.790> mentioned<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.240> was<00:05:22.330> going<00:05:22.450> to

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
then I also mentioned I was going to

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.140 
then I also mentioned I was going to
talk<00:05:22.630> about<00:05:22.780> one<00:05:23.080> tank<00:05:23.670> we<00:05:24.670> found<00:05:24.850> that

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
talk about one tank we found that

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.230 
talk about one tank we found that
healing<00:05:25.990> one<00:05:26.140> tank<00:05:26.440> even<00:05:26.710> on<00:05:26.830> heroic<00:05:27.220> was<00:05:27.970> much

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
healing one tank even on heroic was much

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.330 
healing one tank even on heroic was much
easier<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.840> more<00:05:29.350> controlled<00:05:29.830> than<00:05:29.950> two

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
easier and more controlled than two

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.850 
easier and more controlled than two
tanks<00:05:30.700> simply<00:05:31.300> because<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:32.410> healers<00:05:32.710> don't

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
tanks simply because the healers don't

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.350 
tanks simply because the healers don't
have<00:05:32.980> to<00:05:33.040> spread<00:05:33.250> their<00:05:33.430> heels<00:05:33.730> to<00:05:34.210> two

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
have to spread their heels to two

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.670 
have to spread their heels to two
targets<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:35.460> waste<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.610> lot<00:05:36.730> of<00:05:36.790> over<00:05:37.060> healing

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
targets and waste a lot of over healing

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.370 
targets and waste a lot of over healing
instead<00:05:38.680> they<00:05:39.400> can<00:05:39.550> just<00:05:39.700> spam<00:05:39.880> and<00:05:40.210> use<00:05:41.200> up

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
instead they can just spam and use up

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.220 
instead they can just spam and use up
their<00:05:41.530> over<00:05:41.740> healing<00:05:41.950> on<00:05:42.130> one<00:05:42.310> person<00:05:43.230> so

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
their over healing on one person so

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.110 
their over healing on one person so
that's<00:05:44.590> pretty<00:05:44.860> much<00:05:45.010> it<00:05:45.070> and<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.790> hope<00:05:45.910> you<00:05:46.000> got

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
that's pretty much it and I hope you got

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.230 
that's pretty much it and I hope you got
the<00:05:46.180> gist<00:05:46.480> thanks<00:05:46.810> for<00:05:46.930> watching
