00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
into the plastic ends here now what's

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
into the plastic ends here now what's
really<00:00:48.600> neat<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.050> both<00:00:49.469> ends<00:00:50.100> hold

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

bubbles and there are wands on both ends

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.420 
bubbles and there are wands on both ends
so<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.719> actually<00:00:54.949> use<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> bubbles

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
so that you can actually use the bubbles

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.290 
so that you can actually use the bubbles
it's<00:00:56.610> pretty<00:00:56.820> cool

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
it's pretty cool

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.150 
it's pretty cool

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
now this is what you're gonna have to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180 
now this is what you're gonna have to
realize<00:00:59.489> they<00:01:00.390> both<00:01:00.660> ends<00:01:01.079> unscrew<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
realize they both ends unscrew here to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.009 
realize they both ends unscrew here to
reveal<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.789> wands<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> bubble

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
reveal the wands that have the bubble

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
reveal the wands that have the bubble
solution<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> inside<00:01:04.979> which<00:01:05.670> means

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
solution on the inside which means

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.160 
solution on the inside which means
you're<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.090> gonna<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.510> able<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:06.810> one

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
you're really gonna be able to use one

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
you're really gonna be able to use one
end<00:01:07.470> at<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> time<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:09.090> want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.299> be

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
end at a time so you just want to be

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.880 
end at a time so you just want to be
careful<00:01:09.540> make<00:01:09.960> sure<00:01:10.110> obviously<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.710> end

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
careful make sure obviously the end

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.289 
careful make sure obviously the end
that's<00:01:11.070> facing<00:01:11.310> down<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> end<00:01:12.210> that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that's facing down is the end that

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.969 
that's facing down is the end that
you're<00:01:12.510> unscrewing<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:14.509> twist<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.659> off

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
you're unscrewing here twist that off

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.350 
you're unscrewing here twist that off
we'll<00:01:16.979> pull<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.759> you'll<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.119> that's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
we'll pull it out and you'll see that's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.450 
we'll pull it out and you'll see that's
where<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> wand<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.159> bubble

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
where we have the wand and the bubble

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.899 
where we have the wand and the bubble
solution<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.240> end<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:22.909> blow

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
solution is in this end right here blow

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.330 
solution is in this end right here blow
that<00:01:24.090> around<00:01:24.420> well<00:01:24.689> let's<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.070> if<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.100> get

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that around well let's see if we get

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.410 
that around well let's see if we get
some<00:01:26.549> good<00:01:26.580> Bubble<00:01:27.000> Boy<00:01:28.460> there<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.729> go<00:01:29.880> bubbles

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
dual ends with bubbles but it's gonna be

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.170 
dual ends with bubbles but it's gonna be
hard<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.340> without<00:01:50.520> spilling<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
hard to do that without spilling the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.429 
hard to do that without spilling the
bubbles<00:01:51.479> because<00:01:51.840> there's<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.259> like

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
bubbles because there's really like

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.609 
bubbles because there's really like
they'll<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.659> one<00:01:54.659> side<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
they'll have to do one side here and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
they'll have to do one side here and
then<00:01:56.490> turn<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> around<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.270> other
