question<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.680> assuming<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.250> be<00:00:23.670> directional

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
question is assuming that be directional

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.630 
question is assuming that be directional
replication<00:00:25.019> how<00:00:25.230> many<00:00:25.529> origins<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
replication how many origins of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.849 
replication how many origins of
replications<00:00:27.420> our<00:00:27.660> egg<00:00:27.869> defense<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.470> DNA

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
replications our egg defense is DNA

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.979 
replications our egg defense is DNA
molecule<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.359> let<00:00:30.599> me<00:00:30.810> draw<00:00:32.390> five<00:00:33.390> prime<00:00:33.719> end

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
molecule so let me draw five prime end

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.600 
molecule so let me draw five prime end
here<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.309> three<00:00:35.730> prime<00:00:36.030> end<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.980> here<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.160> on

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
here and three prime end on here and on

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.479 
here and three prime end on here and on
the<00:00:38.790> other<00:00:38.969> strand<00:00:39.680> this<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.340> be

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the other strand this is going to be

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
the other strand this is going to be
prime<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.930> three<00:00:43.770> prime<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.350> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
prime and here and three prime here so a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.299 
prime and here and three prime here so a
region<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.510> replication<00:00:50.960> is<00:00:51.960> visible<00:00:52.860> here

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
region of replication is visible here

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
region of replication is visible here
because<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.390> three<00:00:55.760> three<00:00:57.230> replication

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
because we have three three replication

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.670 
because we have three three replication
bubble<00:00:58.699> one<00:00:59.699> two<00:01:00.180> three<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.140> each

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
bubble one two three and each

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.020 
bubble one two three and each
replication<00:01:02.460> bubble<00:01:03.799> started<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:05.070> one

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
replication bubble started from one

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
replication bubble started from one
point<00:01:07.280> let<00:01:08.280> me<00:01:08.460> draw<00:01:09.830> DNA<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:12.560> probably<00:01:13.560> how

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
point let me draw DNA here probably how

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.109 
point let me draw DNA here probably how
it<00:01:14.070> look<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:18.150> bit<00:01:18.830> earlier<00:01:20.119> so

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
it look at just a little bit earlier so

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
it look at just a little bit earlier so
if<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.960> three<00:01:22.740> bubbles<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:24.049> one<00:01:25.049> two

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
if we have three bubbles here one two

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
if we have three bubbles here one two
and<00:01:26.250> three<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:28.729> DNA<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.060> means<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
and three on this DNA it means that

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.200 
and three on this DNA it means that
origins<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.049> replications<00:01:35.210> somewhere

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
origins of the replications somewhere

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.010 
origins of the replications somewhere
here<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.100> middle<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:39.020> each

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
here just in the middle of each

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.819 
here just in the middle of each
replication<00:01:40.890> bubble<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> second

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
replication bubble so here is the second

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.380 
replication bubble so here is the second
origin<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.579> replication<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:46.070> here<00:01:47.180> would<00:01:48.180> be

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
origin of replication and here would be

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.260 
origin of replication and here would be
sought<00:01:48.630> origin<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.350> replication<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:51.060> have

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
sought origin of replication so we have

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.999 
sought origin of replication so we have
one<00:01:51.750> two<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.860> three<00:01:53.790> origins<00:01:54.689> of

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
one two and three origins of

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.200 
one two and three origins of
replications<00:01:57.380> question<00:01:58.380> B<00:01:58.590> how<00:01:59.100> many

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
replications question B how many

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.990 
replications question B how many
replication<00:02:00.210> forks<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.780> present<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.549> if<00:02:02.549> we

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
replication forks are present and if we

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.179 
replication forks are present and if we
know<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.810> real<00:02:04.469> origin<00:02:05.009> of

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
know that this is real origin of

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.459 
know that this is real origin of
replication<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.840> directional

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
replication and this is be directional

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.910 
replication and this is be directional
replication

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
replication

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.370 
replication
that<00:02:09.099> goes<00:02:09.369> into<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.119> two<00:02:10.690> ways<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:13.170> there<00:02:14.170> is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
that goes into the two ways so there is

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.210 
that goes into the two ways so there is
we<00:02:15.130> can<00:02:15.310> count<00:02:16.650> replication<00:02:17.650> forks<00:02:18.099> that<00:02:20.220> does

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
we can count replication forks that does

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.180 
we can count replication forks that does
look<00:02:21.459> like<00:02:21.520> folks<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:23.140> this<00:02:23.349> is<00:02:23.530> one<00:02:24.010> fork<00:02:25.080> here

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
look like folks so this is one fork here

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:45.030 
look like folks so this is one fork here
this<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.370> another<00:02:27.580> 1<00:02:28.239> 2<00:02:29.200> &amp;<00:02:29.739> 3<00:02:33.390> 4<00:02:34.390> &amp;<00:02:37.140> 5<00:02:38.140> &amp;<00:02:38.890> 6<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:44.040> 3

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
this is another 1 2 &amp; 3 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 so 3

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.580 
this is another 1 2 &amp; 3 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 so 3
replication<00:02:46.030> bubbles<00:02:46.450> give<00:02:46.840> us<00:02:46.989> 6

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
replication bubbles give us 6

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.789 
replication bubbles give us 6
replication<00:02:50.590> forks<00:02:51.959> questions<00:02:52.959> see<00:02:53.200> assuming

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
replication forks questions see assuming

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.190 
replication forks questions see assuming
that<00:02:54.040> all<00:02:54.280> replication<00:02:55.120> forks<00:02:55.540> move<00:02:55.780> at<00:02:56.049> the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
that all replication forks move at the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.140 
that all replication forks move at the
same<00:02:56.410> speed<00:02:56.470> which<00:02:57.130> origin<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.910> replication

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
same speed which origin of replication

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.660 
same speed which origin of replication
was<00:02:58.930> activated<00:02:59.739> last<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:01.769> as<00:03:02.769> you<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.250> here

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
was activated last and as you see here

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.740 
was activated last and as you see here
all<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.150> bubbles<00:03:04.390> have<00:03:05.010> different<00:03:06.010> sizes<00:03:06.880> for

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
all the bubbles have different sizes for

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.680 
all the bubbles have different sizes for
example<00:03:07.780> this<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> biggest<00:03:09.989> bubble<00:03:10.989> and

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
example this is the biggest bubble and

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.430 
example this is the biggest bubble and
eventually<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:14.549> should<00:03:15.549> take<00:03:15.820> longer<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:17.109> form

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
eventually it should take longer to form

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.120 
eventually it should take longer to form
if<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.340> speed<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.269> same<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:20.019> what<00:03:20.680> we<00:03:20.890> can

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
if the speed is the same so what we can

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.220 
if the speed is the same so what we can
say<00:03:21.609> that<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:23.829> bubble<00:03:24.190> will<00:03:24.690> form<00:03:25.690> at<00:03:25.870> first

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
say that this bubble will form at first

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.970 
say that this bubble will form at first
and<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:28.180> bubble<00:03:30.450> form<00:03:31.450> at<00:03:31.660> second<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.500> this

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
and this bubble form at second and this

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.650 
and this bubble form at second and this
is<00:03:33.220> bubble<00:03:35.609> was<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.850> last<00:03:37.090> one

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
is bubble was the last one

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.940 
is bubble was the last one
so<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:41.680> smallest<00:03:42.070> bubble<00:03:43.079> will<00:03:44.079> activate<00:03:44.709> it

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
so this smallest bubble will activate it

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.670 
so this smallest bubble will activate it
last<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:47.190> also<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.489> want<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.030> add<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:49.690> as<00:03:50.410> long

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
last and also I want to add that as long

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.400 
last and also I want to add that as long
as<00:03:50.970> we<00:03:51.970> have<00:03:52.209> three<00:03:53.880> bubbles<00:03:54.880> here<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:56.170> means

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
as we have three bubbles here that means

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.160 
as we have three bubbles here that means
that<00:03:56.620> we<00:03:56.769> have<00:03:57.010> three<00:03:57.310> origins<00:03:57.910> of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
that we have three origins of

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.319 
that we have three origins of
replications<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.459> that<00:04:00.459> also<00:04:00.760> means<00:04:01.150> that

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
replications and that also means that

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.770 
replications and that also means that
this<00:04:01.600> is<00:04:01.780> not<00:04:02.100> bacterial<00:04:03.100> DNA<00:04:03.790> because

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
this is not bacterial DNA because

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.699 
this is not bacterial DNA because
bacteria<00:04:05.760> usually<00:04:06.760> have<00:04:07.269> only<00:04:07.450> one<00:04:07.780> origin<00:04:08.590> of

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
bacteria usually have only one origin of

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.370 
bacteria usually have only one origin of
replication<00:04:09.069> and<00:04:12.120> assuming<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.359> we<00:04:13.870> can<00:04:14.079> say

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
replication and assuming this we can say

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.449 
replication and assuming this we can say
that<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.400> is<00:04:15.609> a<00:04:17.459> eukaryotic<00:04:18.459> DNA

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that this is a eukaryotic DNA

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.010 
that this is a eukaryotic DNA
just<00:04:21.180> looking<00:04:21.900> at<00:04:22.109> this<00:04:22.710> picture<00:04:23.009> and<00:04:24.020> knowing

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
just looking at this picture and knowing

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.249 
just looking at this picture and knowing
that<00:04:25.289> there<00:04:25.500> are<00:04:25.650> three<00:04:26.009> origins<00:04:26.970> of

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:27.259 
that there are three origins of

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.879 
that there are three origins of
replications<00:04:28.340> usually<00:04:29.599> such<00:04:30.599> bacteria<00:04:31.199> like

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
replications usually such bacteria like

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.089 
replications usually such bacteria like
e-coli<00:04:32.250> have<00:04:33.180> only<00:04:33.630> one<00:04:35.090> point<00:04:36.090> of<00:04:36.389> the

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
e-coli have only one point of the

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.330 
e-coli have only one point of the
replication<00:04:38.099> and<00:04:38.550> it's<00:04:39.479> called<00:04:39.810> Ori<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.410> see

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
replication and it's called Ori I see

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.240 
replication and it's called Ori I see
and<00:04:43.009> bacterial<00:04:44.009> genome<00:04:44.669> is<00:04:44.910> about<00:04:46.250> 1,500

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
and bacterial genome is about 1,500

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.610 
and bacterial genome is about 1,500
times<00:04:47.520> smaller<00:04:48.389> than<00:04:49.099> for<00:04:50.099> example<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.729> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
times smaller than for example of the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.520 
times smaller than for example of the
human<00:04:52.620> genome<00:04:52.979> and<00:04:53.360> human<00:04:54.360> genome<00:04:54.720> consists

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
human genome and human genome consists

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.339 
human genome and human genome consists
of<00:04:55.710> 23<00:04:56.400> pairs<00:04:57.090> of<00:04:57.330> chromosome<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.639> have<00:04:59.639> many

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
of 23 pairs of chromosome and have many

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.210 
of 23 pairs of chromosome and have many
regions<00:05:01.349> of<00:05:01.820> replications<00:05:02.820> on<00:05:03.060> each

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
regions of replications on each

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.610 
regions of replications on each
chromosome<00:05:05.599> so<00:05:06.599> this<00:05:06.990> is<00:05:07.169> all<00:05:07.349> for<00:05:07.560> today

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
chromosome so this is all for today

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.460 
chromosome so this is all for today
