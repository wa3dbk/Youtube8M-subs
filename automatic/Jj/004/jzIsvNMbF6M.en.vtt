00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Before being Professor X 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 He was Charles 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Before being Magneto 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 He was Erik 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Before being enemies ... 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 Before being enemies ... -Hello, my name is Charles Xavier. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 It is a pleasure. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 ...They were friends. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 One was hope for peace. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 The other was defined by pain. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 -My son. -Mom 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Their abilities made them different. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 There's more of what you think inside ... ... more than the pain and the fury 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Fate makes them companions. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 You have the kindness, you can control it, you have the inner strength that nobody else has ... 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 ...Not even me. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 SOON. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 People will soon know that mutants exist. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Know the principle of mutants. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 We can become better 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 We already are. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 That will define our world. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Listen to me friend ... 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 ... Killing will not bring you peace. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Peace was never an option. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 X-Men: First Class 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.466
 The story begins.
