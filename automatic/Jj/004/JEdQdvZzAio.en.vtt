00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.860
 at the same cost Remus tries to crack the short of the teammates without 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.299
 that before a record is cracked bru 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.909
 it is in the beginning one is in Qatna is uncertain but then come 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.960
 could carry against losses and it comes more and more information game like that 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.590
 that you can suddenly start to grow but how can I do it all 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 Correct that told me that he himself was looking for information 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.119
 Finally, also in special then to be exciting thing as it is exactly 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.119
 works that Simons is of course bitter 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.470
 yes that would have legally but then told food is already in advance 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.200
 important to know 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.890
 Understand which goals pursues and thus does not build its own grote 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.839
 Erfurt 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.979
 Because Elias Counselors Ways to Keep In Mind is Random 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.390
 now that you had to have the numbers of the two halls episode 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:56.590
 he has just stopped here right now 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 63 and pay equal then has the black superior but 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.820
 usually not much 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.979
 so much too cheap everything happens it's all bad 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.450
 now well 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.310
 Okafor Mommenheim are listed and you have to finally get the same proposals 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.700
 each other's game that he built the same way 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.420
 is 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.080
 "From this one can indeed draw the course of the game further conclusions everyone 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.180
 Player now has such a point and now you're ready for the first thing 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.170
 you do is pull one more slight drag dragon the outer plaster I go 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.140
 secretly provides as additional information and now you can with his 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.390
 Information beginning are as said still relatively few 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.250
 Of course you have to give your number again in every color of the business 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.900
 maybe still very important you can try now 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.370
 guessing certain numbers of each player what my perspective is 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.120
 Let's say that number we expect the critical times that say 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.400
 Citizens sit examples 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.780
 03 here you go, for example, SMI 3 Conzen ensures that makes with the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.010
 two team players where you want and you can see if you have had bad luck 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.490
 that can of course now I'm not here looking for three because unfortunately 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.130
 I already at 50 3 from 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.659
 the profit expectations since 2002 Although I always have it goes 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.260
 think Mar 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.109
 if I performed every night now and that's right 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.560
 then I can go further 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.959
 if I want to with manipulations 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.909
 or I can stop and my family club is this situation 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.439
 leads you have the right to move in the right place 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:21.890
 case 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.870
 Of course I already have the new ascending order who rules now 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.590
 multiplying oneself can make it harder to play because of their end 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.620
 useful information if I can correctly rate it again I can do that again 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.790
 Sort the appropriate place Muller, of course, more 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.360
 Benefits also, but I can of course continue to guess what with the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.690
 Forte does not want to be able to do several moves and thus the complaints 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.370
 a goal can come closer if not, salvation at the beginning we must index 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.219
 not, "said Bluth 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.679
 House has something like that 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:53.349
 I can pass that as well as pitfalls then I have the big one 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.249
 Problem that this additional information kept in the right place 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.939
 of my short and on benches I was here that gives me 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.609
 Really also much information better it would be even here at the 4 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.010
 Dierig also the one-sided cover up 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.110
 and now players will realize these numbers are less than rewarding 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.029
 the St is clear but also under 1 4 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.609
 you three of them are less than 4 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.450
 century 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.819
 Dawson as well as obviously information in addition to the public numbers 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.750
 Out are one and this is not always better was save them that is 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.640
 so the big train "It's my turn that by no means information I can now 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.580
 Roth, I advise correctly 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.539
 I could continue on it 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.819
 At one time these animals or I have to Vattenfall already by myself in 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.859
 Uncovering individual topics in the other games accordingly is natural 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.790
 Clearly, if I had to crack something right, lay down defeat 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.870
 nice 4 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.659
 with that it has to be uncovered that not all game that one has to be 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.999
 they will not be much there in March 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.159
 "Then the whole in a variant game with such hyphens can still do that 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.459
 sometimes very exhausting you can not turn somewhere in the curve 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.359
 and you can really wait for the two of them 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.069
 Of course, he hopes that they are the latest hyphen 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.380
 another has the wm-game are not captured 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.720
 and that in itself is a pretty big additional challenge 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:16.229
 Reason he takes care of until, of course, expects the austerity course 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.650
 Hessen laughs a station wagon laughs me and discovered that 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.620
 notified 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.220
 the idea at da Vinci Code Â»this good location this 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.689
 and concealed a short teaser March 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:31.459
 It brings important rainy games and is seen in the long run 

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:35.419
 but also a lot to Google's Merkel really much superior 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.860
 the only Bavaria two main ways with him that he ascend on stilts and 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.119
 Minister Black, or something like that, actually 

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.949
 all considerations 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.249
 only now that is not always so easy come so he can still one 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.750
 little 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.620
 more tactics do not stop sorting, Qiagen pointed out 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.620
 to continue 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.100
 not that another player type wins second on points because of him 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.270
 faster than me 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.580
 and that is then I'm not too risky that he will fail longer 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.719
 It has to be interesting elements that you can easily control 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.229
 but even on four wheels so-called would suffer the star of the game 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.610
 Baldor is it so that you have to say is not revealed you can 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.039
 only know if the animals 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.009
 APA if you're feeling good then on the pack then better groth than that 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.409
 Reason if someone then wrong way he says what uncovered so there is the same 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.749
 in the beginning really imbalances one actually has almost no chance 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.680
 to the other side of the winery harder to decipher I Daniela 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.639
 then they hit bb + and let up to regulate but then that's on 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.469
 Start with a little luck then when you are with the 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.360
 Whistle the player also has whole history has Wenders or at 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.199
 the simple advantage of this is not that easy Efron 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.370
 Even a simple title is likely to have you doing that 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:50.629
 just not all that too 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.060
 if she is so risky 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.680
 very likely simple 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.940
 the bitter end of the overload today also Petar Lukovic daughter 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.090
 you have won a score according to the wishes of our Zotti 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.600
 more but that may simply by the starting lineup of the phone when what and so 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.920
 Antje Hiekisch lightweight the lightest lightweight so that no 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.080
 strategic important well played then we are looking for easy at the same time 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.880
 but still fast game in between 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.110
 where you were lucky enough to have some of this game but where you are 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.550
 so it has to be exhausting so it's not that easy anymore 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.960
 One thing you can recommend as a family game 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.469
 assess 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.680
 then i would say had also come to beating for memory
