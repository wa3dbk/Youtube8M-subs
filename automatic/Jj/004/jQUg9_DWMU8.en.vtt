 habitissimo tips for your home 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.990
 Hi, I'm Carmen Barahona interior designer and 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.130
 proud ambassador of the highest 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.410
 today I bring to you as advice to explain you a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.140
 little bit the different taps that we 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.480
 we found to cook the kitchen is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 trend every time we spend more time in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.730
 the kitchen and we have to choose a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.809
 suitable taps for our project 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.220
 here we find from the most 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.830
 spectacular that are these 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.340
 industrials that have a very aesthetic 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.620
 pretty for both loft and for a 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.070
 Island cuisine is not rather indicated 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.080
 for island as good as some more 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.080
 simple but also very nice 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.839
 rotating or you find these 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.309
 removable these removable goes very well 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.729
 because you enter at any point of the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.190
 sink and is great for pots 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.080
 great volume I really like this one too 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.030
 because it is extremely thin but 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.030
 it is very good in the amount of water that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.200
 there's a sink and we have some with 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.000
 arc 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.530
 and that I also have a very line 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.299
 interesting 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.520
 I want to teach osuna because sometimes 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.130
 you find impediments like windows 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.259
 that you can not clear that when 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.360
 you have to open you need a tap that 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.150
 you are shocked and then there is the meeting 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.680
 an extremely interesting model 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.479
 because the faucets are down and are 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.149
 this way could open perfectly 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.070
 the window gives the opening and you come back from 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.320
 new with this and this is good since it is 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.799
 that it does not take a second to do 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.159
 the function on the other hand is interesting 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:01.090
 talk about new models of 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.490
 good ecological where you have faucets 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.710
 that have built-in systems 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.009
 osmosis water purification you have 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.200
 it would come out of the water 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.940
 to wash the dishes the water that does not 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.240
 is purified and with this other 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.450
 handle would leave the purified footprint 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.670
 direct to drink or cook good as 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.970
 you are seeing and have a nice tap 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.090
 in the kitchen it 's very easy I hope that 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.620
 these tips have been useful and not 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.680
 forget that if you are going to do some kind 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.120
 of work or reform 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.970
 I recommend that you use a 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.640
 professional because it will always give better
