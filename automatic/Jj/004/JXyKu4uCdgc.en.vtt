00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
trailer first of all this trailer was so

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.650 
trailer first of all this trailer was so
much<00:00:23.430> better<00:00:23.670> than<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.060> other<00:00:24.210> trailers<00:00:24.630> that

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
much better than the other trailers that

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.390 
much better than the other trailers that
they<00:00:24.900> released<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.350> while<00:00:25.529> back<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.949> first<00:00:26.189> one

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
they released a while back the first one

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.009 
they released a while back the first one
I<00:00:26.609> didn't<00:00:26.849> even<00:00:27.060> bother<00:00:27.210> doing<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.599> video<00:00:27.779> about

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
I didn't even bother doing a video about

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.490 
I didn't even bother doing a video about
that<00:00:28.380> because<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.340> was<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.820> complete

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
that because it was just a complete

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
that because it was just a complete
flatline<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:32.099> me<00:00:32.219> there<00:00:32.399> was<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:33.000> nothing

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
flatline for me there was really nothing

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.970 
flatline for me there was really nothing
there<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.050> thought<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.469> worth<00:00:34.649> talking

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
there that I thought was worth talking

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.910 
there that I thought was worth talking
about<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:36.270> however<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:37.410> much<00:00:37.649> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
there's a lot of good stuff in there

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.880 
there's a lot of good stuff in there
we're<00:00:39.360> talking<00:00:39.780> about<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.200> I've<00:00:40.559> got<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> lot

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.580 
we're talking about and I've got a lot
of<00:00:40.920> questions<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.760> well<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> how<00:00:43.260> it's

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
of questions as well as to how it's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
of questions as well as to how it's
gonna<00:00:43.770> unfold<00:00:44.399> first<00:00:45.090> thing<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.480> surprised

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
gonna unfold first thing I was surprised

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.680 
gonna unfold first thing I was surprised
with<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.350> from<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.340> appearances<00:00:47.640> they're<00:00:48.390> not

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
with is from all appearances they're not

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.529 
with is from all appearances they're not
including<00:00:49.530> ant-man's<00:00:50.460> ability<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> grow

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
including ant-man's ability to grow

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.779 
including ant-man's ability to grow
really<00:00:51.960> massive<00:00:52.620> yet<00:00:52.890> based<00:00:53.399> off<00:00:53.610> these

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
really massive yet based off these

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.850 
really massive yet based off these
trailers<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.449> seems<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.020> only<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.469> how

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
trailers it seems it it's only about how

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
trailers it seems it it's only about how
he<00:00:55.920> shrinks<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:56.699> small<00:00:56.969> but<00:00:57.210> he<00:00:57.329> still

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
he shrinks really small but he still

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.660 
he shrinks really small but he still
retains<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.350> strength<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.859> being<00:00:59.460> his<00:00:59.640> normal

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
retains the strength of being his normal

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.849 
retains the strength of being his normal
size<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> thought<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
size and I kind of thought it would be a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.439 
size and I kind of thought it would be a
no-brainer<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.820> would<00:01:02.969> include<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
no-brainer that they would include you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.450 
no-brainer that they would include you
can<00:01:03.629> turn<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:04.019> King<00:01:04.290> Kong<00:01:04.320> size<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
can turn into King Kong size because I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.130 
can turn into King Kong size because I
thought<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:05.760> sort<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.750> will<00:01:06.930> make

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
thought that's sort of what will make

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.260 
thought that's sort of what will make
him<00:01:07.350> useful<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> Avengers<00:01:08.549> later<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.030> but

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
him useful to the Avengers later on but

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
him useful to the Avengers later on but
I've<00:01:09.510> seen<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:09.990> trailer<00:01:10.260> no<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> think<00:01:11.070> him

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
I've seen this trailer no I think him

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
I've seen this trailer no I think him
being<00:01:11.280> small<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:11.970> actually<00:01:12.630> better<00:01:12.840> than

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
being small is actually better than

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690 
being small is actually better than
being<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.530> giant<00:01:13.740> cuz<00:01:14.189> they<00:01:14.310> say<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
being a giant cuz they say in this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640 
being a giant cuz they say in this
trailer<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.360> he<00:01:15.659> gets<00:01:15.869> smaller<00:01:16.200> he<00:01:16.439> gets

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
trailer as he gets smaller he gets

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.289 
trailer as he gets smaller he gets
stronger<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.460> kind<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.759> becomes<00:01:18.000> like<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
stronger so it kind of becomes like a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
stronger so it kind of becomes like a
bullet<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.140> even<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.439> shot<00:01:19.710> where<00:01:19.950> he

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
bullet there was even that shot where he

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.100 
bullet there was even that shot where he
dodges<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> bullet<00:01:20.939> coming<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.900> gun

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
dodges a bullet coming out of the gun

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.510 
dodges a bullet coming out of the gun
barrel<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:22.680> runs<00:01:22.920> along<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.250> gun

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
barrel and then runs along the gun

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
barrel and then runs along the gun
barrel<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:24.000> would<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.330> liked<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.810> that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
barrel I would have liked it if that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.289 
barrel I would have liked it if that
bullet<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.530> fired<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> hit<00:01:26.700> him<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
bullet was fired and it hit him but it

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.910 
bullet was fired and it hit him but it
broke<00:01:27.509> apart<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.200> hit<00:01:28.350> him<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.619> sort<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
broke apart when it hit him to sort of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
broke apart when it hit him to sort of
illustrate<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.700> he's<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.150> stronger<00:01:30.450> than

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
illustrate that he's like stronger than

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
illustrate that he's like stronger than
a<00:01:30.720> bullet<00:01:30.960> when<00:01:31.170> he<00:01:31.259> SAT<00:01:31.470> sighs<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.189> anyway<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
a bullet when he SAT sighs but anyway it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
a bullet when he SAT sighs but anyway it
was<00:01:32.700> still<00:01:32.880> pretty<00:01:33.000> cool<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.659> also<00:01:33.840> included

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
was still pretty cool they also included

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.249 
was still pretty cool they also included
that<00:01:34.590> he<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.860> control<00:01:35.250> ants<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.659> useful<00:01:37.229> for

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that he can control ants very useful for

whether<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.219> actually<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.939> Michael<00:01:57.329> Douglas

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
whether I actually like Michael Douglas

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.020 
whether I actually like Michael Douglas
in<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.020> trailer<00:01:58.290> though<00:01:58.590> he's<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.399> mean<00:01:59.759> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
in this trailer though he's I mean of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.069 
in this trailer though he's I mean of
course<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.299> still<00:02:00.509> need<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> movie

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
course we still need to see the movie

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.959 
course we still need to see the movie
but<00:02:01.409> now<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.799> seems<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.219> weird<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
but now it seems a bit weird just the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.219 
but now it seems a bit weird just the
way<00:02:03.090> he's<00:02:03.210> talking<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.990> way<00:02:04.079> he's

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
way he's talking and the way he's

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.690 
way he's talking and the way he's
playing<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> character<00:02:04.829> seems<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.219> bit<00:02:05.310> weird

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
playing the character seems a bit weird

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
playing the character seems a bit weird
to<00:02:05.729> me<00:02:05.969> but<00:02:06.270> he<00:02:06.570> certainly<00:02:06.840> got<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> lot<00:02:07.229> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
to me but he certainly got a lot of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.900 
to me but he certainly got a lot of
experience<00:02:07.860> Michael<00:02:08.190> Douglas<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.819> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
experience Michael Douglas so what do I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.839 
experience Michael Douglas so what do I
know<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.390> basic<00:02:09.780> plot<00:02:10.050> from<00:02:10.319> what<00:02:10.530> we<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.770> see

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
know the basic plot from what we can see

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.979 
know the basic plot from what we can see
actually<00:02:11.849> seems<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> little<00:02:12.870> bit

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
actually seems to be a little bit

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.530 
actually seems to be a little bit
similar

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
similar

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.429 
similar
iron<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:15.629> you<00:02:16.629> don't<00:02:16.870> want<00:02:17.049> too<00:02:17.260> many

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
iron and to you don't want too many

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.619 
iron and to you don't want too many
similarities<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.489> iron<00:02:18.670> man<00:02:18.939> two<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.569> you

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
similarities that iron man two but you

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.240 
similarities that iron man two but you
remember<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.079> it<00:02:20.409> was<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:20.650> Tony<00:02:20.890> Stark

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
remember in that it was like Tony Stark

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.830 
remember in that it was like Tony Stark
was<00:02:21.400> trying<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.700> stop<00:02:21.939> the<00:02:22.329> Iron<00:02:22.659> Man

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
was trying to stop the Iron Man

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.750 
was trying to stop the Iron Man
technology<00:02:23.560> from<00:02:23.980> falling<00:02:24.370> into<00:02:24.459> other

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
technology from falling into other

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.280 
technology from falling into other
people's<00:02:25.120> hands<00:02:25.359> and<00:02:25.540> other<00:02:25.629> companies<00:02:25.959> hands

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
people's hands and other companies hands

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.660 
people's hands and other companies hands
and<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.560> sort<00:02:26.799> of<00:02:26.859> stuff<00:02:27.010> seems<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.430> be<00:02:27.579> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and that sort of stuff seems to be the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.000 
and that sort of stuff seems to be the
idea<00:02:27.969> here<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.540> Hank<00:02:28.900> Pym<00:02:29.200> wants<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.769> stop

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
idea here that Hank Pym wants to stop

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.880 
idea here that Hank Pym wants to stop
the<00:02:30.280> ant-man<00:02:30.519> technology<00:02:31.359> to<00:02:31.599> be<00:02:32.200> used<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.769> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the ant-man technology to be used in the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.949 
the ant-man technology to be used in the
wrong<00:02:33.040> way<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.849> using<00:02:34.150> Paul<00:02:34.329> Rudd<00:02:34.599> to<00:02:34.750> sort

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
wrong way so is using Paul Rudd to sort

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.599 
wrong way so is using Paul Rudd to sort
of<00:02:35.049> steeler<00:02:35.290> back<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.010> I'm<00:02:36.099> wondering<00:02:36.310> like

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609 
of steeler back but I'm wondering like

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.520 
of steeler back but I'm wondering like
why<00:02:37.000> doesn't<00:02:37.209> Michael<00:02:37.659> Douglas<00:02:38.019> just<00:02:38.290> steal<00:02:38.500> a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
why doesn't Michael Douglas just steal a

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.949 
why doesn't Michael Douglas just steal a
back<00:02:38.829> himself<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.489> don't<00:02:39.670> see<00:02:40.090> why<00:02:40.389> he<00:02:40.720> really

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
back himself I don't see why he really

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.050 
back himself I don't see why he really
needs<00:02:41.290> Paul<00:02:41.680> Rudd<00:02:41.950> he's<00:02:42.280> got<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.609> suit<00:02:42.849> he

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
needs Paul Rudd he's got the suit he

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.369 
needs Paul Rudd he's got the suit he
knows<00:02:43.209> how<00:02:43.359> to<00:02:43.420> use<00:02:43.689> it<00:02:43.750> he's<00:02:44.019> got<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.230> history

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
knows how to use it he's got a history

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.319 
knows how to use it he's got a history
of<00:02:44.650> using<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.159> why<00:02:45.340> doesn't<00:02:45.609> he<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:45.730> put<00:02:46.209> on

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
of using it why doesn't he just put on

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.000 
of using it why doesn't he just put on
the<00:02:46.450> suit<00:02:46.659> shrink<00:02:46.989> down<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.230> head<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.829> there

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
the suit shrink down and head in there

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.619 
the suit shrink down and head in there
and<00:02:48.129> steal<00:02:48.340> whatever<00:02:48.519> he<00:02:48.730> needs<00:02:48.970> maybe<00:02:49.450> it's

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
and steal whatever he needs maybe it's

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.300 
and steal whatever he needs maybe it's
got<00:02:49.750> something<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.049> do<00:02:50.260> with<00:02:50.530> like<00:02:50.889> how<00:02:51.069> in<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
got something to do with like how in the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.399 
got something to do with like how in the
comics<00:02:51.669> like<00:02:51.909> big<00:02:52.150> prolonged<00:02:52.750> exposure<00:02:52.900> to

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
comics like big prolonged exposure to

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.080 
comics like big prolonged exposure to
the<00:02:53.620> Pym<00:02:53.829> particles<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.459> make<00:02:54.639> you<00:02:54.760> shrink

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
the Pym particles that make you shrink

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.550 
the Pym particles that make you shrink
they<00:02:55.389> eventually<00:02:55.629> like<00:02:55.989> mess<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:56.379> your<00:02:56.530> head

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
they eventually like mess with your head

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.159 
they eventually like mess with your head
so<00:02:57.069> maybe<00:02:57.280> physically<00:02:58.000> Michael<00:02:58.629> Douglas<00:02:58.989> is

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.169 
so maybe physically Michael Douglas is

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.770 
so maybe physically Michael Douglas is
not<00:02:59.349> able<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.950> use<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.340> anymore<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:01.359> does<00:03:01.750> that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
not able to use it anymore but does that

about<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:54.010> that's<00:03:54.250> really<00:03:54.579> cool<00:03:54.760> that's<00:03:55.060> a

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
about it that's really cool that's a

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.770 
about it that's really cool that's a
whole<00:03:55.780> area<00:03:56.739> of<00:03:57.389> superpowers<00:03:58.389> that<00:03:58.540> we've

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
whole area of superpowers that we've

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.629 
whole area of superpowers that we've
never<00:03:58.989> really<00:03:59.260> seen<00:03:59.379> explored<00:04:00.010> before<00:04:00.189> and

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
never really seen explored before and

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.800 
never really seen explored before and
particularly<00:04:01.239> in<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.419> scene<00:04:01.599> where<00:04:01.750> he

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
particularly in that scene where he

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.420 
particularly in that scene where he
shrinks<00:04:02.109> down<00:04:02.349> it<00:04:02.620> looks<00:04:02.799> like<00:04:02.859> easing<00:04:03.280> like

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
shrinks down it looks like easing like

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.860 
shrinks down it looks like easing like
the<00:04:03.549> ants<00:04:03.909> nest<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.449> that's<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.720> whole<00:04:04.840> another

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
the ants nest and that's a whole another

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.689 
the ants nest and that's a whole another
world<00:04:05.409> so<00:04:05.799> it's<00:04:05.919> kind<00:04:06.099> of<00:04:06.129> like<00:04:06.220> we<00:04:06.549> can

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
world so it's kind of like we can

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.640 
world so it's kind of like we can
explore<00:04:07.030> whole<00:04:07.269> new<00:04:07.479> worlds<00:04:08.019> in<00:04:08.199> miniature

form as well plus if you can shrink to
that<00:04:10.720> size<00:04:10.989> he<00:04:11.409> could<00:04:11.439> like<00:04:11.709> shrink<00:04:12.009> down

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
that size he could like shrink down

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.520 
that size he could like shrink down
crawl<00:04:13.060> into<00:04:13.299> somebody's<00:04:13.750> ear<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.409> then
