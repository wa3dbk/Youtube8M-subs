00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
of these liquids has been turned off

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.410 
of these liquids has been turned off
okay<00:03:10.770> let's<00:03:11.130> create<00:03:11.370> something<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:12.060> five

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
okay let's create something like five

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.100 
okay let's create something like five
minutes<00:03:12.630> for<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.350> quality<00:03:14.450> okay<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.660> tell<00:03:15.900> us

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
minutes for the quality okay and tell us

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.420 
minutes for the quality okay and tell us
this<00:03:16.459> coolant<00:03:17.459> leak<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.120> burning<00:03:18.510> out

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
this coolant leak it is burning out

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.190 
this coolant leak it is burning out
nicely<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.590> we<00:03:22.590> wait<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.390> but<00:03:24.390> all<00:03:24.660> liquids

nicely and we wait that but all liquids

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.979 
nicely and we wait that but all liquids
are<00:03:25.440> away<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.420> then<00:03:27.420> we<00:03:27.660> continue<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:29.989> thank
