reach research blocks you just hold in

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.670 
reach research blocks you just hold in
writing<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.870> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.140> research<00:00:46.469> for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
writing and if you can research for

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.650 
writing and if you can research for
block<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.280> points<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.480> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
block you will get points if not you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.100 
block you will get points if not you
will<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.899> an<00:00:48.989> error<00:00:49.230> message<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.489> rock

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
will get an error message in the rock

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.979 
will get an error message in the rock
right<00:00:52.110> down<00:00:53.070> corner<00:00:55.850> if<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.809> can

you will get and the more things you
will<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.680> able<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.100> research

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.550 

as<00:01:18.470> you<00:01:18.650> see<00:01:18.830> I<00:01:18.860> couldn't<00:01:19.250> research<00:01:19.610> listen

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
as you see I couldn't research listen

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.200 
as you see I couldn't research listen
but<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.590> can<00:01:21.770> research<00:01:22.010> code<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.970> I<00:01:23.000> can

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
but I can research code and I can

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.740 
but I can research code and I can
research<00:01:23.510> this<00:01:23.990> no<00:01:24.260> account<00:01:25.450> get<00:01:26.450> back<00:01:26.600> and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
research this no account get back and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.840 
research this no account get back and
research<00:01:26.990> crossing<00:01:27.500> or<00:01:28.310> let's<00:01:28.850> see<00:01:29.000> good<00:01:30.850> so

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
research crossing or let's see good so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.760 
research crossing or let's see good so
that's<00:01:32.090> how<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:33.049> get<00:01:33.229> research<00:01:33.650> points<00:01:34.040> and

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
that's how you get research points and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.469 
that's how you get research points and
you<00:01:36.770> should<00:01:36.979> note<00:01:37.250> but<00:01:37.970> you<00:01:38.090> should<00:01:38.210> always

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
you should note but you should always

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.920 
you should note but you should always
have<00:01:38.690> ascribing<00:01:39.380> holes<00:01:39.590> in<00:01:39.890> paper<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:40.700> your

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
have ascribing holes in paper in your

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.170 
have ascribing holes in paper in your
inventory<00:01:41.930> when<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:42.710> go<00:01:43.250> around<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.700> get<00:01:44.000> rid

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
inventory when you go around and get rid

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.260 
inventory when you go around and get rid
this<00:01:44.330> research<00:01:44.780> points<00:01:45.729> because<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:46.940> can<00:01:47.119> get

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
this research points because you can get

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.820 
this research points because you can get
notes<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:49.670> will<00:01:49.970> help<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:51.200> research<00:01:53.830> so

notes that will help you in research so

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.590 
notes that will help you in research so
firstly<00:01:55.429> in<00:01:56.090> recep<00:01:56.570> table<00:01:56.929> you<00:01:57.560> just<00:01:57.890> craft<00:01:58.399> it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
firstly in recep table you just craft it

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.310 
firstly in recep table you just craft it
as<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.810> did<00:01:59.960> before<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:02.690> combine

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
as you did before you can combine

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.880 
as you did before you can combine
aspects<00:02:04.149> like<00:02:05.149> air<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.390> fire<00:02:06.220> into<00:02:07.220> light<00:02:08.890> so

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
aspects like air and fire into light so

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.870 
aspects like air and fire into light so
now<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.130> got<00:02:10.340> four<00:02:10.580> right<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:13.400> remove<00:02:13.730> them

the<00:02:21.050> green<00:02:21.230> button<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.739> research<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.220> now<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the green button to research it now I

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.660 
the green button to research it now I
got<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> research<00:02:23.810> here<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.920> night<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.549> a

got a research here and it's night or a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.930 
got a research here and it's night or a
mystical<00:02:26.150> flight<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:28.070> this<00:02:28.280> looks<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.850> lot

should know if you have more than one
purple<00:02:42.200> dot<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.860> need<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.430> connect<00:02:43.820> them<00:02:43.940> in

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
purple dot you need to connect them in

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.020 
purple dot you need to connect them in
line<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.230> if<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.590> got<00:02:45.980> a<00:02:46.010> purple<00:02:46.370> dot<00:02:46.549> here<00:02:46.730> too<00:02:46.940> I

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
line so if I got a purple dot here too I

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.960 
line so if I got a purple dot here too I
need<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.570> connect<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.350> this<00:02:48.500> one<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:48.970> done

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
need to connect it to this one and done

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.300 
need to connect it to this one and done
to<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.269> one<00:02:50.480> or<00:02:50.989> two<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.560> one<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.010> then<00:02:52.160> to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
to this one or two this one and then to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.640 
to this one or two this one and then to
this<00:02:52.400> one<00:02:52.610> account<00:02:52.940> connect<00:02:53.269> it<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:54.410> that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
this one account connect it like that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.830 
this one account connect it like that
and<00:02:54.920> like<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.900> from<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.079> block

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.370 

so<00:03:00.840> what<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.380> need<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.600> move<00:03:03.600> this<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:04.200> walk

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
so what I need to do is move this a walk

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.980 
so what I need to do is move this a walk
away<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.880> get<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.240> it<00:03:06.360> more<00:03:06.540> space<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:09.390> then<00:03:09.780> I

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
away so get up it more space and then I

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.720 
away so get up it more space and then I
can<00:03:10.290> also<00:03:11.090> activate<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.570> again<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.830> then

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
can also activate this again and then

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
can also activate this again and then
you<00:03:15.210> see<00:03:15.390> this<00:03:15.900> here<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.380> shining<00:03:16.980> yellow<00:03:17.220> now

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
you see this here is shining yellow now

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.120 
you see this here is shining yellow now
so<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:19.080> relaxed<00:03:19.950> symbol<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.620> if<00:03:22.710> I<00:03:22.830> move<00:03:23.010> this

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
so it's relaxed symbol so if I move this

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.600 
so it's relaxed symbol so if I move this
away<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.790> costs<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:25.050> do<00:03:25.170> this<00:03:25.460> so<00:03:26.460> we

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
away and it costs in to do this so we

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.240 
away and it costs in to do this so we
spare<00:03:29.750> I'll<00:03:30.750> do<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.080> too<00:03:31.380> much<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.860> will

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
spare I'll do this too much you will

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.410 
spare I'll do this too much you will
need<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.760> kill<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> lot<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.330> octopi<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:35.420> you

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
need to kill a lot of octopi and you

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.380 
need to kill a lot of octopi and you
can't<00:03:36.720> move<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.940> ones<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.570> glow<00:03:41.300> there's<00:03:42.300> a

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
can't move the ones that glow there's a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.270 
can't move the ones that glow there's a
research<00:03:42.750> later<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.320> game<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.800> makes<00:03:43.980> so

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
research later in the game that makes so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.840 
research later in the game that makes so
you<00:03:44.340> can<00:03:44.490> move<00:03:44.610> on<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.000> stop<00:03:46.130> but<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.310> think<00:03:47.550> in

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
you can move on and stop but I think in

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.810 
you can move on and stop but I think in
this<00:03:48.060> research<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.990> also<00:03:49.290> fired<00:03:49.830> so<00:03:50.490> research

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
this research is also fired so research

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.000 
this research is also fired so research
wire<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.270> here<00:03:52.020> I<00:03:52.170> got<00:03:52.410> fired<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:53.480> now<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:55.010> move

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
wire and here I got fired so now I move

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.170 
wire and here I got fired so now I move
them<00:03:56.190> on<00:03:56.400> right<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:58.140> now<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.260> need<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.620> turn<00:03:59.180> one

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
them on right and now I need to turn one

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.400 
them on right and now I need to turn one
of<00:04:00.300> this<00:04:00.420> off<00:04:00.660> let's<00:04:01.020> turn<00:04:03.710> the<00:04:04.710> light<00:04:04.980> off

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
of this off let's turn the light off

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.480 
of this off let's turn the light off
that's<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:07.710> and<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.130> should<00:04:08.160> note

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
that's like that and you should note

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.710 
that's like that and you should note
that<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:08.910> costs<00:04:09.450> like<00:04:09.930> when<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:10.320> do<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:11.720> so

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
that it costs like when I do this so

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.160 
that it costs like when I do this so
this<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.050> something<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.470> really<00:04:13.800> should<00:04:15.170> do

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
this is something you really should do

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.840 
this is something you really should do
that<00:04:16.440> too<00:04:16.980> too<00:04:17.430> much<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:19.130> as<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.250> see<00:04:20.430> it

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
that too too much and as you see it

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.560 
that too too much and as you see it
didn't<00:04:21.180> connect<00:04:21.450> but<00:04:21.810> if<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.910> go<00:04:23.910> over<00:04:23.940> here<00:04:24.120> it

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
didn't connect but if I go over here it

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.870 
didn't connect but if I go over here it
will<00:04:24.750> connect<00:04:25.050> because<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.950> can<00:04:26.160> jump<00:04:26.640> a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
will connect because it can jump a

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.820 
will connect because it can jump a
distance<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.600> one<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.830> here<00:04:29.490> is<00:04:30.230> a<00:04:31.230> distance<00:04:31.710> of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
distance of one so here is a distance of

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.930 
distance of one so here is a distance of
one<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:33.330> dislocate<00:04:33.900> iv-<00:04:34.290> even<00:04:35.070> have<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.370> here

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
one to dislocate iv- even have it here

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.220 
one to dislocate iv- even have it here
and<00:04:37.720> now<00:04:38.050> we<00:04:38.140> need<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.410> move<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:39.010> fire<00:04:40.230> so

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
and now we need to move the fire so

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.310 
and now we need to move the fire so
let's<00:04:41.410> move<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.620> air<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.430> down<00:04:44.850> here<00:04:45.850> I<00:04:46.360> think

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
let's move to air and down here I think

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.560 
let's move to air and down here I think
that's<00:04:47.530> too<00:04:47.740> far<00:04:48.270> let's<00:04:49.270> see

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
that's too far let's see

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.930 
that's too far let's see
no<00:04:49.660> it<00:04:49.780> wasn't<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.260> now<00:04:51.160> I<00:04:51.190> got<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.520> mystical

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
no it wasn't and now I got a mystical

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.710 
no it wasn't and now I got a mystical
flame<00:04:52.590> nitron<00:04:54.120> so<00:04:55.120> now<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.300> need<00:04:55.570> to

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
flame nitron so now I need to

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.350 
flame nitron so now I need to
right-click<00:04:56.170> it<00:04:56.610> just<00:04:57.610> like<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.180> I

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
right-click it just like that and I

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.970 
right-click it just like that and I
learn<00:04:58.600> night<00:04:58.960> on<00:04:59.140> and<00:05:01.410> because<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.530> mean<00:05:02.710> create

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
learn night on and because I mean create

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
learn night on and because I mean create
device<00:05:03.280> we'll<00:05:04.060> keep<00:05:04.330> this<00:05:05.290> here<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:09.000> the

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
device we'll keep this here and the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.940 
device we'll keep this here and the
combinations<00:05:10.600> of<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:13.150> aspects<00:05:14.050> but<00:05:14.860> you

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
combinations of the aspects but you

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.860 
combinations of the aspects but you
combine<00:05:15.220> you<00:05:15.760> can<00:05:15.940> find<00:05:16.150> them<00:05:16.300> here<00:05:16.480> so<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:16.690> can

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
combine you can find them here so I can

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.360 
combine you can find them here so I can
find<00:05:17.110> locks<00:05:17.580> air<00:05:18.580> pulse<00:05:19.420> fire<00:05:19.630> here<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.650> you

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
find locks air pulse fire here and you

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.000 
find locks air pulse fire here and you
must<00:05:21.490> find<00:05:22.090> them<00:05:22.450> this<00:05:22.840> yourself<00:05:25.350> but<00:05:26.350> it<00:05:26.650> will

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
must find them this yourself but it will

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.290 
must find them this yourself but it will
remember<00:05:27.430> it<00:05:27.700> for<00:05:28.000> you

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
remember it for you

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.540 
remember it for you
so<00:05:29.080> after<00:05:29.320> you<00:05:29.380> research<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:29.770> once<00:05:30.190> you<00:05:30.370> don't

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
so after you research it once you don't

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.799 
so after you research it once you don't
need<00:05:30.700> to<00:05:30.850> find<00:05:31.510> them<00:05:31.630> again

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:36.809 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:40.529 

so<00:05:37.809> after<00:05:38.199> I<00:05:38.259> research<00:05:38.650> it<00:05:38.939> you<00:05:39.939> can<00:05:40.120> find<00:05:40.389> it

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
so after I research it you can find it

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.679 
so after I research it you can find it
under<00:05:40.719> one<00:05:41.559> of<00:05:41.680> these<00:05:41.830> tabs<00:05:42.300> in<00:05:43.300> this<00:05:43.479> case

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 
under one of these tabs in this case

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.959 
under one of these tabs in this case
I'll<00:05:43.900> Shmi<00:05:44.169> and<00:05:44.770> then<00:05:44.860> I<00:05:44.889> can<00:05:45.069> click<00:05:45.279> later<00:05:45.639> and

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
find out how to craft it I will cover

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.760 
find out how to craft it I will cover
this<00:05:49.449> in<00:05:49.629> another<00:05:49.809> video<00:05:51.870> but<00:05:52.870> you<00:05:53.379> find<00:05:53.650> it

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:00.339 
create this item as early as possible

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:04.200 
create this item as early as possible
and<00:06:00.960> then<00:06:01.960> run<00:06:02.289> around<00:06:02.409> and<00:06:03.210> research

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210

everything you can find let's see we can

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.679 
everything you can find let's see we can
research<00:06:07.210> this<00:06:07.479> node<00:06:07.930> now<00:06:09.479> nothing<00:06:10.479> to<00:06:10.509> learn

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:10.689 
research this node now nothing to learn

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.959 
research this node now nothing to learn
about<00:06:10.839> that<00:06:11.199> I<00:06:11.409> do<00:06:11.649> but<00:06:12.339> you<00:06:12.430> can<00:06:12.639> research

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
about that I do but you can research

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.369 
about that I do but you can research
items<00:06:13.180> too<00:06:13.809> and<00:06:14.189> if<00:06:15.189> you<00:06:15.279> craft<00:06:15.610> items<00:06:16.389> so

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
items too and if you craft items so

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:26.269 
items too and if you craft items so
let's<00:06:17.409> give<00:06:17.919> me<00:06:18.039> a<00:06:18.069> furnace<00:06:20.669> furnace<00:06:21.669> I<00:06:23.399> can

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
let's give me a furnace furnace I can

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:32.339 
let's give me a furnace furnace I can
urge<00:06:29.849> let's<00:06:30.849> turn<00:06:31.120> off<00:06:31.270> magic<00:06:31.659> magnetic<00:06:32.110> mode

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349 
urge let's turn off magic magnetic mode

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:35.639 
urge let's turn off magic magnetic mode
it's<00:06:32.889> a<00:06:33.039> lot<00:06:33.159> easier<00:06:33.990> so<00:06:34.990> now<00:06:35.169> I<00:06:35.379> could

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649 
it's a lot easier so now I could

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:38.820 
it's a lot easier so now I could
research<00:06:36.009> furnace<00:06:36.610> and<00:06:36.819> get<00:06:37.020> to<00:06:38.020> fire<00:06:38.259> aspects

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
research furnace and get to fire aspects

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.570 
research furnace and get to fire aspects
and<00:06:39.039> some<00:06:39.849> other<00:06:40.029> aspects<00:06:40.389> from<00:06:40.599> it<00:06:41.370> so<00:06:42.370> that's

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
and some other aspects from it so that's
