00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.680
 section since next to the top 5 the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.420
 strongest poems of each type is from 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.760
 the parties that have visited the most have 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.500
 my channel and now let's start 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.899
 explain how each of them has come 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.760
 them up to where it is 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.440
 Sernas had a difficult path 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.840
 to get to the final in the first 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.630
 round touched him against keratin that ended 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.460
 going through the hairs already bouncing on 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.770
 rooms happened the same with center and what 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.120
 he went really badly to be able to win and 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.040
 when everyone thought that 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.780
 semifinals was going to fall out of beating against 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.000
 on YouTube ended up giving the surprise 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.640
 defeating them without much difficulty and 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.199
 placing himself in the final on the other hand 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.750
 ago you have had a much more road 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.820
 relaxed in no combat had any 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.070
 kind of problem and in the semifinal where 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.840
 I was following the great surprise that 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.150
 he had defeated almost all 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.330
 favorites he ended up defeating him with a 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.420
 sovereign 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.740
 so we have the big favorite against 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.270
 a surprise 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.550
 do you have all the chance to win but 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.070
 may give again be the surprise 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.920
 now we will see it in the end of the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.110
 legendary pokémon tournament if it's the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 first combat that you see first do not 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.070
 there's only the final we look at the whole tournament 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.960
 legendary pokémon but if it's the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.520
 first that you see, I will explain 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.030
 how are we going to do to evaluate the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.940
 winner 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.490
 first we will calculate the stars the one 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.740
 earn more stats will be the winner of this 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.020
 combat in case the stands are 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.030
 tied we would move to the position where 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.250
 they are in case there is also 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.160
 there were a draw we would go to the forms 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.780
 special or mega evolutions and already as 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.180
 last option if they were also 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 tied we would calculate the type 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.580
 of them and with that said we started the final 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.619
 of the legendary pokémon tournament with 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.750
 the stacks of sernas ideas zeus 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.180
 as for health points the thing is 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.330
 evenly there are not even 10 points of 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.480
 difference but narrowly hernias just 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.950
 starting with a 1 to 0 in 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.420
 as to attack although they are matched 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.090
 not as much as in the first place 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.530
 They are also very even but come back 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.349
 to take the hernias so this 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.659
 it's already a 2 to 0 in terms of defense and 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.150
 we can see a difference goodbye you 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.829
 takes a pretty advantage to serbia it 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.069
 finds defense so it starts to 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:43.440
 tracing a 2-1 speed you 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.359
 there are 99 positions that are 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.069
 they take and makes you take back the 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.109
 put on speed so already 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.760
 we have a draw to two in attack 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.769
 special the thing is again quite 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.140
 equaled but by very little I know 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.989
 leads to serbia so we have a 3 to 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.409
 2 and in special defense to zeus get 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.790
 save and tie 3 this fight I want to 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.340
 remember that you won all the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.989
 combats with a lot of ease and never 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.400
 had passed the stands part 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.470
 since I used to win from beating in the 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.840
 this is the first time we're going to 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.010
 move to the position but in position as 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.319
 we can see 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.379
 Sernas is ranked number 10 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.760
 and toilets is ranked number 3 by 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.549
 which true to its name 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.159
