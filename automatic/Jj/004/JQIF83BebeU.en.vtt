separation but I think that your surgeon

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.900 
separation but I think that your surgeon
should<00:02:59.390> at<00:02:59.510> least<00:02:59.660> be<00:02:59.870> informed<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:01.160> timing

it's a matter of what your surgeons
preferences<00:03:50.450> so<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.650> think<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.579> you<00:03:53.299> should

with their phone or have someone else
take<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> picture<00:04:15.169> with<00:04:15.319> the<00:04:15.380> camera<00:04:15.940> it's

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
take a picture with the camera it's

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.210 
take a picture with the camera it's
always<00:04:17.299> better<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.660> see<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.500> patient<00:04:19.099> in

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
always better to see the patient in

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.240 
always better to see the patient in
front<00:04:19.310> of<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:21.010> considering<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.099> you

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
front of you and considering that you

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.700 
front of you and considering that you
had<00:04:22.490> your<00:04:22.729> surgery<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.419> recently<00:04:23.930> I<00:04:24.229> think

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
had your surgery so recently I think

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.920 
had your surgery so recently I think
that'll<00:04:25.190> be<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.430> best<00:04:25.610> thing<00:04:26.030> for<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.570> is<00:04:26.599> to

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
that'll be the best thing for you is to

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.659 
that'll be the best thing for you is to
meet<00:04:27.169> with<00:04:27.349> your<00:04:27.469> doctor<00:04:27.530> sooner<00:04:28.340> rather<00:04:28.520> than

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
meet with your doctor sooner rather than

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.850 
meet with your doctor sooner rather than
later<00:04:28.840> get<00:04:29.840> an<00:04:29.960> understanding<00:04:30.169> of<00:04:30.620> what's

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
later get an understanding of what's

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.640 
later get an understanding of what's
going<00:04:31.190> on

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
going on

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.170 
going on
and<00:04:31.740> what<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.490> appropriate<00:04:33.560> next<00:04:34.560> step<00:04:34.889> is<00:04:35.180> so

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
and what the appropriate next step is so

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.520 
and what the appropriate next step is so
I<00:04:36.210> hope<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:36.510> was<00:04:36.780> helpful<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:37.199> wish<00:04:37.229> you<00:04:37.410> the
