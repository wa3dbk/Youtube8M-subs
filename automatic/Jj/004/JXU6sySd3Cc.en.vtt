yeah<00:00:01.460> it's<00:00:02.460> quite<00:00:02.870> different<00:00:03.870> track<00:00:04.430> scoffs

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
yeah it's quite different track scoffs

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.400 
yeah it's quite different track scoffs
on<00:00:05.580> pass<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:06.089> little<00:00:06.720> bit<00:00:06.870> similar<00:00:07.109> than

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
on pass a little bit similar than

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.860 
on pass a little bit similar than
another<00:00:07.770> like<00:00:08.160> smart<00:00:08.429> here<00:00:08.970> have<00:00:09.210> many<00:00:09.420> tight

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
another like smart here have many tight

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.499 
another like smart here have many tight
corners<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:11.040> quite<00:00:11.340> hard<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.969> either

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
corners and it's quite hard for either

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.919 
corners and it's quite hard for either
because<00:00:12.929> how<00:00:13.469> many<00:00:13.530> heart<00:00:14.040> break<00:00:14.190> points<00:00:14.580> and

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
because how many heart break points and

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.130 
because how many heart break points and
and<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.520> for<00:00:17.520> key<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> concentrate<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.449> for

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
and this for key to concentrate and for

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.470 
and this for key to concentrate and for
black<00:00:19.350> all<00:00:19.560> within<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> same<00:00:19.980> point<00:00:20.520> it's

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
black all within the same point it's

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.120 
black all within the same point it's
difficult<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> good<00:00:22.949> base

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
difficult but if you have a good base

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.570 
difficult but if you have a good base
it's<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> little<00:00:24.269> bit<00:00:24.420> easier<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.310> think

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it's a little bit easier but but I think

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.179 
it's a little bit easier but but I think
will<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.789> nice<00:00:27.050> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> race<00:00:28.410> because<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.949> many

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
will be nice on the race because of many

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
will be nice on the race because of many
points<00:00:29.640> where<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.480> overtake<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.170> other

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
points where you can overtake the other

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.490 
points where you can overtake the other
riders<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.070> will<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.969> will<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.329> nice<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:34.350> of

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
riders and will be will be nice which of

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.119 
riders and will be will be nice which of
the<00:00:34.620> past<00:00:35.130> few<00:00:35.340> line<00:00:36.440> first<00:00:37.440> part<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> is

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the past few line first part it is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.940 
the past few line first part it is
difficult<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.360> get<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.800> know

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
difficult but when you get the you know

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.420 
difficult but when you get the you know
that<00:00:41.730> chickens<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:43.050> difficult<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:44.280> do

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that chickens are difficult but when do

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.760 
that chickens are difficult but when do
you<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> good<00:00:45.300> line<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.289> enjoyed

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you have a good line then you enjoyed

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.439 
you have a good line then you enjoyed
quite<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> lot<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.960> that<00:00:48.960> part<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.710> quite<00:00:50.449> nice

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
quite a lot so that part is quite nice

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.880 
quite a lot so that part is quite nice
but<00:00:52.079> also<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> dallas<00:00:53.070> /<00:00:53.930> it's<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.530> so

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
but also the dallas / it's it's so so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069 
but also the dallas / it's it's so so
important<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.539> funded<00:00:57.780> there

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
important to be to be funded there

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.010 
important to be to be funded there
because<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:59.219> can<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.969> improve<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.600> lot<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
because you can you can improve a lot of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 
because you can you can improve a lot of
a<00:01:01.109> pipe<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> running<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> circle<00:01:03.420> on

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
a pipe is the running of the circle on

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.550 
a pipe is the running of the circle on
the<00:01:03.570> world<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> candle<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.739> comparative

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
the world of a candle and comparative

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.850 
the world of a candle and comparative
it's<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:08.390> difficult<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.780> chickens<00:01:10.229> took

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
it's is difficult but that chickens took

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.420 
it's is difficult but that chickens took
like<00:01:11.390> Silverstone<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:13.200> little<00:01:13.680> bit<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.130> our

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
like Silverstone a little bit but our

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.260 
like Silverstone a little bit but our
defense<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.270> much<00:01:15.810> longer<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.500> ones

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
defense because I much longer this ones

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.149 
defense because I much longer this ones
and<00:01:18.270> then<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:19.350> tight<00:01:19.560> corners<00:01:19.979> like

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and then have some tight corners like

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
and then have some tight corners like
Valencia<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.240> there<00:01:21.869> are<00:01:22.080> many<00:01:22.350> types

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
Valencia but there are many types

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.850 
Valencia but there are many types
corners<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> little<00:01:25.590> bit

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
corners but you know it's a little bit

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.410 
corners but you know it's a little bit
different<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.340> it's<00:01:26.520> nice<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> most

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
different but it's nice but the most

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.340 
different but it's nice but the most
important<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.200> truth

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
important is that the truth

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.770 
important is that the truth
it's<00:01:29.890> good<00:01:30.159> maybe<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.030> hip<00:01:31.180> at<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.420> moment<00:01:31.720> is

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
it's good maybe the hip at the moment is

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's good maybe the hip at the moment is
not<00:01:31.930> the<00:01:32.320> best<00:01:32.530> but<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:33.780> didn't<00:01:34.780> fit<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.110> bump

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
not the best but I didn't fit the bump

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.250 
not the best but I didn't fit the bump
so<00:01:35.619> this<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:36.549> important<00:01:37.060> for<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.299> right

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.300 

are<00:01:43.260> you<00:01:43.320> surprised<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> captain's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
are you surprised in the captain's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.600 
are you surprised in the captain's

here are two for tonight but it would

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.730 
here are two for tonight but it would
fit<00:01:50.520> with<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:50.940> of<00:01:51.120> many<00:01:51.360> creative<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
one of the strongest point but at the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.410
