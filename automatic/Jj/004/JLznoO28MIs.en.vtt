00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.160
 How about friends, I'm Juan Carr, ya 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.919
 I will show you a figure of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.500
 origami origami as you prefer 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.500
 call this is a spaceship 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.150
 this is our spaceship 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.020
 here we have what would be the cabin 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.430
 I send the wings 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:35.350
 this would be the landing gear 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:38.320
 and ailerons well go with the first 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.800
 step the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.730
 get a standard size sheet a 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.900
 folio 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.030
 of size a4 the typical paper that 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.600
 you get in any office or in 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.870
 any study site and what 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.329
 we have to do is simply 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.510
 split it in two we only need the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.730
 half of the folio 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.450
 once we have it this will be the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.509
 result we have half the folio and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.850
 all we have to do is 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.750
 place it that is the first step 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.610
 we fold them in half 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.610
 trying to make it as straight as possible 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.390
 we have doubled it and the second movement 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.390
 it is simply one of its tips 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.390
 fold them 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:39.150
 put them seeing us on this side of here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.630
 we put as straight as possible we double 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.210
 once we have it we open and see 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.790
 that here is a fold we have to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.380
 do the same thing to the other side 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.620
 we take this point 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.060
 we double 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.830
 try as straight as possible 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.870
 and we double 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.770
 we open again 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.509
 and we see that there is one X 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.540
 of the doubles we have made 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:17.550
 the next step is to put both fingers 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.340
 over here and we double focus here 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.630
 and these two points we take off with these 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.970
 two other points 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.970
 so that it stays this way 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.630
 this is the result 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.970
 we have to stay like a tip 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.390
 arrow 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.010
 we do the same with our tips 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.890
 I repeat quickly in case it has not been 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:51.080
 clear we speak here straight we open 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:54.210
 we turn to the other straight side we open 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.069
 we have the X 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.630
 we doubled through the center 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.790
 and let's go here 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.550
 so we have this left 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.550
 once we have this 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.880
 we doubled this piece from here to 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.880
 in more or less a finger 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:25.099
 it's pretty much a finger and we doubled to 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.099
 that we do not lose the form 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.420
 we do the same to the other side by 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.580
 here 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.580
 we bend the rectum 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.730
 and we doubled here in the center so that 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.470
 lose the shape of the triangle 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.510
 once arrived here the only thing that 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.379
 we have to choose is any of the 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.230
 tips we have this for example and what 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:55.660
 let's do this little piece here what 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.510
 we doubled through the center 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.590
 we go like this and do the same with 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.269
 this other side 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.269
 We bend over here 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.200
 This would be the booth ship 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.090
 agreement once we have this what 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.540
 only thing that we have to do is fit 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.540
 these two points to these two holes 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.760
 that we are left here 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.760
 we just folded a little here 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.900
 without doubling completely just to be able 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.900
 fit the 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.190
 we fit them inside 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.880
 We try to go all the way up 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.910
 Here you slip up and give butt 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.640
 once we have it simply 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.630
 we doubled trying not to leave many 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.830
 wrinkles 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.150
 well this would be the base of our ship 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.390
 now only the details remain 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.230
 let's look at the landing gear 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.420
 we simply double here 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.400
 guiding us along the same line of 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.560
 cabin this line here 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.860
 we double 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.860
 on the other side the same thing where we're like that 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:18.320
 that's how our landing gear is 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:23.110
 perfect and the ailerons simply 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.110
 we fold this part of here very little 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.290
 it is more than an ornament but if 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.729
 you want, you can also leave without him 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.370
 aileron 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.660
 just like to do it a little more 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.130
 curious about what is already 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:41.590
 and here is finally here we have 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.460
 our spaceship 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.520
 it's something very interesting very curious and if 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.100
 you have children or some child for sure 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.100
 I would raze with this little figure
