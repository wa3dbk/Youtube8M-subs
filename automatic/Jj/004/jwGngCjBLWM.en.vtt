00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
get on with this demo so this is the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.689 
get on with this demo so this is the
wand<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.559> can<00:00:48.679> see<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.039> bristles<00:00:49.309> on

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
wand and you can see the bristles on

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.630 
wand and you can see the bristles on
there<00:00:49.969> it's<00:00:50.870> very<00:00:51.079> different<00:00:51.519> it's<00:00:52.519> almost

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
there it's very different it's almost

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.970 
there it's very different it's almost
like<00:00:52.850> a<00:00:52.940> butterfly<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:53.600> it's<00:00:53.749> very<00:00:53.899> small<00:00:54.289> when

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
like a butterfly so it's very small when

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.709 
like a butterfly so it's very small when
it<00:00:55.129> begins<00:00:55.399> at<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.670> tip<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.120> then<00:00:56.239> gets<00:00:56.449> wider

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
it begins at the tip and then gets wider

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.750 
it begins at the tip and then gets wider
at<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:56.960> end<00:00:57.140> so<00:00:57.769> you<00:00:57.800> have<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.010> lot<00:00:58.219> of<00:00:58.249> control

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
at the end so you have a lot of control

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.500 
at the end so you have a lot of control
when<00:00:58.879> you're<00:00:59.030> putting<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.359> mascara<00:00:59.780> on

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.880 

okay<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> first<00:01:03.809> thing<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.619> put<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
okay so the first thing is I put a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
okay so the first thing is I put a
couple<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.369> coats<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.659> looks<00:01:06.869> like

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
couple of coats on and it looks like

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.469 
couple of coats on and it looks like
this<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.820> just<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
this and what you do is you just take it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.280 
this and what you do is you just take it
and<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:10.740> run<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.100> through<00:01:11.280> your<00:01:11.340> lashes<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> as

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
and you run it through your lashes so as

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.570 
and you run it through your lashes so as
you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.950> didn't<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.369> any

you can see like I didn't have any
eyelashes<00:01:15.270> before<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.770> pretty<00:01:17.009> sad<00:01:17.310> but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.880 
kind of stick straight so if you need to
curl<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> i<00:01:44.940> recommend<00:01:45.360> doing<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.569> first<00:01:46.050> but

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
curl it i recommend doing that first but

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.649 
curl it i recommend doing that first but
i<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.159> how<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> grabs<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:48.060> lashes<00:01:48.300> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
i like how it grabs my lashes it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.910 
i like how it grabs my lashes it
actually<00:01:48.810> lengthens<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.679> you<00:01:49.770> can

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
actually lengthens them and you can

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.210 
actually lengthens them and you can
actually<00:01:50.039> feel<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:51.350> bristles<00:01:52.350> pulling<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
actually feel the bristles pulling and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.930 
actually feel the bristles pulling and
stretching<00:01:53.580> my<00:01:54.270> eyelashes<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.159> one

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
stretching my eyelashes so that is one

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.980 
stretching my eyelashes so that is one
coat<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:58.649> looks<00:01:58.950> fantastic<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> let's<00:02:00.630> dip<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
coat it looks fantastic so let's dip it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.139 
coat it looks fantastic so let's dip it
again<00:02:01.289> I<00:02:01.619> want<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.369> do<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.670> use<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.880> little

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
again I want to do is I use that little

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.350 
again I want to do is I use that little
butterfly<00:02:03.770> part<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.550> like<00:02:06.300> that<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:08.360> let's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
butterfly part but like that and let's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.990 
butterfly part but like that and let's
do<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.599> again

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.420 

I<00:02:14.060> don't<00:02:14.780> think<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.260> clumpy<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.130> think

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
I don't think that it's clumpy I think

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.290 
I don't think that it's clumpy I think
it's<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.610> nice<00:02:16.930> wet<00:02:17.930> formula<00:02:18.830> if<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.460> if

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
it's a nice wet formula if you think if

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.030 
it's a nice wet formula if you think if
you<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.600> dryer<00:02:20.900> formula<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.530> isn't<00:02:21.860> for

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
you like a dryer formula this isn't for

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.250 
you like a dryer formula this isn't for
you<00:02:22.130> but<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.490> like<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> wet<00:02:23.020> formula<00:02:24.020> like<00:02:24.230> this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
you but be like a wet formula like this

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.650 
you but be like a wet formula like this
I<00:02:24.740> think<00:02:25.370> it's<00:02:25.460> great<00:02:25.670> okay<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.150> let's<00:02:26.420> try<00:02:26.600> the

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
what I like about it is that when you

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.460 
what I like about it is that when you
wash<00:03:46.489> it<00:03:46.790> it<00:03:47.180> comes<00:03:47.420> off<00:03:47.600> flip<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:48.049> says<00:03:48.260> soap
