this thing no I thought about it and
seriously<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> think<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:21.520> not<00:02:21.790> even<00:02:21.820> an

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
seriously I think it's not even an

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150 
seriously I think it's not even an
escape<00:02:22.450> pod<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.690> think<00:02:23.140> it's<00:02:23.290> meant<00:02:23.500> come<00:02:23.860> I

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160

escape pod I think it's meant come I
think<00:02:24.220> it's<00:02:24.520> entirely<00:02:24.850> meant<00:02:25.210> it's<00:02:25.360> a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
think it's entirely meant it's a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.080 
think it's entirely meant it's a
surprise<00:02:25.870> trap<00:02:26.550> although<00:02:27.550> why<00:02:27.760> they<00:02:27.970> would
