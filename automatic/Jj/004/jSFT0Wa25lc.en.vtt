00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
at the first one which i have to think

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.020 
at the first one which i have to think
is<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.409> bad<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.920> one<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> said<00:01:14.880> hey

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
is just as bad as this one and said hey

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
is just as bad as this one and said hey
we<00:01:15.600> should<00:01:15.810> make<00:01:15.960> another<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.619> that's

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
we should make another one that's

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.160 
we should make another one that's
literally<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> last<00:01:18.240> conclusion<00:01:19.020> i<00:01:19.110> would

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
literally the last conclusion i would

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.740 
literally the last conclusion i would
have<00:01:19.350> reached<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> play<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.330> raven
