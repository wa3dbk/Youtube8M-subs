really thick foam padding it's very nice
that<00:03:02.079> they<00:03:02.380> did<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:03.069> because<00:03:03.850> these<00:03:04.120> laptops

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
that they did that because these laptops

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.199 
that they did that because these laptops
are<00:03:04.810> not<00:03:04.959> cheap<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:07.389> then<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:08.470> get<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:08.829> red

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
are not cheap and then you get this red

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.539 
are not cheap and then you get this red
felt<00:03:10.209> case<00:03:10.540> for<00:03:10.959> your<00:03:11.019> laptop<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.370> that's

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
felt case for your laptop so that's

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.170 
felt case for your laptop so that's
really<00:03:13.239> cool<00:03:13.569> that<00:03:14.079> they<00:03:14.230> included<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:15.180> I'm

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
really cool that they included that I'm

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:26.229 
really cool that they included that I'm
just<00:03:16.329> gonna<00:03:17.340> this

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.530 

there<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.420> go<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.560> on<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.830> side<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:30.510> have

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
there you go so on this side you have

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.860 
there you go so on this side you have
the<00:03:30.989> SD<00:03:31.590> card<00:03:31.860> reader<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.909> believe<00:03:33.360> I

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the SD card reader and I believe I

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.580 
the SD card reader and I believe I
believe<00:03:34.849> that<00:03:35.849> is<00:03:36.090> a<00:03:36.120> M<00:03:36.420> if<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.349> sim

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
believe that is a M if you have a sim

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.740 
believe that is a M if you have a sim
card<00:03:37.620> which<00:03:38.579> every<00:03:38.909> phone<00:03:39.090> has<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.360> SIM<00:03:39.540> card

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
card which every phone has the SIM card

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.830 
card which every phone has the SIM card
so<00:03:39.930> stupid<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:40.650> say<00:03:40.860> if<00:03:41.129> but<00:03:41.819> for<00:03:42.540> your<00:03:42.629> SIM

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
so stupid to say if but for your SIM

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.479 
so stupid to say if but for your SIM
card<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.409> can<00:03:43.620> put<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:43.980> there<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.370> then

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
card you can put it in there and then

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.750 
card you can put it in there and then
you<00:03:44.579> can<00:03:44.730> get<00:03:44.849> 3G<00:03:45.360> or<00:03:45.390> 4G<00:03:45.540> access<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.709> think<00:03:46.760> then

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
you can get 3G or 4G access I think then

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.369 
you can get 3G or 4G access I think then
you<00:03:47.790> got<00:03:48.000> dual<00:03:48.269> headphone<00:03:48.569> jacks<00:03:49.079> a

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
you got dual headphone jacks a

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.210 
you got dual headphone jacks a

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
port HDMI out and a VGA then on the back

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.259 
port HDMI out and a VGA then on the back
you<00:04:00.120> got<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.299> vent<00:04:00.599> right<00:04:00.840> here<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.790> then<00:04:02.970> just

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
you got a vent right here and then just

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.149 
you got a vent right here and then just
the<00:04:03.390> power<00:04:03.599> plug<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.500> that's<00:04:04.650> really<00:04:04.799> nice<00:04:05.010> I

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
the power plug so that's really nice I

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.699 
the power plug so that's really nice I
like<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.370> when<00:04:05.579> power<00:04:05.849> plugs<00:04:06.060> on<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.329> back

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
like it when power plugs on the back

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.869 
like it when power plugs on the back
then<00:04:07.709> on<00:04:07.829> this<00:04:08.010> side<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.989> have<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.200> ethernet

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
then on this side you have the ethernet

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.770 
then on this side you have the ethernet
2<00:04:11.879> USB<00:04:12.510> 3.0<00:04:13.409> and<00:04:13.799> a<00:04:14.459> Kensington<00:04:14.670> lock<00:04:15.030> also

and capslock indicators so they're
really<00:05:29.130> small<00:05:29.370> little<00:05:29.669> dots<00:05:29.880> in<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.330> system

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
really small little dots in the system

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.050 
really small little dots in the system

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
but that's such a small thing that it's

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.890 
but that's such a small thing that it's
not<00:05:33.240> even<00:05:33.449> worth
