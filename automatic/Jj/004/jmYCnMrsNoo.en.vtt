00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.470

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.230
 and today one more sniper and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.480
 update around February is that there 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.660
 today is superficial and let swan pq aki 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.510
 kaurismaki pike number 3 referring 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.429
 to that option of entering or not at war 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.380
 by his clan is available for the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.520
 war or not then your clan does not need 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.510
 more kill yourself 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.309
 it's just you're putting that option 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 to be or not in war 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 before the club needed to be crazy 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 to take the local face clear depending on 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
 what he wanted to pursue for war or 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.239
 not then what that whole worry 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.960
 and now no more 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.910
 and then everyone knows on your facebook 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.940

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.190
 team with this image saying soon 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.550
 your clan will have full control of the plan 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.290
 Orge to translate there for you is the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.330
 since usually they put there 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.110
 around 10 am to 11 am every 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.290
 days 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.930
 the next update then released a 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.869
 per day and more ahead and I will show 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.400
 also forum bonus also scrolling 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.100
 but I think the city will be cool 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.420
 for everybody, everyone is going to enjoy it, and I will 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 show you now how it's going to be 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.330
 probably this option screen is 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.329
 or not at war 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.310
 here is the clean screen and what 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.259
 It's probably where we're going. 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.250
 able to put the option of being or 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.920
 not at war 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.409
 You will click Yes, I will. Yes, I will. 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.170
 I'm probably going to be the line. 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.909
 that clan top button wars me 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.280
 I believe it is there you click there it goes 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.380
 for that other box of options and she 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.110
 if you will be at war or 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.270
 not available then this will be the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.460
 I found it very nice option for everything 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.290

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.420

 there and there last but not least 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.720
 important to publicize the team ism 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.500
 what a bonus on the forum and clash site 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.640
 clans 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.040
 where they say we're going 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.050

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.600

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.520

 a guy wants to join his clan 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.010
 You will be able to analyze his life without 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.440
 need to get into his life is just for the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.790
 Profile screen actually so that is 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.800
 very cool too 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.390

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.200
 will enjoy everyone here will use 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.570

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.250
 independent 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.840
 likely to turn around early in the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.170
 I think this update should 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.310
 leave Tuesday at the latest Wednesday and I think 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.720

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.430
