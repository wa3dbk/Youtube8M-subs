00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
that is pathetic and not only is it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.569 
that is pathetic and not only is it
pathetic<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.430> like

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
pathetic but this is like this is like

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
pathetic but this is like this is like
the<00:01:35.790> equivalent<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.720> steroids<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the equivalent of like steroids and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.240 
the equivalent of like steroids and
video<00:01:38.220> gaming<00:01:38.759> because<00:01:39.619> how<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.950> trust

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.600 
and a tactic like this like this is
literally<00:01:51.420> set<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.140> people<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:53.040> want<00:01:53.070> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
literally set up for people that want to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.219 
literally set up for people that want to
play<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.880> game<00:01:54.170> 24<00:01:55.170> hours<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> day<00:01:55.680> 7<00:01:56.520> days<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.729> week

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
play a game 24 hours a day 7 days a week

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.530 
play a game 24 hours a day 7 days a week
because<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.649> said<00:01:58.710> they<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.369> go<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.880> log

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
because like I said they will go on log

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690 
because like I said they will go on log
on<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.110> account<00:02:01.530> play<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> your

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
on to your account play is your

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.719 
on to your account play is your
character<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:04.680> could<00:02:04.829> be<00:02:04.950> asleep<00:02:05.399> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
character and you could be asleep you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.550 
character and you could be asleep you
