00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.680
 good morning let's go with another shot of 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.160
 shoe contact in this case the 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.220
 new and long-awaited dynafit panther 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.420
 I do not know how you know dynafit is a brand 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.860
 of mountain specially highlighted on 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.290
 everything in the world of ski mountaineering 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.480
 with material is tremendously advanced 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.269
 and revolutionaries for quality and lightness 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.309
 and for a couple of years now we have them 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.239
 also in the world of sneakers 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.610
 of the trail 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.040
 until now they had made sneakers for 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.750
 fly in short stretches like they were the evo 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.400
 and the cost of this quarry is the first 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.979
 sneaker that is designed for ultra 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.180
 High mountain technical trail is a 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:08.350
 shoe about 130 euros in weight 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:12.430
 forgiveness 130 euros of price with 355 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.369
 grams of weight and a drop not in the fall 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.729
 8-millimeter heel to toe 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.380
 but the important thing is not so much that drop 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.810
 which is more or less intermediate you to 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.120
 commented as the great rubber distance 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.060
 to the ground a very outstanding cushioning 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.290
 which is 35 millimeters in heel 27 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.780
 pointed millimeters 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.900
 we see then is 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.229
 if you look at it too, it's very important 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.430
 the sole vibram as you can see that 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.530
 comes below 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.619
 It is a sole with several parts 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.960
 differentiated is the black part is the 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.790
 that has more traction and grip here 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.280
 we see a white section that is the plate 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.619
 anti rock and inside a is that green ado 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.600
 all the tacos that come here are very 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.940
 prominent especially the tacos 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.690
 of this green area in the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.690
 back we see is also another one is 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.509
 created blue a little less prominent in 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.909
 all this is the system that in 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.730
 Andean I wanted to call mapping 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.189
 compound and good is a little try to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.900
 adjust to detail in each part of the 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:24.189
 it's what they understand 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.650
 we need more properly we see 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.170
 this type of sole should logically 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.650
 give us a great grip on the grounds 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.609
 technicians we are seeing that in mud it is 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.010
 or in rock is both dry and wet 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.930
 we will be able to do well in the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.299
 first contact outlet with them from 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.099
 about 20 kilometers effectively in the 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.830
 technical parts got a grip and 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.150
 adherence 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.830
 really impeccable now well what 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.180
 it really draws attention and where 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.030
 we think he has worked especially 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.920
 well dynafit is on the theme of the last and 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.640
 the chassis in terms of adjustment and support 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.620
 of the foot as you can see takes us for a 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.620
 side a kind of guide rails 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.730
 that carry the foot lengthwise 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:16.220
 or less subject and snug bears 2 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.450
 stiff balloon heels you see here to this 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.140
 point here too 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.290
 in this same point the two embrace like this 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.380
 the heel is that it is very tight and is 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.440
 difficult to tilt side or the other 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.990
 once we put our foot inside the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.060
 last is not as flat as the abrupt 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.250
 Kadja ni is so pronounced with a 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.410
 bridge as violent as it happens to them 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.140
 the trees for I like have found 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.290
 a very sweet intermediate point where the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.390
 foot enter and fits and goes very subject 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.740
 it's like you can see there is an entrance 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.740
 highlighted here 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.250
 you see here low and this makes the foot 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.380
 go very well subject is followed by back 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.900
 and it opens a little bit just gives a little 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.200
 space at the same time is a norm of which 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.349
 we usually call long and narrow 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.989
 if it's long it's not so close you were 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.180
 well very tight very well measured at the foot 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.970
 in the style of what he achieved at the time 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.290
 new balance with very minimal form 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.000
 striking also how they have taken care 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.790
 the details of mountain protection 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.400
 because the front what is born 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.310
 already goes in the top band but it's really 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.860
 impeccable already with this you can give him those 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.280
 unfortunate punctures and kicks to the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.580
 rocks in a descent that the foot will go well 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.320
 protected a detail regarding the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.850
 Sizing and adjustment is that if 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.210
 you normally wear a 4343 one third in 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.860
 sneakers as the new ones can be 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.560
 balance or the waterfalls by 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.110
 standard references in this case maybe 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.910
 you'll be more comfortable with a 44 which is what 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.300
 same that usually happens with the salomon 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.790
 at least it is my case and I think that the 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.130
 enough people regarding the 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.280
 cover, as you can see, we opted for a 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.050
 classic lace but it has also been 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.529
 worked a lot in adjusting the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.649
 lazada you see details 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.449
 is to be able to adjust the commitment to 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:22.279
 maximum 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:26.539
 I had the tongue a very tongue 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:29.119
 comfortable and the conclusion of all this is 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.799
 that dina cid has created her first 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:33.099
 shoe for ultra trail in high 

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:37.069
 mountain and has done a very good job 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:39.409
 it's not frankly although it's not a 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.059
 Soft and soft rolling on tracks is not 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.579
 that your work so you take them to 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:46.309
 clues you will notice a bit stiff a bit 

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:48.499
 maybe it lasts that same rigidity and hardness 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:52.249
 when we get into technical terrain 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:54.409
 thank delicate or pregnancy is 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:56.269
 because the firmness of support and 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.819
 accuracy of it thanks to the great 

00:05:56.269 --> 00:06:01.629
 adjustment of the last give us a lot 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.129
 quiet to go down like a panzer 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:08.319
 well up here the summary of these 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:11.509
 first dynafit trail panther and 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:14.209
 we hope that the test thoroughly confirm 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.969
 a little the durability of them that 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:18.169
 It would be the only outstanding issue 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:20.379
 thank you for your attention until 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.379
 soon
