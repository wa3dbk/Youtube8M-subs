00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.562
 Welcome to the League of Legends preview patch. 

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:15.536
 I'm Phreak and I'm here with Morell, the chief designer of the champions. 

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:20.390
 Together we will review some of the game changes that the next update will bring. 

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:26.340
 However, this video does not contain all of them, rather we will try to explain what led us to these changes. 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.279
 Shen gets a huge amount of change in the next patch because we're adjusting each of his skills. 

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:34.420
 What is the purpose of these changes? 

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:38.375
 We wanted to make Shen better level during the game. 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.155
 The amount of cured health from 'Vorpal Blade' now depends on the value of Shen's maximum health, even after target hit by the Allies. 

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:49.450
 So even though Shen is more focused on refueling, 'Vorpal Blade' is still useful. 

00:00:49.563 --> 00:00:53.343
 We have chosen a similar approach when adjusting 'Ki Strike'. 

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:59.314
 He will still pose a threat and force other players to attack him, which is the main role of the tanka. 

00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:09.811
 As primary dances like Alistar can stun enemies and have another crowd control, they also prevent enemies from damaging. 

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.233
 Similarly, we approached 'Shadow Dash'. 

00:01:12.373 --> 00:01:16.749
 When Shen hits someone with 'Shadow Dash', they will give Shen less damage for the duration of the taunt. 

00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:22.562
 If they attack Shena, total damage to enemies during team combat will be significantly lower. 

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:27.141
 A frequent complaint of the players was that Shen was much constrained by the amount of energy. 

00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:33.676
 So we wanted to give Shen the chance to restore energy in longer fights, if he plays smartly and takes advantage of appropriate opportunities. 

00:01:33.813 --> 00:01:38.109
 'Shadow Dash' now restores a certain amount of energy that depends on the number of champions pd due to the taunts. 

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:45.939
 So if Shen uses 'Shadow Dash' correctly - for multiple goals, he gets a lot of energy back and can use more skills. 

00:01:46.063 --> 00:01:51.189
 Adding a power restoration property to 'Ki Strike' is another tool to manage energy well. 

00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:55.474
 In addition, his own attacks now reduce the cooldown of 'Ki Strike'. 

00:01:55.563 --> 00:02:00.656
 Previously, he was falling when he was hit alone and at the 'Feint' shield, but the new way is twice as fast. 

00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:07.361
 So if Shen can use it to fight all these new elements, he will gain energy back much faster than hitherto. 

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:13.875
 All of us now consider Sona to be the "best support champion", so we have a couple of Nerf in this patch. 

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.816
 How do we moderate it? 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.250
 All changes to Sony relate to her power at the start of the game. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.440
 Reducing grades 1 to 4 of all auras and returning this power to 5th level will reduce the power of Sony at the start of the game and its balancing will be much more effective. 

00:02:27.587 --> 00:02:31.533
 But what is so fun with Sony, we leave - active skills. 

00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:36.399
 Sony players can think about new things: "Which aura do I want to specialize in?" 

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:43.876
 Because Sona's aura will be greatly strengthened at other skill levels, you can specialize in a certain aura and reach level 5 with it. 

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.174
 This is what makes this decision. 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.867
 Soraka will also go through some changes. We adjust mana spending for 'Starcall' and 'Astral Blessing'. 

00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:57.157
 We also increase the amount of mana provided through the 'Infuse', but will no longer add any Soration mana. 

00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.002
 Why do we apply these changes? 

00:03:00.144 --> 00:03:02.394
 Soraka's adjustments concern two things. 

00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:11.551
 The first is to improve its unique ability to restore mana to allies, and the second is to reduce its immobility in the line to maintain its own resources. 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.149
 By taking away Sorace's ability to cast 'Infuse' on itself, we can make it endlessly mana ... 

00:03:17.298 --> 00:03:20.879
 ... and that the amount of mana needed for other skills will therefore make sense. 

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.440
 The advantage is that 'Infuse' now restores more mana to allies. 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.379
 So in the line you can decide if you want to support someone with extra mana. 

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:39.988
 We also wanted to keep Soraka's ability to have good AoE and harass, so we reduced mana spending at 'Starcall', which compensates for the change in 'Infuse'. 

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:42.399
 Vladimir gets 2 nerf. 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.174
 We reduce bonus healing at lower 'Tides of Blood' grades and also slightly reduce the wound healing of his ultimatum 'Hemoplague' goals. 

00:03:49.318 --> 00:03:51.167
 Why don't we rush Vladimir? 

00:03:51.285 --> 00:03:56.676
 When we lowered the cooldown to 'Transfusion' and mana output at 'Tides of Blood', we liked that it could cast spells more often, ... 

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:59.417
 ... but at the beginning of the game he kept doing it too long. 

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:05.380
 Now that the 'Tides of Blood' healing bonus is being increased, it will "smooth" Vladimir's progress from start to finish. 

00:04:05.522 --> 00:04:11.254
 At the end of the game, Vladimir will still be good at team battles, but he won't be as strong at the start of the game. 

00:04:11.394 --> 00:04:15.801
 For longer games and intense pharmacy, Vladimir's damage was too high. 

00:04:16.097 --> 00:04:22.909
 By reducing the increase in damage for 'Hemoplague' targets, we can adjust this lategame damage without affecting what's fun at Vladimir. 

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.645
