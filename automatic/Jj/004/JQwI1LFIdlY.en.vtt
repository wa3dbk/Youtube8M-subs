supposed<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.769> come<00:03:26.040> up<00:03:26.190> with<00:03:26.989> developing<00:03:27.989> new

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
supposed to come up with developing new

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.800 
supposed to come up with developing new
products<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.190> new<00:03:29.280> trend<00:03:29.790> setting<00:03:30.209> products

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
products and new trend setting products

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.759 
products and new trend setting products
will<00:03:31.709> have<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> complete<00:03:32.580> new<00:03:33.769> architecture

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
will have a complete new architecture

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.210 
will have a complete new architecture
and<00:03:35.600> also<00:03:36.600> we<00:03:37.110> are<00:03:37.260> going<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.650> use<00:03:37.830> new

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
and also we are going to use new

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.360 
and also we are going to use new
materials<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.120> reduce<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.720> weight<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.370> the

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
materials to reduce the weight and the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.160 
materials to reduce the weight and the
steps<00:03:41.850> with<00:03:42.360> mini<00:03:42.780> ii<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.319> BMW<00:03:44.040> are<00:03:44.489> towards

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
steps with mini ii and BMW are towards

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.220 
steps with mini ii and BMW are towards
the<00:03:46.170> megacity<00:03:47.100> vehicle<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.850> have<00:03:48.030> really<00:03:48.480> high
