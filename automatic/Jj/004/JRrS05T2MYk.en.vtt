feeling tired not a good thing to do or
to<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.680> well<00:00:25.859> programming<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.390> managed<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
to be well programming but I managed to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.169 
to be well programming but I managed to
get<00:00:27.960> in<00:00:28.109> most<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.590> stuff<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> posted

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
get in most of this stuff that I posted

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.139 
get in most of this stuff that I posted
it<00:00:30.240> up<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.690> rather<00:00:34.649> well<00:00:35.399> first<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> all<00:00:36.000> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it up so rather well first of all you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.020 
it up so rather well first of all you
can<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.420> there's<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> new<00:00:36.899> button<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
can see there's a new button right and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.510 
can see there's a new button right and
rather<00:00:39.030> than<00:00:39.149> bought<00:00:40.520> automatically

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
rather than bought automatically

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.790 
rather than bought automatically
starting<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> friends<00:00:43.410> I've<00:00:43.530> added

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
starting and going to friends I've added

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.279 
starting and going to friends I've added
a<00:00:44.190> button<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.450> bunch<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.750> settings<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
a button and a bunch of settings of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.090 
a button and a bunch of settings of
course<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:48.379> yeah<00:00:49.379> someone<00:00:49.739> had<00:00:49.860> some

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
course right yeah someone had some

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.560 
course right yeah someone had some
issues<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.969> accept<00:00:51.480> button<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.020> stuff

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
issues with the accept button and stuff

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.830 
issues with the accept button and stuff
so<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.309> actually<00:00:56.309> figured<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.600> more

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
so I actually figured it's actually more

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.860 
so I actually figured it's actually more
likely<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:59.520> image<00:01:00.090> offset<00:01:00.660> issue

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
likely to be an image offset issue

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.959 
likely to be an image offset issue
because<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.829> having<00:01:01.980> troubles<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
because I was having troubles with it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.060 
because I was having troubles with it
myself<00:01:05.240> it<00:01:06.240> wasn't<00:01:06.570> clicking<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
myself it wasn't clicking it for you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
myself it wasn't clicking it for you
know<00:01:08.159> pretty<00:01:08.340> much<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.850> after<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.210> made<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
know pretty much right after I made the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.469 
know pretty much right after I made the
video<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.680> assuming<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.330> an

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
video so I'm assuming it's just an

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.950 
video so I'm assuming it's just an
offset<00:01:12.869> issue<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> i<00:01:13.710> changed<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> offset

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
offset issue so I i changed the offset

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.550 
offset issue so I i changed the offset
in<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.670> bot<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.030> should<00:01:18.210> click<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
in the bot so it should click that the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.140 
in the bot so it should click that the
next<00:01:19.830> thing<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.040> i've<00:01:20.310> done<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.729> i've<00:01:20.939> added

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
next thing that i've done is i've added

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.340 
next thing that i've done is i've added
in<00:01:21.420> settings<00:01:22.790> right<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.509> settings<00:01:24.869> here<00:01:25.110> are

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
in settings right the settings here are

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.340 
in settings right the settings here are
just<00:01:26.220> generated<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.750> you're<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.170> add<00:01:28.320> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
just generated so if you're to add a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.130 
just generated so if you're to add a
little<00:01:28.590> thing<00:01:29.400> here

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
little thing here

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.820 
little thing here
what<00:01:30.409> not<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:31.310> would<00:01:31.490> add<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.790> into<00:01:31.970> here<00:01:32.330> right

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.590 

yeah<00:01:36.830> because<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.850> guys<00:01:37.940> don't<00:01:38.150> need<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.479> know

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
yeah because you guys don't need to know

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.870 
yeah because you guys don't need to know
the<00:01:38.979> programming<00:01:39.979> portion<00:01:40.369> of<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.610> it's

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
the programming portion of it it's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.050 
the programming portion of it it's
pretty<00:01:41.030> simple<00:01:42.100> as<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:43.280> can<00:01:43.340> see<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.580> get<00:01:43.820> some

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
pretty simple as you can see I get some

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.660 
pretty simple as you can see I get some
fields<00:01:44.600> up<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:45.020> auto<00:01:45.320> start<00:01:45.710> visiting<00:01:45.920> I

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
fields up like auto start visiting I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.969 
fields up like auto start visiting I
need<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.360> widen<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.050> spittle<00:01:48.440> do<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.770> just

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
need to widen the spittle do that just

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.340 
need to widen the spittle do that just
before<00:01:49.160> I<00:01:49.369> upload<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.330> update<00:01:50.690> so<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.200> can

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
before I upload the update so you can

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.560 
before I upload the update so you can
see<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.650> entire<00:01:51.740> thing<00:01:51.979> right<00:01:52.970> as<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.450> can

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
see the entire thing right as you can

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.540 
see the entire thing right as you can
see<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:54.409> doesn't<00:01:54.619> say<00:01:54.860> auto<00:01:55.070> start

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
see it it doesn't say auto start

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.520 
see it it doesn't say auto start
visiting<00:01:55.909> friends<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.659> just<00:01:56.810> says<00:01:56.990> auto<00:01:57.170> start

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
visiting friends it just says auto start

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.480 
visiting friends it just says auto start
visiting<00:01:57.680> oh<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.750> it's<00:01:59.900> been<00:02:00.080> cut<00:02:00.290> off<00:02:00.490> but

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
visiting oh so it's been cut off but

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.889 
visiting oh so it's been cut off but
Ivan<00:02:01.700> fixed<00:02:01.970> that<00:02:02.090> pretty<00:02:02.300> easily<00:02:04.630> yeah<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:05.869> I

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
Ivan fixed that pretty easily yeah so I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.870 
Ivan fixed that pretty easily yeah so I
have<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.110> set<00:02:06.259> on<00:02:06.320> false<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.220> check

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
have it set on false and the check

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.699 
have it set on false and the check
bottom<00:02:08.479> one<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.660> automatically<00:02:09.350> check

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
bottom one is automatically check

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.270 
bottom one is automatically check
requests<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:11.380> here<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.800> intervals

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
requests and here we have the intervals

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.320 
requests and here we have the intervals
right<00:02:13.730> check<00:02:14.690> requests<00:02:15.350> and<00:02:15.940> open<00:02:16.940> requests

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
right check requests and open requests

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.740 
right check requests and open requests
menu<00:02:17.570> right<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.590> how<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:19.750> frequency

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
menu right so this is how the frequency

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.990 
menu right so this is how the frequency
that<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:21.050> checks<00:02:21.260> for<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:22.400> know<00:02:22.700> when<00:02:22.880> it

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000

a lot because you know it works better
and<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.990> long<00:04:56.200> run<00:04:56.470> have<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.980> set<00:04:57.340> on<00:04:57.490> lower

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
and the long run have it set on lower

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.660 
and the long run have it set on lower
intervals<00:04:58.530> right<00:04:59.530> so<00:04:59.860> actually<00:05:00.370> that's<00:05:00.460> going

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
intervals right so actually that's going

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.190 
intervals right so actually that's going
to<00:05:00.730> take<00:05:00.880> like<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.150> minute<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.720> recording<00:05:02.170> time

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
to take like a minute of recording time

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.630 
to take like a minute of recording time
so<00:05:02.500> I'm<00:05:02.620> not<00:05:02.740> even<00:05:02.800> going<00:05:03.070> to<00:05:03.250> show<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:03.520> guys

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
so I'm not even going to show you guys

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.100 
so I'm not even going to show you guys
going<00:05:03.970> for<00:05:04.180> that<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:05.970> stuff<00:05:06.970> right<00:05:07.930> it's

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
going for that and stuff right it's

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.780 
going for that and stuff right it's
pretty<00:05:08.440> slow<00:05:08.800> at<00:05:08.980> this<00:05:09.130> central<00:05:09.490> maybe<00:05:09.730> I

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
pretty slow at this central maybe I

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.160 
pretty slow at this central maybe I
should<00:05:09.970> speed<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.510> up<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:12.510> like<00:05:13.510> five<00:05:13.750> thousand

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
should speed it up to like five thousand

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.750 
should speed it up to like five thousand
milliseconds<00:05:14.380> instead<00:05:15.070> of<00:05:15.190> ten<00:05:15.370> thousand

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
milliseconds instead of ten thousand

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.090 
milliseconds instead of ten thousand
right<00:05:17.370> I'm<00:05:18.370> pretty<00:05:18.760> sure<00:05:19.590> if<00:05:20.590> I<00:05:20.710> save<00:05:20.920> the

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
right I'm pretty sure if I save the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.070 
right I'm pretty sure if I save the
settings<00:05:21.400> now<00:05:21.580> it'll<00:05:21.850> totally<00:05:22.180> script<00:05:22.750> bought

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
settings now it'll totally script bought

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.620 
settings now it'll totally script bought
so<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:23.890> something<00:05:24.190> needs<00:05:24.580> add-in<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.210> make

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
so that something needs add-in to make

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.810 
so that something needs add-in to make
 the<00:05:26.350> settings<00:05:26.680> more<00:05:26.890> user-friendly<00:05:27.430> and

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
 the settings more user-friendly and

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.250 
 the settings more user-friendly and
stuff<00:05:28.980> anyways<00:05:30.690> may<00:05:31.690> have<00:05:31.780> noticed<00:05:32.080> that<00:05:32.140> I

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
stuff anyways may have noticed that I

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.650 
stuff anyways may have noticed that I
mentioned<00:05:32.590> custom<00:05:33.460> functions<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.240> stuff<00:05:34.360> for

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
mentioned custom functions and stuff for

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.500 
mentioned custom functions and stuff for
custom<00:05:35.380> tasks<00:05:35.860> so<00:05:36.690> basically<00:05:38.130> oops<00:05:39.510> how

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
custom tasks so basically oops how

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.420 
custom tasks so basically oops how
that's<00:05:40.720> going<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:40.960> work<00:05:41.020> is<00:05:41.410> you're<00:05:42.190> going<00:05:42.340> to

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
that's going to work is you're going to

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.030 
that's going to work is you're going to
take<00:05:42.490> an<00:05:43.210> image<00:05:43.390> of<00:05:43.720> an<00:05:43.870> object<00:05:44.110> right<00:05:44.800> and

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
take an image of an object right and

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.100 
take an image of an object right and
then<00:05:46.140> it's<00:05:47.140> going<00:05:47.350> to<00:05:47.410> tell<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.710> bots<00:05:48.060> to

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
then it's going to tell the bots to

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.200 
then it's going to tell the bots to
click<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.410> right<00:05:50.620> and<00:05:51.190> then<00:05:51.790> you're<00:05:51.940> going<00:05:52.090> to

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
click it right and then you're going to

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.810 
click it right and then you're going to
take<00:05:52.300> an<00:05:52.570> image<00:05:52.720> of<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.170> icon<00:05:53.590> I<00:05:53.920> do<00:05:54.400> what<00:05:54.700> you

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820

want<00:05:55.030> it<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.180> do<00:05:55.480> right<00:05:56.170> and<00:05:56.650> then<00:05:56.890> it<00:05:57.100> would<00:05:57.310> be

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
want it to do right and then it would be

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.050 
want it to do right and then it would be

here<00:06:03.610> anyways<00:06:04.600> it's<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:05.080> general<00:06:05.500> idea<00:06:05.800> and

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
here anyways it's the general idea and

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.310 
here anyways it's the general idea and
that<00:06:06.610> way<00:06:06.820> the<00:06:07.180> bots<00:06:07.390> not<00:06:07.660> completely<00:06:08.170> useless

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
that way the bots not completely useless

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.070 
that way the bots not completely useless
and<00:06:08.830> you<00:06:09.640> can<00:06:09.820> it'll<00:06:10.210> I've<00:06:10.510> already<00:06:10.810> started

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
and you can it'll I've already started

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.810 
and you can it'll I've already started
to<00:06:11.260> collect<00:06:11.500> in<00:06:11.710> it<00:06:11.830> actually

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.700 

wherever<00:06:16.820> it<00:06:16.940> is<00:06:17.180> here<00:06:18.080> I've<00:06:18.229> already<00:06:18.380> started

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
wherever it is here I've already started

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.210 
wherever it is here I've already started
collecting<00:06:19.130> the<00:06:19.430> numbers<00:06:19.729> of<00:06:19.759> energy<00:06:20.389> right

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.220
