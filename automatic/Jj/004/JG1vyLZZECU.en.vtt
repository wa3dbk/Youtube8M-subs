you're about to drive to the right here

you're about to drive to the right here
you're<00:00:32.820> trying<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> make<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.570> more

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
you're trying to make it a little more

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.569 
you're trying to make it a little more
obvious<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.649> you're<00:00:34.860> about<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
obvious like that you're about to go to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.069 
obvious like that you're about to go to
the<00:00:35.850> left<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.180> you're<00:00:36.270> gonna<00:00:36.360> step<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the left so you're gonna step to the

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.330 
the left so you're gonna step to the
left<00:00:37.230> from<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.770> gonna<00:00:37.860> cross<00:00:38.190> over

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
left from there you're gonna cross over

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.799 
left from there you're gonna cross over
back<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> right<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.120> went<00:00:39.360> between<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
back to the right I went between the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
back to the right I went between the
legs<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.260> use<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> regular<00:00:40.620> crossover<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
legs you can use a regular crossover and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
legs you can use a regular crossover and
then<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> dribble<00:00:42.690> you're<00:00:42.899> gonna<00:00:43.020> hop

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
then on that dribble you're gonna hop

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.200 
then on that dribble you're gonna hop
you<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.770> either<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> side<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.910> more

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you can either do it to the side or more

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.639 
you can either do it to the side or more
as<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.360> step<00:00:45.570> back<00:00:45.780> depending<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.350> how<00:00:46.469> your

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
as a step back depending on how your

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.930 
as a step back depending on how your
defender<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.100> playing<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.640> which

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
defender is playing you in which

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.700 
defender is playing you in which
direction<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.719> momentum<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> carrying<00:00:49.620> them

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
direction the momentum is carrying them

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.959 
direction the momentum is carrying them
if<00:00:49.829> they're<00:00:49.980> moving<00:00:50.070> more<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:50.730> then

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
if they're moving more to the right then

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
if they're moving more to the right then
you<00:00:51.000> come<00:00:51.239> back<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> left<00:00:51.750> if<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.260> move

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you come back to the left if they move

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.959 
you come back to the left if they move
more<00:00:52.649> back<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.399> more<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.730> step

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
more back then you do more of a step

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.189 
more back then you do more of a step
back<00:00:54.000> from<00:00:54.480> there<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.719> should<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:54.960> room<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
back from there you should have room to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.750 
back from there you should have room to
make<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> jump<00:00:55.680> shot<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.430> recover

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
make a jump shot or if they recover

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250 
make a jump shot or if they recover
quick<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.870> their<00:00:58.020> momentum

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
quick then you can use their momentum

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
quick then you can use their momentum
against<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.010> drive<00:00:59.190> past<00:00:59.460> them

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
against them and drive past them

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
against them and drive past them
now<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> quick<00:01:00.210> variation<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
now a quick variation on this is to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
now a quick variation on this is to
really<00:01:01.680> sell<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.160> first<00:01:02.460> jab<00:01:02.820> fake<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
really sell that first jab fake on that

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030 
really sell that first jab fake on that
first<00:01:03.600> between<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> legs<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.530> then<00:01:04.769> not

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
first between the legs and then not

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.800 
first between the legs and then not
cover<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.549> much<00:01:05.700> ground<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> second

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
cover as much ground on the second

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.480 
cover as much ground on the second
crossover<00:01:07.500> essentially<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:08.159> you're<00:01:08.250> trying

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
crossover essentially what you're trying

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.280 
crossover essentially what you're trying
to<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.850> really<00:01:09.150> send<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> funder<00:01:09.990> flying

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to do is really send it to funder flying

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
to do is really send it to funder flying
on<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> first<00:01:10.860> crossover<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> don't

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
on that first crossover so you don't

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.910 
on that first crossover so you don't
really<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.780> use<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> step<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
really have to use a step back on that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.010 
really have to use a step back on that
second<00:01:14.369> crossover<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> sidestep<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
second crossover or a sidestep on that

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.510 
second crossover or a sidestep on that
second<00:01:16.409> crossover<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.430> go

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
second crossover and you can just go

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.620 
second crossover and you can just go
right<00:01:17.640> into<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:17.939> shot<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.330> get<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.540> off

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.480 
sell that fake to the left side also one
final<00:01:34.140> thing<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> notice<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.740> left<00:01:34.979> foot<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
final thing to notice my left foot is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.980 
final thing to notice my left foot is
slightly<00:01:35.790> forward<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> left-handed

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
slightly forward I'm a left-handed

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899 
slightly forward I'm a left-handed
shooter<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.100> most<00:01:38.280> players<00:01:38.640> this

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
shooter so for most players this

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.520 
shooter so for most players this
combination<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.720> might<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.079> more<00:01:40.259> effective

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
combination you might be more effective

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.920 
combination you might be more effective
doing<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.159> all<00:01:41.310> opposite<00:01:42.150> especially<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.810> your

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
doing it all opposite especially on your

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
doing it all opposite especially on your
step<00:01:43.170> backs<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.460> right

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
step backs so you can get that right

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.800 
step backs so you can get that right
foot<00:01:45.030> forward<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.420> you're<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> right-handed

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
foot forward if you're a right-handed

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.870 
foot forward if you're a right-handed
shooter<00:01:46.170> left<00:01:47.009> foot<00:01:47.189> forward<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.670> you're

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
shooter left foot forward if you're

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.880 
shooter left foot forward if you're
left-handed<00:01:48.180> shooter<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.049> your<00:01:49.170> lefty<00:01:49.590> do

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
left-handed shooter so if your lefty do

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.170 
left-handed shooter so if your lefty do
it<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> way<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.640> video<00:01:50.850> if

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it the way you see it this video if

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.880 
it the way you see it this video if
you're<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> righty<00:01:51.630> flip<00:01:52.259> everything<00:01:52.649> around

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
you're a righty flip everything around

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.859 
you're a righty flip everything around
and<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> crossovers<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> opposite

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and do the crossovers in the opposite

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.179 
and do the crossovers in the opposite
direction<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.409> think<00:01:55.470> you'll<00:01:55.680> find<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.009> your

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
direction I think you'll find that your

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.069 
direction I think you'll find that your
shot<00:01:56.399> comes<00:01:56.670> off<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> lot<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.270> quickly<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
shot comes off a lot more quickly and a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.600 
shot comes off a lot more quickly and a
lot<00:01:58.200> more<00:01:58.229> comfortably<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.310> video<00:01:59.549> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
lot more comfortably so this video is

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.889 
lot more comfortably so this video is
actually<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> tip<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> iceberg

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
actually just the tip of the iceberg

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.450 
actually just the tip of the iceberg
I've<00:02:01.049> actually<00:02:01.259> got<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> ton<00:02:01.829> more<00:02:01.979> ways<00:02:02.189> for
