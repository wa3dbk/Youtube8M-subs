Sookie<00:02:19.650> was<00:02:20.250> an<00:02:20.370> artist<00:02:20.819> so<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
Sookie was an artist so this is the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.339 
Sookie was an artist so this is the
model<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.370> basic<00:02:24.180> model<00:02:24.349> which

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
model this is the basic model which

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.080 
model this is the basic model which
