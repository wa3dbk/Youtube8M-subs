00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.040
 quite a hard game, we basically 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.049
 expected such a game because they knew that 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.360
 very good team Carpathians 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.160
 control the ball principle this is football to them 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.960
 like they preach him and already 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.439
 the second year they play the same 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.240
 football 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:27.269
 we prepared for this we gave 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.429
 the initiative was given to the field team knowing that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.559
 still appear and intercepts and selection and 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.480
 the middle of the field and there will be zones for 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.180
 backs at the central defenders 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.159
 teamwork you understand yes that her and not 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.019
 there will be some more rounds because this 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.019
 very important element of football 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.699
 feeling your friend's elbow choice 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.040
 really was quite difficult but 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.019
 that reason was more psychological 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.449
 because literally last night 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.850
 some crayfish iraq including swarm 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.570
 match Vladimir receptions signed a contract 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.290
 with metalworker 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.180
 that you understand yes when a person thinks 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.979
 not about their job but think about what 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.170
 will continue to be unknown to us always 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.170
 scary so here it was 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.960
 a certain problem we have left of 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.060
 one player who trains with us but 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.770
 not signed but Dima is my forehead 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.110
 we know well the possibilities too 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.360
 try to sign this football player 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.370
 but there are certain problems new 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.900
 price will try to solve them and the choice 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.760
 really was quite difficult 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.160
 because you see we are not ready physically 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.030
 although maybe we did not lie with blows 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.520
 as football players 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.500
 our rival but in my opinion we are not 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.159
 willing to physically withstand 90 minutes 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.230
 high 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.750
 This is a big problem . 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.020
 direct to me one moment we found our 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.300
 our species whirlwind yaks are not respected for 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.560
 we will demand you tamara in each match 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.930
 do not go out and rich 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.760
 spill dark charisma kimi no pushes 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.510
 from requirements and kiwi go 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.890
 remark on chi and parsing on 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.380
 prompt hours criss-crossing the other team 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.790
 enough sprat from the moment 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.400
 so that the hunn stop things you think and for 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:21.610
 just say the gap in any give them a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.830
 by sight we can find the reason 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.900
 today you can catch and what is the reason 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.900
 I am not adored and on the very issue
