those what I'm holding here is a crash

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.450 
those what I'm holding here is a crash
cymbal<00:00:14.059> and<00:00:15.289> this<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.560> crashing<00:00:17.220> bull<00:00:17.340> as

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
cymbal and this is a crashing bull as

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.230 
cymbal and this is a crashing bull as
well<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.800> ride<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.060> used

well and this is a ride this is used

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.570 
well and this is a ride this is used
much<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.350> hi-hat<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.279> used<00:00:23.519> for

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
much like the hi-hat it's used for

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.029 
much like the hi-hat it's used for
keeping<00:00:23.970> time<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.260> crashes<00:00:25.740> are<00:00:25.890> used

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
keeping time and the crashes are used

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.849 
keeping time and the crashes are used
for<00:00:26.160> accents<00:00:26.779> hit<00:00:27.779> him<00:00:27.900> make<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> great<00:00:28.650> noise

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
for accents hit him make a great noise

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.209 
for accents hit him make a great noise
very<00:00:29.820> loud<00:00:30.029> which<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
very loud which I like and this of

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.639 
very loud which I like and this of
course<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.640> your<00:00:32.759> hi-hat<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.960> had<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> segment

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
course is your hi-hat we had a segment

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.690 
course is your hi-hat we had a segment
about<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.219> right<00:00:36.030> before<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
about that right before this and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.100 
about that right before this and
basically<00:00:38.700> will<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.360> components<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
basically will go with the components of

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.709 
basically will go with the components of
this<00:00:40.920> particular<00:00:41.219> crash<00:00:41.640> cymbal<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.570> with

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
this particular crash cymbal so with

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.650 
this particular crash cymbal so with
also<00:00:43.079> most<00:00:43.320> symbols<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:44.100> now<00:00:44.280> all<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.940> most

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
also most symbols not now all but most

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
also most symbols not now all but most
of<00:00:45.840> them<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.200> much<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> high<00:00:47.340> hat

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
of them are much like the high hat

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.130 
of them are much like the high hat
because<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.270> looks<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> high<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:49.079> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
because it looks like the high I just a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.920 
because it looks like the high I just a
lot<00:00:49.260> bigger<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:51.000> whole<00:00:51.239> outside<00:00:51.449> part

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
lot bigger and this whole outside part

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.529 
lot bigger and this whole outside part
is<00:00:52.649> called<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.039> apron<00:00:53.340> okay<00:00:54.059> makes<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.390> much

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
is called the apron okay makes a much

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.720 
is called the apron okay makes a much
different<00:00:54.750> sound<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> inside<00:00:55.829> which<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
different sound in the inside which of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.459 
different sound in the inside which of
course<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.059> called<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> bell<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
course is called the bell just like the

high hat and this crash as a different
brand<00:01:01.770> different<00:01:02.309> kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.609> style<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.059> this

brand different kind of style in this

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.789 
brand different kind of style in this
but<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> same<00:01:03.660> components<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.619> both

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
but it's the same components they both

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.530 
but it's the same components they both
have<00:01:05.010> an<00:01:05.100> apron<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.939> both<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> bell

have an apron they both have the bell
they<00:01:06.750> both<00:01:06.900> make<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> distinct<00:01:07.560> noise<00:01:08.240> this<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
they both make a distinct noise this the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.929 
they both make a distinct noise this the
ride<00:01:09.960> cymbal<00:01:10.409> same<00:01:11.070> thing<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:11.850> your

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
ride cymbal same thing you got your

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.840 
ride cymbal same thing you got your
apron<00:01:12.330> got<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.049> bell<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.830> rides<00:01:14.130> generally

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
apron got your bell but rides generally

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.289 
apron got your bell but rides generally
are<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> lot<00:01:15.960> bigger<00:01:16.290> wider<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.610> their<00:01:17.880> little

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
are a lot bigger wider and their little

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
are a lot bigger wider and their little
more<00:01:18.479> dense<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.530> don't<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> light

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
more dense so you don't have a light

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.179 
more dense so you don't have a light
crash<00:01:20.970> some<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.740> more<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
crash some as a you have more of a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.179 
crash some as a you have more of a
pinging<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.320> bright<00:01:25.710> pink<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
pinging a really really bright pink a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.490 
pinging a really really bright pink a
sound<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.090> lot<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> stand<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.780> from

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
sound that a lot of stand out from

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.140 
sound that a lot of stand out from
crashes<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.369> used<00:01:29.700> again<00:01:29.939> for

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
crashes and it's I used again for

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.800 
crashes and it's I used again for
keeping<00:01:30.659> time<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:32.600> like<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:33.720> saying

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
keeping time so like I was saying

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
keeping time so like I was saying
earlier<00:01:34.049> when<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.439> buy<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> symbol<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
earlier when you buy a symbol it's a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.649 
earlier when you buy a symbol it's a
pretty<00:01:35.909> good<00:01:36.060> investment<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.479> they're

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
pretty good investment because they're

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.390 
pretty good investment because they're
not<00:01:36.810> cheap<00:01:37.110> if<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.439> get<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> pretty<00:01:38.189> expensive

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
not cheap if you get a pretty expensive

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.310 
not cheap if you get a pretty expensive
one<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> tend<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> like<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> brand<00:01:39.600> zildjian

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
one I tend to like the brand zildjian

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.620 
one I tend to like the brand zildjian
because<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.369> using<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.880> life<00:01:41.909> they

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
because I'm using it all my life they

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
because I'm using it all my life they
rarely<00:01:43.320> break<00:01:43.619> if<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.880> usually<00:01:44.970> get

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
rarely break if they do you usually get

your<00:02:23.670> symbol<00:02:23.940> doesn't<00:02:24.239> split<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:25.140> always<00:02:25.470> make

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
your symbol doesn't split so always make

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.990 
your symbol doesn't split so always make
sure<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.980> have<00:02:26.130> one<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.370> those<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.610> your<00:02:26.700> stand

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
sure you have one of those on your stand

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.610 
sure you have one of those on your stand
it's<00:02:27.209> very<00:02:27.420> important<00:02:27.989> because<00:02:28.050> your<00:02:28.290> symbol

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's very important because your symbol

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.340 
it's very important because your symbol
will<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:28.950> it'll<00:02:29.190> vibrate<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> crack<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
will just it'll vibrate in a crack and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.229 
will just it'll vibrate in a crack and
it's<00:02:31.350> very<00:02:31.560> bad<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.520> then<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> put<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.060> on

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
it's very bad so then you put that on

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.850 
it's very bad so then you put that on
put<00:02:34.080> your<00:02:34.110> top<00:02:34.350> cushion<00:02:34.769> on<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.700> then<00:02:36.860> cinch

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
down the wing nut and then now the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.509 
down the wing nut and then now the
amount<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.620> space<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.010> let<00:02:41.130> your<00:02:41.220> symbol

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
amount of space that you let your symbol

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.330 
amount of space that you let your symbol
move<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.819> all<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.950> like<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.040> Malik's

doesn't get cut off as much thoughts

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.830 
doesn't get cut off as much thoughts
about<00:02:50.790> where<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.420> make<00:02:51.569> sure<00:02:51.600> the

about where I like it but make sure the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.420 
about where I like it but make sure the
wingnut<00:02:52.200> doesn't<00:02:52.739> vibrate<00:02:52.860> out<00:02:53.190> there<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
wingnut doesn't vibrate out there in the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.590 
wingnut doesn't vibrate out there in the
show<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.730> make<00:02:53.850> sure<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.090> nice<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.269> tight

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
show so make sure it's nice and tight

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.759 
show so make sure it's nice and tight
and<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.560> about<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.830> same<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:57.769> whichever

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
and this is about the same and whichever

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.400 
and this is about the same and whichever
symbols<00:02:59.280> set<00:02:59.519> up<00:02:59.750> and<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:00.840> can<00:03:00.959> move<00:03:01.080> on<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.380> a

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
symbols set up and we can move on to a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.430 
symbols set up and we can move on to a
actual<00:03:02.160> plane
