00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
honestly with his growth i thought it'd

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660 
honestly with his growth i thought it'd
just<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> gradual<00:00:45.899> girls<00:00:46.170> maybe<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.250> you

79 overall age of 24 a ball control
dribbling<00:01:13.770> heading<00:01:14.130> accuracy<00:01:14.340> look<00:01:14.670> very

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
dribbling heading accuracy look very

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
dribbling heading accuracy look very
good<00:01:15.000> finishing<00:01:15.479> looks<00:01:15.659> great<00:01:15.900> as<00:01:16.020> well<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
more additions to his physical senses

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520 
more additions to his physical senses
physics<00:01:17.970> tests<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.240> looking<00:01:18.540> tremendous

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
physics tests are looking tremendous

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
physics tests are looking tremendous
overall<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.310> that's<00:01:20.460> great<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.479> now

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the age of 25 he does reach a selfie

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
the age of 25 he does reach a selfie
potential<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.820> he<00:01:24.360> did<00:01:24.509> grow<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:24.930> quickly

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
potential so he did grow really quickly

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.219 
potential so he did grow really quickly
at<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> end<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.070> big<00:01:26.850> leaps<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.420> growth<00:01:27.600> as

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
at the end here big leaps and growth as

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
at the end here big leaps and growth as
you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> plus<00:01:28.799> three<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.310> physical

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you can see a plus three and physical

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
you can see a plus three and physical
stats<00:01:30.270> went<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.570> nicely<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> green
