which led them to the which led them to
19th<00:03:17.579> I<00:03:18.019> think<00:03:19.019> that's<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.290> good<00:03:19.739> achievement

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
19th I think that's a good achievement

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.970 
19th I think that's a good achievement
in<00:03:20.730> their<00:03:20.939> China<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.980> call<00:03:22.980> more<00:03:23.879> fervor<00:03:24.360> and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
in their China and call more fervor and

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.280 
in their China and call more fervor and
yeah<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.370> um<00:03:28.909> that's<00:03:29.909> pretty<00:03:30.599> much<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.780> for<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
yeah so um that's pretty much it for the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.089 
yeah so um that's pretty much it for the
rankings<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.720> one<00:03:33.720> thing<00:03:33.959> about<00:03:34.260> model<00:03:34.859> feel
