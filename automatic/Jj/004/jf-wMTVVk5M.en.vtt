00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello and welcome to the chain 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.720
 video blogs my child born here I 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.719
 introduces you to our latest do-it-yourself 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.849
 made a heart with a knit 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.269
 made with a knit and a yarn 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.429
 iron 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.320
 so for this diy we used a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.600
 knitwear like the one you see on 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.160
 the photo so that is suitable for 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.279
 children ie the deck lula 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.080
 loops make it a wire from the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.000
 wool of the color of your choice 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.529
 and then optionally for the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.990
 decoration you can use some 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.940
 beads and a needle and then a wire 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.800
 so how does the knitting 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 it's very simple so you spend the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 wool inside and then you do 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.500
 loops around nails like 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 shown on the video 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.450
 so then you make a second 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.640
 loop over the first nail and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.699
 then you pass the first loop with 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.399
 a hook over the second loop 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.500
 over the nail to go to 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.510
 inside the knitwear then you 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.449
 pull on the thread that protrudes underneath 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
 to close 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.720
 you then make a second loop 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.729
 over the second platoon 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.619
 as you see on the video you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.210
 skip the first loop above 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.790
 the second loop and above cloud 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.759
 and then you shoot a little bit in 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.159
 below to often close the beginning 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.490
 is going to be done by an adult 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.670
 then the child will be able to do the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.650
 knit so here you go see my daughter 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.240
 who will she do she prefers not to do 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.729
 with a hook but with a small 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.630
 wooden wand like that so she goes 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 so be able to do the knitting in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.070
 all its length and then for 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.079
 finish only it'll be still 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.299
 the adult who will finish the knitting so 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.320
 you cut the thread a little bit more 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.200
 far and you pass the remaining son 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.790
 inside each loop 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.210
 and then you go through the loop 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.290
 over the nail she will go to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.090
 inside so moving on 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.920
 the son who stay inside of 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.410
 loop the fact that it's 1 st and so 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.070
 the knitting will not get rid of a 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:13.430
 once out of the device 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:16.130
 So here is the last nail that remains 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.800
 pass the thread inside the loop 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.690
 the loop goes over the closed and we 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:27.490
 can pull out the knit from underneath 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:30.470
 and here is our knitting finish then 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.380
 to realize the heart and well enough 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.910
 to cut a wire to the good 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.800
 length 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.950
 and then pass it inside the 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.680
 knit that is actually hollow you spend 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.959
 the knitting indoors when you 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.140
 have finished you do in them very 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.209
 quickly you cut you pass the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.220
 knit over and then train you a 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.560
 heart you can do the decoration 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.040
 with pearls if you feel like it 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.900
 so that's it if you decide to 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.940
 make the decoration with the pearls well 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.290
 sure they have to have one and one 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.000
 needle and then you have to monitor 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.250
 the child be very careful so that he 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.930
 do not get stung so here I hope that 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.489

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.260
