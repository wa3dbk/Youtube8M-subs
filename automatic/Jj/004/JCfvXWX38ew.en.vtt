let me show you what I did here first
here<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.200> actually<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.620> running<00:00:13.920> machine

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
here is actually the running machine

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.340 
here is actually the running machine
it's<00:00:14.490> running<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.480> final<00:00:16.139> product

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it's running this is the final product

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's running this is the final product
sitting<00:00:16.650> area<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.890> looks<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> PC<00:00:17.609> but

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
sitting area it looks like a PC but

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.420 
sitting area it looks like a PC but
actually<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.539> has<00:00:18.920> Macintosh<00:00:19.920> components

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
actually it has Macintosh components

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.720 
actually it has Macintosh components
inside<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.449> running<00:00:21.689> OS<00:00:21.840> 10.2<00:00:22.730> so

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
inside of it and it's running OS 10.2 so

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.460 
inside of it and it's running OS 10.2 so
but<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.060> not<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> Mac<00:00:24.510> though<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.109> well<00:00:25.350> it's

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
but it's not a Mac though it's well it's

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.810 
but it's not a Mac though it's well it's
not<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> Mac<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> doesn't<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> Mac<00:00:26.580> case

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
not a Mac it doesn't have the Mac case

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.330 
not a Mac it doesn't have the Mac case
it<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.449> Mac<00:00:27.689> components<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.949> actually

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
it is all Mac components that actually

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.099 
it is all Mac components that actually
Apple<00:00:30.000> does<00:00:30.150> sell<00:00:30.420> well<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:30.750> don't<00:00:30.900> sell

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
Apple does sell well they don't sell

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.049 
Apple does sell well they don't sell
them<00:00:31.199> directly<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.730> find<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
them directly but there you can find the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.940 
them directly but there you can find the
third-party<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.260> sell<00:00:34.500> them<00:00:34.620> how<00:00:34.890> did

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
third-party that do sell them how did

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.500 
third-party that do sell them how did
you<00:00:35.130> track<00:00:35.430> down<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.850> these<00:00:35.969> parts<00:00:36.329> that's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
you track down all these parts that's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.880 
you track down all these parts that's
the<00:00:36.690> tricky<00:00:36.960> part<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.350> tricky<00:00:37.649> part<00:00:37.829> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
finding all the components I'll show you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.850 
finding all the components I'll show you
the<00:00:39.690> first<00:00:39.809> component<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the first component we have here this is

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.610 
the first component we have here this is
the<00:00:41.040> actual<00:00:41.309> motherboard<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.510> g4<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.200> we

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the actual motherboard of the g4 and we

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
the actual motherboard of the g4 and we
got<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.860> from<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.070> place<00:00:44.219> called<00:00:44.250> Mac<00:00:45.059> rescue

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
got this from a place called Mac rescue

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.049 
got this from a place called Mac rescue
and<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> standard<00:00:47.010> g4<00:00:47.430> motherboard<00:00:47.879> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and this is a standard g4 motherboard it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.470 
and this is a standard g4 motherboard it
has<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> 10100<00:00:49.050> land<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> side<00:00:50.030> USB<00:00:51.030> ports

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
has the 10100 land on the side USB ports

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240 
has the 10100 land on the side USB ports
audio<00:00:51.840> everything<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.590> standard<00:00:52.890> motherboard

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
audio everything a standard motherboard

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.040 
audio everything a standard motherboard
would<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.520> okay<00:00:53.940> that's<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.840> first

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
would have okay that's the first

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.569 
would have okay that's the first
component<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.590> was<00:00:55.890> able<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> track<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.460> down

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
component I was able to track that down

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.520 
component I was able to track that down
after<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:58.050> over<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
after that we go over here to the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
after that we go over here to the
processor<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.820> core<00:01:00.059> of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
processor and this is the the core of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.369 
processor and this is the the core of
the<00:01:00.210> operating<00:01:00.420> system<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.079> actually

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the operating system this is actually

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.360 
the operating system this is actually
are<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> operations<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> core<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
are the operations in the core of the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640 
are the operations in the core of the
computer<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.809> gigahertz<00:01:04.170> with

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
computer this is the one gigahertz with

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.359 
computer this is the one gigahertz with
two<00:01:04.830> Meg's<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.159> cash<00:01:05.689> SONET<00:01:06.689> processor<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
two Meg's of cash SONET processor and is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.890 
two Meg's of cash SONET processor and is
that<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.790> an<00:01:08.880> upgrade<00:01:09.030> processor<00:01:09.750> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that actually an upgrade processor that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.240 
that actually an upgrade processor that
is<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.200> upgrade<00:01:10.470> processor<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
is an upgrade processor because you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.530 
is an upgrade processor because you
cannot<00:01:11.490> buy<00:01:11.670> these<00:01:11.850> components<00:01:12.299> directly

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
cannot buy these components directly

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
cannot buy these components directly
from<00:01:12.659> Apple<00:01:13.049> okay<00:01:13.200> they<00:01:13.590> won't<00:01:13.710> sell<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
from Apple okay they won't sell you a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.410 
from Apple okay they won't sell you a
processor<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> go<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> apple.com

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
processor if you go to apple.com

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.210 
processor if you go to apple.com
okay<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.619> bought<00:01:16.860> an<00:01:16.979> upgrade

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
okay so I actually bought an upgrade

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.969 
okay so I actually bought an upgrade
processor<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.200> went<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
processor from them and then I went you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.890 
processor from them and then I went you
have<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> find<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.420> CPU

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
have to actually have to find a CPU

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
have to actually have to find a CPU
cooling<00:01:22.170> fan<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.590> well<00:01:22.619> for<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> processor

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
cooling fan as well for the processor

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.730 
cooling fan as well for the processor
because<00:01:24.450> they're<00:01:24.900> thinking<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.320> an<00:01:25.439> upgrade

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
because they're thinking it's an upgrade

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.749 
because they're thinking it's an upgrade
and<00:01:25.830> they're<00:01:25.920> thinking<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.250> already<00:01:26.520> have

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and they're thinking you already have

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.700 
and they're thinking you already have
the<00:01:27.000> CPU<00:01:27.299> cooling<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.990> don't<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.530> don't

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the CPU cooling but you don't you don't

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.749 
the CPU cooling but you don't you don't
because<00:01:29.040> you're<00:01:29.159> building<00:01:29.490> one<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.640> scratch

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
because you're building one from scratch

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.100 
because you're building one from scratch
or<00:01:30.090> did<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.299> find<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:30.960> normally

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
or did you find it because normally

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.260 
or did you find it because normally
people<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.829> build<00:01:32.040> these<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
people don't really build these for you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
people don't really build these for you
know<00:01:33.360> over<00:01:33.390> nobody<00:01:33.960> really<00:01:34.140> over<00:01:34.380> clocks<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
know over nobody really over clocks a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.749 
know over nobody really over clocks a
Mac<00:01:34.979> no<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.430> don't

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
Mac no they don't

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.140 
Mac no they don't
so<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> did<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.659> took<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> standard<00:01:37.259> PC

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
so what I did is I took a standard PC

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.880 
so what I did is I took a standard PC
CPU<00:01:39.150> cooling<00:01:39.540> fan<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> volcano<00:01:40.439> 6

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
CPU cooling fan this is the volcano 6

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.889 
CPU cooling fan this is the volcano 6
from<00:01:41.130> Thermaltake<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.659> really

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
from Thermaltake and it's really

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.940 
from Thermaltake and it's really
important<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.500> find<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
important what you have to find here is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.230 
important what you have to find here is
you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> find<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.670> will<00:01:44.759> actually

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you have to find one that will actually

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.749 
you have to find one that will actually
mount<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> top<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.590> sit<00:01:46.829> above<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.670> see

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
mount to the top and sit above you see

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.160 
mount to the top and sit above you see
there's<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.210> different<00:01:48.479> circuitry

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
there's a lot of different circuitry

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.960 
there's a lot of different circuitry
that's<00:01:49.350> sticking<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.850> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that's sticking out here you have to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.399 
that's sticking out here you have to
find<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.329> that'll<00:01:51.479> sit<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.899> mount<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.320> there

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
find one that'll sit on mount on there

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.560 
find one that'll sit on mount on there
correctly<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.070> they're<00:01:53.430> actually<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.909> clip

the clip here that's not gonna work you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.980 
the clip here that's not gonna work you
gotta<00:01:56.430> yank<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.729> out<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.149> find<00:01:57.540> another<00:01:57.780> way

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.580 
the sharp and you stick it through and
you<00:05:39.330> Mark<00:05:39.630> all<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:39.870> holes<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.320> where<00:05:40.470> they're

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
you Mark all the holes and where they're

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.380 
you Mark all the holes and where they're
at<00:05:40.770> and<00:05:41.070> so<00:05:41.520> that<00:05:41.669> it'll<00:05:41.940> actually<00:05:42.150> leave

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
at and so that it'll actually leave

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.390 
at and so that it'll actually leave
marks<00:05:42.720> on<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:42.900> case<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.740> what<00:05:43.890> you<00:05:44.010> do<00:05:44.190> is<00:05:44.250> you

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
marks on the case and what you do is you

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.890 
marks on the case and what you do is you
take<00:05:44.550> one<00:05:44.729> of<00:05:44.820> these<00:05:44.910> here<00:05:45.270> you<00:05:45.479> drill<00:05:45.690> a<00:05:45.720> small

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
take one of these here you drill a small

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.870 
take one of these here you drill a small
hole<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:46.590> this<00:05:46.860> is<00:05:46.950> an<00:05:47.039> actual<00:05:47.250> tap<00:05:47.610> so<00:05:47.789> you

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
hole and this is an actual tap so you

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.850 
hole and this is an actual tap so you
can<00:05:48.000> put<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.450> screw<00:05:48.780> hole<00:05:48.960> in<00:05:49.140> there<00:05:49.320> now<00:05:49.740> you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
can put a screw hole in there now you

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.740 
can put a screw hole in there now you
tap<00:05:50.100> it<00:05:50.220> in<00:05:50.280> there<00:05:50.430> I<00:05:50.580> guess<00:05:51.240> it's<00:05:51.419> from<00:05:51.479> Yoshi

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
tap it in there I guess it's from Yoshi

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.630 
tap it in there I guess it's from Yoshi
actually<00:05:52.080> I'm<00:05:52.169> uses<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.530> all<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.710> time<00:05:52.919> create

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
actually I'm uses it all the time create

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.770 
actually I'm uses it all the time create
the<00:05:53.760> screw<00:05:53.970> hole<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.360> then<00:05:54.450> you<00:05:54.539> can<00:05:54.660> actually

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
the screw hole and then you can actually

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.779 
the screw hole and then you can actually
create<00:05:55.260> so<00:05:55.470> you<00:05:55.590> can<00:05:55.710> mount<00:05:55.979> it<00:05:56.100> hard<00:05:56.400> mounted

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
create so you can mount it hard mounted

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.610 
create so you can mount it hard mounted
to<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.210> case<00:05:57.390> itself<00:05:57.720> better<00:05:58.169> than<00:05:58.350> using

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
to the case itself better than using

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.350 
to the case itself better than using
glue<00:05:58.800> better<00:05:59.130> than<00:05:59.310> using<00:05:59.550> zip<00:05:59.700> ties<00:05:59.880> we<00:06:00.240> are

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
glue better than using zip ties we are

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.670 
glue better than using zip ties we are
running<00:06:00.600> out<00:06:00.810> of<00:06:00.870> time<00:06:00.960> what<00:06:01.320> happened<00:06:01.620> the

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
running out of time what happened the

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.409 
running out of time what happened the
first<00:06:01.830> time<00:06:02.039> you<00:06:02.130> tried<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.340> boot<00:06:02.550> it<00:06:02.700> first

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
first time you tried to boot it first

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.670 
first time you tried to boot it first
time<00:06:03.539> I<00:06:03.600> had<00:06:03.750> to<00:06:03.780> boot<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.110> everything<00:06:04.590> went

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
time I had to boot it everything went

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.969 
time I had to boot it everything went
fine

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
fine

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.370 
fine
it<00:06:05.640> booted<00:06:05.850> up<00:06:06.000> just<00:06:06.180> fine<00:06:06.360> basically<00:06:07.260> what

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
it booted up just fine basically what

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.719 
it booted up just fine basically what
you<00:06:07.440> have<00:06:07.470> to<00:06:07.590> do<00:06:07.710> is<00:06:07.770> stick<00:06:07.919> in<00:06:08.039> OS<00:06:08.310> 10<00:06:08.340> point

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
you have to do is stick in OS 10 point

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.580 
you have to do is stick in OS 10 point
to<00:06:08.880> hold<00:06:09.539> down<00:06:09.750> see<00:06:10.050> it'll<00:06:10.260> boot<00:06:10.410> from<00:06:10.470> the

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
to hold down see it'll boot from the

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.830 
to hold down see it'll boot from the
cd-rom<00:06:10.950> and<00:06:11.370> it'll<00:06:12.090> just<00:06:12.240> install<00:06:12.479> just<00:06:12.630> fine

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
cd-rom and it'll just install just fine

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.659 
cd-rom and it'll just install just fine
and<00:06:13.080> it's<00:06:13.590> nice<00:06:13.890> it's<00:06:14.130> it's<00:06:14.310> running<00:06:14.580> great

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
and it's nice it's it's running great

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.279 
and it's nice it's it's running great
and<00:06:15.090> it's<00:06:15.240> a<00:06:15.270> great<00:06:15.390> little<00:06:15.570> machine<00:06:15.600> what<00:06:16.229> do

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
and it's a great little machine what do

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.350 
and it's a great little machine what do
you<00:06:16.380> do<00:06:16.560> with<00:06:16.650> the<00:06:16.830> power<00:06:17.190> switch<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:18.120> power

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
you do with the power switch the power

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.029 
you do with the power switch the power
switch<00:06:18.510> actually<00:06:18.870> I<00:06:19.260> have<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:19.650> wiring<00:06:19.919> diagram

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
switch actually I have a wiring diagram

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.310 
switch actually I have a wiring diagram
so<00:06:20.520> you<00:06:20.550> can<00:06:20.880> use<00:06:21.060> the<00:06:21.150> standard<00:06:21.510> PC<00:06:21.810> power

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
so you can use the standard PC power

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.930 
so you can use the standard PC power
switch<00:06:22.620> as<00:06:22.740> well<00:06:22.890> this<00:06:23.310> is<00:06:23.490> just<00:06:23.640> one<00:06:23.760> that<00:06:23.880> I

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
switch as well this is just one that I

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.159 
switch as well this is just one that I
found<00:06:24.120> off<00:06:24.240> an<00:06:24.360> old<00:06:24.450> Mac<00:06:24.660> and<00:06:24.870> it's<00:06:24.960> just<00:06:25.080> that

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
found off an old Mac and it's just that

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.750 
found off an old Mac and it's just that
much<00:06:25.289> easier<00:06:25.590> just<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.770> connect<00:06:26.100> it<00:06:26.220> so<00:06:26.460> this

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
much easier just to connect it so this

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.540 
much easier just to connect it so this
is<00:06:26.820> a<00:06:26.940> single<00:06:27.919> one<00:06:28.919> gigahertz<00:06:29.310> processor

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
processor motherboards and you can just

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.290

pick up another sonnet 1 gigahertz chip
and<00:06:49.169> it<00:06:49.260> would<00:06:49.350> work<00:06:49.440> fine<00:06:49.650> it<00:06:49.860> just<00:06:49.889> you

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
and it would work fine it just you

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.890

really have to focus on cooling and have

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.240 
really have to focus on cooling and have

to put an extra fan on top of there and

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.740 
to put an extra fan on top of there and
just<00:06:53.580> make<00:06:53.700> sure<00:06:53.730> you<00:06:53.970> really<00:06:54.180> keep<00:06:54.300> that<00:06:54.450> CPU

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
just make sure you really keep that CPU

a<00:06:57.900> new<00:06:58.050> g4<00:06:58.440> that's<00:06:59.310> a<00:06:59.400> good<00:06:59.520> question<00:06:59.940> actually

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
a new g4 that's a good question actually

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.700 
a new g4 that's a good question actually
you're<00:07:00.660> gonna<00:07:00.780> you<00:07:01.050> might<00:07:01.230> save<00:07:01.440> a<00:07:01.500> few<00:07:01.650> bucks

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710

but you're gonna put a lot of time and
energy<00:07:03.120> into<00:07:03.419> it<00:07:03.570> so<00:07:04.169> it<00:07:04.440> all<00:07:04.590> depends<00:07:04.860> on<00:07:04.950> how

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
energy into it so it all depends on how

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.680 
energy into it so it all depends on how
much<00:07:05.190> your<00:07:05.340> time<00:07:05.460> is<00:07:05.580> worth<00:07:05.700> and<00:07:06.030> whether<00:07:06.570> or
