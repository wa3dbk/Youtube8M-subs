00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.850
 hi so little review of Cabinda 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.440
 knife knife sculptures from home flex 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.870
 side 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.150
 so that's what happens with the whole 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.610
 the package so I bought them 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.680
 used on ebay that's a knife 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.070
 who sees in the Saturdays 150 euros 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.460
 according to a bit the sites where we go so me 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.779
 I had them for 32 euros and I am 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.279
 glad the confession to have seen for this 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.170
 Price then we will see a bit small 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.640
 negatives after I do not know if it 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.149
 really worth the 150 euros at the end of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.399
 when so the elements 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.790
 so we have the cover with the knife to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.309
 inside a small polishing lug 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.879
 what to sharpen his knife and the manual 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.500
 so first manual trick so the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.520
 advantage is that he is a Frenchman 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.510
 so here we see how to maintain his 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.489
 knife sharpen it why etc 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.320
 then behind my various functions 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.239
 so of the knife then at the level of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.420
 the sharpening we have a small polishing tab 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.720
 so from flex 4 then a piece of 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.760
 wood 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.950
 so that's really my thoughts with a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.100
 little piece of leather at the back actually 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.229
 here we will pass the polishing paste on 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.090
 and then every tool to his 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.119
 location to come be polite to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.520
 maximum so we'll see a little example 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.580
 just now so really very very 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.829
 well stuck at the new level of the holster 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.530
 so it's leather that smells good leather so 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.950
 it's really ep1 battleship very 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.829
 good studies well a sturdy and rigid 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.930
 with the small kate flex engraving 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.130
 then the time blow itself so me 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.170
 I like the design with its small 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.869
 wooden pads on both sides so 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.680
 it's pretty cool at the knife 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.180
 so it's pretty broad in terms of 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.060
 tools so not too much choice as they 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.560
 are a bit crooked to place them and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.840
 then on the back so a pretty little 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.040
 kate flex engraving 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.170
 so that's what will actually serve 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.990
 security it's a safety notch 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.909
 for different tools 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.670
 so we see tools first of 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.979
 things at the carving knife so there 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.910
 we're going to come out so we'll see 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.440
 the first the big disadvantage 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.010
 scout troop it's when we go out 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.480
 a blade actually is everything that comes with 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.890
 so suddenly everything is very very 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.390
 well sharpened but in fact it is well 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.970
 quickly dangerous we must do well 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.890
 attention of well folded each of 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.000
 blades to go out as we want 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.140
 so if you want a knife around your neck 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.520
 ghoul thing knife one shot the other 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.700
 it's a bit of a hassle 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.570
 be careful it's long enough then 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.870
 on the other hand here a good slap 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.520
 so here we are sure that the blade jane 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.170
 no game and the blade so and polite so 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.790
 it's really very very sharp of 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.270
 really feel on the finger this is 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.150
 really razor razor so that he 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.320
 advocates in the manual to sharpen it 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.180
 every 20 to 30 minutes of use 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.650
 when in the softwoods 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.660
 so his dismemberments a big interview 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.100
 but hey it's the price to pay 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.770
 here we press the security so for 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.390
 unlock the blade 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:18.340
 we will then put the left right 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.660
 so here she is on the other side 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.130
 on the opposite small notch for the ngo 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.480
 so again sent have mostly 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.970
 at the same time so it's still not very 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.870
 practice is quite dangerous though 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.150
 all attacks 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.150
 we are all stuck with security so 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:39.270
 that's a little candle if a 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:44.160
 right mouth always the same smart 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:46.209
 we come here folded with the sÃ©cu here 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.970
 then the left knife so in fact 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.200
 it's a crooked knife more or less 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.640
 so me who have a knife crush one can 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.470
 still not go without the real knife 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.910
 eighth is a lot more 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.330
 practice especially to make the team 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.860
 that or even the spoons after here it's 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.020
 still effective for all that is 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.340
 cooked yesterday but we will not stay on 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:09.790
 stay on the surface only at the palace too 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.959
 deep still well polished so there 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.660
 it is secondhand it has some marks 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.200
 I have not tried yet I will 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.080
 to receive 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.639
 so a little test to do to see 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.150
 real efficiency 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.129
 then the goal ray to 70 so the tool 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.009
 removed so it's okay to do 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.569
 small strokes the small grooves 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.129
 so here it's the same you have to come all 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.199
 go out be careful not to get 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.529
 cut with the host the soul to come on the 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.719
 take 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.620
 so that's why I have 150 euros 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:39.319
 even though they could have done a 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.219
 little design effort so that's it 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:45.979
 a nice legs and very b for example one 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:51.080
 going to see for sharpening here so I 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.099
 pass my paw polishing actually on there 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.560
 I will have his location 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:58.159
 so I just ask and there I go 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:02.120
 pull back to come polish it at 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:04.669
 maximum so on the inside and then 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.639
 on the outside face here so every 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:12.110
 tool to a place to come be polite 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.789
 on this little wood chip so 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:25.610
 it's really very well thought out 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:28.089
 then we have a gouge at 90 here so there 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:35.060
 it is above 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:36.379
 next to the knife so moves the same 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.219
 principle that raised except in accordance with 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:46.580
 the rounded very convenient for example for 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:48.560
 to make small drawings here and for 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.379
 finish we have the right chisel so it's up to 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.310
 right it's like a wood chisel 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.310
 traditional here 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.520
 it's going to crash so that's coming 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.080
 like a very very good carved knife 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.270
 a little pocket knife all in hand the 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.140
 Swiss army knife after sculpture 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.380
 to have in practice 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.360
 I have not tried it yet but it has 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.270
 look good cut 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.270
 this may be a little test ahead 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.270
 thank you
