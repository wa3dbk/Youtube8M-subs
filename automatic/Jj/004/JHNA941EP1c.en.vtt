working ten minutes with him in the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.270 
working ten minutes with him in the
classroom<00:01:24.110> setting<00:01:24.440> try<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.920> keep<00:01:25.070> them<00:01:25.160> in

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
classroom setting try to keep them in

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.700 
classroom setting try to keep them in
the<00:01:25.340> classroom<00:01:25.460> as<00:01:25.760> much<00:01:25.910> as<00:01:26.090> possible

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
the classroom as much as possible

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
library who's getting distracted I think

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.170 
library who's getting distracted I think
it's<00:01:30.920> definitely<00:01:31.070> beneficial<00:01:31.760> because<00:01:31.970> I

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
it's definitely beneficial because I

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's definitely beneficial because I
didn't<00:01:32.510> know<00:01:32.690> that<00:01:33.530> much<00:01:33.680> about<00:01:33.820> sdn

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
didn't know that much about sdn

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.280 
didn't know that much about sdn
and<00:01:36.060> say<00:01:36.540> definitely<00:01:37.850> helped<00:01:38.850> me<00:01:39.290> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
and say definitely helped me to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.480 
and say definitely helped me to
understand<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.860> more<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> school's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.850 
understand a bit more about the school's
approach<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.150> SD<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.960> was<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.500> place

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
approach to SD and what was in place

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.900 
approach to SD and what was in place
there<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.930> how<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.400> the<00:01:47.400> air<00:01:47.490> cope<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
there and how they the air cope with it

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.150
