I'm<00:00:16.289> talking<00:00:16.680> about<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.100> basically<00:00:17.820> just

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
I'm talking about is basically just

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.970 
I'm talking about is basically just
implementing<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.869> few<00:00:19.140> different<00:00:19.230> strategies

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
implementing a few different strategies

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.580 
implementing a few different strategies
that<00:00:20.340> will<00:00:20.490> help<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.330> control<00:00:21.510> your<00:00:22.140> oily

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
that will help you to control your oily

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.140 
that will help you to control your oily
face<00:00:22.859> throughout<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.400> day<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.910> first

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
face throughout the day the first

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.509 
face throughout the day the first
strategy<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.840> use<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.380> gentle<00:00:25.830> face<00:00:26.220> wipe

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
strategy is to use a gentle face wipe

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.609 
strategy is to use a gentle face wipe
during<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> day<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.689> nothing<00:00:27.960> too<00:00:28.140> crazy<00:00:28.320> and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
during the day so nothing too crazy and

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.439 
during the day so nothing too crazy and
I<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:28.980> that's<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> wipe<00:00:29.939> off<00:00:30.179> half

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
I think that's going to wipe off half

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.450 
I think that's going to wipe off half
your<00:00:30.480> face<00:00:30.869> halfway<00:00:31.320> through<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> day<00:00:31.710> just

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
your face halfway through the day just

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.459 
your face halfway through the day just
