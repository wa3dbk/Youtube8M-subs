yet the first thing I've noticed besides
the<00:01:03.600> obvious<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.689> side<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.700> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
see a little oval circle there in the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.000 
see a little oval circle there in the
center<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.610> outsides<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:13.010> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
center you see the outsides of it it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.280 
center you see the outsides of it it
looks<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.280> he's<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:15.600> looks<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.900> he<00:01:16.020> broke

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
looks like he's it looks like he broke

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.130 
looks like he's it looks like he broke
through<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> wall<00:01:17.630> is<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
through that wall is this like a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830 
through that wall is this like a
metaphor<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:20.060> symbolic<00:01:21.060> reasoning<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
metaphor or symbolic reasoning of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.929 
metaphor or symbolic reasoning of
breaking<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.890> boundaries<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.580> something

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
breaking the boundaries or something

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.300 
breaking the boundaries or something
breaking<00:01:24.600> through<00:01:24.780> boundaries<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.560> know

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
breaking through boundaries you know

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.649 
breaking through boundaries you know
because<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.000> supposed<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
because this is supposed to be it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.450 
because this is supposed to be it
because<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> neck<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> game<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.220> supposed

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
because the neck so the game is supposed

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.300 
because the neck so the game is supposed
to<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:30.140> motion<00:01:31.140> plus<00:01:31.439> control<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.130> I'm

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
to be all motion plus control if I'm

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.219 
to be all motion plus control if I'm
correct<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> look<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
correct and then when you look at the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.399 
correct and then when you look at the
background<00:01:34.970> you<00:01:35.970> see<00:01:36.229> almost<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
background you see almost like a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.160 
background you see almost like a
building<00:01:38.040> structure

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
building structure

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.999 
building structure
so<00:01:40.420> I'm<00:01:41.420> not<00:01:41.689> exactly<00:01:41.990> sure<00:01:42.170> what<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.830> but

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
so I'm not exactly sure what that is but

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.399 
so I'm not exactly sure what that is but
you<00:01:43.790> can<00:01:43.939> at<00:01:44.030> least<00:01:44.090> tell<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:44.750> he<00:01:44.900> is<00:01:44.990> broken

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
you can at least tell that he is broken

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.649 
you can at least tell that he is broken
through<00:01:45.650> and<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.549> might<00:01:46.820> be<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:47.119> discovering

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
through and it might be like discovering

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.420 
through and it might be like discovering
new<00:01:47.930> areas<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.500> we've<00:01:48.619> never<00:01:48.860> been<00:01:49.189> to

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
new areas that we've never been to

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.270 
new areas that we've never been to
before<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:50.030> don't<00:01:50.840> know<00:01:51.110> exactly<00:01:51.710> what's<00:01:52.009> going

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
before I don't know exactly what's going

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.910 
before I don't know exactly what's going
on<00:01:52.670> here<00:01:53.000> but<00:01:53.930> that's<00:01:54.170> just<00:01:54.380> my<00:01:54.619> best

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
on here but that's just my best

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:05.260 
on here but that's just my best
reasoning<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.490> logic<00:01:55.549> behind<00:01:56.030> it<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:04.270> now

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
reasoning and logic behind it and now

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.029 
reasoning and logic behind it and now
I'll<00:02:05.450> go<00:02:05.539> over<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.840> main<00:02:06.110> theory<00:02:06.830> that

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
I'll go over the main theory that

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.330 
I'll go over the main theory that
everybody's<00:02:07.700> been<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:08.090> over<00:02:08.619> yes<00:02:09.619> link

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
everybody's been going over yes link

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.840 
everybody's been going over yes link
