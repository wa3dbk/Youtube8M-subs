00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
back to the the Chinese inadequacies

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.570 
back to the the Chinese inadequacies
made<00:01:59.630> kind<00:01:59.930> of<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.140> not<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.130> hard<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.520> a

made kind of a not that hard of a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.580 
made kind of a not that hard of a
landing<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:02.119> had<00:02:02.930> to<00:02:03.020> do<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:03.200> out<00:02:03.290> in<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.410> grass

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
landing I had to do it out in the grass

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.620 
landing I had to do it out in the grass
and<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.310> landing<00:02:04.880> gear<00:02:04.940> ripped<00:02:05.270> out<00:02:05.420> by<00:02:05.600> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
and the landing gear ripped out by the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.010 
and the landing gear ripped out by the
roots

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
roots

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.169

let's<00:02:06.920> just<00:02:07.100> take<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.250> look<00:02:07.430> at<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
let's just take a look at the

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.020 
let's just take a look at the
construction<00:02:08.750> now<00:02:09.259> inside<00:02:09.920> here<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.759> notice

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
construction now inside here you notice

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.890 
construction now inside here you notice
that<00:02:12.220> every<00:02:13.220> piece<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.850> ply<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.270> here<00:02:14.510> was<00:02:14.750> not

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
that every piece of ply in here was not

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.760 
that every piece of ply in here was not
actually<00:02:15.230> glued<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:16.010> by<00:02:17.080> epoxy<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.260> was<00:02:18.380> gluten

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
actually glued in by epoxy it was gluten

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.729 
actually glued in by epoxy it was gluten
by<00:02:18.920> superglue<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:20.380> everything<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.500> loose

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
by superglue and everything is loose

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.280 
by superglue and everything is loose
it's<00:02:22.520> all<00:02:22.760> coming<00:02:23.120> apart<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:24.200> we're

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
it's all coming apart so what we're

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.540 
it's all coming apart so what we're
gonna<00:02:24.350> do<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.680> we're<00:02:24.800> gonna<00:02:24.860> strip<00:02:25.190> off<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
gonna do is we're gonna strip off the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.060 
gonna do is we're gonna strip off the
bottom<00:02:25.790> here<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:27.709> will<00:02:27.920> go<00:02:28.040> through

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
bottom here and it will go through

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.550 
bottom here and it will go through
bulkhead<00:02:28.910> by<00:02:29.090> bulkhead<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.750> epoxy<00:02:30.110> each<00:02:30.380> one

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
bulkhead by bulkhead in epoxy each one

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.690 
bulkhead by bulkhead in epoxy each one
of<00:02:30.650> them<00:02:30.739> in<00:02:30.860> especially<00:02:31.280> running<00:02:31.519> a<00:02:31.580> big

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
of them in especially running a big

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.949 
of them in especially running a big
four-stroke<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:32.330> just<00:02:32.600> going<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.780> kind<00:02:32.930> of

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
four-stroke it's just going to kind of

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.880 
four-stroke it's just going to kind of
shake<00:02:33.140> everything<00:02:33.380> loose<00:02:33.970> but<00:02:35.350> nice<00:02:36.350> fire

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
shake everything loose but nice fire

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.460 
shake everything loose but nice fire
real<00:02:37.130> nice<00:02:37.280> flier<00:02:37.549> once<00:02:38.209> again<00:02:38.330> real<00:02:39.260> poor

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.250 
real nice flier once again real poor
Chinese<00:02:39.709> construction<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:41.360> but<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.049> just

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
Chinese construction so but it's just

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.090 
Chinese construction so but it's just
something<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:43.030> I'm<00:02:44.030> gonna<00:02:44.180> have<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.480> expect

that country yeah but like it is
definitely<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> good<00:02:50.060> plane<00:02:50.299> so<00:02:50.920> also<00:02:51.920> got<00:02:52.040> a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
definitely a good plane so also got a

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.560 
definitely a good plane so also got a
video<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.489> flying<00:02:52.790> today<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.180> you'll<00:02:53.390> see

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
video of a flying today and you'll see

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.750 
video of a flying today and you'll see
that
