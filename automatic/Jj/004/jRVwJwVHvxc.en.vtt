and<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> start<00:01:22.310> putting<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and then you want to start putting the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.359 
and then you want to start putting the
belt<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> bottom<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.259> put<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
belt on at the bottom so you put it you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
belt on at the bottom so you put it you
loop<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.150> at<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> bottom<00:01:27.439> first

and<00:01:28.850> then<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> run<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> counterclockwise<00:01:30.720> so

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and then you run it counterclockwise so

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.190 
and then you run it counterclockwise so
you're<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.890> run<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.070> over<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.579> pulley

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
you're going to run it over this pulley

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.890 
you're going to run it over this pulley
then<00:01:34.200> over<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.590> sprocket<00:01:35.600> under<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> water

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
then over this sprocket under the water

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.819 
then over this sprocket under the water
pump<00:01:37.310> then<00:01:38.310> over<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> sprocket<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.829> then

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
pump then over the sprocket and then

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.350 
pump then over the sprocket and then
you're<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> slide<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.090> under<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
you're going to slide it under the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.350 
you're going to slide it under the
tensioner<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.670> all<00:01:44.670> these<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> be

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
tensioner here and all these need to be

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.450 
tensioner here and all these need to be
fairly<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.170> right<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.829> should<00:01:47.310> be

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.289 
tensioner pulley here you can see
there's<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.390> movement<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:02.210> once<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
there's some movement there once you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.520 
there's some movement there once you
pull<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> pin<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:04.500> the

of course reverse order so you want to
start<00:02:45.130> with<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.940> one<00:02:47.210> first<00:02:49.870> going<00:02:50.870> into<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
start with this one first going into the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.810 
start with this one first going into the
engine<00:02:51.530> okay<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.550> it'll<00:02:55.700> be<00:02:55.790> like

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
engine okay and then so it'll be like

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.410 
engine okay and then so it'll be like
that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.910 
that
and<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.710> want<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:59.410> put<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.710> that's

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
and you want to put the one that's

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.990 
and you want to put the one that's
hooked<00:03:01.520> up<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.940> body<00:03:03.430> right<00:03:04.430> here<00:03:04.460> okay

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
hooked up to the body right here okay

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.250 
hooked up to the body right here okay
come<00:03:05.660> out<00:03:05.810> on<00:03:06.940> sorry<00:03:07.940> go<00:03:08.330> pound<00:03:08.660> on<00:03:08.810> just<00:03:09.080> like

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
come out on sorry go pound on just like

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.320 
come out on sorry go pound on just like
that<00:03:11.709> it's<00:03:12.709> pretty<00:03:12.950> much<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:14.000> pretty<00:03:14.209> much

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
that it's pretty much it you pretty much

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.030 
that it's pretty much it you pretty much
done<00:03:14.570> after<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:16.580> manual<00:03:17.000> says<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:18.040> in

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
done after that the manual says that in

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.370 
done after that the manual says that in
this<00:03:19.760> state<00:03:20.150> right<00:03:20.420> here<00:03:20.750> once<00:03:21.020> you<00:03:21.140> pull<00:03:21.350> the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
this state right here once you pull the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.320 
this state right here once you pull the
pin<00:03:21.620> you'll<00:03:21.860> get<00:03:21.980> tension<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:23.860> turn<00:03:25.330> your

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
pin you'll get tension to turn your

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.540 
pin you'll get tension to turn your
crank

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.360 

you<00:03:32.060> see<00:03:32.330> sorry<00:03:34.390> six<00:03:35.390> turns<00:03:35.750> clockwise<00:03:36.650> until

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
you see sorry six turns clockwise until

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.600 
you see sorry six turns clockwise until
the<00:03:37.880> one<00:03:38.180> cylinder<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:39.070> at<00:03:40.070> top<00:03:40.370> dead<00:03:40.640> center

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
the one cylinder is at top dead center

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.920 
the one cylinder is at top dead center
so<00:03:43.610> basically<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.210> want<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.480> run<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.810> in

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
so basically you just want to run it in

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:55.990 
so basically you just want to run it in
a<00:03:45.050> loop<00:03:47.080> manually<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:49.210> then<00:03:54.730> just<00:03:55.730> make<00:03:55.880> sure

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
a loop manually and then just make sure

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.290 
a loop manually and then just make sure
that<00:03:56.060> all<00:03:56.330> your<00:03:57.790> your<00:03:58.790> marks<00:03:59.120> are<00:03:59.240> still

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
that all your your marks are still

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.860 
that all your your marks are still
lining<00:03:59.570> up<00:03:59.780> in<00:03:59.870> your<00:04:00.020> top<00:04:00.200> dead<00:04:00.410> center<00:04:00.710> also

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
lining up in your top dead center also

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.480 
lining up in your top dead center also
before<00:04:02.870> I<00:04:02.930> forget<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:04.040> harmonic<00:04:04.730> balancer

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
before I forget the harmonic balancer

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.590 
before I forget the harmonic balancer
after<00:04:07.490> you<00:04:07.580> put<00:04:07.700> all<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.910> dust<00:04:08.150> shields

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
after you put all the dust shields

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.620 
after you put all the dust shields
obviously<00:04:09.470> you'll<00:04:09.740> be<00:04:10.220> able<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.460> put<00:04:10.670> your

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
obviously you'll be able to put your

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.720 
obviously you'll be able to put your
harmonic<00:04:12.170> balancer<00:04:12.650> on<00:04:12.680> again<00:04:15.400> reverse<00:04:16.400> order

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
harmonic balancer on again reverse order

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.810 
harmonic balancer on again reverse order
and<00:04:17.090> then<00:04:17.750> you're<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.769> going<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.010> torque<00:04:19.700> it

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
and then you're just going to torque it

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.310 
and then you're just going to torque it
down<00:04:19.850> to<00:04:20.239> specs<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:25.070> manual<00:04:25.790> says<00:04:26.320> 181

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
down to specs the manual says 181

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.950 
down to specs the manual says 181
foot-pounds<00:04:28.190> of<00:04:28.960> torque<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:31.750> there<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.930> have

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
foot-pounds of torque so there you have

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.070 
foot-pounds of torque so there you have
it<00:04:33.140> it's<00:04:33.770> pretty<00:04:34.100> pretty<00:04:34.700> much<00:04:34.880> done<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.390> you

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
it it's pretty pretty much done and you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.900 
it it's pretty pretty much done and you
just<00:04:36.110> want<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.740> refill<00:04:37.160> your<00:04:37.340> coolant<00:04:37.760> of

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
just want to refill your coolant of

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.560 
just want to refill your coolant of
course<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:39.310> give<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.490> little<00:04:40.610> tests<00:04:41.150> make

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
course and give it a little tests make

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.960 
course and give it a little tests make
sure<00:04:42.040> everything's<00:04:43.040> running<00:04:43.220> smooth<00:04:43.669> and
