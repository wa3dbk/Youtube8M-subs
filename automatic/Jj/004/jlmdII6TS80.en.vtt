00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
think people like Scully especially make

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.929 
think people like Scully especially make
galleries<00:01:06.469> more<00:01:06.649> accessible<00:01:07.070> for<00:01:07.280> some

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
people that might make them more

people that might make them more
forbidding<00:01:09.469> but<00:01:10.189> for<00:01:10.399> me<00:01:10.549> it<00:01:11.090> makes<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:11.420> more

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
forbidding but for me it makes it more

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.120 
forbidding but for me it makes it more
accessible<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.200> is<00:01:12.319> a<00:01:12.350> guy<00:01:12.590> he's<00:01:12.920> very

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
from a very tough background you know he

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.629 
from a very tough background you know he
was<00:01:17.719> the<00:01:17.779> street<00:01:17.990> fighting<00:01:18.229> man<00:01:18.350> or<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.490> the

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
was the street fighting man or so the

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.489 
was the street fighting man or so the
mythology<00:01:20.149> would<00:01:20.359> would<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.779> it<00:01:20.929> what<00:01:21.349> he's

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
mythology would would have it what he's

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:23.649 
mythology would would have it what he's
doing<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.889> so<00:01:22.099> simple<00:01:22.399> it's<00:01:22.819> so<00:01:22.999> basic<00:01:23.240> it's

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
doing is so simple it's so basic it's

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.389 
doing is so simple it's so basic it's
just<00:01:23.959> colors<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.439> shapes<00:01:24.590> every<00:01:25.009> painting

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
just colors and shapes every painting

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.069 
just colors and shapes every painting
his<00:01:25.579> colors<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:26.029> shapes<00:01:26.209> I<00:01:26.509> think<00:01:26.990> what

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
his colors and shapes I think what

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.330 
his colors and shapes I think what
people<00:01:27.170> are<00:01:27.409> intimidated<00:01:27.619> about<00:01:27.950> has<00:01:28.159> not

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
people are intimidated about has not

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.800 
people are intimidated about has not
been<00:01:28.520> able<00:01:28.639> to<00:01:28.819> divine<00:01:29.119> meaning<00:01:29.539> from<00:01:29.689> a

been able to divine meaning from a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.529 
been able to divine meaning from a
painting<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:31.099> that<00:01:31.880> doesn't<00:01:31.999> bother<00:01:32.209> me<00:01:32.389> in

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
painting but that doesn't bother me in

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:34.629 
painting but that doesn't bother me in
the<00:01:32.569> slightest<00:01:33.229> because<00:01:33.889> you<00:01:34.279> know<00:01:34.399> I

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:34.639 
the slightest because you know I

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.099 
the slightest because you know I
couldn't<00:01:34.849> really<00:01:35.119> analyze<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.509> piece<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.719> music

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
couldn't really analyze a piece of music

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.029 
couldn't really analyze a piece of music
either<00:01:36.200> for<00:01:36.439> that<00:01:36.469> matter<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.950> couldn't

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
either for that matter I couldn't

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.249 
either for that matter I couldn't
sometimes<00:01:37.459> analyze<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.759> poem<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.329> can't<00:01:38.539> you

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
sometimes analyze a poem I can't you

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.559 
sometimes analyze a poem I can't you
know<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:40.310> reason<00:01:40.579> why<00:01:40.609> an<00:01:40.789> artist<00:01:41.149> chooses

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
know the reason why an artist chooses

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.330 
know the reason why an artist chooses
this<00:01:41.719> medium<00:01:42.169> a<00:01:42.349> particular<00:01:42.889> an<00:01:42.950> abstract

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
this medium a particular an abstract

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.949 
this medium a particular an abstract
artist<00:01:43.700> chooses<00:01:43.969> that<00:01:44.119> medium<00:01:44.509> is<00:01:44.599> because<00:01:44.899> he

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
artist chooses that medium is because he

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.289 
artist chooses that medium is because he
can't<00:01:45.200> articulate<00:01:45.919> his<00:01:46.189> true<00:01:46.399> feelings<00:01:46.579> if<00:01:47.119> he

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
can't articulate his true feelings if he

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.599 
can't articulate his true feelings if he
could<00:01:47.539> he<00:01:47.810> would<00:01:47.840> presumably<00:01:48.679> there<00:01:49.340> is<00:01:49.459> no

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:49.609 
could he would presumably there is no

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.399 
could he would presumably there is no
doubt<00:01:49.819> in<00:01:49.849> my<00:01:49.969> mind<00:01:50.239> that<00:01:50.450> that<00:01:50.599> is<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.049> way<00:01:51.200> he

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
doubt in my mind that that is the way he

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.309 
doubt in my mind that that is the way he
sees<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.770> world<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.909> know<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.419> see<00:01:53.659> you<00:01:54.139> see

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
sees the world you know you see you see

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.139 
sees the world you know you see you see
the<00:01:54.409> world<00:01:54.590> through<00:01:54.919> windows<00:01:55.700> through

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
the world through windows through

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.540 
the world through windows through
doorways

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
doorways

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.090 
doorways
so<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.630> world<00:01:58.870> if<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.320> live<00:01:59.470> in<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.620> city<00:01:59.830> is

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
so the world if you live in a city is

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.670 
so the world if you live in a city is
arranged<00:02:00.730> in<00:02:00.940> geometric<00:02:01.450> shapes<00:02:01.900> so<00:02:02.500> that's

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
arranged in geometric shapes so that's

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.470 
arranged in geometric shapes so that's
the<00:02:02.740> way<00:02:02.830> he<00:02:02.980> sees<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.340> world<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:04.090> an<00:02:04.180> ordinary

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
the way he sees the world so an ordinary

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.120 
the way he sees the world so an ordinary
landscape<00:02:04.990> or<00:02:05.140> report<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.470> doesn't<00:02:05.770> do<00:02:05.860> it<00:02:05.980> for

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
landscape or report it doesn't do it for

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.740 
landscape or report it doesn't do it for
him<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.370> doesn't<00:02:06.460> say<00:02:06.790> it<00:02:06.910> for<00:02:07.090> him<00:02:09.750> something

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
him it doesn't say it for him something

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.560 
him it doesn't say it for him something
