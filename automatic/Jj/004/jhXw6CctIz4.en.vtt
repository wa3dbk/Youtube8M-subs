there are health bars and stamina and
you<00:02:36.450> know<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.380> was<00:02:37.560> technically

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you know this is this was technically

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.860 
you know this is this was technically
the<00:02:38.130> tutorial<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.819> wish<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.150> could<00:02:39.329> skip<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.600> but

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
the tutorial I wish I could skip it but

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.740 
the tutorial I wish I could skip it but
it<00:02:39.959> would<00:02:40.109> not<00:02:40.260> let<00:02:40.500> me<00:02:41.329> so<00:02:42.329> I<00:02:42.389> was<00:02:42.569> totally

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it would not let me so I was totally

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.210 
it would not let me so I was totally
kicking<00:02:43.230> ass<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.620> I'm<00:02:43.709> guessing<00:02:44.130> this

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
kicking ass and I'm guessing this

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.240 
kicking ass and I'm guessing this
because<00:02:44.459> they're<00:02:45.389> not<00:02:45.510> gonna<00:02:45.630> let<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.989> lose

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
because they're not gonna let you lose

so yeah I was like oh I'm gonna kick his

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.340 
so yeah I was like oh I'm gonna kick his
butt<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.950> one<00:02:50.100> more<00:02:50.280> swing<00:02:50.579> right<00:02:50.910> no<00:02:51.870> my<00:02:52.170> guy
