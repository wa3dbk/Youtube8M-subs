00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.480 
ray Suarez from race talk wrote a great
piece<00:00:06.330> for<00:00:06.390> alternet<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.620> has<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.859> do<00:00:08.250> with

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
piece for alternet and it has to do with

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.459 
piece for alternet and it has to do with
the<00:00:08.610> fact<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:09.030> our<00:00:09.300> public<00:00:09.929> schools<00:00:10.260> are

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
the fact that our public schools are

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.830 
the fact that our public schools are
short<00:00:10.860> changing<00:00:11.280> Latino<00:00:11.790> students<00:00:12.300> now<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
short changing Latino students now I

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.939 
short changing Latino students now I
found<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.440> uh<00:00:13.799> fascinating<00:00:14.700> because<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:16.199> lot

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
found this uh fascinating because a lot

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.800 
found this uh fascinating because a lot
of<00:00:16.980> people<00:00:17.220> don't<00:00:17.640> know<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.910> our<00:00:18.390> public

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
of people don't know that our public

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.340 
of people don't know that our public
schools<00:00:19.140> are<00:00:19.470> funded<00:00:19.740> through<00:00:20.220> uh<00:00:21.350> property

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
schools are funded through uh property

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.140 
schools are funded through uh property
tax<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> lot<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.939> uh<00:00:24.680> schools<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.640> uh

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
tax so a lot of uh schools that are uh

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.050 
tax so a lot of uh schools that are uh
heavily<00:00:27.840> populated<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.710> Latino<00:00:29.490> students

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
heavily populated with Latino students

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.020 
heavily populated with Latino students
are<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.630> poor<00:00:31.050> areas<00:00:31.189> with<00:00:32.189> low<00:00:32.460> cost<00:00:32.759> housing

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
are in poor areas with low cost housing

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.030 
are in poor areas with low cost housing
so<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.020> course<00:00:34.290> uh<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:35.309> leads<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:37.040> less

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
so of course uh that leads to less

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.530 
so of course uh that leads to less
funding<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> school<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
funding for the school because the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.330 
funding for the school because the
property<00:00:39.989> tax<00:00:40.230> isn't<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.680> much<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> would

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
property tax isn't as much as it would

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.880 
property tax isn't as much as it would
be<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.640> richer<00:00:42.000> areas<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.750> they<00:00:43.620> don't<00:00:43.739> have

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
be in richer areas and they don't have

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.180 
be in richer areas and they don't have
the<00:00:44.399> same<00:00:44.640> resources<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> same<00:00:46.190> teachers

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the same resources and the same teachers

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.150 
the same resources and the same teachers
as<00:00:47.809> students<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.230> areas<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.590> Beverly

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
as students do in areas like Beverly

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.740 
as students do in areas like Beverly
Hills<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> uh<00:00:52.520> maybe<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> good<00:00:54.329> way<00:00:54.719> for

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
Hills so uh maybe this is a good way for

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.170 
Hills so uh maybe this is a good way for
politicians<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.770> think<00:00:56.010> about<00:00:56.280> other<00:00:56.550> ways<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
politicians to think about other ways to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.330 
politicians to think about other ways to
fund<00:00:57.449> education<00:00:57.780> other<00:00:58.500> than<00:00:58.710> relying<00:00:59.070> on

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
fund education other than relying on

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.689 
fund education other than relying on
property<00:01:00.030> tax<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.620> totally<00:01:01.620> agree<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.340> think

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
property tax I totally agree I think

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
property tax I totally agree I think
it's<00:01:02.820> absurd<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.719> base<00:01:03.960> education

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it's absurd that you you base education

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.440 
it's absurd that you you base education
on<00:01:04.860> property<00:01:05.400> taxes<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:05.970> how<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
on property taxes because how is that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
on property taxes because how is that
equal<00:01:06.630> opportunity<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.530> live<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.920> rich

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
equal opportunity if you live in a rich

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
equal opportunity if you live in a rich
neighborhood<00:01:08.240> with<00:01:09.240> great<00:01:09.479> property<00:01:09.900> values

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
neighborhood with great property values

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.200 
neighborhood with great property values
or<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> poor<00:01:10.710> neighborhood<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.030> always

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
or a poor neighborhood but that's always

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
or a poor neighborhood but that's always
the<00:01:12.350> conservative<00:01:13.350> argument<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.130> oh<00:01:14.310> no

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the conservative argument is like oh no

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.520 
the conservative argument is like oh no
you<00:01:14.640> know<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> parents<00:01:16.140> and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you know it's it's up to the parents and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.800 
you know it's it's up to the parents and
it's<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.750> get

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
it's like it's not that I get that I get

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.020 
it's like it's not that I get that I get
that<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.259> somewhat<00:01:19.830> sympathetic<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that I'm somewhat sympathetic to that to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.060 
that I'm somewhat sympathetic to that to
a<00:01:21.060> point<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.259> how<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.799> kids

course puts Latino students at a
gigantic<00:01:39.150> disadvantage<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.020> makes<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> even

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
gigantic disadvantage it makes it even

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
gigantic disadvantage it makes it even
harder<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.009> them<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> advance<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.600> know

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
harder for them to advance and you know

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
harder for them to advance and you know
in<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.049> piece<00:01:43.380> written<00:01:43.649> by<00:01:43.770> where<00:01:44.100> ray

disadvantage<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.969> think<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
disadvantage and I think that it's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.870 
disadvantage and I think that it's
something<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.860> need<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.159> focus<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.759> in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
something that we need to focus on in

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.880 
something that we need to focus on in
