special piece for me I studied it a lot
in<00:02:57.980> college<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:59.420> was<00:02:59.450> one<00:02:59.720> of<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.930> one<00:03:00.260> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
in college and it was one of the one of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.170 
in college and it was one of the one of
the<00:03:00.440> last<00:03:00.650> concertos<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.820> started

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
the last concertos that I started

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.330 
the last concertos that I started
working<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.600> after<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.930> had<00:03:03.110> done<00:03:03.290> as<00:03:03.980> sort<00:03:04.280> of

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
working on after I had done as sort of

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.230 
working on after I had done as sort of
many<00:03:04.820> of<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.150> other<00:03:05.390> standard<00:03:06.170> works<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.709> I

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
many of the other standard works and I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.550 
many of the other standard works and I
think<00:03:08.240> I<00:03:08.330> sort<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.750> started<00:03:08.959> working<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:09.440> this

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.400 
think I sort of started working on this
piece<00:03:09.770> and<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> really<00:03:10.250> found<00:03:10.459> my<00:03:10.820> voice<00:03:11.780> now

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
piece and I really found my voice now

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.199 
piece and I really found my voice now
Beethoven<00:03:13.070> himself<00:03:13.459> actually<00:03:13.880> wrote<00:03:14.090> an

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
Beethoven himself actually wrote an

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.690 
Beethoven himself actually wrote an
alternate<00:03:14.690> version<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.260> piece<00:03:15.890> for<00:03:16.400> piano

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
alternate version of the piece for piano

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.270 
alternate version of the piece for piano
and<00:03:16.760> orchestra<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:18.080> that<00:03:18.320> version<00:03:18.770> he

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
and orchestra and in that version he

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.460 
and orchestra and in that version he
wrote<00:03:19.520> his<00:03:19.760> own<00:03:19.880> cadenza<00:03:20.390> play<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.080> Chrysler

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
wrote his own cadenza play the Chrysler

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.970 
wrote his own cadenza play the Chrysler
cadenza<00:03:21.920> which<00:03:22.070> is<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.850> was<00:03:23.180> popularized<00:03:23.980> well

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
cadenza which is it was popularized well

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.340 
cadenza which is it was popularized well
I<00:03:25.130> guess<00:03:25.370> since<00:03:25.610> Fritz<00:03:26.390> Kreisler<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:27.050> such<00:03:27.320> a

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
I guess since Fritz Kreisler and such a

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.170 
I guess since Fritz Kreisler and such a
great<00:03:27.590> composer<00:03:28.540> he<00:03:29.540> can<00:03:30.580> take<00:03:31.580> two<00:03:31.850> themes

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
great composer he can take two themes

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.240 
great composer he can take two themes
and<00:03:32.480> since<00:03:33.050> he's<00:03:33.200> also<00:03:33.380> such<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> great<00:03:33.920> fiddle

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
and since he's also such a great fiddle

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.190 
and since he's also such a great fiddle
player<00:03:34.430> he<00:03:34.610> understands<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.180> instrument<00:03:35.600> he

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
player he understands the instrument he

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.250 
player he understands the instrument he
can<00:03:36.410> layer<00:03:36.800> two<00:03:37.520> themes<00:03:37.880> on<00:03:38.180> one<00:03:38.780> on<00:03:38.900> top<00:03:39.110> of

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
can layer two themes on one on top of

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.020 
can layer two themes on one on top of
the<00:03:39.350> other<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:39.739> he<00:03:40.280> does<00:03:40.459> that<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.670> lot<00:03:40.760> in

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
the other and he does that a lot in

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.530 
the other and he does that a lot in
these<00:03:41.180> cadenzas<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:43.459> think<00:03:43.700> you<00:03:44.299> can't

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
these cadenzas and so I think you can't

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.970 
these cadenzas and so I think you can't
miss<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.720> but<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.049> ends<00:03:45.470> up<00:03:45.560> being<00:03:45.920> very

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
miss it but it ends up being very

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.970 
miss it but it ends up being very
exciting<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:47.230> also<00:03:48.230> very<00:03:48.380> difficult<00:03:48.890> of

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
exciting and also very difficult of

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.610 
exciting and also very difficult of
course<00:03:49.040> for<00:03:49.400> me<00:03:49.519> but<00:03:50.140> moreover<00:03:51.140> it's<00:03:51.380> just

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
course for me but moreover it's just

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.820 
course for me but moreover it's just
very<00:03:51.739> exciting<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:53.690> really<00:03:53.930> packs<00:03:54.500> quite

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
very exciting and it really packs quite

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.980 
very exciting and it really packs quite
a<00:03:54.890> punch
