00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
somewhere on the streets i think is your

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.150 
somewhere on the streets i think is your
that<00:00:24.430> but<00:00:24.640> that's<00:00:25.000> it's<00:00:25.510> extremely<00:00:26.020> vague<00:00:26.230> so

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
that but that's it's extremely vague so

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.100 
that but that's it's extremely vague so
and<00:00:27.430> it's<00:00:27.939> very<00:00:28.150> unfortunate<00:00:28.420> that<00:00:28.840> you<00:00:28.960> know

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110

and it's very unfortunate that you know
since<00:00:29.380> that<00:00:29.619> you<00:00:29.800> know<00:00:29.919> i<00:00:30.250> didn't<00:00:30.939> travel

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
since that you know i didn't travel

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.819 
since that you know i didn't travel
north

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.459 

I<00:00:35.920> I<00:00:36.820> was<00:00:37.179> always<00:00:37.510> in<00:00:37.600> favor<00:00:37.749> of<00:00:37.929> creative

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
I I was always in favor of creative

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.919 
I I was always in favor of creative
ideas<00:00:38.859> so<00:00:39.129> in<00:00:39.339> essence<00:00:39.699> and<00:00:39.969> naturally<00:00:40.719> know

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
ideas so in essence and naturally know

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:43.560 
ideas so in essence and naturally know
that<00:00:41.230> people<00:00:41.469> might<00:00:41.920> be<00:00:42.390> questioning<00:00:43.390> you

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
that people might be questioning you

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.869 
that people might be questioning you
know<00:00:43.600> this<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:46.019> revolutionary<00:00:47.219> concept<00:00:48.219> but

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
know this very revolutionary concept but

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.469 
know this very revolutionary concept but
I<00:00:49.239> think<00:00:49.899> anything<00:00:50.379> that<00:00:50.409> makes<00:00:50.799> chest<00:00:51.479> more

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
I think anything that makes chest more

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.560 
I think anything that makes chest more
intriguing<00:00:53.280> should<00:00:54.280> be<00:00:54.460> practiced<00:00:55.299> and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
intriguing should be practiced and

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.160 
intriguing should be practiced and
should<00:00:56.019> we<00:00:56.049> support<00:00:56.500> it<00:00:56.619> so<00:00:56.649> i<00:00:58.140> doubt<00:00:59.140> that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
should we support it so i doubt that

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.349 
should we support it so i doubt that
every<00:00:59.829> tournament<00:01:00.159> can<00:01:00.399> be<00:01:00.489> played<00:01:00.760> in<00:01:01.030> this

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
every tournament can be played in this

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.189 
every tournament can be played in this
very<00:01:02.399> sort<00:01:03.399> of<00:01:03.460> extravaganza<00:01:04.179> fashion<00:01:04.570> but

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
very sort of extravaganza fashion but

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.350 
very sort of extravaganza fashion but
the<00:01:05.409> very<00:01:05.560> fact<00:01:05.679> that<00:01:05.950> bilbao<00:01:06.340> made<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.880> step

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
the very fact that bilbao made this step

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.969 
the very fact that bilbao made this step
in<00:01:07.600> this<00:01:07.750> direction<00:01:07.810> i<00:01:08.380> think<00:01:08.679> should<00:01:08.860> be

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
in this direction i think should be

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.680 
in this direction i think should be
uploaded

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.200 

because<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:15.070> think<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.580> said<00:01:15.820> that's<00:01:16.150> my

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
because I I think that said that's my

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.660 
because I I think that said that's my
