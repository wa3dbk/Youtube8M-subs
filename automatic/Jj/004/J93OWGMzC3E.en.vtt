00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.770 
if it doesn't kill him he'll throw an
air<00:02:16.210> strike<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.370> I've<00:02:18.370> done<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.970> same<00:02:19.240> on<00:02:19.300> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
air strike and I've done the same on the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.180 
air strike and I've done the same on the
side<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:19.990> I'm<00:02:20.350> holding<00:02:21.280> puts<00:02:21.970> c4<00:02:22.180> there<00:02:23.190> just

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
side that I'm holding puts c4 there just

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.950 
side that I'm holding puts c4 there just
to<00:02:24.430> weaken<00:02:24.880> him<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.090> probably<00:02:25.120> won't<00:02:25.660> kill<00:02:25.870> him

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
to weaken him it probably won't kill him

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.320 
to weaken him it probably won't kill him
it<00:02:26.110> at<00:02:26.710> this<00:02:26.950> point<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:27.880> just<00:02:28.120> there<00:02:28.300> to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
it at this point so it's just there to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.990 
it at this point so it's just there to
weaken<00:02:28.840> him<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.250> we've<00:02:30.250> got<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.550> troops<00:02:30.790> to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
weaken him and we've got the troops to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.510 
weaken him and we've got the troops to
keep<00:02:31.180> him<00:02:31.330> busy<00:02:31.480> while<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:32.100> like<00:02:33.100> shoot<00:02:33.430> the

keep him busy while we like shoot the
hell<00:02:33.640> out<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.280> earlier<00:02:36.580> rounds<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:37.060> will

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
hell out in the earlier rounds it will

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.680 
hell out in the earlier rounds it will
kill<00:02:37.450> him<00:02:37.590> up<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.800> about<00:02:38.950> 40<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:40.090> shouldn't

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
kill him up to about 40 you shouldn't

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.090

you're<00:02:58.090> going<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:58.270> have<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.540> start<00:02:58.570> looping

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
you're going to have to start looping

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.850 
you're going to have to start looping
the<00:02:59.350> map<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.890> do<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.280> strategy<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.239> we<00:03:01.510> do

the map to do the strategy that we do

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.960 
the map to do the strategy that we do
basically<00:03:02.860> we<00:03:03.100> just<00:03:03.130> keep<00:03:03.400> running<00:03:03.640> around

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
basically we just keep running around

when you get to 50 60 plus they take a

when you get to 50 60 plus they take a
lot<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.290> lot<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:17.950> kill<00:03:18.360> probably<00:03:19.360> two<00:03:19.540> or<00:03:19.570> three

them as and when you on and how are you
on<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:27.820> what<00:03:28.420> were<00:03:28.570> your<00:03:28.720> favorite<00:03:28.840> ways<00:03:29.140> to

on so what were your favorite ways to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.420 
on so what were your favorite ways to
fill<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.530> jokes<00:03:29.739> just<00:03:29.890> kill<00:03:30.130> them<00:03:30.190> off

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
fill the jokes just kill them off

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.259 
fill the jokes just kill them off
because<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.950> can<00:03:33.190> got<00:03:33.700> all<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> time<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
because you can got all the time the

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.990 
because you can got all the time the
world<00:03:34.480> there's<00:03:34.810> no<00:03:34.930> point<00:03:35.140> rushing<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:36.000> just

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
world there's no point rushing so just

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.400 
world there's no point rushing so just
walk<00:03:37.209> around<00:03:37.450> kill<00:03:38.080> him<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:40.120> I'll<00:03:40.480> speed<00:03:41.140> this

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
walk around kill him and I'll speed this

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.650 
walk around kill him and I'll speed this
bit<00:03:41.680> up<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.980> little<00:03:42.280> bit<00:03:42.430> because<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:43.150> takes<00:03:43.480> a

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
bit up a little bit because it takes a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.449 
bit up a little bit because it takes a
little<00:03:43.810> bit<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.019> time<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.470> leave<00:03:44.680> them<00:03:44.860> up<00:03:45.010> so

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
little bit of time to leave them up so

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.720 
little bit of time to leave them up so
speed<00:03:46.329> up

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.980 

as<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.880> can<00:03:51.030> see<00:03:51.210> we're<00:03:51.390> just<00:03:51.630> killing<00:03:51.840> them

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
as you can see we're just killing them

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.720 
as you can see we're just killing them
by<00:03:52.140> looping<00:03:52.620> getting<00:03:53.010> more<00:03:53.160> flash<00:03:53.400> bangs

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
by looping getting more flash bangs

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.090 
by looping getting more flash bangs
shooting<00:03:54.510> them<00:03:54.630> however<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.900> now<00:03:58.410> last<00:03:58.890> but

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
shooting them however and now last but

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.420 
shooting them however and now last but
certainly<00:03:59.610> not<00:04:00.330> least<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:01.260> chopper<00:04:01.800> arms<00:04:02.250> on

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
certainly not least the chopper arms on

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.250 
certainly not least the chopper arms on
this<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> little<00:04:03.210> different<00:04:03.690> because<00:04:03.870> we

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
this is a little different because we

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.760 
this is a little different because we
don't<00:04:04.500> actually<00:04:04.770> do<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.300> on<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:07.170> rooftop<00:04:07.620> we

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
don't actually do it on the rooftop we

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.560 
don't actually do it on the rooftop we
do<00:04:07.890> have<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.400> complete<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.180> other<00:04:09.330> side<00:04:09.540> of

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
do have the complete the other side of

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.740 
do have the complete the other side of
the<00:04:09.750> map<00:04:09.930> in<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.140> cave<00:04:10.470> as<00:04:10.770> well<00:04:10.980> show<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.220> now

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
the map in the cave as well show you now

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.500 
the map in the cave as well show you now
and<00:04:12.860> this<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:13.980> also<00:04:14.160> where<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.730> sentry<00:04:15.300> guns

the<00:04:53.730> idea<00:04:53.760> of<00:04:54.150> using<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.480> cave<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.110> kill

the idea of using the cave is to kill
the<00:04:55.410> troops<00:04:55.680> leave<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.550> choppers<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:57.720> the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
the troops leave the choppers so you the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.030 
the troops leave the choppers so you the
choppers<00:04:58.680> on<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.070> new<00:04:59.280> at<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.490> same<00:04:59.670> time

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
choppers on to new at the same time

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.770
