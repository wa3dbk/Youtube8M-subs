front glass of the iphone or the iphone
5<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:12.300> might<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.570> coming<00:00:12.870> out<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.259> looking

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
5 that might be coming out and looking

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.550 
5 that might be coming out and looking
like<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.549> sides<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.780> display<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
like this the sides on the display are a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650 
like this the sides on the display are a
little<00:00:16.859> bit<00:00:17.130> thinner<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.820> when<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.119> see<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
little bit thinner so when we see on the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.840 
little bit thinner so when we see on the
iphone<00:00:19.050> 4<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:20.010> those<00:00:20.250> borders

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
iphone 4 we have those borders

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.300 
iphone 4 we have those borders
surrounding<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.750> display<00:00:22.199> well<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.800> sides

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
surrounding the display well the sides

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.070 
surrounding the display well the sides
are<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:24.090> thinner<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.900> see

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
are a little bit thinner as you can see

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.560 
are a little bit thinner as you can see
in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> picture<00:00:25.500> there<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.910> just<00:00:27.330> seems

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
in the picture there and it just seems

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.929 
in the picture there and it just seems

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
iphone is kind of behind on that so we

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540 
iphone is kind of behind on that so we
kind<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.960> need<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> bigger<00:00:52.559> display<00:00:53.039> now<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
kind of do need a bigger display now I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.850 
kind of do need a bigger display now I
did<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.300> interesting<00:00:54.899> model<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.500> got

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
did see an interesting model which got

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
did see an interesting model which got
rid<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.309> home<00:00:56.579> button<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> made<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
rid of the home button and made the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.950 
rid of the home button and made the
display<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> little<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:58.980> longer<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.600> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
display a little bit longer so it can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
display a little bit longer so it can
have<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.649> extra<00:01:02.399> part<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> screen<00:01:03.180> down

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
have a extra part of the screen down

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.910 
have a extra part of the screen down
there<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.809> guessing<00:01:04.199> they<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.500> put<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> home

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
there I'm guessing they would put a home

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.980 
there I'm guessing they would put a home
button<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.909> well<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.869> would

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
button right there as well but it would

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.530 
button right there as well but it would
be<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> screen<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.820> actual

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
be on the screen and not a actual

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
be on the screen and not a actual
physical<00:01:10.020> button<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.799> that's<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.100> pretty<00:01:11.250> cool

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
physical button so that's a pretty cool

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
physical button so that's a pretty cool
idea<00:01:11.640> i<00:01:11.909> don't<00:01:12.270> believe<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:12.960> Apple<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.619> going

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
idea i don't believe that Apple is going

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
idea i don't believe that Apple is going
to<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.430> method<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.390> did<00:01:15.720> see

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
to go with that method but we did see

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570 
to go with that method but we did see
that<00:01:16.020> Apple<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.680> testing<00:01:17.100> out<00:01:17.189> some<00:01:17.369> new

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that Apple is testing out some new

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730 
that Apple is testing out some new
multi-touch<00:01:18.180> gestures<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.049> basically

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
multi-touch gestures that basically

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.830 
multi-touch gestures that basically
allowed<00:01:20.070> us<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.280> use<00:01:20.640> our<00:01:20.790> hands<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.659> home

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
allowed us to use our hands as the home

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.810 
allowed us to use our hands as the home
button<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.650> pinching<00:01:23.100> four<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.610> five

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
button by just pinching four or five

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.359 
button by just pinching four or five
fingers<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.900> screen<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:26.130> press

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
fingers on the screen to actually press

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
fingers on the screen to actually press
the<00:01:26.520> home<00:01:26.700> button<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.390> maybe<00:01:27.720> we'll<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.170> Apple

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the home button so maybe we'll see Apple

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.280 
the home button so maybe we'll see Apple
do<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.920> within<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.909> refresh<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.020> more

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
do that within this refresh but more

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.780 
do that within this refresh but more
likely<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.950> that's<00:01:32.159> ever<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.729> happen

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
likely if that's ever going to happen

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.120 
likely if that's ever going to happen
we'll<00:01:33.390> probably<00:01:33.720> see<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.110> next<00:01:34.409> year<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
we'll probably see it next year or the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.580 
we'll probably see it next year or the
year<00:01:35.159> after<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:36.900> still<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
year after that but that's still just a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.920 
year after that but that's still just a
rumor<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.310> an<00:01:38.460> idea<00:01:38.640> there<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.540> Apple

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
rumor just an idea there that Apple

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
rumor just an idea there that Apple
might<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.290> doing<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.950> doubt<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:41.970> going

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
might be doing I doubt that it's going

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
might be doing I doubt that it's going
