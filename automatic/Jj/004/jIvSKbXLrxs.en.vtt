00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 everyone knows multitouch shing 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.620
 commented and you listen to me, I'm fine 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.109
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.540
 pretty short video since I you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.690
 showed I do a little comparison of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.080
 the ipad r and the new ipad so the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.880
 new ipad that is older than 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.890
 the ipad r that came out a few days ago 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.660
 time already 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.430
 so a little comparative on the speed 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.380
 the size or the weight of 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.500
 the camera so really a pretty video 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.040
 short but to inform you of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.270
 different from the differences between them and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.030
 two devices we will start with one 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.739
 speed test so for the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.420
 traditional test to extinguish it 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.980
 so we'll start with dyeing 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.809
 the holidays and by turning off both 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.629
 ipad 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.809
 knowing that mine and the one on the left 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.539
 so just wait and one of the two ipods 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:58.140
 first and second 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:01.350
 that's it, so I'm waiting for the two 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.359
 go out already we'll see knowing that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.720
 the new ipad is largely part 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.700
 before ipad r so that's it is 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.630
 the ipad r who will catch up with the new ipad 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.430
 good knowing that the fact that one is that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.430
 when one is varies enormously 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.590
 so I wait for the two to go out 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.570
 and we'll see what we can do 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.530
 so here is the ipad r it's a good one 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.060
 new ipad it's a little weird 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.170
 by the way I think he takes 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.400
 a lot of time like to go out 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.780
 knowing that both are not already the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.149
 break and then we will now go 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.720
 speed tests or startup 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.640
 so at three I'm going to press so on 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.490
 both buttons simultaneously then one 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:49.590
 two three here is you see that there is already 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.450
 a slight of the slight end benefit to 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.280
 ipad r will see if it is confirmed 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.020
 later on normally it should be 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.080
 confirm there is no reason I know 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.590
 that the new ipad is endowed bin ein with a 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.840
 a6 processor if I remember correctly 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.500
 while the ipad r and a processor to 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.990
 7 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.090
 I am not sure in any case the ipad r and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.830
 already lit up here you see it is 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.170
 already turned on so that was really very 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.640
 very fast followed at a few seconds 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.019
 near the new ipad so it's not 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.670
 really blatant deposits level of 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.840
 startup speed so now 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.579
 if you unlock both devices 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.400
 missing some net curtains and unlocks and 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.959
 now we will open 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.730
 we want to open an application that will 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.630
 give us 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.829
 I do not know - what could I 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:43.410
 to have complications simultaneously we're going 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:49.380
 open eurosport so I have to do it so 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.239
 one two three here is like you 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.340
 want to see it's relatively it's 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.380
 relatively the same knowing that good 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.540
 images and not show up because that's 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.200
 it is linked to the network but hey there is 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.549
 really no big differences at 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.739
 device level 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.209
 now at the level of weight and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.690
 size and so if one is a place two 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.480
 devices and which ones one but one is 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.570
 ask on the other so here I go 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.820
 do it like that so we see that 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.440
 the new ipad is slightly larger 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.239
 that ipad r simply makes it 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.319
 because the screen is the same but we have 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.040
 reduced the benches of you see that there is 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.159
 much less 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.040
 2 and 2 on both sides of the screen 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.260
 so this is where the 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.620
 main difference between the two 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.060
 appliances 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.920
 after at the level of the thickness 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.260
 the thickness of the ipad r it is 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.750
 slightly higher than that of the new 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.980
 ipad you're going to see it now it's 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.120
 see moreover to touch anything 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.500
 it's not even sure no it's not even 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.239
 sure I think it's pretty much equivalent 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.079
 except that there is a little more shape 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.549
 curve is a bit more curved on the side of 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.510
 the ipad of the new ipad 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.370
 that's the weight level it's largely 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.439
 ipad r who wins because that one 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.730
 is really bloating that feels 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.689
 by the way to the touch so listen is 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.659
 just about everything I have to tell you 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:11.010
 at photo quality level I can not you 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.159
 show it on video because I like it 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.239
 this video enough I would not say to the 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.380
 rage but in fact it's because I have 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.639
 no ten fingers you out in this 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.590
 moment knowing that I still have the 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.109
 video to show you how to disassemble 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.430
 his home button on my computer but 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.199
 I still can not take it out for you 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.389
 Because of connection then after we will 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:33.330
 see the speed at stake since it's 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:35.880
 for once, a characteristic of 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.680
 two ipod of both ipad so here I have 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.520
 the same game so 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.930
 engelberg ow who is besides a very 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.289
 good game I play it advise him 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.210
 anyway 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.860
 so he's on both devices we're going 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.900
 see where it lights up the most 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.550
 quickly so we will wait and I 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.070
 just check they're not in my 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.449
 multitasking that's how it was in 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.690
 even multitasking so it would have a small 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.000
 little break everything here and I asked 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.570
 what it is also not in the 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.190
 multitasking that's exactly then a 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.780
 two three here and we see that here 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.720
 it's once again very simultaneous 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.840
 but here is a slight advantage to ipad r 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.419
 but well again nothing very 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.590
 very serious so listen now that's me 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.199
 go here's so here comes in conclusion 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.690
 it's still two iPad that had 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:27.720
 acquired still has a slight advantage to 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.000
 the ipad r but without without there being 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.860
 huge differences 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.780
 so I hope this video will have you 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.250
 it will have helped you one or 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.990
 little more advise in the choice 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.729
 of these two devices knowing that still 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.650
 once she is only 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.490
 indicative and especially that it is very 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.439
 summary if this is the case do not hesitate to 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:50.330
 leave a green thumb to the video to you 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:54.089
 subscribe and follow me on twitter or in 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.199
 with the @ multi tasking here I hope 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:56.490
 that it is the old you will have liked 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.569
 me anyway it would have been a pleasure 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.620
 to do it we end up for a 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.620
 next video by everyone
