 you have a human gift with tonight 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.420
 the second episode major le bleu en 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.210
 that is was pretty funny is because 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.800
 the title was good the turn century was good 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.469
 only my club is completely wrong 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.120
 I had exchanged the no for you 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 namely easy have god the one 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.449
 Some are thoughtful to sit here 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 So sorry about that I noticed him 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.210
 immediately changed again I happened to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.980
 also that my club name had to be on 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.840
 fit so I immediately have such a nice 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 manage task completed very thick vest and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.019
 you get one which is talked cunt 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.189
 a them there you have something but like 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.230
 you had seen 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 I am very likely 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.620
 I in my first it is in that vision 10 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.600
 and see what happens here I immediately 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.730
 a red card for shirt attracts what I do 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.040
 still bullshit think micheal you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.930
 first we can say the 500 again 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.700
 600 I know for how many likes get the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.649
 support the four start was a chic 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.940
 otherwise i'm so happy with that 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.950
 So we can do that again in the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 well the alien at 108 stand really come 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.820
 a fucking weird header from outside the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 sixteen of which I thought of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 is possible but apparently it came 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.879
 then way here makes the 1 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.430
 to 1 or everyone is going to make one 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.180
 and I want to tell you just check fifa 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.589
 coins 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.049
 dot nl in the link in the description 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.939
 use code lucky 'all letters and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.040
 government of 5% discount 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.360
 and also check out the fever forum.nl which 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.010
 may among others were on 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.750
 competitions like the netherlands spain and you 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.610
 can really win a lot of coins with it 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.740
 the stake is free so check that too 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.659
 just at the links in the description 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.700
 and now we are already one with three 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.200
 advantage again way and so it went 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.420
 contest in the vision 10 berries 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.280
 smoothly because I am even going to be four 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.210
 income through real chic shot from 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.350
 way 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.840
 and this one also decided to do something different 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 to live and paul we immediately have six 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.170
 points from two matches 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.730
 yes it can't be better but yes it is we too 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.660
 by the way, this was per three points 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.780
 our first laws 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.920
 nice screen for me sorry mistake must 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.710
 I I can just go then 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 trying to get to six points now 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.520
 let's do it that would be nice 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.040
 of course this is not the team either 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.930
 very good and yes we already came in the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.830
 third minute at a distance like him 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.930
 pabon 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.030
 or see the ball in the far corner for something 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.530
 he went one against zero for him 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.540
 can immediately be right again because we are that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.340
 way and you always see when it 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.200
 When I come to a doctor must 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.500
 your best players are, but I would 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.210
 say 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.040
 and what does that way do here and then 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.530
 then he makes the one one and herein card 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.840
 idyllic neto just completely over 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.760
 sprint and then make a two in whose 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.320
 blood so have our victories back 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.250
 which is always tasty of course 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.990
 in the end we have even further 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.370
 perfectly dyrus way that go to 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.310
 inside and he does the roulette he wants 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.720
 shoot and then 9 hoe and that 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.850
 means that I 'm going to get a penalty 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.590
 because it was in the 16s and the disk round 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.520
 on the main line and it was maybe 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.920
 also 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.840
 and yes that penalty will then be used 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.120
 by none other than diaby the ball 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.470
 just yes 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.910
 a ship over the head of the keeper 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.320
 think where i just fucking lucky that 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.720
 everyone but now it belongs to three 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.530
 one eventually had my husband or with 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.290
 my husband 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.450
 buy from this donor or three or two 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.070
 but what the fuck 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.280
 MacKeeper was doing here really 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.280
 serious 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.850
 shia that means we just three two 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.170
 that of course did not mean me 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.209
 match was going to lose a good one 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.370
 attack a good pass 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.320
 leads to the 4 2 and then it goes away 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.920
 he must and then we go on to that 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.220
 six points now certainly true 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.260
 yeah what the fuck is he just here keeper 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.550
 complete something happening here 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.920
 I do n't have words but words 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.599
 becomes 524 ricadi 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.700
 and then it goes well but you would 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.349
 just the keeper i had a much needed 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.760
 need a new one 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.610
 here he comes or something wants a goal 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.300
 a goal from romario on the path no 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.020
 not too neat 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.190
 now I come to six points but look 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.410
 what will happen next 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.209
 it was time that with time 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.310
 episode 2 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.310
 but no one else is inside already 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.280
 yes exactly I already have yogis of no less than 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.590
 15 100 coins and I pretend like me 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.840
 have bought some ribery with 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.610
 blasts music and crazy like an ADD 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.810
 let's rebel i don't know what's going on either 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.760
 wrong with me sorry 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.870
 impatience really something crazy with bubbles 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.310
 at the ball 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.780
 lost a month of hint because we have 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.840
 many wounded shift rick and lascaux 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.310
 record very simple rebol what the fuck he 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.130
 there may be nothing that mcdonald's me 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.860
 liked that im so much ate 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.080
 also yes my opponent is 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.820
 to be a yogi's nothing that could 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.470
 to do is the very first match could 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.060
 do not blame him 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.030
 therefore did not 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.950
 and yes in the end I will get through really again 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.140
 a fucking uglier i won't put on two one 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.910
 man you know sometimes you live here with it 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.800
 sometimes from those against pay attention to the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.780
 housing law site is like from tip to the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.310
 for the white oh yes this was 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.380
 just a single online competition because 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.150
 so I and who have jamaica and on the 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.060
 bank had put thought of yes it is 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.200
 maybe better if i just take a moment 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.310
 can play a single match online 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.200
 before i got there i took my cunt 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.790
 division against energy team is that 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.920
 that's how smart I am about this time 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.290
 well but I just stayed at six point 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.470
 in the vision team because yes this was none 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.630
 division competition and yes then finally 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.400
 I am just so competitive with four 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.780
 around quite like it is the vision 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.910
 it's not a division match like me 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.560
 so said which means that we can up 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.450
 go to the tree and the competition and 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.100
 In this competition we don't buy anyone first 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.510
 us if he so code from Left 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.790
 liverpool really only worth it 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.680
 one in the 81p they for s can not 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.140
 a lot of 470 defend yourings as you 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.850
 but a good addition too 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.190
 for the chemistry to our team it is the 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.640
 mandala and diaby back in the team 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.919
 and yes we have quite a bit now 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.900
 chemistry of 750 we have and like me 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.450
 may even my spanjaard is put in it come 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.280
 I even come to 73 eventually 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.200
 I switch it back to 70 why me 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.450
 it did so often I still 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.640
 but he did and ivan did and then 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.130
 we look for the competition and we come across it 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.720
 this team and that's a pretty good 10 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.400
 way of football team they want first 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.990
 time we encounter it and it's a 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.940
 meaning that vision 10 so actually I have to 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.320
 just win him but yes the 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.940
 match starts well here a good one 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.890
 header of that cart that leads us 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.600
 to the one against zero and I already had 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.940
 immediately 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.980
 hopeful both 9 points but come 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.870
 yes that became the southern one in the 8th 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.720
 minute just as fun because fucking 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.950
 mangala finally my best defender 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.360
 criticized fucked against you but 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.940
 she here you have the ball just shoot me ' 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.680
 and lima and d which is then also subsequently from 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.150
 the rebound i can only just do it 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.440
 if I take it now I have it whole 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.420
 very disappointing 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.760
 here the two become a dory bean thea you 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.770
 this is also not well defended and 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.300
 then yes again such a reboot 4 or three 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.830
 ring it becomes alabaster but yes you know me 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.480
 said it myself though i always just my 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.130
 honest against so yes it is give and 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.140
 take is always your motives this is like 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.840
 sorry but that way to be at 318 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.180
 in the end yes sometimes you agree 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.550
 sometimes you have something against him here i had 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.070
 so it significantly along for the three against 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.750
 two that rhyme hoppakee 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.360
 but what was less cheerful is 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.250
 that he did yes this way 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.100
 a good way a nice goal in four 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.430
 two come and so remained masco because it was 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.930
 rest and you think 4 2 bell is 9 to 4 3 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.610
 at home then I know the plane 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.190
 because that fuckin it really happens that 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.860
 that never your never mind vision but 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.600
 ie so and then this me happened 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.610
 get a penalty for did but diaby 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.560
 is large greenhouse and when I look back 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.660
 it I just put the ball away making the on 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.530
 can shoot this way but then feel it 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.700
 you are already in the mood 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:25.040
 the first loss of great fun because 

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:28.070
 a nice 538 in five 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.330
 what do I still have to do, what is it? 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.100
 simple i just don't have to make a comeback 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.320
 I will do that with quiero 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.360
 and he made five four 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.190
 but this just isn't enough fleece 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.320
 with five four the first loss 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.730
 red le bleu and I can tell you 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.010
 that success is certainly not the last 

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.870
 loss that you are going to see in full 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.340
 episodes don't forget to like 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.690
 that would be great 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.610
 defy as long as we feel like it 

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.930
 as I said, this is certainly not the case 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.280
 the last blew are thanks for it 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.280
 look and let the people
