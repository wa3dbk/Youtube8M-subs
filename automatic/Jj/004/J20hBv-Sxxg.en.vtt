found<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.530> village<00:01:32.680> but<00:01:33.310> he<00:01:33.340> hadn't<00:01:33.670> like

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
found the village but he hadn't like

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.760 
found the village but he hadn't like
exported<00:01:34.360> on<00:01:34.450> his<00:01:34.600> map<00:01:34.870> or<00:01:35.080> something<00:01:35.290> I'm<00:01:35.590> not

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
exported on his map or something I'm not

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.010 
exported on his map or something I'm not
exactly<00:01:35.950> sure<00:01:36.100> but<00:01:37.000> like<00:01:37.120> he<00:01:37.210> said<00:01:37.240> or<00:01:37.750> like<00:01:37.930> I

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
exactly sure but like he said or like I

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.500 
exactly sure but like he said or like I
said<00:01:38.080> like<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.620> get<00:01:39.010> a<00:01:39.040> doubled<00:01:39.580> look<00:01:40.270> at<00:01:40.360> this

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
said like you get a doubled look at this

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.230 
said like you get a doubled look at this
it<00:01:41.020> like<00:01:41.200> rewrites<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.010> village<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.760> as<00:01:43.060> if

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
it like rewrites the village and as if

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it like rewrites the village and as if
you<00:01:43.360> were<00:01:43.510> never<00:01:43.750> here

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
you were never here

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.780 
you were never here
so<00:01:44.620> here<00:01:44.800> let's<00:01:45.010> not<00:01:45.310> like<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.490> want<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.700> show

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
so here let's not like I want to show

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.550 
so here let's not like I want to show
you<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.060> guess<00:01:46.390> here<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.900> it<00:01:47.050> with<00:01:47.170> stuff<00:01:47.350> out<00:01:47.500> of

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
you I guess here to it with stuff out of

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.900 
you I guess here to it with stuff out of
it<00:01:47.710> but<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.160> didn't<00:01:48.340> come<00:01:48.460> with<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.640> chest

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
it but it didn't come with a chest

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.670 
it but it didn't come with a chest
inside<00:01:49.240> here<00:01:49.540> so<00:01:49.900> as<00:01:49.990> far<00:01:50.140> as<00:01:50.230> I<00:01:50.260> know<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.500> well

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
inside here so as far as I know it well

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.410 
inside here so as far as I know it well
it<00:01:50.740> does<00:01:50.950> duplicate<00:01:51.460> all<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.820> stuff<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:52.360> you

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
it does duplicate all the stuff and you

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.110 
it does duplicate all the stuff and you
know<00:01:52.870> you<00:01:52.990> could<00:01:53.230> double<00:01:53.950> double<00:01:54.730> you<00:01:54.970> could

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
know you could double double you could

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.720 
know you could double double you could
duplicate<00:01:55.660> X<00:01:55.930> villages<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:57.130> get<00:01:57.370> double

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
duplicate X villages and you get double

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.430 
duplicate X villages and you get double
the<00:01:57.850> books<00:01:58.120> you<00:01:58.390> could<00:01:58.510> get<00:01:58.630> double<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:58.990> like

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
the books you could get double the like

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.230 
the books you could get double the like
if<00:01:59.560> there's<00:01:59.710> diamonds<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.280> stuff<00:02:00.430> um<00:02:00.640> we

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
if there's diamonds and stuff um we

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.390 
if there's diamonds and stuff um we
looked<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.750> doesn't<00:02:02.020> already<00:02:02.140> work<00:02:02.530> on<00:02:02.770> the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
looked it doesn't already work on the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.430 
looked it doesn't already work on the
look<00:02:03.850> at<00:02:03.940> this<00:02:04.090> okay<00:02:04.630> he<00:02:04.810> said<00:02:04.960> he<00:02:05.200> said<00:02:05.350> he<00:02:05.380> uh

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
look at this okay he said he said he uh

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.380 
look at this okay he said he said he uh
he<00:02:06.220> added<00:02:06.550> some<00:02:06.670> stuff<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.210> make<00:02:07.300> it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
he added some stuff to it to make it

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.820 
he added some stuff to it to make it
kind<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.570> like<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.720> livable<00:02:08.140> village<00:02:08.379> after<00:02:08.649> it

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
kind of like a livable village after it

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.070 
kind of like a livable village after it
was<00:02:08.920> actually<00:02:09.190> done<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.810> was<00:02:10.929> kind<00:02:11.050> of

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
was actually done so that was kind of

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.370 
was actually done so that was kind of
funny<00:02:11.260> but<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:12.760> looked<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.720> end<00:02:13.930> and

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
funny but we looked in the the end and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.080 
funny but we looked in the the end and
the<00:02:14.710> end<00:02:14.740> doesn't<00:02:15.220> seem<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.400> be<00:02:15.490> affected<00:02:15.940> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
the end doesn't seem to be affected and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.650 
the end doesn't seem to be affected and
what

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
what

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.170 
what
a<00:02:16.690> couple<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.380> villages<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:18.610> he<00:02:18.760> had<00:02:18.880> they

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
a couple of villages that he had they

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.000 
a couple of villages that he had they
were<00:02:19.240> closer<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.840> spawn<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.560> some<00:02:20.710> reason

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
were closer to the spawn for some reason

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.710 
were closer to the spawn for some reason
they<00:02:21.130> didn't<00:02:21.370> duplicate<00:02:21.820> so<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.360> don't<00:02:22.600> know

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
they didn't duplicate so I don't know

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.230 
they didn't duplicate so I don't know
like<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.260> said<00:02:23.410> what<00:02:23.800> exactly<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.460> causing<00:02:24.520> this

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
like I said what exactly is causing this

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.940 
like I said what exactly is causing this
I'd<00:02:25.810> really<00:02:26.080> appreciate<00:02:26.170> if<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.620> guys<00:02:26.770> could

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
I'd really appreciate if you guys could

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.010 
I'd really appreciate if you guys could
tell<00:02:27.220> me<00:02:27.340> if<00:02:27.490> if<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.910> know<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.750> know<00:02:28.840> if<00:02:28.930> you

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
tell me if if you know you know if you

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.200 
tell me if if you know you know if you
don't<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.470> cool<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:29.980> maybe<00:02:30.190> maybe<00:02:30.610> we

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
don't that's cool like maybe maybe we

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.340 
don't that's cool like maybe maybe we
can<00:02:31.360> figure<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.720> out<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:32.020> will<00:02:32.200> make<00:02:32.290> a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
can figure it out but I will make a

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.230 
can figure it out but I will make a
video<00:02:32.650> if<00:02:32.830> anybody<00:02:33.160> figures<00:02:33.460> out<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> way<00:02:33.820> to<00:02:33.880> do

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
video if anybody figures out a way to do

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.630 
video if anybody figures out a way to do
this<00:02:34.420> consistently<00:02:35.190> because<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.430> think<00:02:36.490> that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
this consistently because I think that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.000 
this consistently because I think that
would<00:02:36.790> be<00:02:36.820> amazing<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.570> have<00:02:37.690> double<00:02:38.560> villages

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
would be amazing to have double villages

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.790 
would be amazing to have double villages
just<00:02:39.280> think<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:39.970> your<00:02:40.000> world<00:02:40.510> for<00:02:41.170> some<00:02:41.530> reason

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
just think in your world for some reason

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.260 
just think in your world for some reason
it<00:02:41.890> doesn't<00:02:42.130> duplicate<00:02:42.430> these<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.850> guess<00:02:43.060> I

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
it doesn't duplicate these I guess I

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.840 
it doesn't duplicate these I guess I
don't<00:02:43.330> know<00:02:44.110> exactly<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:45.160> awfully<00:02:45.580> weird

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
don't know exactly it's awfully weird

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.580 
don't know exactly it's awfully weird
right<00:02:46.330> though<00:02:46.570> like<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.110> see<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.290> double

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
right though like to see a double

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.110 
right though like to see a double
village<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.010> mean<00:02:48.130> look<00:02:48.220> at<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.820> he<00:02:48.970> said

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
village I mean look at this like he said

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.540 
village I mean look at this like he said
this<00:02:49.270> one<00:02:49.450> was<00:02:49.480> um<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:50.470> under<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.040> under<00:02:51.460> the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
this one was um like under the under the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.760 
this one was um like under the under the
ground<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.940> little<00:02:52.030> bit<00:02:52.270> oh<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.780> seed<00:02:53.110> for<00:02:53.620> this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
ground a little bit oh the seed for this

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.340 
ground a little bit oh the seed for this
is<00:02:53.980> one<00:02:54.580> so<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.330> just<00:02:55.480> go<00:02:55.660> into<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> seed<00:02:56.140> name

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
is one so you just go into the seed name

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.380 
is one so you just go into the seed name
you<00:02:56.500> just<00:02:56.680> type<00:02:56.830> in<00:02:56.980> one<00:02:57.400> literally<00:02:58.150> just

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
you just type in one literally just

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.990 
you just type in one literally just

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
though does the number one and then it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.540 
though does the number one and then it
is<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.740> world<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.340> here

if<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.200> want<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.380> come<00:03:05.500> check<00:03:05.560> out<00:03:05.800> this

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
if you want to come check out this

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.020 
if you want to come check out this
village<00:03:06.160> because<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.490> tried<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.000> couple

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
village because I tried it a couple

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.210 
village because I tried it a couple
times<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.720> would<00:03:08.170> not<00:03:08.290> work<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.040> here<00:03:09.160> you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
times and it would not work so here you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.870 
times and it would not work so here you
go<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:09.460> negative<00:03:10.050> 930<00:03:11.050> is<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.190> X<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.670> y<00:03:12.820> is

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
go so negative 930 is the X and the y is

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.110 
go so negative 930 is the X and the y is
73<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.140> Z<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:14.470> forward<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.580> there<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:15.820> go

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
73 and the Z is forward so there you go

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.120 
73 and the Z is forward so there you go
so<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.390> thought<00:03:16.570> this<00:03:16.720> was<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:17.170> super<00:03:17.890> weird
