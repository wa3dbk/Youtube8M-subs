though today what I'm going to use the
first<00:00:13.820> one<00:00:14.059> is<00:00:14.750> very<00:00:15.320> very<00:00:15.500> simple<00:00:15.740> it's

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400

play a match you get a point if you win
three<00:00:30.439> points<00:00:30.710> in<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:30.860> row<00:00:31.630> that's<00:00:32.630> it<00:00:33.309> that's

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
three points in a row that's it that's

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.160 
three points in a row that's it that's
how<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:34.610> step<00:00:34.969> how<00:00:35.120> you<00:00:35.180> score<00:00:35.480> a<00:00:35.510> point<00:00:35.570> you

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
how you step how you score a point you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.110 
how you step how you score a point you
can<00:00:36.350> only<00:00:36.590> get<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:36.920> peg<00:00:37.190> if<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:37.670> score<00:00:37.940> three

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
can only get a peg if you score three

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.690 
can only get a peg if you score three
points<00:00:38.210> in<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.629> row<00:00:38.890> all<00:00:39.890> right<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:40.160> it's<00:00:40.190> timed

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
points in a row all right so it's timed

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.750 
points in a row all right so it's timed
will<00:00:41.629> put<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:41.930> on<00:00:42.110> in<00:00:42.289> your<00:00:42.440> play<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:43.010> if<00:00:43.640> you

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
will put you on in your play and if you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.270 
will put you on in your play and if you
get<00:00:43.850> three<00:00:44.060> points<00:00:44.210> in<00:00:44.360> a<00:00:44.420> row<00:00:44.450> you<00:00:44.570> get<00:00:44.840> paid

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
get three points in a row you get paid

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.580 
get three points in a row you get paid
okay<00:00:46.280> if<00:00:47.240> you<00:00:47.390> don't<00:00:47.540> get<00:00:47.690> 3.0<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:48.290> don't<00:00:48.470> and

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
okay if you don't get 3.0 you don't and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.170 
okay if you don't get 3.0 you don't and
the<00:00:48.650> reason<00:00:49.130> we<00:00:49.220> do<00:00:49.310> that<00:00:49.340> is<00:00:49.489> statistically

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
the reason we do that is statistically

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.790 
the reason we do that is statistically
we<00:00:50.300> know<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.900> person<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.290> wins<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.620> most

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
we know the person that wins the most

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.030 
we know the person that wins the most
three<00:00:52.040> points<00:00:52.310> in<00:00:52.400> a<00:00:52.489> row<00:00:54.040> ninety-eight

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
three points in a row ninety-eight

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.340 
three points in a row ninety-eight
percent<00:00:55.130> the<00:00:55.399> time<00:00:55.579> when<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.850> match<00:00:56.260> so<00:00:57.260> we

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
percent the time when to the match so we

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.880 
percent the time when to the match so we
want<00:00:57.500> place<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:58.280> focus<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.820> stay<00:00:59.000> focused<00:00:59.890> now

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
want place to focus and stay focused now

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.350 
want place to focus and stay focused now
again<00:01:01.220> this<00:01:01.340> tends<00:01:01.610> to<00:01:01.700> be<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:01.850> better<00:01:02.000> format

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
again this tends to be a better format

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.509 
again this tends to be a better format
for<00:01:02.600> good<00:01:02.840> oranges<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.590> green<00:01:03.890> players<00:01:04.250> and

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
for good oranges and green players and

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.429 
for good oranges and green players and
the<00:01:04.579> reason<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.239> course<00:01:05.360> most<00:01:06.049> little<00:01:06.409> kids

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
the reason is of course most little kids

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.810 
the reason is of course most little kids
don't<00:01:06.860> remember<00:01:07.189> if<00:01:07.280> they've<00:01:07.430> won<00:01:07.610> three

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
don't remember if they've won three

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.690 
don't remember if they've won three
points<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.270> row<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:09.200> start<00:01:09.229> with<00:01:09.619> right<00:01:10.520> but

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
points in a row to start with right but

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.950 
points in a row to start with right but
also<00:01:10.880> it's<00:01:11.119> that<00:01:11.240> level<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.600> concentration

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
also it's that level of concentration

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.760 
also it's that level of concentration
and<00:01:12.350> focus<00:01:12.439> that<00:01:12.979> we're<00:01:13.399> trying<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.670> develop

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
and focus that we're trying to develop

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.250 
and focus that we're trying to develop
this<00:01:15.770> one<00:01:16.659> wigan<00:01:17.659> is<00:01:17.750> you're<00:01:17.900> going<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.080> play<00:01:18.229> a

going to play games scoring rather than

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.990 
going to play games scoring rather than
tiebreak<00:01:22.850> scoring<00:01:23.409> okay<00:01:24.409> you've<00:01:25.190> started<00:01:25.520> 30

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
because the other thing we know is a lot

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.850 
because the other thing we know is a lot
of<00:01:51.420> kids<00:01:51.690> get<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.890> switch<00:01:53.610> off
