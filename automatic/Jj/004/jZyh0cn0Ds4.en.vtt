00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.440 
have your gauge strings and
reconsidering<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.179> trying<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
reconsidering that now I'm trying to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.410 
reconsidering that now I'm trying to
work<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:09.630> way<00:02:09.929> back<00:02:10.140> toward<00:02:11.009> tens<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.970> how

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
work my way back toward tens and see how

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.120 
work my way back toward tens and see how
that<00:02:12.600> sounds<00:02:12.870> good<00:02:13.319> what<00:02:13.830> are<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.069> to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
that sounds good what are you going to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.440 
that sounds good what are you going to
do<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:15.060> small<00:02:15.510> guitar<00:02:16.519> shogi<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.730> dings<00:02:17.970> I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
do so a small guitar shogi the dings I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.420 
do so a small guitar shogi the dings I
love<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.260> design<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.830> headstock<00:02:20.280> I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
love this design on the headstock I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.800 
love this design on the headstock I
think<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:20.760> makes<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.209> much<00:02:21.420> sense<00:02:21.450> because

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
think this makes so much sense because

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.380 
think this makes so much sense because
you're<00:02:22.170> putting<00:02:22.350> less<00:02:22.680> strength<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
you're putting less strength on the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.199 
you're putting less strength on the
strings<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> Framus<00:02:25.970> that's<00:02:26.970> got<00:02:27.180> a

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
strings I have a Framus that's got a

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.400 
strings I have a Framus that's got a
headstock<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:29.870> big<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.170> big

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
headstock that's like a big it's big

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.740 
headstock that's like a big it's big
it's<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.799> a<00:02:31.830> big<00:02:32.160> thing<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.420> springs

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
it's like a big thing and the springs

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.270 
it's like a big thing and the springs
are<00:02:34.019> going<00:02:34.260> out<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.950> there's<00:02:35.130> too

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
are going out like that and there's too

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.440 
are going out like that and there's too
much<00:02:35.430> spring<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.030> think<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.540> shut<00:02:36.810> up<00:02:36.989> Ted

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
much spring I think so shut up Ted

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.670 
much spring I think so shut up Ted
