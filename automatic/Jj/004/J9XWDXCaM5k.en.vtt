00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.260
 there are good to all that such kids 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:09.200
 welcome one more day to my channel today 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.690
 we have a new tutorial for a program 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.110
 super curious that I found by the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.439
 windows 8 store is called mussi maker 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.900
 good jam is very serious is a program 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.039
 Free that you can download it from 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.249
 the store really I have 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.109
 downloaded and clear in this case then 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.109
 I wanted to do a dubstep song 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.870
 free so it was not copyright 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.050
 so the good thing is that it can not 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.559
 let use what is the basis of your 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.809
 step 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.570
 You can also use the villas of 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.550
 techno house and rock good in this case 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.520
 then the only one that installs two works of 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.280
 techno house 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.620
 and the one of edu step these two then 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.630
 really it does not make me lack thereof 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.630
 lar the good in this case also as 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.640
 you see here there are new musical styles 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.880
 but of course this is already payment in case 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 you want you can pay two euros with 99 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.650
 that this one is not bad either and here 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.650
 they have new styles of music 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.520
 like hip hop and co volume 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.580
 reggaeton techno volume good of all 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.009
 of everything really as you see here is of 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.229
 all good then let's how is 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.450
 really the program how it works 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:35.580
 good in this case then I'm going to go to your 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:38.700
 step and wait for it to be charged vale 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.130
 let's pause and select all the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.710
 clues that are put in this case I 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.190
 I was doing some more provided 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.750
 nothing and here in this case we have 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.240
 here what would be the low is worth 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.450
 we click on the bass 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.880
 we do not hear what would be the bass 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.549
 ok here we have the instruments 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.890
 we have the battery effects this 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.450
 the cloud I do not know what really the 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.690
 sequencers and the good I think it is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.300
 the synthetics also and the boxes and 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.410
 those of vocal or that is and is quite 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.130
 simple that is, it's a pretty program 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:26.970
 good or to do free and be 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.739
 well entertained with the program and the 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 it's quite entertaining 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.910
 Well, let's make a kind of 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.819
 seeds and quickies to see how 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.580
 works good in this case I have to 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:43.290
 added the bass is worth it now we want 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:46.140
 add the most important thing to the box and there 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.660
 we have the box 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.000
 ah 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:56.510
 and now we want to take him down a little bit 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.520
 volume to the box we got it down and you 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.470
 we went up a little more the low vale 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.380
 Well, let's not go down a little bit more 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.940
 because it starts to vibrate here we have 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.290
 the time zone we have what it would be 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.130
 as a kind of kwh smoothing that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.870
 now we will see it is worth it there 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.340
 all good you just have to go selecting 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.560
 very simple click here and you get 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.660
 directly the cash and everything 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.530
 we go up we go down the decibels 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:34.540
 pretty simple kids 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.540
 we can also choose 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:42.300
 the voice we can also change here this 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.820
 this area here is what will make 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.470
 let's change the sound, that is if we have 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:53.240
 here the box when we click and then I 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.240
 change another box directly 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.709
 It's very good now how it was 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.090
 explaining here you can control what 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:07.790
 of the sound ie the volume rather 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.659
 always have it 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.870
 on a good enough short scale to 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:18.620
 Do not go over the limit either because 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:23.120
 We got beat reaches and reaches the 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.750
 red because we take it and lower it very 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.400
 well here we see supposedly what 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.520
 it would be like a kind of hoisting 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.310
 serious strong soft sharp and we catch and 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.710
 we can 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.660
 I will do the wave as you want 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.990
 or get off 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.630
 to the right we go to the left or 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.060
 be a pass can really do what 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.150
 who want can play with the sound 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.030
 they can do anything kids 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.060
 good nothing is good is all right not 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.230
 but let's lower it a little 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.640
 we'll see it here ok 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.640
 we change the voices 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.150
 it's very good now we want 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.480
 have the harmonies can do what 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.260
 we really want 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.480
 that is, we can 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.480
 as you wish sincerely 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:32.139
 I'm not really doing the crazy thing 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:32.139
 I'm doing it no more than here 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.569
 in the harmonies is not that each 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.779
 successful 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:45.369
 then I wanted to teach them that for example 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:48.589
 if we click here with the right button 

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:52.420
 Well what we would get for a 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:56.000
 kind of skin that we can change it 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:59.360
 we can choose the skin we want 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.250
 We can choose anything really 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.840
 Boys 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.840
 this is what we had 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.580
 this is what we really had 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:16.340
 these beautiful worth 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.320
 if we get on top of this we're going 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.390
 directly 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.100
 good to the selection there is no talk of 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.550
 selection of what you want here 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.820
 also the music style then 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.150
 you can also make mixes you can 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.070
 load the selected ones we also 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.030
 we come to 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.850
 vocal and here we choose for the vowel that 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:45.020
 we want and we listen to it makes a 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:50.470
 preview and blogs are uploaded 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.470
 and we already have the vowel here 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.910
 all right 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:05.820
 or so then good really is 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.289
 pretty simple guys is a pass 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:12.590
 just go for playing playing for 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:14.870
 with music playing color 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.440
 supposedly what they would be as a species 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.440
 of sampler 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.949
 and nothing 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:30.090
 let's see I think I do not forget anything about 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:35.100
 how the good program is used here 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:38.700
 because here we would change styles 

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:41.020
 here they have one already made we change to 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.139
 other 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:46.440
 good that they are already really made 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:49.900
 we can keep doing more we can 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:52.139
 right button rename the same 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.469
 perfect 

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:59.639
 here to record well this will be for 

00:07:55.469 --> 00:08:04.520
 make a loop guys and nothing this is the 

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:04.520
 program is called music maker piano 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:11.729
 in this for windows 8 free if you 

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:17.300
 It seems that they like it and it says 

00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:17.300
 they comment nothing kids until then
