are told differently you know you seeing
people<00:02:20.959> rather<00:02:21.530> than<00:02:21.680> using<00:02:21.980> your

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
people rather than using your

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.190 
people rather than using your
imagination<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.209> she<00:02:23.270> had<00:02:23.540> some<00:02:23.720> very<00:02:23.959> good

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
imagination so she had some very good

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.230 
imagination so she had some very good
insight<00:02:24.560> into<00:02:24.590> like<00:02:25.190> how<00:02:25.850> something<00:02:26.120> might

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
insight into like how something might

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.030 
insight into like how something might
come<00:02:26.390> off<00:02:26.600> versus<00:02:27.230> how<00:02:27.350> she<00:02:27.410> had<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.800> read<00:02:27.920> it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
come off versus how she had to read it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.199 
come off versus how she had to read it
in<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.130> book<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.490> it's<00:02:28.580> very<00:02:28.670> helpful<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.090> talk

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
in the book so it's very helpful to talk

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.340 
in the book so it's very helpful to talk
to<00:02:29.360> her<00:02:29.480> and<00:02:29.540> obviously<00:02:29.660> David<00:02:30.080> this

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
to her and obviously David this

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.380 
to her and obviously David this
extremely<00:02:30.800> helpful<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:31.880> know<00:02:31.970> Nick<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:32.360> a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
extremely helpful and you know Nick is a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.880 
extremely helpful and you know Nick is a
character<00:02:32.780> who's<00:02:32.959> who's<00:02:33.320> under<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> lot<00:02:33.800> of

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
character who's who's under a lot of

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.800 
character who's who's under a lot of
media<00:02:34.220> scrutiny<00:02:34.490> in<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.000> film<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.630> think

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
media scrutiny in the film and I think

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.510 
media scrutiny in the film and I think
being<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.290> know<00:02:36.410> for<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:36.709> being<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.220> celebrity

being you know for you being a celebrity

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.070 
being you know for you being a celebrity
must<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:38.030> used<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.900> different

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
must be used to that it's a different

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.110 
must be used to that it's a different
type<00:02:39.350> of<00:02:39.380> scrutiny<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.010> course<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:40.910> are<00:02:41.030> you

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
type of scrutiny of course but are you

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
of the leeches on that and they just are

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.310 
of the leeches on that and they just are
sanctimonious<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.000> they<00:03:32.269> whip<00:03:32.450> up<00:03:32.630> anger<00:03:33.110> and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
they stoke the fires and I think that's

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.210

what's<00:03:35.450> irresponsible<00:03:36.380> not<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.530> hypocritical

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
what's irresponsible not to hypocritical

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.470 
what's irresponsible not to hypocritical
and<00:03:37.280> that's<00:03:37.430> kind<00:03:37.610> of<00:03:37.640> what<00:03:37.790> David<00:03:37.970> went<00:03:38.209> after

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
and that's kind of what David went after

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.850 
and that's kind of what David went after
which<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:38.750> really<00:03:39.019> a<00:03:39.049> different<00:03:39.440> thing<00:03:39.650> than

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
which is really a different thing than

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.009 
which is really a different thing than
the<00:03:40.549> celebrity<00:03:40.940> fixation<00:03:41.450> it's<00:03:41.690> a<00:03:41.750> different

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
the celebrity fixation it's a different

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.430 
the celebrity fixation it's a different
movie<00:03:42.230> I'd<00:03:42.410> be<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.560> very<00:03:42.739> interesting<00:03:42.980> movie
