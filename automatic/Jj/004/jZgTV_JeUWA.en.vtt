you can match that type of pressure

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.300 
you can match that type of pressure
anywhere<00:01:10.240> else<00:01:10.360> but<00:01:10.510> yeah<00:01:10.780> absolutely<00:01:11.470> you're

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.350 
couple balances in the band like for
example<00:01:47.260> I'm<00:01:47.560> really<00:01:47.830> melodic<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.400> he<00:01:48.580> brings

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
example I'm really melodic and he brings

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.420 
example I'm really melodic and he brings
a<00:01:49.480> bit<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.780> out<00:01:49.900> brings<00:01:50.680> me<00:01:50.860> out<00:01:50.980> of<00:01:51.070> over

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
a bit the out brings me out of over

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.070 
a bit the out brings me out of over
melodic<00:01:51.820> lands<00:01:52.000> so<00:01:52.210> that's<00:01:52.810> like<00:01:52.930> an

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
melodic lands so that's like an

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.420 
melodic lands so that's like an
important<00:01:53.470> chemistry<00:01:53.830> in<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.979> band<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.280> think

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
important chemistry in the band I think

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.800 
important chemistry in the band I think
it's<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> lot<00:01:54.670> about<00:01:54.790> chemistry's<00:01:55.479> in<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.630> band

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
it's a lot about chemistry's in the band

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.870 
it's a lot about chemistry's in the band
you<00:01:55.930> know<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.260> if<00:01:56.950> if<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.550> have<00:01:57.670> something

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
you know so if if you have something

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.100 
you know so if if you have something
that<00:01:58.030> big<00:01:58.120> starts<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.479> come<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.780> little<00:01:58.990> too

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
that big starts to come to a little too

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.390 
that big starts to come to a little too
melodic<00:01:59.440> sandwich<00:01:59.770> jobs<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.220> put<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.370> little

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
melodic sandwich jobs and put a little

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.100 
melodic sandwich jobs and put a little
bite<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.880> put<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.240> spice<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:01.690> knows<00:02:01.840> I'm<00:02:02.020> a
