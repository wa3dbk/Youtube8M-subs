solar<00:04:20.780> row<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:21.739> is<00:04:21.889> one<00:04:22.039> of<00:04:22.160> our

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
solar row this is one of our

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.190 
solar row this is one of our
monocrystalline<00:04:23.030> solar<00:04:23.210> panels<00:04:23.690> right<00:04:23.900> here

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
monocrystalline solar panels right here

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.010 
monocrystalline solar panels right here
super<00:04:24.950> durable<00:04:25.190> super<00:04:25.820> lightweight<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.539> in
