00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 or 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.660
 hello and welcome to another corner of 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.610
 handyman today I'm super super super 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.379
 happy because we are in December we are going 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.850
 to make the majorities impossible negative 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.980
 this colorines exercise that I bought myself 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.270
 me and it is with which it is impossible not to be 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.130
 happy and good guys you already know that 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.110
 we are at the time then of Christmas of 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.550
 Holidays to spend with the family and 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.800
 then I thought about doing a craft 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.750
 well according to this time and the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.550
 craft is this sock I saw it from 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.949
 new in the attempt we can put 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.660
 candy candies and rich things are 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.579
 oriented more or less without making it a 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.199
 hour and they begin to medium difficulty 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.909
 it depends because if you're getting to know 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.559
 medium difficulty and if you do it with 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:43.789
 Glue is easy difficulty 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.559
 before I start I'm just going to make them a 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.969
 warning and is that I'm not too 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.859
 good doing crafts I'm going 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.420
 doing as improvising then if 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.589
 you see that I do something wrong that could do it 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.300
 better then you tell me in the 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.249
 comments with a lot of respect and I what 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.170
 we will improve please be nervous 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:00:59.170
 I'm not going to start now 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.710
 we will need filters of colors that 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.570
 we want a paper a lace scissors 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.570
 needles and pins and thread 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.049
 the first thing is to draw the form of 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.830
 our sock on paper and 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.830
 cut it out 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.010
 I have made it the size of my hand 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.170
 now we place the silhouette on the felt 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.940
 red and we cut two pieces in which 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 It's too much to try always 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.080
 about instead of missing 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.880
 We put the two pieces together and put the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.450
 silhouette on top and we fix it with 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.450
 pins 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.330
 then we cut 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.940
 when we finish we remove the pins 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 and we will have the shape in the felt 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.690
 now we are left with what would be the 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.130
 front of the sock because 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.900
 let's put what would be the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.150
 decoration me for this I will use 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.310
 the white felt we have to cut out 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.250
 again two pieces that give us a leftover 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.630
 for what we want to draw the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.630
 shape and cut it 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.159
 these are the ones that I'm going to put at the moment 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.080
 me but you can also put a piece 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.849
 up with the same method I will 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.920
 later with a little more method 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.049
 complicated but which I like more now 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.940
 you can stick or sew them I'm going to 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.920
 sew as after we will sew all the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.790
 outside now we're just going to sew the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.790
 interior part 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.160
 I'm going to do it this way but 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.290
 you do it in the way that most 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.030
 you like it as I said in another video if 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.220
 you do not control this needle better 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.319
 ask for help from someone who does or seeks 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.319
 how it is done and take great care 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.870
 once we finish we put together the two 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.520
 parts of the felt square the good and 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.120
 we return to make voodoo the poor 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.890
 sock 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.930
 - for the part above that will be the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.100
 opening so we started sewing by 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.100
 this height more or less 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.980
 the result will be something like this 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.900
 and now we go to do the white part 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.610
 from above the goal is to make a 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.230
 cylinder that fits inside the opening 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.180
 for this we measure how much cloth 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.610
 we need surrounding the top 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.620
 with white felt 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.620
 once we have it then we cut 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.530
 This piece is folded in the place where 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.530
 would go and remove the excess 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.989
 we sew to join and once sewn the 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.939
 white piece must be joined with the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.540
 red so we finished sewing the 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.700
 sock 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:57.049
 this time going through red felt and 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.049
 white once done we double 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.090
 let's go for the last step we take the 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.260
 cord and we see how much we need to 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.260
 hang the sock well 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.420
 we cut the piece and now we are going to 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.880
 make a hole in the top of 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.620
 back of the sock with the scissors has 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.600
 that being a normal hole, do not do it 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.579
 larger than the cord needs 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.930
 when we have it we pass the cord and 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.930
 we sew the bottom part 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.060
 with this I would be everything but you 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.950
 you are free to put more decoration 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.950
 like jingle bells or stars 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.690
 you know how are the crafts each 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.440
 one with your creativity can do what 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.120
 you want 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.979
 these are two models taught but 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.510
 you can innovate and you can also 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.160
 get closer you have to not be Christmas 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.050
 the question is that if you do one of these 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.090
 seedlings I would love to see how you 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.220
 it stays so super super obligated 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.380
 to take a picture and send it to my twitter 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.850
 At the platform girl, well, nothing 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.830
 more I hope you liked it a lot 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.360
 this video and that you find useful , you know 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.770
 that you liked the right thing would be that 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.870
 I gave him that I like and that what 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.610
 will share through social networks not 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.810
 It is also not to look at the box 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.669
 description because there are a lot of 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.199
 interesting links and also also you 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.880
 I leave the link of this exercise for super 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.110
 I would not be too bad either 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.220
 you will leave in the comments then something 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.220
 nice see you
