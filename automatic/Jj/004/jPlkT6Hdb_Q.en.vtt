00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
wanted to get a tutorial out but I

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.060 
wanted to get a tutorial out but I

couldn't do the tree tutorials so as you
have<00:00:41.579> probably<00:00:41.790> read<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> title<00:00:42.629> I'm

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
don't know obviously this starts at

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.330 
don't know obviously this starts at
always<00:00:56.010> edible<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.239> code<00:00:57.480> um<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.219> add

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
always edible is the code um but to add

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.889 
always edible is the code um but to add
the<00:00:59.489> potion<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.879> fact<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.210> really<00:01:00.600> really

the potion in fact it's really really
easy<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.949> line<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.129> code<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:03.059> dot<00:01:03.589> set

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
easy just one line of code this dot set

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.789 
easy just one line of code this dot set
nah<00:01:06.890> sorry<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.159> popped<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.939> it

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
nah sorry that popped up and it

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.429 
nah sorry that popped up and it
completely<00:01:10.799> messed<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> auto<00:01:12.420> fill<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.229> in

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
completely messed up the auto fill in in

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.420 
completely messed up the auto fill in in
eclipse<00:01:13.770> dart<00:01:14.369> set<00:01:14.580> potion<00:01:15.270> effect<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.430> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
eclipse dart set potion effect and it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.640 
eclipse dart set potion effect and it
has<00:01:17.790> four<00:01:18.060> parameters<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.810> first<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
has four parameters the first one is the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.380 
has four parameters the first one is the
potion<00:01:19.979> ID<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.430> we're<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> say<00:01:20.939> potion

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
potion ID so we're going to say potion

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.260 
potion ID so we're going to say potion
dot<00:01:22.040> regeneration<00:01:23.040> i'm<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.150> add

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
dot regeneration i'm going to add

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.249 
dot regeneration i'm going to add
regeneration<00:01:24.840> ID<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.570> second<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:27.990> here

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
regeneration ID and the second one here

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.179 
regeneration ID and the second one here
is<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.490> duration<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.920> this<00:01:31.920> um

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
is going to be the duration so this um

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.310 
is going to be the duration so this um
I'm<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.270> quite<00:01:33.479> sure<00:01:33.509> what<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> number

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
I'm not quite sure what the number

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.460 
I'm not quite sure what the number
represents<00:01:34.979> however<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.350> were

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
represents however I know if you were

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.700 
represents however I know if you were
decided<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> say<00:01:38.250> 500<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> would<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.710> about

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
decided to say 500 it would be about

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.850 
decided to say 500 it would be about
eight<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.579> half<00:01:41.610> minutes<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.740> little<00:01:43.740> bit

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
eight and a half minutes a little bit

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
eight and a half minutes a little bit
less<00:01:44.009> than<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.340> think<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
less than that I think I'm just going to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.139 
less than that I think I'm just going to
set<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.229> 500<00:01:47.899> for<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.229> then

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
set this to 500 for now and then

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.700 
set this to 500 for now and then
amplifier<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.509> obviously<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.619> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
amplifier so obviously this is going to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.060 
amplifier so obviously this is going to
be<00:01:52.799> how<00:01:53.100> much<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.670> affects<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.950> potion<00:01:55.950> I'm

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
be how much it affects the potion I'm

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.560 
be how much it affects the potion I'm
going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> set<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.850> five<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.329> it'll<00:01:57.540> be

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
going to set this to five so it'll be

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
going to set this to five so it'll be
incredibly<00:01:58.229> regenerative<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.130> then<00:01:59.850> at<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
incredibly regenerative and then at the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.700 
incredibly regenerative and then at the
end<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> probability<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
end you have the probability of the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.350 
end you have the probability of the
effect<00:02:01.979> happening<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.759> might<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.119> always

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
effect happening you might not always

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.260 
effect happening you might not always
want<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.380> affect<00:02:04.619> your<00:02:04.920> player<00:02:05.270> for

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
want this to affect your player for

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.650 
want this to affect your player for
example<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.429> in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.119> vanilla<00:02:09.360> game

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
example if you had in the vanilla game

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.440 
example if you had in the vanilla game
the<00:02:09.929> zombie<00:02:10.289> flesh<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:11.129> has<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.970> high

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
the zombie flesh that has a high

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.970 
the zombie flesh that has a high
probability<00:02:12.800> but

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
probability but

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.369 
probability but
it<00:02:14.040> doesn't<00:02:14.400> always<00:02:14.580> affect<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.390> player<00:02:15.569> so

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
it doesn't always affect the player so

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.899 
it doesn't always affect the player so
I'm<00:02:16.620> going<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.860> set<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.159> to<00:02:17.310> one<00:02:17.430> point<00:02:17.580> 0<00:02:17.700> F

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
I'm going to set this to one point 0 F

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.399 
I'm going to set this to one point 0 F
because<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.360> wanted<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.720> always<00:02:18.870> affect<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
because I wanted to always affect the

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.229 
because I wanted to always affect the
player<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.459> actually<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.030> end<00:02:21.150> of

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
player and that is actually the end of

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.360 
player and that is actually the end of
the<00:02:21.330> code<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:22.470> if<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.709> go<00:02:22.860> ahead<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.099> test

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
the code now if we go ahead and test

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.490 
the code now if we go ahead and test
this<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:26.569> I'm<00:02:27.569> not<00:02:27.780> going<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.080> go<00:02:28.200> into<00:02:28.290> full

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
this and I'm not going to go into full

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.770 
this and I'm not going to go into full
screen<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.069> my<00:02:29.430> video<00:02:29.760> will<00:02:30.030> compress

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
screen so that my video will compress

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.009 
screen so that my video will compress
faster<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.440> i<00:02:31.530> can<00:02:31.709> upload<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.069> faster<00:02:34.370> no<00:02:36.019> um

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
faster and i can upload it faster no um

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.710 
faster and i can upload it faster no um
I<00:02:37.680> had<00:02:38.250> actually<00:02:38.459> been<00:02:38.790> testing<00:02:39.239> around<00:02:39.510> with

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
I had actually been testing around with

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.190 
I had actually been testing around with
that<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:41.000> don't<00:02:42.000> want<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.540> use<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.750> world

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that and I don't want to use that world

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.440 
that and I don't want to use that world
because<00:02:44.099> yes<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.579> want<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.879> continue<00:02:45.060> loading

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
because yes I want to continue loading

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.069 
because yes I want to continue loading
okay<00:02:46.260> um<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:48.920> let's<00:02:49.920> find<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.190> good<00:02:50.310> tall<00:02:50.489> tree

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
okay um so let's find a good tall tree

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.809 
okay um so let's find a good tall tree
ok<00:02:52.079> I'm<00:02:52.410> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.890> give<00:02:53.280> myself<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:54.000> food<00:02:54.870> and

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
ok I'm going to give myself the food and

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.349 
ok I'm going to give myself the food and
set<00:02:58.190> /<00:02:59.190> game<00:02:59.400> mode<00:02:59.640> 0<00:03:00.290> eat<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.530> food<00:03:02.359> and

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
set / game mode 0 eat the food and

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.940 
set / game mode 0 eat the food and
you'll<00:03:03.569> see<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.260> has<00:03:04.290> set<00:03:04.739> our

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
you'll see that it has set our

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.300 
you'll see that it has set our
regeneration<00:03:05.670> 28<00:03:06.540> minutes<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.319> 20<00:03:07.859> seconds<00:03:08.190> i

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
regeneration 28 minutes and 20 seconds i

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.860 
regeneration 28 minutes and 20 seconds i
think<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.640> was<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.200> 500<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.950> quite<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.670> bit<00:03:11.970> you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
think it was so 500 is quite a bit you

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.270 
think it was so 500 is quite a bit you
can<00:03:13.019> mess<00:03:13.170> around<00:03:13.200> with<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.680> number<00:03:13.890> all<00:03:14.129> you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
can mess around with that number all you

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.129 
can mess around with that number all you
want<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.720> if<00:03:15.720> i<00:03:16.019> jump<00:03:16.410> off<00:03:16.590> here<00:03:18.049> you'll<00:03:19.049> see

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
want and if i jump off here you'll see

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.819 
want and if i jump off here you'll see
it<00:03:19.440> fills<00:03:19.739> up<00:03:20.299> incredibly<00:03:21.299> quickly<00:03:21.829> i'm

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
it fills up incredibly quickly i'm

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.940 
it fills up incredibly quickly i'm
already<00:03:23.310> healed<00:03:23.940> after<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.840> fall<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:25.470> it

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
already healed after that fall and it

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.729 
already healed after that fall and it
was<00:03:26.069> quite<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.340> fall<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:27.750> took<00:03:28.260> away<00:03:28.470> more<00:03:28.709> than

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
was quite a fall it took away more than

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.069 
was quite a fall it took away more than
half<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.220> my<00:03:29.430> bar<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:29.910> within<00:03:30.419> an<00:03:30.630> instant<00:03:30.959> I

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
half of my bar and within an instant I

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.030 
half of my bar and within an instant I
was<00:03:31.230> healed<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.829> an<00:03:32.959> amplifier<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.139> 5<00:03:34.319> is<00:03:34.680> quite

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
was healed so an amplifier of 5 is quite

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.490 
was healed so an amplifier of 5 is quite
a<00:03:35.069> bit<00:03:35.250> too<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.120> that's<00:03:36.450> going<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.260> end

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
a bit too so that's going to be the end

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.670 
a bit too so that's going to be the end
of<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:37.919> tutorial<00:03:38.389> in<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:40.169> next<00:03:40.530> tutorial
