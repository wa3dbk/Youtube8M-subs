00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
did you get to up to speed like when you

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.900 
did you get to up to speed like when you
wearing<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:48.890> know<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.070> really<00:00:49.430> helps<00:00:49.730> is<00:00:49.880> I

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
wearing you know it really helps is I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.780 
wearing you know it really helps is I
use<00:00:50.480> these<00:00:50.630> tiny<00:00:50.930> picks<00:00:51.500> I've<00:00:52.190> kind<00:00:52.489> of<00:00:52.580> real

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
use these tiny picks I've kind of real

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.820 
use these tiny picks I've kind of real
where<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.300> found<00:00:53.480> them<00:00:53.809> again<00:00:53.930> but<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:54.710> can

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
where you found them again but you can

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.400 
where you found them again but you can
use<00:00:54.949> any<00:00:55.160> pick<00:00:55.430> what<00:00:56.000> what<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.360> can<00:00:56.510> do<00:00:56.750> is<00:00:57.080> if

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
use any pick what what you can do is if

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.040 
use any pick what what you can do is if
you<00:00:57.440> go<00:00:57.980> along<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:58.580> carpet<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.180> kind<00:00:59.840> of<00:00:59.930> the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
you go along the carpet and kind of the

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.110 
you go along the carpet and kind of the
the<00:01:00.350> same<00:01:00.680> shape<00:01:00.980> is<00:01:01.160> your<00:01:01.280> pick<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:01.640> sharpens

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
the same shape is your pick it sharpens

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.270 
the same shape is your pick it sharpens
the<00:01:02.270> point<00:01:02.540> that<00:01:03.110> really<00:01:03.440> helps<00:01:03.860> because<00:01:03.980> it's

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
the point that really helps because it's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.520 
the point that really helps because it's
less<00:01:04.580> gets<00:01:04.879> caught<00:01:05.330> in<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.510> strings<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.440> all

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
less gets caught in the strings so all

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.550 
less gets caught in the strings so all
you<00:01:06.710> gonna<00:01:06.860> do<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.750> send<00:01:08.750> there<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.080> do<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.410> I
