00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:07.100
 I present the xperia m2 so signed 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.129
 sony as usual we do a tour 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.610
 fast of the box 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:17.060
 so hop nothing and nothing and that's it 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.100
 sony xperia m2 ok on the bottom a very 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.250
 interesting apart from an information so 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.480
 it is a white version I 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.230
 so it exists in 3 colors well 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.490
 obviously like sony it's to do 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.170
 rape black and white so we'll go 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.730
 on the unpacking side and you will see 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.320
 that unpacking is happening directly on 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:44.030
 the back so it's a 4.8 screen see 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.600
 right after that then directly 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.280
 will find the m2 a little heavy 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.420
 first grip but there is the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:59.570
 battery the battery and not expandable 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.489
 it happens after we'll go like this 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.320
 directly then a little bit 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.009
 start guide information etc 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:22.340
 etc. 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:35.539
 if you feel like reading then 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:38.619
 this contest have everything pedestrian everything that 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.619
 could be basic 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.420
 here is a little remote 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.320
 it reminds me a little remotes 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.530
 who had on the 33-10 nokia on 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.960
 old series like that of nokia actually 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:10.070
 think a little bit about that headphones 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.070
 nice sony here is an extraordinary 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:21.740
 then you find the charger 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.740
 usb 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:40.770
 here 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:43.220
 always the same and sony 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.220
 cATANIA 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:03.609
 so usb micro usb obviously 2.0 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.550
 strings look really very very 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.550
 solid and quite hard very hard 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.050
 we will move to the mobile side 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.410
 so it's a 4.8 inch screen 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.600
 phone is a bit far 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.470
 here after the finish is sony I 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.110
 believe it's a phone that 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.310
 around 150 euros 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:41.280
 go we think we 'll do a little 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.840
 turn then what we find right here 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.920
 between the bottom and the right side actually 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.300
 just if you next 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.610
 accessory if you want to put it to 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.370
 your wrist or else there you have a 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.580
 one-button device for the device 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.560
 rest that can be practical you have 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.090
 buttons volume buttons more volume - 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.320
 so turn up the volume turn down the volume 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.320
 by cons she is really very very 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.330
 little that touch you have the button 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.770
 start so on is a on the phone 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.440
 wake up but works the 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:14.160
 phone you have the little drawer 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:21.750
 micro sd his wife is still a little 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:27.270
 mirror must be micro sd and sim cards 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.919
 besides there are two slots game that makes 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.320
 a little bit that it's a bit low 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.050
 range like that the shiny blue good 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.169
 after the balls of cover up on the 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.169
 up you go directly the 3.5 jack 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:47.520
 except right side you have the micro usb 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:48.630
 2.0 and bottom speakers up 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.060
 speakers who is really very nice 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.750
 like that to a lot then on 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:59.780
 the back you have an apn of 8 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:04.050
 megapixels a flash a microphone there the little 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.810
 the small nfc logo at n 2 nfc does not 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.950
 do not notice you also have the little logo 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.669
 shiny sony on the bottom xperia that makes 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.139
 a lot of experience was ending 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:21.090
 then on the front 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:22.490
 you have a front sensor vga sensor 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.050
 brightness 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.340
 there you have the buttons I do not know 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.599
 if they are integrated directly where 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.289
 in the screen but in my opinion it will be 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:34.229
 more in the screen so that's it for this 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.560
 quick start of the xperia m2 really 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.120
 pretty overall finish 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.099
 really very very good phone is 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.870
 a bit heavy it's a screen of 4.8 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.629
 inch 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.530
 that's not very expensive 250 euros so 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.530
 not bad
