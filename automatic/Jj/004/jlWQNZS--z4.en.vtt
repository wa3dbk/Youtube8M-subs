00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
reach return punch you counter where as

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.759 
reach return punch you counter where as
I<00:00:48.039> give<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.460> break<00:00:48.789> the<00:00:48.999> plane<00:00:49.329> then<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.350> have<00:00:50.620> an

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
I give to break the plane then I have an

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.860 
I give to break the plane then I have an
ability<00:00:50.979> he<00:00:51.399> loses<00:00:52.179> the<00:00:52.300> ability<00:00:52.359> to<00:00:52.629> follow

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
ability he loses the ability to follow

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.020 
ability he loses the ability to follow
up<00:00:53.170> with<00:00:53.350> that<00:00:53.379> hand<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.039> he<00:00:54.489> also<00:00:54.670> keeps

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
up with that hand and he also keeps

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.329 
up with that hand and he also keeps
himself<00:00:55.179> open<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.469> upside<00:00:56.920> keeping<00:00:57.249> your

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
himself open so the upside keeping your

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.700 
himself open so the upside keeping your
hands<00:00:57.579> in<00:00:57.760> tight<00:00:58.030> is<00:00:58.449> having<00:00:58.929> good<00:00:59.139> fix

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
hands in tight is having good fix

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.889 
hands in tight is having good fix
so<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.249> way<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.429> have<00:01:00.609> face<00:01:00.879> is<00:01:01.089> to<00:01:01.239> be<00:01:01.359> sharp

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
so the way to have face is to be sharp

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.840 
so the way to have face is to be sharp
at<00:01:02.139> suddenly<00:01:02.679> you<00:01:02.889> don't<00:01:02.949> want<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:03.190> float<00:01:03.639> an

to react and you notice what I did right

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.880 
to react and you notice what I did right
there<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.579> what's<00:01:21.820> his<00:01:21.939> hand<00:01:22.240> proclaim<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:23.200> just

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
there is what's his hand proclaim I just

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.770 
there is what's his hand proclaim I just
kept<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.280> hand<00:01:24.490> out<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.969> respect

kept the hand out and respect

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.670 
kept the hand out and respect
instruction<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:27.159> that<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:28.479> once<00:01:28.990> it<00:01:29.409> breaks

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
instruction so that is once it breaks

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.029 
instruction so that is once it breaks
plane<00:01:30.159> his<00:01:30.789> peripheral<00:01:31.299> defense<00:01:31.750> is<00:01:31.960> gone<00:01:32.170> so

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
plane his peripheral defense is gone so

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.359 
plane his peripheral defense is gone so
again<00:01:33.570> good<00:01:34.570> fakes<00:01:34.990> that's<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.469> great<00:01:35.799> way<00:01:36.070> to

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
again good fakes that's a great way to

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.819 
again good fakes that's a great way to
get<00:01:36.789> his<00:01:36.909> defenses<00:01:37.450> out<00:01:37.689> and<00:01:38.020> being<00:01:38.619> able<00:01:38.679> to

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.160 

that's<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.610> great<00:01:42.790> tip<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.329> think<00:01:43.630> about<00:01:43.899> is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
that's a great tip to think about is

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.520 
that's a great tip to think about is
controlling<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.040> distance<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.810> thing<00:01:47.079> that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
controlling the distance one thing that

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.990 
controlling the distance one thing that
you're<00:01:47.680> going<00:01:47.829> to<00:01:47.860> find<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.250> view<00:01:48.549> into<00:01:48.880> your

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
you're going to find the view into your

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.700 
you're going to find the view into your
opponent<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.720> that<00:01:50.229> you're<00:01:50.350> going<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.500> find

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
opponent is that you're going to find

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.410 
opponent is that you're going to find
ranges<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.549> like<00:01:51.759> better<00:01:52.030> than<00:01:52.299> others

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
ranges that you like better than others

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.570 
ranges that you like better than others
and<00:01:52.750> your<00:01:53.470> opponent's<00:01:53.830> going<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.009> find<00:01:54.220> ranges

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
and your opponent's going to find ranges

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.639 
and your opponent's going to find ranges
that<00:01:54.729> he<00:01:54.939> likes<00:01:55.149> better<00:01:55.420> than<00:01:55.539> others<00:01:55.750> there's

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
that he likes better than others there's

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.679 
that he likes better than others there's
four<00:01:57.159> really<00:01:57.460> distinct<00:01:57.970> ranges<00:01:58.450> when<00:01:58.600> it

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
four really distinct ranges when it

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.899 
four really distinct ranges when it
comes<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:59.080> sparring<00:01:59.649> fighting<00:02:00.009> what<00:02:00.549> having

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
comes to sparring fighting what having

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.850 
comes to sparring fighting what having
one<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> kicking<00:02:01.869> range<00:02:02.110> which<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
one is the kicking range which is the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.789 
one is the kicking range which is the
longest<00:02:03.369> range<00:02:03.670> weapons<00:02:04.539> then<00:02:05.200> there's<00:02:05.649> your

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
longest range weapons then there's your

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
control the distance is so key because

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.920 
control the distance is so key because
when<00:03:18.950> people<00:03:19.070> get<00:03:19.310> someone<00:03:19.670> fighting<00:03:19.940> is<00:03:20.420> they
