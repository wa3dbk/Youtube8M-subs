below<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.700> one<00:03:06.239> right<00:03:06.720> there<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.319> just<00:03:08.130> kind

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
below that one right there and just kind

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.839 
below that one right there and just kind
of<00:03:08.519> gently<00:03:08.880> press<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.510> right<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:09.959> there<00:03:10.200> and

of gently press that right in there and

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.030 
of gently press that right in there and
this<00:03:11.849> way<00:03:12.150> it's<00:03:12.660> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.959> dry<00:03:13.230> together<00:03:13.650> it's

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
this way it's going to dry together it's

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.470 
this way it's going to dry together it's
going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> stay<00:03:14.579> flat<00:03:14.910> because<00:03:15.329> you're

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
going to stay flat because you're

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.380 
going to stay flat because you're
staggering<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.500> weft<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.730> important<00:03:18.329> to

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
staggering the weft it's important to

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.789 
staggering the weft it's important to
stagger<00:03:18.690> because<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.079> don't<00:03:19.260> want<00:03:19.380> to<00:03:19.470> stack

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
stagger because you don't want to stack

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.220 
stagger because you don't want to stack
it'll<00:03:20.130> make<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.459> too<00:03:20.670> thick<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.150> bulky<00:03:21.329> so

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
it'll make it too thick and bulky so

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.979 
it'll make it too thick and bulky so
again<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.890> can<00:03:23.040> just<00:03:23.340> do<00:03:23.519> this<00:03:23.760> press<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.720> in

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
again you can just do this press that in

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.430 
again you can just do this press that in
now<00:03:25.739> girls<00:03:26.310> again<00:03:26.730> some<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.840> lay<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.110> tape

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
now girls again some just lay the tape

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.680 
now girls again some just lay the tape
and<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.549> have<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.970> recorder<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.660> can

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
and if you have the recorder you can

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.600 
and if you have the recorder you can
fold<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.230> over<00:03:31.530> if<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.769> want<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.129> folding

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
fold it over if you want but folding

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.420 
fold it over if you want but folding
over<00:03:32.760> also<00:03:33.480> may<00:03:33.720> save<00:03:34.049> tape<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.280> also

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
over also may save tape but it also

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.390 
over also may save tape but it also
makes<00:03:35.819> it<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:36.030> little<00:03:36.150> bit<00:03:36.390> more<00:03:36.599> bulky<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.400> like

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
and it just gives it a really great bond

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.089 
and it just gives it a really great bond
I'm<00:04:24.000> using<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.360> piece<00:04:24.539> of<00:04:24.720> really<00:04:24.870> nice<00:04:25.560> tile

I'm using a piece of really nice tile

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.909 
I'm using a piece of really nice tile
because<00:04:26.669> it's<00:04:27.030> flat<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.750> it's<00:04:27.870> heavy<00:04:28.229> and<00:04:28.830> it

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
because it's flat and it's heavy and it

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.550 
because it's flat and it's heavy and it
really<00:04:29.250> works<00:04:29.550> great<00:04:29.940> now<00:04:30.180> once<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:30.990> do<00:04:31.289> this

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
really works great now once you do this

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.610 
really works great now once you do this
you<00:04:31.800> go<00:04:31.979> ahead<00:04:32.099> and<00:04:32.430> lift<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.910> up<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:34.410> can

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
you go ahead and lift it up and you can

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.480 
you go ahead and lift it up and you can
go<00:04:34.800> back<00:04:35.099> and<00:04:35.520> trim<00:04:36.389> off<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:36.750> sides<00:04:36.960> now<00:04:37.919> again

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
go back and trim off the sides now again

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.890 
go back and trim off the sides now again
we<00:04:38.729> didn't<00:04:39.000> go<00:04:39.090> all<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.360> way<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:39.510> the<00:04:39.660> top

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
we didn't go all the way to the top

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.520 
we didn't go all the way to the top
which<00:04:40.139> gives<00:04:40.169> us<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:41.180> really<00:04:42.180> nice<00:04:42.530> smaller

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
which gives us a really nice smaller

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.770 
which gives us a really nice smaller
amount<00:04:44.099> that's<00:04:44.370> going<00:04:44.669> to<00:04:44.760> hit<00:04:44.969> and<00:04:45.270> fit<00:04:45.570> in

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
amount that's going to hit and fit in

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.980 
amount that's going to hit and fit in
your<00:04:45.990> hair<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.580> less<00:04:47.789> is<00:04:48.060> better<00:04:48.300> really

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
your hair so the less is better really

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.050 
your hair so the less is better really
the<00:04:49.140> smaller<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:50.070> web<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.580> nicer<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.300> is<00:04:51.810> so

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
the smaller the web the nicer it is so

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.250 
the smaller the web the nicer it is so
anything<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.270> make<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.870> anything<00:04:55.170> you

anything that you make and anything you
can<00:04:55.410> take<00:04:55.650> off<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.890> top<00:04:56.310> it's<00:04:56.610> worth<00:04:56.910> just

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
can take off the top it's worth just

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.900 
can take off the top it's worth just
giving<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.960> little<00:04:57.990> cut<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.680> taking<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.580> down

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
giving a little cut and taking that down

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.570 
giving a little cut and taking that down
