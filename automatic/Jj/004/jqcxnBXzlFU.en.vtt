00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
whole image is at a very very fine
resolution<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.810> wanted<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.320> what

resolution so if we wanted to know what

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.429 
resolution so if we wanted to know what
is<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.610> any<00:01:18.180> spot<00:01:18.600> along<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> Tsim

I'd<00:01:19.619> say<00:01:19.920> near<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.490> building<00:01:21.000> at<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
I'd say near this building at this

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.710 
I'd say near this building at this
