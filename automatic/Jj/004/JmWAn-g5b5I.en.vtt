00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:22.039
 So and welcome to a new episode 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.850
 at a safe with channel today 1 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.150
 it was wished that I was a bit 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.730
 what was there about my cultured teeth 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.820
 do it anyway 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.840
 I do not use a big engine 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.760
 Niche no exact data from 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.430
 750 square meters he said one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.520
 plot of 150 square meters 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.680
 but only 50 to 60 square meters 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 maybe a little more than 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.940
 earned garden and I think so 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.050
 such a small electrocoal we out 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.850
 this model that gave it trouble with the lidl 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.339
 I do not know if 70 euros or he says 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.530
 it was tasted by florabest 710 and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.060
 neat power 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.880
 I had already seen it up there 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.020
 I've got my back here 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.900
 me in the potato a bit 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 thinned and there he sees that is 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.610
 that really has farmers and that 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:28.520
 does not justify four stars two 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.820
 every page goes up to 18 centimeters 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.490
 Deep in the moon and so on is everything 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.830
 only about what actually perfect 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.119
 sufficient 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.289
 Why should we be half a meter deep ? 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:48.580
 dig or so 18 43 print out the 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:53.270
 working width is about 36 cm and 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.100
 can I want I could 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.860
 now here on both sides also the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.759
 screw it off 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.800
 maybe now changes all over 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.310
 Pull bit smaller which naturally 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.310
 also saves space 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.380
 we have safety switches young 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.759
 but that you press the button with it 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.759
 you even get the whole thing on 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:23.690
 actually almost every electrical appliance 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:28.280
 The synagogue houses do not always tell 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.420
 already said he clip it too 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.760
 that every cable is a bit better 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.140
 but I can understand it 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.100
 actually only in the small garden 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.329
 and have such an electro putin of yours 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.400
 maybe I also wanted to start 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.120
 to work according to their own 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.190
 generated electricity for light or so 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.159
 I have a small project something 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.159
 Energy is not enough 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:58.220
 withstand 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.349
 So that's a nice device over in the 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.720
 next video will still look like this 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:07.450
 times in the corner house years 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.290
 he is quietly not telling afterwards 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.810
 So I have a few well 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.220
 under control like two handles and who 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.560
 I would like to have the link to it 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.900
 reinstellen as I said now do 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.980
 I have the thing for 50 or 60 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.260
 Euro something in the spotlight and I am full 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.489
 satisfied 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.810
 your probation period represents the deep 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.940
 I agree with the water 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.810
 you come so first time 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.849
 grass names by actually knotless for 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.349
 the money 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.829
 I was thinking if I the great well 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.829
 Not 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.609
 First, as I said, who would like to give 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:53.209
 I find the link to that he 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:55.540
 no gardens wonderful see you 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.540
 closes
