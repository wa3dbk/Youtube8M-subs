00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
point style pencils

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.550 
point style pencils
now<00:00:20.640> when<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.820> say<00:00:21.000> creme<00:00:21.330> point<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.380> looks

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
now when I say creme point so it looks

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.950 
now when I say creme point so it looks
like<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> pencil<00:00:23.359> just<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> regular<00:00:24.660> pencil

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
like a pencil just like a regular pencil

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.740 
like a pencil just like a regular pencil
but<00:00:25.529> if<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.800> tell<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> actual<00:00:26.849> tip<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.630> it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
but if you can tell the actual tip of it

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.810 
but if you can tell the actual tip of it
is<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.590> cream<00:00:28.830> eyeliner<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.730> it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
is like a cream eyeliner so it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
is like a cream eyeliner so it's
basically<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.330> hardened<00:00:30.900> cream<00:00:31.109> eyeliner<00:00:31.349> or

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
basically a hardened cream eyeliner or

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.540 
basically a hardened cream eyeliner or
when<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:31.740> about<00:00:31.859> cream<00:00:32.130> liner<00:00:32.279> anyway

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
when you think about cream liner anyway

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.590 
when you think about cream liner anyway
it<00:00:32.669> tends<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> pot<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it tends to be in the pot you have to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.120 
it tends to be in the pot you have to
use<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> brush<00:00:33.870> these<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.649> creamy<00:00:34.800> enough<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
use a brush these are creamy enough you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.530 
use a brush these are creamy enough you
go<00:00:35.280> right<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.640> brush<00:00:35.820> or<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.329> glide

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
go right in with a brush or they glide

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
go right in with a brush or they glide
right<00:00:36.719> across<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> skin<00:00:37.350> really<00:00:38.309> smoothly

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
right across the skin really smoothly

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.100 
right across the skin really smoothly
you<00:00:39.210> could<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> right<00:00:39.690> there

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
you could see it right there

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.650 
you could see it right there
let<00:00:40.710> me<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.360> there's<00:00:42.540> no

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
let me do it like this so there's no

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
let me do it like this so there's no
tugging<00:00:43.079> glides<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.559> these<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
tugging glides right on these are the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.180 
tugging glides right on these are the
NYX<00:00:44.579> slide<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.390> glide<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.110> eyeliner<00:00:46.710> pencils

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
NYX slide on glide on eyeliner pencils

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.069 
NYX slide on glide on eyeliner pencils
so<00:00:47.730> hence<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> reason<00:00:48.239> they<00:00:48.480> slide<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:48.780> on

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
so hence the reason they slide right on

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.340 
so hence the reason they slide right on
but<00:00:49.860> either<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.660> six<00:00:51.660> shades<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.020> these<00:00:52.140> here

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
but either way six shades of these here

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.380 
but either way six shades of these here
they<00:00:52.530> stay<00:00:52.770> waterproof<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> skin<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
they stay waterproof on the skin and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.779 
they stay waterproof on the skin and
they're<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.440> creamy<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.579> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
they're really creamy going on not so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.580 
they're really creamy going on not so
hard<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.270> use<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:58.140> much<00:00:58.289> else<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.559> can

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
hard to really use not much else I can

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.080 
hard to really use not much else I can
say<00:00:58.829> about<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.399> you're<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.579> fan<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.969> like

glossy<00:01:24.750> black<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.799> reminds

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
glossy black it actually really reminds

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.280 
glossy black it actually really reminds
me<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.310> perversion<00:01:26.939> from<00:01:27.750> Urban<00:01:27.990> Decay<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
can see it's a lot darker than what I

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
can see it's a lot darker than what I
would<00:01:29.939> say<00:01:30.090> zero<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.450> shown<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
would say zero is shown so that's that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
would say zero is shown so that's that
one<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.729> gonna<00:01:33.060> try<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.390> in

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
I'm assuming it's white because it's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.990 
I'm assuming it's white because it's
white<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.950> could<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.729> something<00:01:42.000> else

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
white but could be something else

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
white but could be something else
and<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.270> saved<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.570> money<00:01:45.659> actually<00:01:45.899> cuz<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470

moving<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.750> little<00:03:54.990> I<00:03:55.110> guess<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.410> one<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.560> did

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
of them haven't really moved so it's

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.180

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
my body or my top lash line and the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.539 
my body or my top lash line and the
black<00:04:15.840> wasn't<00:04:16.260> as<00:04:16.410> long-lasting<00:04:16.739> as<00:04:17.250> my<00:04:17.370> NARS

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
black wasn't as long-lasting as my NARS

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.949 
black wasn't as long-lasting as my NARS
pencil<00:04:18.000> but<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.270> NARS<00:04:18.450> one<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> little

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
pencil but the NARS one is a little

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.599 
pencil but the NARS one is a little
drier<00:04:19.170> in<00:04:19.320> texture<00:04:19.709> so<00:04:19.830> it's<00:04:19.950> not<00:04:20.100> as<00:04:20.310> creamy

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
drier in texture so it's not as creamy

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.310 
drier in texture so it's not as creamy
so<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.270> kind<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.600> give<00:04:21.750> up<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> creaminess<00:04:22.200> of

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
so you kind of give up the creaminess of

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.700 
so you kind of give up the creaminess of
this<00:04:22.650> for<00:04:23.640> that<00:04:24.120> but<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.510> thing<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.720> that's

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
this for that but the thing is that's

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.320 
this for that but the thing is that's
also<00:04:25.950> $24<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:26.880> that's<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
also $24 so that's the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.450 
also $24 so that's the
