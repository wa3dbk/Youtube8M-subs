every<00:01:23.630> crazy<00:01:24.320> surge<00:01:24.890> just<00:01:25.369> on<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:25.760> I<00:01:25.850> do<00:01:25.909> need

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
every crazy surge just on and I do need

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.690 
every crazy surge just on and I do need
to<00:01:26.300> keep<00:01:26.600> myself<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:27.170> little<00:01:27.290> bit<00:01:27.440> closer<00:01:27.710> I

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
to keep myself a little bit closer I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.719 
to keep myself a little bit closer I
mean<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.630> wasn't<00:01:30.140> in<00:01:30.350> shape<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.070> lot<00:01:31.430> last

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
mean I wasn't in shape to a lot last

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.040 
mean I wasn't in shape to a lot last
year<00:01:31.910> so<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:33.670> crowd<00:01:34.670> away<00:01:34.970> with<00:01:35.210> all<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.600> stuff
