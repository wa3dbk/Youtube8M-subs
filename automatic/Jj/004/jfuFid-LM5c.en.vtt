00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.370
 We're going to take care of ourselves today because 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.930
 I 'm being a wedding and I 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.360
 Wish I was almost hotter than the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.550
 bride goes can download so popular that I 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.910
 I want to learn for sure, I always 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.910
 wrong 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.030
 separate this part of the top while frei 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.830
 is it usually leaves this space 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:03.220
 of the fringe is that they are three to four 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:08.160
 fingers and from there we separate the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.160
 people will give that effect he knows 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:23.789
 so they use it and use a little spray 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:44.259

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:48.009
 then because I avoid getting in one 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.960
 of the product on the comb is that the use 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.420

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.670
 hair the next customer I will not go 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.670
 have to be cleaning the teeth of the pent 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.760
 but this is a somewhat professional thing 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.380
 my mom 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.380
 You can also use it at home. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:26.040
 team at least another 45 with it the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.040
 People use some spray 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.120
 Good people, one thing, I would never go. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.080
 taught him to see and spoke that hair because 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.880
 is very professional look at the order and I think 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.100
 what with Luis 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.340
 You can learn and I you are in 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.340
 home can test that it will work in 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:21.160
 being cleaner 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:31.090
 the finishing is this , its base of it is the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:33.820
 same then you saw the trick for him 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.100
 It's good that you make several 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.100
 Indian artists had 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.069
 hey you choose if you want a hair 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.610
 more style brigitte brigitte bardot you 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.040
 keep this fringe or if you want 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.470
 the most classical effect depending on the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.790
 party you go you can raise 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:10.540
 this part of the front also all behind and 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:15.060
 This mecha after Tiara comes 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:44.970
 It will pass here in the middle I still prefer 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:44.970
 is more loose if not the most modern is 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.410
 keep a base né hair more loose 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.410
 from your head 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:21.520
 this is what i can do as your 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.220
 hair is very thin it will get us 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.870
 will have some difficulty to 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:31.590
 learn this clamp from the other side of the 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.590
 line 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:55.240
 and I come with a clamp and holding it here 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.240
 in this place where the bê these they acting 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:19.159
 on this other side we do the same 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:30.229
 process and crosses the wick by another 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:32.180
 And then we can leave that 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.280
 apparent clamp 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.169
 and there's something else that people talk about 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.080
 a lot of grampá blond hair white 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:44.870
 blond and I still prefer the dark clamp 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.460
 because that reflection of the light in the 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.479
 photo something program have mine 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.479
 relative 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:53.900
 it will and will not appear as much as 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:56.180
 the group gilded a group of type mice 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:05.960
 exploded in the center 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:08.360
 the finish is joking stayed low 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.870
 afraid of this it is good to remember in the same 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.870
 price 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.860
 It can that joined in hair 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:54.360
 this part of the front and left the 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:58.880
 behind the hair is full the volume is more 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:08:04.220
