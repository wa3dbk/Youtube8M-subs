00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
rising the shell even more as you can

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.330 
rising the shell even more as you can
see<00:03:09.349> we're<00:03:09.530> getting<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.829> reaction<00:03:12.129> hitting<00:03:13.129> it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
see we're getting a reaction hitting it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.830 
see we're getting a reaction hitting it
we're<00:03:13.519> getting<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.849> all<00:03:14.000> being<00:03:14.390> broken<00:03:14.659> down

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
we're getting it all being broken down

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.390 
we're getting it all being broken down
so<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.290> know<00:03:15.349> bubbling<00:03:15.799> fizzing

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
so you know bubbling fizzing

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.830 
so you know bubbling fizzing
now<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:16.970> calcium<00:03:17.450> in<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.569> vinegar

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
now it's the calcium in the vinegar

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.630 
now it's the calcium in the vinegar
mixing<00:03:18.170> doctor<00:03:18.439> getting<00:03:18.620> basically<00:03:19.040> calcium

mixing doctor getting basically calcium

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.839 
mixing doctor getting basically calcium
acetate<00:03:20.319> okay<00:03:21.319> we<00:03:22.220> can<00:03:22.370> smell<00:03:22.609> it<00:03:22.670> almost

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
acetate okay we can smell it almost

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.539 
acetate okay we can smell it almost
smells<00:03:22.970> like<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.269> beer<00:03:23.599> now<00:03:24.220> you're<00:03:25.220> gonna<00:03:25.340> do

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
smells like a beer now you're gonna do

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.530 
smells like a beer now you're gonna do
is<00:03:25.609> you're<00:03:25.700> gonna<00:03:25.760> pour<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.209> into<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
is you're gonna pour that into a

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.089 
is you're gonna pour that into a
container<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:27.109> this<00:03:27.170> which<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.680> already<00:03:27.769> done

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
container like this which I already done

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.280 
container like this which I already done
see<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.579> was<00:03:28.700> done<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:28.879> earlier<00:03:29.180> today<00:03:29.480> it's

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
see that was done to earlier today it's

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.270 
see that was done to earlier today it's
still<00:03:30.530> reacting<00:03:33.040> worn<00:03:34.040> in<00:03:34.220> there<00:03:38.889> now<00:03:39.889> that's

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
still reacting worn in there now that's

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.869 
still reacting worn in there now that's
it<00:03:40.549> for<00:03:40.909> a<00:03:40.970> couple<00:03:41.090> days<00:03:42.069> watching<00:03:43.069> us<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.700> for

a couple days

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.860 
a couple days
they<00:03:46.720> then<00:03:47.720> strain<00:03:48.409> it<00:03:49.120> once<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.329> strain<00:03:50.689> it

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
they then strain it once you strain it

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.410 
they then strain it once you strain it
then<00:03:51.049> use<00:03:51.230> about<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.560> half<00:03:51.889> a<00:03:52.040> teaspoon

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
then use about a half a teaspoon

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.670 
then use about a half a teaspoon

strain<00:05:05.000> it<00:05:05.150> through<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.389> filter<00:05:05.599> and<00:05:06.110> all<00:05:06.590> that

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
strain it through a filter and all that

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.890 
strain it through a filter and all that
you<00:05:06.950> have<00:05:06.979> left<00:05:07.430> is<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:08.090> vinegar

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
you have left is the vinegar

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.680 
you have left is the vinegar
with<00:05:09.140> leftover<00:05:09.890> calcium<00:05:10.850> that's<00:05:11.030> in<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.360> all

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
with leftover calcium that's in it all

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.570 
with leftover calcium that's in it all
right<00:05:11.750> make<00:05:12.680> sure<00:05:12.710> see<00:05:13.130> because<00:05:13.280> you'll<00:05:13.400> see<00:05:13.550> a

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
right make sure see because you'll see a

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.420 
right make sure see because you'll see a
residue<00:05:14.060> here<00:05:14.480> that<00:05:15.380> can<00:05:15.620> be<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.740> problem<00:05:16.010> can

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
residue here that can be a problem can

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.360 
residue here that can be a problem can
be<00:05:16.550> problematic<00:05:17.150> so<00:05:17.920> strain<00:05:18.920> it<00:05:19.130> with<00:05:19.340> a

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
be problematic so strain it with a

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.590 
be problematic so strain it with a
coffee<00:05:19.670> coffee<00:05:20.240> filter<00:05:22.270> strain<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:23.420> with<00:05:23.570> a

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
coffee coffee filter strain it with a

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.140 
coffee coffee filter strain it with a
jelly<00:05:23.960> bag<00:05:24.260> or<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.620> handkerchief<00:05:25.370> run<00:05:26.000> it

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
jelly bag or a handkerchief run it

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.350 
jelly bag or a handkerchief run it
through<00:05:26.360> let<00:05:27.140> it<00:05:27.260> collect<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:28.070> next<00:05:29.060> to<00:05:29.210> the
