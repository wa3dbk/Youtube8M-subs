00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.000 

an<00:00:20.470> element<00:00:20.830> on<00:00:20.980> earth<00:00:21.010> after<00:00:21.430> oxygen<00:00:22.210> and<00:00:23.010> in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
an element on earth after oxygen and in

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.880 
an element on earth after oxygen and in
here<00:00:24.340> are<00:00:24.520> purified<00:00:25.150> silicon<00:00:25.750> Rock<00:00:25.990> the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
here are purified silicon Rock the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.300 
here are purified silicon Rock the
silicon<00:00:27.880> is<00:00:28.090> melted<00:00:28.630> you<00:00:29.260> see<00:00:29.590> here<00:00:29.890> this<00:00:30.250> is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
silicon is melted you see here this is

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.570 
silicon is melted you see here this is
molten<00:00:30.880> silicon<00:00:31.600> and<00:00:31.810> it<00:00:32.680> starts<00:00:33.100> with<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.280> seed

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
molten silicon and it starts with a seed

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.420 
molten silicon and it starts with a seed
crystal<00:00:34.120> it's<00:00:34.540> fun<00:00:34.900> and<00:00:35.170> gradually<00:00:35.830> the<00:00:36.130> ingot

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
crystal it's fun and gradually the ingot

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.970 
crystal it's fun and gradually the ingot
is<00:00:36.550> formed<00:00:36.970> slowly<00:00:37.870> by<00:00:38.230> drawing<00:00:38.559> it<00:00:38.739> out<00:00:38.830> of

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
is formed slowly by drawing it out of

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.430 
is formed slowly by drawing it out of
the<00:00:39.070> molten<00:00:39.600> silicon<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:41.530> is<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:41.850> 270-pound

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the molten silicon this is a 270-pound

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.350 
the molten silicon this is a 270-pound
so<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:44.559> can<00:00:44.710> get<00:00:45.070> it's<00:00:45.250> a<00:00:45.370> 300<00:00:45.879> millimeter

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360

the section above is all air
purification<00:01:21.490> because<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.689> biggest<00:01:23.229> threat

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
purification because the biggest threat

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.429 
purification because the biggest threat
to<00:01:23.560> manufacturing<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.610> chip<00:01:24.909> is<00:01:25.479> particles<00:01:26.170> in

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
to manufacturing a chip is particles in
