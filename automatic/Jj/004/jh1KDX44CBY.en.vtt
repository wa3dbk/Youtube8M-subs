00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
information we know it's pretty easy to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.569 
information we know it's pretty easy to
actually<00:00:46.559> come<00:00:46.739> across<00:00:47.070> something<00:00:47.370> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
actually come across something that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.639 
actually come across something that
could<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.149> fake<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.110> point<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.469> time

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
could be fake but at this point in time

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.229 
could be fake but at this point in time
it's<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.340> around<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.789> time<00:00:50.940> where<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it's right around the time where the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.729 
it's right around the time where the
promotion<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.170> start<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> come<00:00:52.680> out

so<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.910> my<00:00:54.239> guess<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.750> real<00:00:55.020> legitimate

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
so this is my guess a real legitimate

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
so this is my guess a real legitimate

again<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.140> said<00:01:40.170> that's<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.860> my

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
again like I said that's just my

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
again like I said that's just my
thoughts<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.970> only<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.329> image<00:01:42.810> for

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
thoughts and we only have one image for

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.020 
thoughts and we only have one image for
each<00:01:43.079> map<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> go

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
each map so it's not really much to go

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.030 
each map so it's not really much to go
off<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.570> from<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:45.990> placeholder<00:01:46.649> images

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
off of but from these placeholder images

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.219 
off of but from these placeholder images
that's<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> feel<00:01:48.420> from<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.869> these

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
that's what I get the feel from of these

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.929 
that's what I get the feel from of these
maps<00:01:49.470> no<00:01:49.799> obviously<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.280> could<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.729> completely

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
maps no obviously I could be completely

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
maps no obviously I could be completely
wrong<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> once<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.960> trailer<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> released

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
