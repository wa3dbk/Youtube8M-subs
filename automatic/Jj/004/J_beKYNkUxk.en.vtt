00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
going to do is we're going to extrude it

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.690 
going to do is we're going to extrude it
up<00:01:54.330> so<00:01:56.030> about<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.270> should<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.510> good<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:59.460> I'm

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
up so about there should be good and I'm

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.230 
up so about there should be good and I'm
really<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.150> of<00:02:00.180> eyeballing<00:02:00.600> everything<00:02:01.170> but

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
really kind of eyeballing everything but

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
really kind of eyeballing everything but
yeah<00:02:03.240> okay<00:02:03.990> now<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.290> we<00:02:04.440> do<00:02:04.650> is<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:04.890> extrude

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
yeah okay now what we do is we extrude

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
yeah okay now what we do is we extrude
this<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.670> little<00:02:05.760> bit<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.570> branch<00:02:07.050> it<00:02:07.260> out

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
this up a little bit and branch it out

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.550 
this up a little bit and branch it out
probably<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> little<00:02:09.810> bit<00:02:09.990> more<00:02:10.260> so<00:02:10.470> we're

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
probably go a little bit more so we're

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.200 
probably go a little bit more so we're
going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.740> scale<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.070> with<00:02:11.460> his<00:02:11.610> are<00:02:11.940> by

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
going to scale it with his are by

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.620 
going to scale it with his are by
default<00:02:12.360> that's<00:02:13.320> your<00:02:13.530> hotkey<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:15.180> we're

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
default that's your hotkey and we're

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.560 
default that's your hotkey and we're
gonna<00:02:15.750> do<00:02:15.960> a<00:02:15.990> little<00:02:16.200> more<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:18.090> comes<00:02:18.300> straight

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
gonna do a little more it comes straight

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.260 
gonna do a little more it comes straight
up<00:02:18.630> with<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.050> one<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:20.610> will<00:02:20.850> ready<00:02:21.060> come

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
up with this one this will ready come

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.770 
up with this one this will ready come
actually<00:02:21.930> should<00:02:22.110> probably<00:02:22.380> give<00:02:22.500> up<00:02:22.680> there

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
actually should probably give up there

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.020 
actually should probably give up there
and<00:02:25.910> then<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.150> there<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.200> go<00:02:28.380> now<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.710> have<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
and then and there you go now you have a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.230 
and then and there you go now you have a
black<00:02:30.030> glass<00:02:30.360> or<00:02:31.050> at<00:02:31.230> least<00:02:32.060> somewhat<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
black glass or at least somewhat of a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.260 
black glass or at least somewhat of a
white<00:02:33.450> glass<00:02:33.750> here<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.550> what<00:02:35.550> i<00:02:35.610> would<00:02:35.760> do<00:02:35.970> is

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
white glass here and what i would do is

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.540 
white glass here and what i would do is
i<00:02:36.300> would<00:02:36.690> select<00:02:37.140> all<00:02:37.350> those<00:02:37.590> vertices<00:02:38.190> here

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
i would select all those vertices here

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.180 
i would select all those vertices here
and<00:02:39.480> i<00:02:40.230> want<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.410> make<00:02:40.470> sure<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.100> don't

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
and i want to make sure that I don't

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.560 
and i want to make sure that I don't
select<00:02:41.520> anything<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.150> don't<00:02:42.360> want

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
select anything that I don't want

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.850 
select anything that I don't want
something<00:02:42.959> come<00:02:43.110> up<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.380> front<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.770> you

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
something come up the front of you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.900 
something come up the front of you
ported<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.630> those<00:02:45.840> Andros<00:02:46.700> scale<00:02:47.700> those

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
ported do it so those Andros scale those

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.680 
ported do it so those Andros scale those
addled<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:51.380> see<00:02:52.970> guess<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.060> could<00:02:54.209> select<00:02:54.510> all

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
addled and see guess we could select all

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.790 
addled and see guess we could select all
these<00:02:54.989> ed<00:02:55.380> scale<00:02:55.980> up<00:02:56.130> down<00:02:57.140> or<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.350> can<00:02:58.470> scale

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
these ed scale up down or you can scale

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.150 
these ed scale up down or you can scale
them<00:02:58.890> up<00:02:59.100> let's<00:02:59.820> see<00:03:00.060> there<00:03:00.860> we're<00:03:01.860> going<00:03:02.010> to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
them up let's see there we're going to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.610 
them up let's see there we're going to
scale<00:03:02.850> these<00:03:03.060> it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
scale these it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.979 
scale these it
all<00:03:05.159> right<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:05.760> we<00:03:05.849> go<00:03:06.000> makes<00:03:06.690> our<00:03:06.810> wide

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
all right there we go makes our wide

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.490 
all right there we go makes our wide
glass<00:03:07.200> like<00:03:07.379> a<00:03:07.470> little<00:03:07.709> bit<00:03:07.799> better<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:09.500> now

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
glass like a little bit better and now

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.490 
glass like a little bit better and now
we're<00:03:10.650> going<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.799> come<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.220> bottom<00:03:11.640> here

my<00:04:29.250> blank<00:04:29.580> materials<00:04:30.349> add<00:04:31.349> this<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.070> change

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
my blank materials add this and change

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.490 
my blank materials add this and change
it<00:04:33.599> from<00:04:33.720> standard<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.620> rach<00:04:34.919> race<00:04:36.500> alright

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
it from standard to rach race alright

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.379 
it from standard to rach race alright
and<00:04:38.389> fog<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.750> default<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.800> that's<00:04:40.949> fine

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
and fog is default and that's fine

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.379 
and fog is default and that's fine
alright<00:04:42.389> we're<00:04:42.900> going<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.080> do<00:04:43.289> a<00:04:43.610> blue<00:04:44.610> kind<00:04:45.270> of

alright we're going to do a blue kind of
glass<00:04:45.630> this<00:04:45.900> will<00:04:46.080> kind<00:04:46.229> of<00:04:46.349> make<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:46.620> clear<00:04:47.039> I

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
glass this will kind of make it clear I

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.480 
glass this will kind of make it clear I
can<00:04:48.000> make<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.300> lighter<00:04:48.510> blue<00:04:48.599> okay<00:04:49.490> we're

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
can make it a lighter blue okay we're

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.219 
can make it a lighter blue okay we're
going<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:50.639> take<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.880> transparency<00:04:51.599> and<00:04:51.930> as<00:04:52.080> we

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
going to take the transparency and as we

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.930 
going to take the transparency and as we
move<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.530> down<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:53.070> know<00:04:53.220> is<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.820> gets

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
move it down you know is that it gets

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.879 
move it down you know is that it gets
more<00:04:54.180> more<00:04:54.389> transparent<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.620> we're<00:04:55.710> going<00:04:55.800> to

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
more more transparent so we're going to

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.600 
more more transparent so we're going to
put<00:04:55.949> it<00:04:56.099> almost<00:04:56.370> into<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.820> white<00:04:57.060> up<00:04:57.990> there

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
put it almost into the white up there

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.480 
put it almost into the white up there
all<00:04:59.610> right

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
all right

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.610

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
then we're going to add spec you are and

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.850 
then we're going to add spec you are and

we're<00:05:40.790> going<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:40.940> come<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.420> transparency

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
we're going to come to the transparency

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.550 
we're going to come to the transparency
just<00:05:43.490> click<00:05:43.670> that<00:05:43.820> little<00:05:44.140> little<00:05:45.140> box<00:05:45.380> right

we can change this to fresh though that
will<00:05:55.880> just<00:05:56.060> put<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.240> rough<00:05:56.480> line<00:05:56.810> around<00:05:57.080> it<00:05:57.290> and

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
will just put a rough line around it and

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.340 
will just put a rough line around it and
now<00:05:58.550> we<00:05:58.610> can<00:05:58.940> go<00:05:59.060> ahead<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.270> render<00:05:59.510> it<00:05:59.630> out<00:05:59.840> so

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
now we can go ahead and render it out so

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.350 
now we can go ahead and render it out so
we're<00:06:00.800> pause<00:06:01.100> this<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.430> render<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:01.970> out<00:06:02.120> for

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
material settings just get used to it a

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.440 
material settings just get used to it a
little<00:06:12.170> bit<00:06:12.670> or<00:06:13.670> make<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.090> a<00:06:14.150> little<00:06:14.300> bit

better looking I really quick have also
anti-aliasing<00:06:18.530> on<00:06:18.680> which<00:06:18.950> will<00:06:19.100> get<00:06:19.310> rid<00:06:19.460> of

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
anti-aliasing on which will get rid of

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.780 
anti-aliasing on which will get rid of
any<00:06:19.760> of<00:06:19.820> the<00:06:20.740> jagged<00:06:21.740> edges<00:06:21.860> that<00:06:22.370> might<00:06:22.580> come
