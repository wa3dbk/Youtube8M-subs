farthest so you can see I just added

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
farthest so you can see I just added
some<00:01:48.990> color<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.710> will<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.009> darker<00:01:50.369> but

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
now the harder I push on my pencil the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.050 
now the harder I push on my pencil the
darker<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> color<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.790> now

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060

bit lighter so you can see here push

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.460 
bit lighter so you can see here push
darker<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.599> pushed<00:02:09.869> harder<00:02:15.470> now

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.289 
color here which is a yellow ochre
prismacolor<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.100> I'm<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.850> begin<00:02:30.000> to

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
prismacolor and I'm going to begin to

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.340 
prismacolor and I'm going to begin to
blend<00:02:30.569> then<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.970> little<00:02:32.970> bit<00:02:33.209> more<00:02:33.540> color<00:02:34.049> in

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.970 
blend then a little bit more color in
there<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:35.640> darken<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.530> warms

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
there just darken it in kind of warms

there just darken it in kind of warms
this<00:02:38.190> color<00:02:38.459> up<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.819> bit<00:02:40.010> now<00:02:41.010> some<00:02:41.310> Palomino's

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
this color up a bit now some Palomino's

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.500 
this color up a bit now some Palomino's
will<00:02:42.239> be<00:02:42.450> just<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.290> brilliant<00:02:43.650> golden<00:02:44.400> color

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
will be just a brilliant golden color

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:53.900 
will be just a brilliant golden color
so<00:02:46.049> we'll<00:02:46.350> be<00:02:46.500> almost<00:02:47.370> white<00:02:52.489> so<00:02:53.489> looking<00:02:53.790> at

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
so we'll be almost white so looking at

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.150 
so we'll be almost white so looking at
reference<00:02:54.330> photos<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:55.140> really<00:02:55.470> help<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
reference photos can really help you to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.030 
reference photos can really help you to
determine<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.900> color<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.410> want<00:02:58.590> your<00:02:58.769> horse

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
determine what color you want your horse

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.190 
determine what color you want your horse
to<00:02:59.069> be

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.800 

and<00:03:05.890> knowing<00:03:06.640> where<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.060> put<00:03:07.240> these<00:03:07.390> muscles

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
and knowing where to put these muscles

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.990 
and knowing where to put these muscles
comes<00:03:08.650> from<00:03:08.800> just<00:03:08.980> looking<00:03:09.310> at<00:03:09.430> photos<00:03:09.640> of

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
comes from just looking at photos of

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.420 
comes from just looking at photos of
horses<00:03:10.450> looking<00:03:10.870> at<00:03:11.050> muscle<00:03:11.590> structure<00:03:12.250> and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
horses looking at muscle structure and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.390 
horses looking at muscle structure and
horse<00:03:13.560> it's<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:14.739> something<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.010> takes<00:03:15.280> a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
horse it's just something that takes a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.059 
horse it's just something that takes a
little<00:03:15.550> studying<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.209> do<00:03:19.709> also<00:03:20.709> when<00:03:20.890> you're

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
little studying to do also when you're

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.920 
little studying to do also when you're
adding<00:03:21.370> shading<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.180> shadowing<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.630> want<00:03:22.840> to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
adding shading and shadowing you want to

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.900 
adding shading and shadowing you want to
know<00:03:23.080> where<00:03:23.709> your<00:03:24.040> light<00:03:24.280> source<00:03:24.580> is<00:03:24.760> coming

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
know where your light source is coming

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.660 
know where your light source is coming
from<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.530> you're<00:03:26.680> not<00:03:26.830> putting<00:03:27.069> a<00:03:27.430> shadow

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
from so that you're not putting a shadow

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.520 
from so that you're not putting a shadow
on<00:03:27.850> this<00:03:28.030> side<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.569> then<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.780> put<00:03:29.020> a<00:03:29.050> shadow<00:03:29.319> on

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
on this side and then I put a shadow on

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.620 
on this side and then I put a shadow on
this<00:03:29.830> side<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.520> leg<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:31.330> there's<00:03:31.480> two

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
this side of the leg so there's two

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.759 
this side of the leg so there's two
different<00:03:31.930> light<00:03:32.050> sources<00:03:32.319> I<00:03:32.470> want<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.680> make

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
different light sources I want to make

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.380 
different light sources I want to make
sure<00:03:32.800> that<00:03:33.069> my<00:03:33.250> light<00:03:33.550> source<00:03:33.850> is<00:03:34.030> coming<00:03:34.090> from

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
sure that my light source is coming from

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.460 
sure that my light source is coming from
the<00:03:35.050> same<00:03:35.260> direction<00:03:39.630> why<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.660> shaded<00:03:40.989> here<00:03:41.319> is

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
the same direction why I shaded here is

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.860 
the same direction why I shaded here is
because<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.950> mane<00:03:42.190> is<00:03:42.489> kind<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.850> casting<00:03:43.780> a

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
because the mane is kind of casting a

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.600 
because the mane is kind of casting a
little<00:03:44.140> bit<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.440> shadow<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.310> I'm<00:03:45.430> going<00:03:45.549> to

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
little bit of a shadow but I'm going to

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.800 
little bit of a shadow but I'm going to
blend<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.090> out<00:03:46.299> so<00:03:46.510> it's<00:03:46.690> not<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.230> harsh<00:03:48.810> so

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
blend that out so it's not so harsh so

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.240 
blend that out so it's not so harsh so
just<00:03:50.019> lightly<00:03:50.230> I'm<00:03:50.410> going<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.590> go<00:03:50.680> over<00:03:50.860> top<00:03:51.069> of

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
just lightly I'm going to go over top of

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:00.449 
just lightly I'm going to go over top of
that<00:03:51.370> just<00:03:52.090> push<00:03:52.299> some<00:03:52.450> color<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:59.340> then<00:04:00.340> I'm

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
that just push some color in then I'm

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.309 
that just push some color in then I'm
going<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.670> move<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.819> my<00:04:01.030> darkest<00:04:01.660> color<00:04:01.720> here

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
going to move to my darkest color here

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.490 
going to move to my darkest color here
and<00:04:02.530> this<00:04:02.769> is<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.340> light<00:04:03.730> umber<00:04:04.209> and<00:04:04.360> this<00:04:05.350> is

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
and this is a light umber and this is

good shadow so the underside of the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.610 
good shadow so the underside of the
horse<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.459> going<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.760> get<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.030> shadow<00:04:19.620> see

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620

horse is going to get the shadow see
that<00:04:20.769> pushes<00:04:21.190> that<00:04:21.340> down<00:04:21.579> in<00:04:21.760> there<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.180> I

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
that pushes that down in there and I

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.350 
that pushes that down in there and I
don't<00:04:23.130> shadow<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.340> straight<00:04:24.640> across<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.180> keep

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
don't shadow it straight across I keep

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.390 
don't shadow it straight across I keep
it<00:04:25.510> rounded<00:04:26.020> so<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.800> can<00:04:26.979> tell<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.190> the

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
it rounded so that you can tell that the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.500 
it rounded so that you can tell that the
horse<00:04:27.610> itself<00:04:28.030> isn't<00:04:28.690> flat<00:04:32.640> so<00:04:33.640> by<00:04:33.850> blending

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
horse itself isn't flat so by blending

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.480 
horse itself isn't flat so by blending
it<00:04:34.660> up<00:04:34.780> it's<00:04:34.960> going<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.140> smooth<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:36.039> out<00:04:36.100> so

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
it up it's going to smooth that out so

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.070 
it up it's going to smooth that out so
it's<00:04:36.610> going<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.789> cause<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.539> viewer<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.930> see

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
it's going to cause the viewer to see

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.450 
it's going to cause the viewer to see
that<00:04:38.500> this<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:38.919> gradually<00:04:39.729> curving<00:04:40.330> around

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
that this is gradually curving around
