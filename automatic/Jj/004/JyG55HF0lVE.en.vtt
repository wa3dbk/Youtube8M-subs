00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.830 
the DRS look like and you can see my my
thing<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.489> auto<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:06.119> now<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.720> can

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
thing is on auto right now if you can

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.830 
thing is on auto right now if you can
focus<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.619> auto<00:01:08.090> right<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.210> how's<00:01:09.600> that

focus it's on auto right here how's that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.130 
focus it's on auto right here how's that
the<00:01:10.049> treats<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.530> auto<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:12.689> fog<00:01:12.900> lights

all<00:01:22.170> right<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.409> DRL<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.950> basically<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.520> they

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
all right so DRL is basically what they

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.539 
all right so DRL is basically what they
look<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.990> yellow<00:01:25.799> lights<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.369> turn

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
on as you can see get this to focus

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.380

and here's a bit here's how we're going

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.359 
and here's a bit here's how we're going
to<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.840> first<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> open<00:01:44.220> your

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
to do it first you have to open your

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
to do it first you have to open your
your<00:01:45.240> compartment<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:46.470> hood

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
your compartment your your hood

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.730 
your compartment your your hood
basically<00:01:47.549> what<00:01:47.670> you're<00:01:47.759> gonna<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.740> you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
know open your hood we want to find is

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.010 
know open your hood we want to find is
the<00:01:52.740> DS<00:01:53.039> little<00:01:53.340> tweezer<00:01:53.850> things<00:01:54.300> that<00:01:54.810> come

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the DS little tweezer things that come

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.570 
the DS little tweezer things that come
with<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.229> car<00:01:55.440> and<00:01:55.740> basically<00:01:56.100> once<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.369> open

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
the hood you find the tweezer things to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.020 
the hood you find the tweezer things to
take<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> fuse<00:01:59.340> because<00:01:59.610> without<00:01:59.759> them

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
take out the fuse because without them
