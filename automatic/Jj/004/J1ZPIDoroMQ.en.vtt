00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
especially like the drynn respond

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.219 
especially like the drynn respond
because<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.229> very<00:01:58.500> close<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.040> bank<00:02:00.229> okay

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
because it's very close to a bank okay

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.959 
because it's very close to a bank okay
so<00:02:01.290> from<00:02:01.590> lumbridge<00:02:02.009> go<00:02:02.280> west<00:02:02.610> until<00:02:02.759> you

so from lumbridge go west until you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.420 
so from lumbridge go west until you
reach<00:02:03.180> drummer<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:04.079> very<00:02:04.290> far<00:02:04.649> away<00:02:04.799> but

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
reach drummer it's not very far away but

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.760 
reach drummer it's not very far away but
anyway<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.880> only<00:02:06.119> have<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> trip<00:02:07.110> wats

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
anyway you only have to do the trip wats

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.229 
anyway you only have to do the trip wats
okay<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:09.830> when<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.250> arrive<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.729> use<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:10.970> net

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
okay so when you arrive you use a net

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:18.149 
okay so when you arrive you use a net
option<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:11.900> order<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.349> get<00:02:12.530> shrimps

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.740 

so<00:02:19.159> you<00:02:19.220> will<00:02:19.370> do<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.730> until<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.269> get<00:02:20.480> level

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
so you will do this until you get level

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.240 
so you will do this until you get level
10<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.049> after<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.769> will<00:02:21.920> start

fly fishing so you will train that way

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.750 
fly fishing so you will train that way
from<00:02:46.480> level<00:02:46.690> 22<00:02:47.170> level<00:02:47.440> 55<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.280> want<00:02:48.490> money

experience<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.890> this<00:02:53.890> video<00:02:54.190> I'll<00:02:54.370> show<00:02:54.550> you

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
experience in this video I'll show you

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.640 
experience in this video I'll show you
three<00:02:54.970> main<00:02:55.180> ways<00:02:55.360> about<00:02:55.570> fly-fishing<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.560> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
three main ways about fly-fishing so the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.500 
three main ways about fly-fishing so the
first<00:02:56.890> one<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.250> regular<00:02:57.459> meta<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.450> you

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
first one is the regular meta so you

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.120 
first one is the regular meta so you
simply<00:02:58.750> wait<00:02:59.050> until<00:02:59.350> your<00:02:59.560> inventory<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.070> full

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
simply wait until your inventory is full

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.830 
simply wait until your inventory is full
of<00:03:00.430> fish<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.000> drop<00:03:01.240> them<00:03:01.360> one<00:03:01.420> by

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
of fish and then you drop them one by

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.020 
of fish and then you drop them one by
one<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.590> second<00:03:02.890> method<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.220> bossy<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:03.910> it's

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
one the second method is bossy so it's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.360 
one the second method is bossy so it's
exactly<00:03:04.780> like<00:03:04.900> regular<00:03:05.530> meta<00:03:05.739> except<00:03:06.190> you're

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
exactly like regular meta except you're

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.310 
exactly like regular meta except you're
using<00:03:06.550> mask<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.180> order<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.570> drop<00:03:07.810> them<00:03:07.989> very

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
using mask is in order to drop them very

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.560 
using mask is in order to drop them very
fast<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.340> with<00:03:09.459> this<00:03:09.580> method<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.030> then<00:03:10.120> expect

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
fast so with this method and then expect

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.170 
fast so with this method and then expect
around<00:03:10.780> 60k<00:03:11.530> experience<00:03:12.130> power<00:03:12.430> went<00:03:12.670> fishing

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
around 60k experience power went fishing

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.020 
around 60k experience power went fishing
at<00:03:13.300> level<00:03:13.570> 99<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.470> level<00:03:14.709> 22<00:03:15.190> level<00:03:15.400> 99<00:03:15.700> can

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
at level 99 so level 22 level 99 can

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.699 
at level 99 so level 22 level 99 can
take<00:03:16.209> around<00:03:16.480> two<00:03:16.720> hundred<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.110> twenty<00:03:17.470> hours

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
take around two hundred and twenty hours

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.220 
take around two hundred and twenty hours
the<00:03:18.520> third<00:03:18.790> method<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.209> local<00:03:19.630> kameez<00:03:19.959> so

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
the third method is local kameez so

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.840 
the third method is local kameez so
instead<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.590> dropping<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.160> fish<00:03:21.430> will<00:03:21.670> gas

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
instead of dropping the fish will gas

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.790 
instead of dropping the fish will gas
little<00:03:22.120> alchemy<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.900> fish<00:03:23.110> will<00:03:23.320> catch<00:03:23.590> in

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
little alchemy on the fish will catch in

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.340 
little alchemy on the fish will catch in
order<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.220> get<00:03:24.400> rid<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.640> them<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:26.020> will<00:03:26.170> get

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
order to get rid of them so you will get

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.199 
order to get rid of them so you will get
both<00:03:26.590> machine<00:03:27.100> experience<00:03:27.580> and<00:03:27.730> magic

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
both machine experience and magic

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.210 
both machine experience and magic
experience<00:03:28.690> her<00:03:29.110> verdict<00:03:29.440> cost<00:03:29.770> will<00:03:30.070> be<00:03:30.100> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
experience her verdict cost will be a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.550 
experience her verdict cost will be a

school<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:31.120> now<00:04:31.210> let's<00:04:31.450> talk<00:04:31.600> about<00:04:31.690> the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
school so now let's talk about the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
school so now let's talk about the
masking<00:04:32.260> so<00:04:32.550> 525<00:04:34.680> 525<00:04:37.860> 525<00:04:41.310> 525<00:04:44.220> 525<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:46.890> it's

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
masking so 525 525 525 525 525 and it's

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.860 
masking so 525 525 525 525 525 and it's
really<00:04:48.070> easy<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.520> do<00:04:48.760> you<00:04:49.120> can<00:04:49.240> also<00:04:49.420> press<00:04:49.840> the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
really easy to do you can also press the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.640 
really easy to do you can also press the
plus<00:04:50.260> button<00:04:50.500> instead<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.340> five<00:04:51.850> twice<00:04:52.650> so

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
plus button instead of five twice so

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.260 
plus button instead of five twice so
this<00:04:53.830> is<00:04:53.860> how<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.280> should<00:04:54.460> look<00:04:54.520> at<00:04:54.790> normal

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
this is how it should look at normal

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.340 
this is how it should look at normal
speed<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:58.330> as<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.480> can<00:04:58.600> see<00:04:58.810> it's<00:04:58.930> way<00:04:59.110> faster

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
speed so as you can see it's way faster

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.370 
speed so as you can see it's way faster
