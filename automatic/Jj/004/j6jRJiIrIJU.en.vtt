00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:48.130
 I downloaded my cell phone, it 's a simple Indian. 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:52.890
 It's very simple, you see, right? 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.890
 is the same control as the 2 x box ne 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.430
 is the gameplay is with it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.170
 so it is not is not very good here is not 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.790

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.780
 internet the internet or mobile phone is not 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.250
 It 's a month's worth of yours. 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:40.360
 to use a fire goes is that you better 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:45.690

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.690

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.690
 to accelerate with the car 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.030

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.329
