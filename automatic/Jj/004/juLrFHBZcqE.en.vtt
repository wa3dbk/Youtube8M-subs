00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.280
 hello in this video only a very short 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.750
 update in own thing in another 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.309
 video we had announced that 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.710
 we are now also on paypal 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.500
 can support in addition to it 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.570
 we offer so-called milestones 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.130
 We should ask for suggestions 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.750
 and there are also many suggestions 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.329
 We have checked in now 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.559
 and after with respect to the milestones 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.170
 But we already have three already 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.460
 Entries made in the link 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.040
 description could be yes once 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.989
 just look down here 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.519
 scrolling we have the listed there 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.199
 there will also be some added 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.239
 here only a short explanation of some 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.929
 ask in the context directly 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.879
 have emerged 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.129
 The first invitation is for one 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.050
 new intro by semper video 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.699
 we get a lot of comments 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.769
 that we should update that 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.480
 and we are told 500 euros would be 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.370
 maybe a reasonable amount if 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.569
 that is not enough 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.800
 Information also on this page 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.659
 you can send us an e-mail 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.390
 in the context then came directly the 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.000
 Request if we then every month 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.040
 have new intro because then just then 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.770
 appropriate donation amount every month 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.110
 would come in theoretically 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.369
 he comes in every month and I go 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.110
 times of it falls sooner or later 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.570
 something different again what we then 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.650
 can just give back to the community 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.229
 then I'm not doing any big ones right now 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.400
 but ensure the appropriate amount of 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.350
 there is donated 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.479
 at this time in this case here are examples 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.240
 on the 82 dollars 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.619
 So about 60 euros and get that 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.229
 Of course we are not completely the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.020
 platform of one of a dollar den 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.780
 you donate us the platform 32 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.170
 cent so about 32 percent in the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.030
 case 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.800
 but it only applies now before now 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.869
 someone says 32 percent is not 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.820
 bad what is true only for the 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.880
 first dollar so take 30 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.710
 cent per transfer or per donation and 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.960
 then again two percent of the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.700
 complete donation so really 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.280
 in the worst case if you have a dollar 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.720
 donations only reach 68 cents 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.000
 but if you donate five dollars or 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:12.520
 so similar then come four of us 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.489
 euro 68 then that will be cheaper 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.050
 to our relationship that's why if you 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.940
 So at some point, we are here 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.069
 Would get get 700 dollar 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.459
 reality probably only 450 euro 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.989
 So to bill and deduct for the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.870
 corresponding provider costs here or 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.069
 cost platform and so far does it 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.540
 already well within the amount a 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.500
 to save a bit and then again 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.180
 to throw out 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.950
 and as I said no, not everyone will 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.260
 give a new intro month but there is 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.510
 other cases that we say for it 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.190
 can now finance so under 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 other times already written out 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.510
 An add on for the google chrome for us 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.129
 that then just put the audience 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.620
 In any case, they can deal with that 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.560
 know and then the tender for 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.270
 the firefox addon taking the order 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.120
 actually should be reversed first 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.680
 we are still changing the firefox add-on 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.790
 the invitation of a new introns 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.760
 I had already said 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.930
 Theoretically, you can continue afterwards 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.459
 Invitation to a new music and so on 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.890
 on and on so I'll go 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.690
 assuming that what occurs to us 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.980
 the more detailed data to the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.630
 corresponding tenders the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.040
 we will then be in a corresponding 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.709
 video separately I'll tell you now 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.300
 announce if the corresponding 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.010
 amount was reached 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.990
 otherwise it was still desired by them 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.440
 live chats once a month or once 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.330
 during the week 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.190
 we are currently looking at it again 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.820
 that can implement skype is there 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.230
 not the first choice but well anyway 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.880
 must be moderated properly 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.650
 can be or without much effort 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.989
 as I said, we are still testing 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.800
 teamspeak eventually we'll see 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.840
 get ahead because 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.490
 who is interested in it just once 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.400
 at regular intervals there 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.290
 stop by and we are next to the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.220
 whole update with appropriate 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.980
 milestones or just here this 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.190
 Case for the single user bar 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.180
 currently still dead trousers here 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.800
 So far nothing remains for me now 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.230
 to say something other than thank you 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.060
 with all who support us there and 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.250
 of course, with all the others us too 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.380
 on all other channels support 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.380
 we appreciate that ok
