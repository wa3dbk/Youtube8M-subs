and<00:02:57.060> stress<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.599> there's<00:02:58.079> no<00:02:58.200> question<00:02:58.620> that

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
and stress and there's no question that

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.220 
and stress and there's no question that
she<00:02:58.799> felt<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.549> again<00:02:59.970> but<00:03:00.780> she<00:03:00.930> did<00:03:01.079> have

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
she felt that again but she did have

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.259 
she felt that again but she did have
some<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.919> know<00:03:02.040> some<00:03:02.340> confidence<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:03.060> think

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
some you know some confidence I think

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.789 
some you know some confidence I think
you<00:03:03.599> know<00:03:03.720> building<00:03:04.079> over<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.379> last<00:03:04.500> four

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
you know building over the last four

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.289 
you know building over the last four
years<00:03:04.829> she<00:03:05.310> felt<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:05.700> she<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:06.209> know

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.920 
later women's hockey has grown and
matured<00:04:07.010> just<00:04:08.010> like<00:04:08.159> its<00:04:08.370> players<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:09.750> nice

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
matured just like its players the nice

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.469 
matured just like its players the nice
thing<00:04:10.199> I<00:04:10.530> think<00:04:11.040> what<00:04:11.189> this<00:04:11.370> Olympus<00:04:12.060> is<00:04:12.180> going

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
thing I think what this Olympus is going

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.190 
thing I think what this Olympus is going
into<00:04:12.629> this<00:04:12.780> Olympics<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.799> competition<00:04:14.489> is

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
into this Olympics is the competition is

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.020 
into this Olympics is the competition is
is<00:04:15.290> is<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.950> getting<00:04:16.160> tougher<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:16.820> think

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
is is is getting tougher and I think

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.490 
is is is getting tougher and I think
that's<00:04:17.209> what<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:17.480> Olympics<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.109> all<00:04:18.200> about

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
that's what the Olympics is all about

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.250 
that's what the Olympics is all about
the<00:04:19.160> women's<00:04:19.489> game<00:04:19.609> is<00:04:19.850> still<00:04:20.000> evolving<00:04:20.540> teams

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
the women's game is still evolving teams

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.000 
the women's game is still evolving teams
are<00:04:21.410> getting<00:04:21.680> better

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
are getting better

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.530 
are getting better
certainly<00:04:22.550> Canada<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.090> us<00:04:23.300> at<00:04:23.450> the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
certainly Canada and us at the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.320 
certainly Canada and us at the
frontrunners<00:04:24.080> but<00:04:24.370> I'm<00:04:25.370> just<00:04:25.669> pleased<00:04:26.000> as<00:04:26.300> a

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
frontrunners but I'm just pleased as a

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.120 
frontrunners but I'm just pleased as a
spectator<00:04:26.870> really<00:04:27.290> to<00:04:27.410> see<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:27.860> women's

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
spectator really to see that the women's

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.890 
spectator really to see that the women's
game<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.910> know<00:04:29.000> more<00:04:29.150> parity<00:04:29.480> is<00:04:29.600> coming<00:04:29.840> to

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
game you know more parity is coming to

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.070 
game you know more parity is coming to
the<00:04:30.020> game<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:31.310> hopefully<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.900> real

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
the game and and hopefully it's a real

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.830 
the game and and hopefully it's a real
tight<00:04:33.760> competitive<00:04:34.760> competition<00:04:35.570> for<00:04:35.750> all

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
tight competitive competition for all

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.500 
tight competitive competition for all
the<00:04:35.960> teams<00:04:36.169> that<00:04:36.260> are<00:04:36.440> there<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:37.120> if<00:04:38.120> we<00:04:38.180> play

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
the teams that are there and if we play

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.879 
the teams that are there and if we play
our<00:04:38.540> best<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:39.200> think<00:04:39.500> we<00:04:39.590> have<00:04:39.680> an<00:04:39.800> opportunity

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
our best I think we have an opportunity

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.760 
our best I think we have an opportunity
to<00:04:40.490> end<00:04:40.760> up<00:04:40.910> on<00:04:41.030> top<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.300> win<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.050> gold<00:04:42.260> defend

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
to end up on top and win the gold defend

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.250 
to end up on top and win the gold defend
the<00:04:42.860> gold<00:04:43.010> but<00:04:43.540> certainly<00:04:44.540> it's<00:04:44.780> gonna<00:04:44.990> be<00:04:45.229> I

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
the gold but certainly it's gonna be I

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.170 
the gold but certainly it's gonna be I
think<00:04:45.500> even<00:04:46.040> a<00:04:46.100> greater<00:04:46.310> challenge<00:04:46.610> this<00:04:46.940> time

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
think even a greater challenge this time

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.210 
think even a greater challenge this time
around<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.540> last<00:04:47.720> Olympics<00:04:48.200> for<00:04:48.440> sure<00:04:48.620> hard

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
around the last Olympics for sure hard

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.580 
around the last Olympics for sure hard
to<00:04:49.280> believe<00:04:49.370> really<00:04:49.639> that<00:04:49.790> you<00:04:50.210> know<00:04:50.330> that

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
to believe really that you know that

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.490 
to believe really that you know that
that<00:04:51.590> she<00:04:51.830> has<00:04:51.979> a<00:04:52.010> gold<00:04:52.250> medal<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:53.229> and<00:04:54.229> that

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
that she has a gold medal and and that

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.090 
that she has a gold medal and and that
she's<00:04:54.740> going<00:04:55.639> to<00:04:55.700> try<00:04:55.820> to<00:04:55.940> get<00:04:56.090> another<00:04:56.270> one

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.160
