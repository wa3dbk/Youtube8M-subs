00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
a little and usually starts up fairly

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.749 
a little and usually starts up fairly
easy<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.850> worked<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
easy now that I worked on it and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.740 
easy now that I worked on it and
actually<00:01:26.759> needs<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.970> new<00:01:27.090> air<00:01:27.240> filter<00:01:27.420> right

now<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:29.040> rusty<00:01:30.590> i

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
now as you can see it's a bit rusty i

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.770 
now as you can see it's a bit rusty i
thing<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:32.820> don't<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.119> about<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:35.689> when<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
thing i don't like about it is when you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.910 
thing i don't like about it is when you
pull<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> down<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.350> pulls<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
pull it down the actually pulls the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.960 
pull it down the actually pulls the
wheel<00:01:41.990> instead<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> pushing<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:44.250> blade<00:01:44.490> down

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
wheel instead of pushing the blade down

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.660 
wheel instead of pushing the blade down
which<00:01:45.470> can<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> pain<00:01:47.280> sometimes

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
which can kind of be a pain sometimes

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.950 
which can kind of be a pain sometimes
and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.380 

oh<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.800> I<00:01:51.920> have<00:01:52.160> had<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.580> change<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:53.120> pull

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
oh and I have had to change the pull

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.290 
oh and I have had to change the pull
rope<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:56.450> was<00:01:56.690> about<00:01:56.870> a<00:01:57.640> month<00:01:58.640> or<00:01:58.880> two<00:01:58.910> ago

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
rope that was about a month or two ago

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.650 
rope that was about a month or two ago
and<00:02:01.990> let's<00:02:02.990> see<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:03.230> it'll<00:02:03.380> start

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
and let's see if it'll start

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:15.990 
and let's see if it'll start
take<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.780> forceps<00:02:06.260> off<00:02:09.610> prime<00:02:10.610> it

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:40.500 

okay<00:02:16.600> let's<00:02:17.050> see<00:02:28.500> almost<00:02:39.270> think<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.330> might<00:02:40.480> be

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
okay let's see almost think it might be

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.780 
okay let's see almost think it might be
the<00:02:40.720> air<00:02:40.870> filters<00:02:41.350> bit<00:02:41.950> clogged<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.610> might

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
the air filters bit clogged it might

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.250 
the air filters bit clogged it might
still<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.150> little<00:02:43.330> wetness<00:02:43.900> from<00:02:43.960> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
still have a little wetness from the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
still have a little wetness from the
rain<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.560> other<00:02:44.680> day<00:03:08.400> maybe<00:03:09.400> not<00:03:10.860> let's<00:03:11.860> see

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
rain the other day maybe not let's see

00:03:12.280 --> 00:04:23.710 
rain the other day maybe not let's see
oh<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:14.080> might<00:03:14.350> have<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:15.420> little<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:17.020> gas<00:03:17.260> line

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.860
