be on that painting so I use charcoal as
opposed<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.009> pencil<00:01:11.520> charcoal<00:01:12.180> absorbs<00:01:13.049> into

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
opposed to pencil charcoal absorbs into

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.160 
opposed to pencil charcoal absorbs into
the<00:01:13.439> paint<00:01:13.619> pencil<00:01:14.310> does<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.840 
the paint pencil does not so we want it
to<00:01:16.200> absorb<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:16.890> away<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.640> seen

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to absorb and go away and not be seen

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.109 
to absorb and go away and not be seen
anymore<00:01:18.149> so<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.979> old<00:01:20.310> master<00:01:20.729> guys<00:01:20.909> knew

tones all on this palette and that's
what<00:03:26.340> I'm<00:03:26.460> doing<00:03:26.490> right<00:03:26.850> now<00:03:27.030> i<00:03:27.060> just<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
what I'm doing right now i just have the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.150 
what I'm doing right now i just have the
virtue<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:28.320> there<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.860> little<00:03:29.070> bit

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
virtue on there and it's a little bit

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.310 
virtue on there and it's a little bit
messy<00:03:29.520> because<00:03:29.790> I've<00:03:30.180> been<00:03:30.210> a<00:03:30.360> little<00:03:30.540> busy<00:03:30.690> so

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
messy because I've been a little busy so

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.440 
messy because I've been a little busy so
from<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.710> would<00:03:31.830> be<00:03:31.890> very<00:03:31.980> easy<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:33.210> take

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
from there would be very easy to take

from there would be very easy to take
the<00:03:34.080> flesh<00:03:34.860> color<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.580> match<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.330> up<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:37.170> the
