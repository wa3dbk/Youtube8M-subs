00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.580
 hello and welcome from my 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.680
 name is dennis and today I want you 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.630
 the miracle weapon the g2 show the 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.520
 marvel weapon the g2 belongs to the classes 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.470
 the miracle weapons I give you a strength 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.919
 of 8 because they are actually very strong 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.880
 but has a very funny effect 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.220
 munitions moderately looks like they 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.710
 The effect is three to fifteen shot like that 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.200
 shit system ammunition also very little 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.320
 Well, if you ask them to load you three 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 such small lightning capsule after find 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.790
 I actually quite cool looks quite 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.380
 cool but well if you look at them 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.090
 you want to have them out of the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.800
 crate get just as with rails 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.880
 this is on call of the dead 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.610
 a little different there you have to at least 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.860
 once that's done and then 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.400
 kill George Romero if you did that 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.260
 has and then picks up the wonder weapon that 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.680
 is then such a deadly sign like that 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.020
 bring the death then you have them first 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.519
 time until it's empty 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.770
 In the hand you can have the weapon 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.150
 do not change and no ammunition 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.000
 buy or something 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.350
 also if you have max m on the floor 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.580
 has somehow by accident 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.260
 reloaded the weapon 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.630
 maybe you can hire dr or something 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.050
 what amused so far but that 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.120
 happens in the rarest cases 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.010
 important is that the weapon only ten 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.830
 killing zombies is the effect of what 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.300
 that's why I did not speak 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.060
 she is not my favorite weapon 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.979
 but well 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.229
 komatsu the wonderful for fat three az 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.600
 she gets more a strength of 10 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.100
 because she is a little bit better 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.530
 and who the ammo of 36 is already 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.560
 360 zombies are a bit better 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.070
 is the double so very cool 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.250
 every case 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.159
 It is not available at cinema number 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.780
 because it's not a packet bank machine 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.760
 gives you only the normal 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.790
 wonderful for call of the dead exactly 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.710
 the same thing there it is so 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.590
 you can not dance because it's a power 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.090
 up is this wonder weapon as you know 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.560
 Can you bring the whole death 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.470
 normal death also does not fit 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.200
 exactly the same principle in the wonderful 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.930
 for dg 2 at call of the dead 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.269
 It is important that the weapon increases 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.400
 reach with the flash but has 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.680
 still kill only ten zombies 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.129
 yes that was actually up to the video 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.129
 next time
