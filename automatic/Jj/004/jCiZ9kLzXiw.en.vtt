00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.989

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.360
 salgado in the profile no no here there is no 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.390
 profiles wait good back here to the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.420
 salgado bringing them a new video about 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.199
 zombies of the favorite game 'I hope world 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.500
 is not at last bringing them the video that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 I had both promised them how to install 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.000
 mods of this great video game good 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.940
 The first thing we have to do to 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 install this or install good mods 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.050
 clarified something before this video tutorial 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.630
 they only go to is for mods of sights 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.950
 here I will only show how to install 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.880
 mode look ok ok now the first thing that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.860
 we have to do to install a mount 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.300
 world of tanks is to go to one of the many 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:34.310
 pages of motorcycles that exist here I see 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.470
 I used here almost always is 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:42.080
 is called 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.780
 with what mont s of the dotcom 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.250
 I like this is very pretty 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.250
 father is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:58.200
 I like it pretty good 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.750
 in the first aspect we have to see 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.620
 to install a mod is 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.780
 which game version do you have how 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.050
 just pulled out they just took out the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.130
 version 8.7 have I recommend you to 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.810
 use mods for that version 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.950
 but if they have other versions 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.590
 different use the modes that are 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.590
 for those versions because most of 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.980
 the modes of view of my views have 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.980
 data then as it passes 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.560
 the versions are changing the 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.970
 they are changing that they are changing 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.970
 data the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.860
 both those that are leaving me 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.490
 all 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.160
 they change the data the tanks by 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.200
 so if you install a mode that is not 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.540
 of the version that you have can 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.720
 be erroneous the data that you 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.720
 have 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.850
 good 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:19.350
 Let's go right now I'm living 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.750
 some mods that I liked and this one 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.720
 like good first thing we have to 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.940
 do already having a mod that we like 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.940
 is to select it 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.980
 and here it is since you select them 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.459
 photos will almost always appear on the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.960
 mod 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.920
 a complete description 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.610
 and then I recommend that you get here 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.960
 now and then the link to download 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.750
 give you here I hope you try and as 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.630
 you will see here 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.720
 she 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.080
 here is exporting let's hope a 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.930
 moment I finished downloading 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.920
 then as we finish we close this no longer 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.370
 it is necessary to remove this and it will appear 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.880
 a winrar file 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.940
 already having this winrar file that 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.669
 I tell them almost all computers 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.949
 they have winrar if they do not have it I will let them 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.070
 here in the link the description of where 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.920
 you can download it 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.560
 and good already having this good folder 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.810
 rap will almost always appear another 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.800
 folder that says the name of the mode that 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.690
 you just downloaded and the version 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.900
 that has so they double- click 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.440
 here then they will appear low region 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:52.270
 mods give you double click here then go them 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.560
 will appear 0.8 points 7 or the version 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:01.120
 that you have can be 0.8 point 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:04.710
 9.8 point 9 so several things give them 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.960
 double click and two folders will appear 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.250
 call cuy and scripts these we had 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:15.310
 here so while we 're closing this 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.940
 here are mine and then look and 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.250
 having these 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:26.430
 these folders we go to libraries 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:29.490
 dislodge to my pc now library my 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.280
 pc in my files where they have 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:37.410
 access to the local disk already being here 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:40.920
 they are going to dislodge by clicking on them and 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:43.530
 will appear in a bunch of case folders 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.230
 of different computers among them 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.150
 they look for a folder called game gives you a 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:53.580
 double click and the two will appear 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.530
 several the world of tanks folder yes 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.540
 they have in world of war plains and war no 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.490
 But they will also appear but 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.080
 now they give him in the word of 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.970
 times 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:10.969
 we will have this we will have this and here and 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:14.689
 here we look for a folder called rhythms 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:18.030
 script under motorcycle there and we selected it 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:23.009
 then we look for the version that you 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:27.030
 have or is mine 8.7 and this folder 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:30.689
 it's going to be empty because I have not installed 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.580
 no motorcycle then having this one here 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.949
 the only thing that should appear to them is a 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.750
 rhythm file and where it says of 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:42.469
 fowler and just for work and desire 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.780
 here they have to put the here 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:48.210
 we minimize this and then we pass these 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:52.259
 two folders separately 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:55.020
