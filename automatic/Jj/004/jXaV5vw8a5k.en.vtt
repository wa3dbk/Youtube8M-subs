00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.910 

well<00:00:56.790> trips<00:00:57.239> afford<00:00:57.660> leaves<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.260> tent<00:00:58.559> still

check-in<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.430> approach<00:00:59.820> that's<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> lane

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
check-in that approach that's the lane

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.479 
check-in that approach that's the lane
if<00:01:00.870> he<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> problem<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.830> think<00:01:01.890> it'll<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.370> on

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
if he has a problem I think it'll be on

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.010 
if he has a problem I think it'll be on
this<00:01:02.610> Lane<00:01:02.850> because<00:01:03.180> he's<00:01:03.330> going<00:01:03.570> more<00:01:03.750> direct

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
this Lane because he's going more direct

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.479 
this Lane because he's going more direct
with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> ball<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.650> when<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.160> go<00:01:05.280> more

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
with the ball and when you go more

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.850 
with the ball and when you go more
direct<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.090> pocket<00:01:06.510> speed<00:01:07.380> control<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
direct to the pocket speed control is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
direct to the pocket speed control is
always<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.759> most<00:01:08.910> important<00:01:09.450> thing<00:01:09.600> if

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
always the most important thing if

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
always the most important thing if
you're<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.899> hair<00:01:10.110> short<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:11.009> hair<00:01:11.280> hard<00:01:11.520> with

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
you're a hair short or a hair hard with

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.670 
you're a hair short or a hair hard with
the<00:01:11.820> ball<00:01:12.030> speed<00:01:12.300> it's<00:01:13.229> either<00:01:13.410> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> go

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
the ball speed it's either going to go

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
the ball speed it's either going to go
through<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> nose<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.399> gonna<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
through the nose or it's gonna be a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190 
through the nose or it's gonna be a
washout<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.210> he<00:01:15.300> has<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.570> very<00:01:15.750> careful

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
washout so he has to be very careful

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.200 
washout so he has to be very careful
that<00:01:16.500> he<00:01:16.530> doesn't<00:01:16.619> set<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.160> early<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:17.820> get

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that he doesn't set it down early or get

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.570 
that he doesn't set it down early or get
soft<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.780> speed<00:01:19.050> on<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.950> certainly

10 pin without hurting myself stands all

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.919 
10 pin without hurting myself stands all
the<00:01:41.789> way<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.090> back<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.479> approach<00:01:42.720> here

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
the way the back of the approach here

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:43.969 
the way the back of the approach here
takes<00:01:43.229> 4<00:01:43.470> steps

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
takes 4 steps

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.010 
watch how smooth he starts so it was the
short<00:01:50.100> push<00:01:50.310> away<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.940> real<00:01:51.360> short<00:01:51.780> first

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
short push away the real short first

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:02.130 
short push away the real short first
step

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.890 

well<00:02:03.100> that's<00:02:03.310> where<00:02:03.460> he<00:02:03.520> was<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.850> whole<00:02:04.060> first

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
well that's where he was the whole first

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.410 
well that's where he was the whole first
game<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:06.640> you'll<00:02:06.730> get<00:02:06.820> back<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.240> lined

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
game I think you'll get back and lined

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.940 
game I think you'll get back and lined
up<00:02:07.570> on<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.720> right-hand<00:02:07.960> lane<00:02:08.289> -<00:02:08.560> it's<00:02:08.740> just<00:02:08.800> a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
up on the right-hand lane - it's just a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.710 
up on the right-hand lane - it's just a
matter<00:02:09.100> of<00:02:09.250> keeping<00:02:09.880> getting<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> speed

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
matter of keeping getting the speed

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.240 
matter of keeping getting the speed
right<00:02:10.750> sometimes<00:02:11.200> your<00:02:11.530> opening<00:02:11.830> shot<00:02:12.070> it

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
right sometimes your opening shot it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.040 
right sometimes your opening shot it
tends<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.820> be<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:12.970> little<00:02:13.180> soft<00:02:13.390> kills<00:02:13.630> also

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
tends to be a little soft kills also

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.750 
tends to be a little soft kills also
well<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> think<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.860> important<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.310> Parker

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
well I think it's important for Parker

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.250 
well I think it's important for Parker
to<00:02:15.790> get<00:02:16.000> out<00:02:16.120> with<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> few<00:02:16.480> strikes<00:02:16.750> get<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.080> hit

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
to get out with a few strikes get a hit

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.840 
to get out with a few strikes get a hit
in<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:17.470> man<00:02:17.620> no<00:02:17.800> question<00:02:18.220> if<00:02:18.340> he<00:02:18.430> lets<00:02:18.640> Danny
