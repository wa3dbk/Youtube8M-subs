main brackets are in place and just need

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.769 
main brackets are in place and just need
a<00:00:25.999> little<00:00:26.150> bit<00:00:26.300> more<00:00:26.449> welding<00:00:27.910> I<00:00:28.910> went<00:00:29.720> ahead

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
a little bit more welding I went ahead

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.069 
a little bit more welding I went ahead
and<00:00:29.960> took<00:00:30.079> the<00:00:30.230> firewall<00:00:30.740> out<00:00:30.980> you<00:00:31.220> can<00:00:31.369> see<00:00:31.550> I

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
and took the firewall out you can see I

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.260 
and took the firewall out you can see I
drilled<00:00:33.079> a<00:00:33.170> couple<00:00:33.470> of<00:00:33.560> holes<00:00:33.770> here<00:00:34.220> this<00:00:35.120> is

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
drilled a couple of holes here this is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.840 
drilled a couple of holes here this is

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
going to be body mounts on this frame

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.450 
going to be body mounts on this frame
member<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.329> this<00:00:38.450> frame<00:00:38.750> member<00:00:39.020> here<00:00:39.460> I'm

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
member and this frame member here I'm

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.250 
member and this frame member here I'm
going<00:00:40.700> to<00:00:40.760> trim<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:41.180> sheet<00:00:41.540> metal<00:00:41.840> to<00:00:41.930> look<00:00:42.200> a

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
going to trim that sheet metal to look a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.550 
going to trim that sheet metal to look a
lot<00:00:42.380> better<00:00:42.560> around<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.070> edge<00:00:43.190> there<00:00:44.530> but<00:00:45.530> I

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 
lot better around the edge there but I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.440 
lot better around the edge there but I
think<00:00:45.620> in<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:45.980> seats<00:00:46.250> out<00:00:46.460> as<00:00:46.670> well<00:00:46.850> steering

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
think in the seats out as well steering

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.830 
think in the seats out as well steering
wheel<00:00:47.600> everything<00:00:48.020> that's<00:00:48.140> been<00:00:48.230> removed<00:00:49.840> and

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
wheel everything that's been removed and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.370 
wheel everything that's been removed and
working<00:00:51.140> on<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.380> park<00:00:51.620> brake<00:00:51.890> here<00:00:53.200> let's<00:00:54.200> see

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
working on the park brake here let's see

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.830 
working on the park brake here let's see
it<00:00:54.560> comes<00:00:54.800> with<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.010> little<00:00:55.850> lever<00:00:56.060> system<00:00:58.840> I

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
it comes with a little lever system I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.960 
it comes with a little lever system I
really<00:01:00.650> had<00:01:00.830> to<00:01:00.980> do<00:01:01.130> some<00:01:01.340> research<00:01:01.520> of<00:01:01.940> the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
really had to do some research of the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.689 
really had to do some research of the
hook<00:01:02.240> or<00:01:03.020> anything<00:01:03.230> else<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.590> ensure<00:01:04.400> that<00:01:04.460> i

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
hook or anything else to ensure that i

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.940 
hook or anything else to ensure that i
have<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.030> thing<00:01:05.089> sitting<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:05.630> here<00:01:05.750> properly

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.489 

you<00:01:09.950> can<00:01:10.070> see<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.460> cable<00:01:10.939> slip<00:01:11.149> to<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.499> break

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:12.499 
you can see the cable slip to the break

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:15.399 
you can see the cable slip to the break
it<00:01:12.740> comes<00:01:12.950> down<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.399> this<00:01:13.520> plate<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:15.200> when<00:01:15.320> you

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
it comes down to this plate and when you

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.630 
it comes down to this plate and when you
pull<00:01:15.590> up<00:01:15.649> on<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.189> lever<00:01:17.679> pulls<00:01:18.679> that<00:01:18.890> back<00:01:19.159> so

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
pull up on the lever pulls that back so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.669 
pull up on the lever pulls that back so
the<00:01:19.820> cables<00:01:20.179> will<00:01:20.359> be<00:01:20.560> originating<00:01:21.560> from

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
the cables will be originating from

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.410 
the cables will be originating from
right<00:01:21.890> underneath<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.369> can't<00:01:22.579> console<00:01:23.149> and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
right underneath the can't console and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.870 
right underneath the can't console and
my<00:01:24.259> initial<00:01:24.619> plan<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.189> put<00:01:25.429> them<00:01:25.549> in<00:01:25.609> some

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
my initial plan is to put them in some

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.749 
my initial plan is to put them in some
metal<00:01:26.119> tubes<00:01:26.359> that<00:01:26.630> go<00:01:26.689> out<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.490> frame

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
metal tubes that go out of the frame

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.880 
metal tubes that go out of the frame
under<00:01:29.329> here<00:01:29.509> somewhere<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:30.200> go<00:01:30.590> into<00:01:30.740> this

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
under here somewhere and go into this

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.309 
under here somewhere and go into this
corner<00:01:31.219> back<00:01:31.969> here<00:01:31.999> underneath<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.840> frame<00:01:33.079> so

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
corner back here underneath the frame so

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.749 
corner back here underneath the frame so
the<00:01:33.439> only<00:01:33.560> thing<00:01:33.649> I'd<00:01:33.829> be<00:01:33.920> sticking<00:01:34.219> out<00:01:34.340> a

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
the only thing I'd be sticking out a

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.590 
the only thing I'd be sticking out a
couple<00:01:35.179> of<00:01:35.329> tubes<00:01:35.600> for<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:35.960> emergency<00:01:36.200> brake

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
couple of tubes for the emergency brake

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.969 
couple of tubes for the emergency brake
but<00:01:38.600> working<00:01:39.319> on<00:01:39.380> building<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:39.939> brackets

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
but working on building the brackets

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.419 
but working on building the brackets
mount<00:01:42.979> these<00:01:43.189> to<00:01:43.969> the<00:01:44.090> edge<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.600> frame<00:01:44.960> and

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
mount these to the edge of the frame and

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.709 
mount these to the edge of the frame and
I<00:01:46.429> get<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.030> done<00:01:47.240> I'll<00:01:47.420> have<00:01:47.539> everything

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
I get that done I'll have everything

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.510 
I get that done I'll have everything
trimmed<00:01:48.109> up<00:01:48.259> nice<00:01:48.909> basically<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:49.969> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
trimmed up nice basically it is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.090 
trimmed up nice basically it is
the<00:01:51.270> major<00:01:52.280> filter<00:01:53.280> are<00:01:53.670> almost
