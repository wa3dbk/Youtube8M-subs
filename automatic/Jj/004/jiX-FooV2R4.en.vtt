the international relations course was
the<00:00:26.160> hardest<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.330> interesting

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the hardest but it was very interesting

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
the hardest but it was very interesting
to<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.529> from<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.980> Brazilian<00:00:29.519> perspective

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
to see from a Brazilian perspective

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.139 
to see from a Brazilian perspective
international<00:00:31.109> relations<00:00:31.619> between<00:00:32.460> Brazil

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149

and<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:34.140> US<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:36.420> class<00:00:37.250> difficulty<00:00:38.250> what

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and the US and the class difficulty what

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.690 
and the US and the class difficulty what
I<00:00:39.000> would<00:00:39.149> say<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.540> about<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.050> same<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:41.280> one

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
I would say was about the same they one

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.490 
I would say was about the same they one
thing<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.210> different<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.870> they

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
thing I they do different is that they

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.299 
thing I they do different is that they
take<00:00:44.460> attendance<00:00:44.700> every<00:00:45.510> class<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.309> they

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
take attendance every class and they

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
take attendance every class and they
base<00:00:47.520> part<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> your<00:00:48.090> grade<00:00:48.270> off<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.629> your

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
base part of your grade off of your

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
base part of your grade off of your
attendance<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:50.420> also<00:00:51.420> um<00:00:52.340> there's<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.789> most

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
attendance and also um there's for most

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.689 
attendance and also um there's for most
of<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.360> classes<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.739> midterm<00:00:56.309> final

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
of your classes it's a midterm final

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.229 
of your classes it's a midterm final
basis<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:58.140> there's<00:00:58.199> two<00:00:58.680> finals<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.850> way

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
basis but there's two finals and the way

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
basis but there's two finals and the way
they<00:01:00.390> do<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> take<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
they do that is you get to take the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
they do that is you get to take the
second<00:01:02.399> final<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> failed<00:01:03.270> your<00:01:03.510> midterm

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
second final if you failed your midterm

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.330 
second final if you failed your midterm
and<00:01:05.510> but<00:01:06.510> basically<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.770> difficulty

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and but basically the the difficulty

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.969 
and but basically the the difficulty
level<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.850> pretty<00:01:09.720> equivalent<00:01:10.110> aside<00:01:10.830> from

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
level was pretty equivalent aside from

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
level was pretty equivalent aside from
the<00:01:11.159> fact<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.970> my<00:01:12.030> classes<00:01:12.450> were<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the fact that all my classes were in

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.700 
the fact that all my classes were in
Portuguese<00:01:13.549> at<00:01:14.549> my<00:01:14.850> university<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.930> in

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
Portuguese at my university it's in

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.170 
Portuguese at my university it's in
Brazil<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.729> was<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.240> lot<00:01:18.960> smaller<00:01:19.439> than<00:01:20.100> UCSB<00:01:20.970> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
Brazil it was a lot smaller than UCSB so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
Brazil it was a lot smaller than UCSB so
there's<00:01:21.390> two<00:01:21.750> main<00:01:22.049> buildings<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> go

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
there's two main buildings that you go

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.730 
there's two main buildings that you go
to<00:01:23.100> every<00:01:23.580> day<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.930> generally<00:01:25.590> where

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to every day and that's generally where

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
to every day and that's generally where
people<00:01:26.130> tend<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> socialize<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.509> meet<00:01:27.570> other

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
people tend to socialize and meet other

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.310 
people tend to socialize and meet other
people<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.619> everything<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.250> um

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
people and everything like that um

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.690 
people and everything like that um
generally<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.590> found<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> hard<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> become

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
generally I found it hard to become

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.460
