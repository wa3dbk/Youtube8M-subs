00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.900
 and well dirty con I hope you go 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.039
 well it's going great today the video 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 so that I had promised in my last 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.349
 video that I 'm doing as a result so been the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 video 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.160
 I love water was again this case the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.570
 video how to fix wifi errors 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 so I think I called it like that 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.629
 to wifi cards and so I had said 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.790
 that we had to download the last 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.440
 drivers all that for that nothing more 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.829
 simple are you going to the sites 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.930
 all drivers are not there 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.610
 and so this little site allows you to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.260
 frankly simplifies life too 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.530
 to download all the latest drivers 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.330
 so those who do not know what it is 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.949
 it's complicated explained in fact because yes 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.269
 you have a because my films that's what 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.189
 allows me to connect to the wifi 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.869
 it needs to be updated and so 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:06.960
 it's thanks to the drivers that we put them 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:08.549
 update the question my drivers so these 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.710
 baghdad videos a bit long do you 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.880
 launched to detection is normally you 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.310
 will not be able to right which will you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.869
 ask to install a plugin you 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.280
 have to do it why not because 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.259
 otherwise you can never 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.670
 detected what is good or there you 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.220
 will see some blur it's normal because it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.080
 there was my pc that is displayed so here is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.700
 once done that it will update a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 little bit the page and he wants to do 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.470
 to appear these is all your 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 components that has in your computer 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.780
 and he will show you for example I 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.640
 seen down ah bah here for example 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.930
 this one there by day compared to this 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.830
 which is available on the intel website 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.960
 he will offer me 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.900
 this one you open and I have another one 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.920
 here you have to do that you go 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.810
 on it and you click on the small if 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.850
 you see what appears me I use 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.430
 the server number to file every 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.370
 drivers you save it for example 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.940
 download there is already 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.940
 Well, I'll call him 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.660
 yeah that's sometimes like me 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.610
 so I'm here I think I had it 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.350
 already installed and sometimes that oven but 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.110
 as under the sign of the problems 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.000
 sometimes does not install properly and 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.070
 that also all they slaughter 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.940
 overwhelming you do it it's very 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.680
 important that they load and unload 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.950
 the latest drivers for anyway 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:36.480
 have a pc that only risk the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.000
 well who was clamoring segus time that there 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.130
 had good performance file all 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.230
 the drivers and the Swiss already plays 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.180
 registered and my hair I'm going 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.180
 test at install with your balls because 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.800
 otherwise it's a point you do not 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.860
 you're surprised not gay talk about things 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.830
 but also and it happened to me it's you 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.020
 see a morning something 7 2 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.260
 for example two or even three things 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.080
 which is displayed here so 3 you 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.610
 look at the driver here or the version and 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.800
 you take the most recent and after 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.150
 you're updating the task for us the 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.220
 prove finished you click on it 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.209
 so under the change my an error on 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.530
 my pc I could not installed here that 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:32.670
 I can not use 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:37.980
 it's a shame I feel so I 'm waiting 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.540
 a little bit of which I still remember a 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.100
 it's really important to win 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:49.850
 to keep from boots because door 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:52.290
 performance on a computer was not 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.230
 if not this case on the site of which I show 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.790
 a little bit our chances among them you 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.370
 have a welcome instructor but 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.440
 treiber which m I think you have 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.610
 a lot of things you have tracks 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.170
 and asus all that is then in my 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.400
 ben drivers I do not really have too much 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.790
 things to change 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.500
 here you are here if ever it's not 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.450
 nice system that selects and who 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.150
 shows if you choose me it's 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.280
 wet of 7.64 to know the system 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.250
 that you got started 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:33.940
 computer property and the hune 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:37.790
 windows 7 devices it's a bit like 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.990
 you have to arrive so you do that 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.990
 it's not necessarily the same for you 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:47.200
 but on a version and windows software 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:50.540
 who will open two next yes next 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:54.650
 the health program and most of the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.450
 time he will ask you for a restart 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.800
 you do it later 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:06.230
 colors and for that going it will allow you 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:10.430
 so put one will tell your pc me I 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.900
 will see also an importance and monday 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.180
 its performance updated but it's 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.670
 rather to know its index pretty much 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:22.460
 knowing it's going from 1.0 to 7.9 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.720
 so sometimes it's not necessary to 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.760
 download last drive the man and me 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.520
 I do it especially why by 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.630
 example if it's not important for all 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.000
 but I know I had problems 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.710
 current last pallet and 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.780
 shot now thrown every smoke there 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.640
 there is no update posted so 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.170
 here is this video is over I hope 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.060
 that she will have pleased you and you will have to 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.890
 help do not hesitate to come and subscribe 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.730
 to my channel but too young young people 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.560
