00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:12.769
 Hello Tsuchiya of ping-pong kids of the world rubber market partners 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:19.099
 Everyone's this theme is stop receive the doubles Saab opponent players 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:21.500
 When it turns out that it is the rotation which turned out, there are many people who hit it safely and hit it back 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:28.350
 Is not there 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:32.800
 It is not tied to the score unless it disturbs the other party by devising any receive 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:37.030
 This time, as the assumption the receive of doubles 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:43.130
 stop I will practice receiving 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:50.220
 You can break the other party's receive by doing this exercise 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:53.190
 It is important to destroy the other party's receive and prospects and take away freedom 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:58.430
 Once you break the flow 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.329
 The match will be brought to you advantageously 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:07.330
 Let's wear by learning a stop receive 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:12.400
 In describes the three points of the stop Receive 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:17.890
 First, when it is judged to have been issued a serve of rotation opponent players were 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:23.460
 Since the pre-feeling is not to stop receive the opponent's serve 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.510
 The racket is at first 30 degrees when it turns out 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.430
 Just here 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.430
 We prepared model of 30 degrees 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:38.320
 If you think your partner's serve has come out 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:41.110
 Let's make an angle of 30 degrees first if we confirm that it is the first rotation 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.520
 This is the first point of 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:49.820
 The second point 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:56.810
 After making an angle of 30 Â°, first read the orbit of the other party's serve 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.280
 At a 30 degree angle to ambush on the extension of the ball going out after serving 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.610
 Let's invade 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:08.890
 Ball rather than come out suddenly when the came is important balls that are pre-waiting 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.819
 It is important to wait for where you came out and wait 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.959
 It is the third point 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.959
 The third point of the 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.670
 stop say and receive is not going to cut from their rotation of the opponent's ball 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:28.420
 I will use the ball to return 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:34.030
 The rubber and the ball use the force of the opponent's downward rotation instead of forcing them to rub from themselves 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:39.569
 Use a system that flies to the port of the other party when it contacts 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:45.389
 Because this place is very important, let's be careful about how to touch the ball 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.889
 In the case of the player who says that the opponent's ball is particularly broken, if you level the racket a little 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:51.330
 May be good 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:56.100
 First of all in practice it is important to practice at 30 degrees 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.370
 Please see the video actually 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.370
 eh 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.970
 It was with Tei 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.719
 You have 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.930
 And 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.910
 had 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.910
 1 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.700
 North 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.310
 It has been 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.740
 Bach 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.030
 top 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.139
 It is a summary of this practice 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.310
 stop say and receive the 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:29.930
 It is also the basic technology of Tsutsuki 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:32.610
 In real battle, stop when you do this tsutsuki and make a long ball on the sea bass base or a short ball 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:38.310
 You also king called made or the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.000
 First of all, because it is a stop receive , how to stop the ball using the rotation made by the other party 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.720
 Can be 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.320
 Let's practice a lot 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:50.750
 Long and short of the ball that the opponent can not predict 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:55.260
 Stop receive is effective in the first thing to shorten 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:58.240
 The amount of ball rotation also varies depending on the opponent's player 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.160
 By catching the ball well 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:09.180
 stop You can decide whether you can or can not receive 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:15.240
 By practicing with many practice opponents, you will be better at processing such as balls with peculiarities 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.190
 We think that it is good to be able to gain experience and return ball with high success rate by repeating the number of times 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:23.729
 I will 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:26.659
 Especially when stopping the ball, make an effort to return the ball conscious of the amount of rotation of the ball 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.659
 Thank you very much
