beauties if you just pan down here Pete
and<00:00:23.680> if<00:00:23.830> you<00:00:23.890> can<00:00:24.040> see<00:00:24.190> this<00:00:24.400> but<00:00:25.210> what<00:00:26.200> is<00:00:26.289> it

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
and if you can see this but what is it

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.870 
and if you can see this but what is it
Klingon<00:00:26.680> well<00:00:26.800> basically<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.280> is<00:00:27.340> used<00:00:27.640> for

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
Klingon well basically it is used for

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.570 
Klingon well basically it is used for
securing<00:00:28.390> things<00:00:28.690> like<00:00:29.100> tarpaulins<00:00:30.100> or

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
securing things like tarpaulins or

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.549 
securing things like tarpaulins or
Poncho's<00:00:31.450> if<00:00:31.630> you<00:00:31.720> want<00:00:31.900> to<00:00:31.960> put<00:00:32.110> on<00:00:32.200> an<00:00:32.320> extra

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
Poncho's if you want to put on an extra

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.439 
Poncho's if you want to put on an extra
guideline<00:00:33.100> that<00:00:33.730> you<00:00:33.820> can<00:00:33.940> see<00:00:34.120> here<00:00:34.300> this

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
guideline that you can see here this

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.530 
guideline that you can see here this
slides<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.260> out<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:35.770> as<00:00:36.400> it<00:00:36.430> does<00:00:36.700> as<00:00:37.390> it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
slides in and out and as it does as it

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.650 
slides in and out and as it does as it
does<00:00:37.750> so<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:38.400> actually<00:00:39.400> shuts<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:40.450> gate<00:00:42.660> on

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
does so it actually shuts the gate on

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.470 
does so it actually shuts the gate on
the<00:00:44.170> mouth<00:00:44.350> of<00:00:44.590> this<00:00:44.739> Klingon<00:00:45.700> so<00:00:45.940> basically

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
the mouth of this Klingon so basically

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.210 
the mouth of this Klingon so basically
what<00:00:46.690> we<00:00:46.810> do<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.079> we<00:00:47.260> just<00:00:47.500> give<00:00:48.070> you<00:00:48.160> a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
what we do is we just give you a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.650 
what we do is we just give you a
demonstration<00:00:48.430> if<00:00:48.970> this<00:00:49.090> was<00:00:49.239> the<00:00:49.360> material

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
demonstration if this was the material

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.090 
demonstration if this was the material
the<00:00:49.930> poncho<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:51.520> slide<00:00:51.820> that<00:00:52.090> inside<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
the poncho you slide that inside and

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.500 
the poncho you slide that inside and
then<00:00:54.370> you<00:00:54.579> shut<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.390> gate<00:00:56.790> on<00:00:57.790> top<00:00:58.090> of<00:00:58.300> the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
then you shut the gate on top of the

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.580 
then you shut the gate on top of the
piece<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.809> material<00:00:58.930> you're<00:00:59.320> trying<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.620> trap

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
piece of material you're trying to trap

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.010 
piece of material you're trying to trap
like<00:01:02.590> so<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:06.369> take<00:01:07.299> a<00:01:07.329> piece<00:01:07.539> of<00:01:07.689> paracord

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
like so then take a piece of paracord

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.999 
like so then take a piece of paracord
and<00:01:09.149> thread<00:01:10.149> it<00:01:10.299> through<00:01:10.539> now<00:01:11.259> very<00:01:11.979> very

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
and thread it through now very very

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.520 
and thread it through now very very
important<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.609> note<00:01:12.819> that<00:01:12.850> you<00:01:13.119> don't<00:01:13.299> tie<00:01:13.749> the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
important to note that you don't tie the

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.730 
important to note that you don't tie the
paracord<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.689> don't<00:01:16.899> tie<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.229> paracord

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
paracord you don't tie the paracord

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.789 
paracord you don't tie the paracord
close<00:01:18.189> to<00:01:18.999> the<00:01:19.119> Klingon<00:01:19.450> like<00:01:19.689> so<00:01:20.020> otherwise

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
close to the Klingon like so otherwise

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.080 
close to the Klingon like so otherwise
you're<00:01:21.009> not<00:01:21.069> going<00:01:21.249> to<00:01:21.310> be<00:01:21.399> able<00:01:21.459> to<00:01:21.549> do<00:01:21.909> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
you're not going to be able to do the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.029 
you're not going to be able to do the
gate<00:01:22.350> what's<00:01:23.350> important<00:01:23.829> is<00:01:23.889> that<00:01:23.920> you

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
gate what's important is that you

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.319 
gate what's important is that you
actually<00:01:24.219> make<00:01:24.520> sure<00:01:24.670> there's<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:24.969> fairly

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
actually make sure there's a fairly

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.330 
actually make sure there's a fairly
generous<00:01:25.840> loop<00:01:26.049> behind<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.590> Klingon<00:01:27.009> so<00:01:27.189> that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
generous loop behind the Klingon so that

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.279 
generous loop behind the Klingon so that
you<00:01:27.429> can<00:01:27.549> open<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.969> gate<00:01:28.179> and<00:01:28.389> readjust<00:01:29.139> it

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
you can open the gate and readjust it

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.899 
you can open the gate and readjust it
accordingly

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
accordingly

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:41.940 
accordingly
so<00:01:32.279> tie<00:01:33.279> ourselves<00:01:33.429> a<00:01:38.999> generous<00:01:39.999> loop<00:01:40.950> which

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
so tie ourselves a generous loop which

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.469 
so tie ourselves a generous loop which
now<00:01:42.189> obviously<00:01:42.609> still<00:01:42.909> serves<00:01:43.179> its<00:01:43.420> purpose

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
now obviously still serves its purpose

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.690 
now obviously still serves its purpose
but<00:01:46.479> will<00:01:46.689> allow<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.649> gate<00:01:47.950> on<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.340> Klingon

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
but will allow the gate on the Klingon

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.569 
but will allow the gate on the Klingon
to<00:01:48.849> open<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.479> shut<00:01:49.779> accordingly<00:01:50.349> how<00:01:51.310> do<00:01:51.369> we

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
to open and shut accordingly how do we

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.999 
to open and shut accordingly how do we
open<00:01:51.700> it<00:01:51.939> well<00:01:52.349> it<00:01:53.349> may<00:01:53.499> sound<00:01:53.709> as<00:01:53.859> I'm

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
open it well it may sound as I'm

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.980 
open it well it may sound as I'm
teaching<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:54.700> subjects<00:01:55.119> on<00:01:55.329> this<00:01:55.509> but<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
teaching the subjects on this but the

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.859 
teaching the subjects on this but the
way<00:01:56.139> I<00:01:56.169> do<00:01:56.349> is<00:01:56.770> I've<00:01:57.009> turn<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.459> around<00:01:57.779> and<00:01:58.779> I

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
way I do is I've turn it around and I

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.389 
way I do is I've turn it around and I
press<00:01:59.109> down<00:01:59.349> with<00:01:59.380> because<00:01:59.859> I'm<00:01:59.979> right<00:02:00.159> under

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
press down with because I'm right under

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.519 
press down with because I'm right under
the<00:02:00.489> press<00:02:00.700> down<00:02:00.909> with<00:02:00.939> my<00:02:01.239> left<00:02:01.479> thumb<00:02:02.079> inside

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
the press down with my left thumb inside

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:05.339 
the press down with my left thumb inside
and<00:02:02.859> then<00:02:03.459> with<00:02:03.609> my<00:02:03.759> right<00:02:03.999> thumb<00:02:04.329> I<00:02:04.599> just<00:02:05.139> push

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
and then with my right thumb I just push

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:10.800 
and then with my right thumb I just push
it<00:02:05.560> forward<00:02:06.340> like<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:08.849> open<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:09.940> gate<00:02:10.119> as

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
it forward like so and open the gate as

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.440 
it forward like so and open the gate as
you<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:11.170> see<00:02:11.380> there<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.700> loop<00:02:12.910> then<00:02:13.120> allows

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
you can see there the loop then allows

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.200 
you can see there the loop then allows
for<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.930> happen

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.010 

as<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.129> one<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.790> what<00:03:24.030> got<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.270> on<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.450> video

the<00:03:26.940> Klingon<00:03:27.690> would<00:03:27.810> give<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.110> up<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.800> if<00:03:28.890> you

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
the Klingon would give it up but if you

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.180 
the Klingon would give it up but if you
come<00:03:29.099> really<00:03:29.280> close<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.879> peak<00:03:31.010> just<00:03:32.010> in

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
come really close on this peak just in

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.910 
come really close on this peak just in
here<00:03:32.370> getting<00:03:32.910> up<00:03:33.379> you<00:03:34.379> can<00:03:34.530> see<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
here getting up you can see that the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.710 
here getting up you can see that the
actual<00:03:35.160> t-shirt<00:03:35.670> started<00:03:36.150> at<00:03:36.239> Terre<00:03:36.480> hence

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
actual t-shirt started at Terre hence

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.030 
actual t-shirt started at Terre hence
the<00:03:36.870> reason<00:03:36.989> why<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.290> ripped<00:03:37.530> out

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
the reason why I ripped out

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.790 
the reason why I ripped out
so<00:03:38.610> all<00:03:39.209> said<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.569> done<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.959> think<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.380> Klingon

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
so all said and done I think the Klingon

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.100 
so all said and done I think the Klingon
is<00:03:41.040> worth<00:03:41.730> its<00:03:41.940> weight<00:03:42.000> in<00:03:42.209> gold<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.989> it's

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
is worth its weight in gold and it's

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.290 
is worth its weight in gold and it's
certainly<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.800> worthy<00:03:44.130> accessory<00:03:44.970> for<00:03:45.239> your
