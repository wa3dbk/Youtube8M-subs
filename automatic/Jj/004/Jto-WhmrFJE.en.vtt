00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.160
 as 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.160
 in particular 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.460
 these difficulties with Sasha 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.460
 we do not reduce much more 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.679
 and his agent 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.110
 Anatoly Anatolyevich 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 took to master 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.770
 by the way asphalt 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.680
 I think that such 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.680
 what a tactful person a by the end of the summer 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.970
 I am very pleased 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.610
 such a great man 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.600
 we are actually doing this work 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 around the house helps to forget 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.580
 as it should be 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.230
 regionals 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.640
 Pavlyuchenko's novel 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.160
 secondly in the right case 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.370
 but he of course 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.280
 for us is something 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.860
 besides the ideal to which we are all 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.350
 strive for 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.680
 certainly not in terms of external data 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 in terms of that skill 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.000
 however, we are now 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.560
 that's where it's not just using airport charm 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.010
 Yes 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.010
 in china canada 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.010
 but more influence 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.900
 but more on that below
