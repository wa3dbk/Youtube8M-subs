people<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.170> just<00:00:19.439> think<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.040> it's<00:00:20.189> really

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
people but I just think that it's really

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.190 
people but I just think that it's really
pretty<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.750> thing<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.050> would

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
pretty and it's the thing that I would

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.170 
pretty and it's the thing that I would
wear<00:00:22.470> if<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.950> knew<00:00:23.189> how<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.670> makeup<00:00:23.880> when

I<00:01:39.350> didn't<00:01:39.740> conceal<00:01:40.069> because<00:01:40.429> I<00:01:40.460> still<00:01:40.909> have

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
I didn't conceal because I still have

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.669
