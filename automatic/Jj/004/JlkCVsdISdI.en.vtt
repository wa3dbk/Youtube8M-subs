00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.269 

running<00:00:04.310> over<00:00:04.609> top<00:00:05.680> and<00:00:06.680> you<00:00:06.799> can<00:00:06.950> see<00:00:07.129> this

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 
running over top and you can see this

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.760 
running over top and you can see this
actually<00:00:07.669> looks<00:00:07.910> like<00:00:08.180> it's<00:00:08.750> it's<00:00:09.139> cut<00:00:09.500> in

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:09.770 
actually looks like it's it's cut in

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.370 
actually looks like it's it's cut in
there's<00:00:10.580> material<00:00:10.969> thickness<00:00:11.420> and<00:00:12.019> then

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
there's material thickness and then

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.359 
there's material thickness and then
there's<00:00:12.650> that<00:00:12.860> hole<00:00:13.599> in<00:00:14.599> there<00:00:15.309> all<00:00:16.309> right

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
there's that hole in there all right

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.960 
there's that hole in there all right
let's<00:00:16.640> put<00:00:16.880> back<00:00:17.150> our<00:00:17.590> let's<00:00:18.590> Lock<00:00:18.859> this<00:00:18.970> let's

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
let's put back our let's Lock this let's

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.800 
let's put back our let's Lock this let's
put<00:00:20.300> back<00:00:20.539> our<00:00:20.810> mesh

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.930 

so<00:00:27.380> as<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:27.980> can<00:00:28.130> see<00:00:28.190> we<00:00:28.490> have<00:00:28.580> our<00:00:28.610> gradient

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
so as you can see we have our gradient

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.360 
so as you can see we have our gradient
mesh<00:00:29.330> in<00:00:29.510> this<00:00:29.750> material<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.710> two<00:00:30.860> material

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.370 
mesh in this material the two material

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.120 
mesh in this material the two material
so<00:00:31.580> we'll<00:00:31.760> copy<00:00:32.029> paste<00:00:32.690> again<00:00:33.230> we'll<00:00:33.890> combine

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
so we'll copy paste again we'll combine

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.440 
so we'll copy paste again we'll combine
them<00:00:34.580> together<00:00:35.500> expand<00:00:36.500> and<00:00:39.880> what<00:00:40.880> we<00:00:41.030> will<00:00:41.150> do

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
them together expand and what we will do

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
them together expand and what we will do
is<00:00:42.610> we'll<00:00:43.610> select<00:00:43.850> this<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:45.110> can<00:00:45.320> make<00:00:45.440> a

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
is we'll select this it can make a

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.070 
is we'll select this it can make a
little<00:00:45.830> swatch<00:00:46.100> of<00:00:46.130> it<00:00:46.520> here<00:00:46.880> that'll<00:00:47.480> keep

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
little swatch of it here that'll keep

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.360 
little swatch of it here that'll keep
our<00:00:48.320> angle<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.130> our<00:00:50.530> sizing<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.800> you<00:00:52.130> use

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
our angle and our sizing and you use

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.690 
our angle and our sizing and you use
your<00:00:52.700> eyedropper<00:00:53.629> tool<00:00:54.200> with<00:00:54.950> your<00:00:55.190> material

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
your eyedropper tool with your material

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:04.869 
your eyedropper tool with your material
new<00:00:55.910> material<00:00:56.330> selected<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:56.989> there<00:00:57.440> goes<00:01:03.879> all

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
new material selected and there goes all

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:12.970 
new material selected and there goes all
right<00:01:05.030> now<00:01:06.040> again<00:01:07.040> we<00:01:07.340> need<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:09.550> take<00:01:10.550> this<00:01:11.980> all

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
right now again we need to take this all

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.219 
right now again we need to take this all
right<00:01:15.310> there<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:16.460> go

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
right there we go

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.860 
right there we go
so<00:01:18.229> starting<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.590> take<00:01:18.770> shape<00:01:18.800> now<00:01:19.870> let's

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
so starting to take shape now let's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:32.289 
so starting to take shape now let's
perform<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.770> same<00:01:24.820> here<00:01:29.229> black<00:01:30.909> we<00:01:31.909> select

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
perform the same here black we select

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.300 
perform the same here black we select
all<00:01:32.509> of<00:01:32.719> these<00:01:32.930> has<00:01:33.200> changed<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.710> stroke<00:01:34.040> to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
all of these has changed the stroke to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:44.970 
all of these has changed the stroke to
0.25<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.850> material<00:01:41.659> here

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:02:00.000 

get<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:47.660> same<00:01:48.050> red<00:01:49.870> treatment<00:01:50.870> to<00:01:51.080> it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.070
