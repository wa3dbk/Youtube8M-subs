so<00:00:00.420> let's<00:00:00.659> take<00:00:00.900> a<00:00:00.960> quick<00:00:01.500> look<00:00:02.330> and<00:00:03.330> Neptune

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
so let's take a quick look and Neptune

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.070 
so let's take a quick look and Neptune
they<00:00:05.160> include<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.089> reasons<00:00:08.960> so<00:00:09.960> what

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
they include it in reasons so what

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080 
they include it in reasons so what
you're<00:00:10.200> hearing<00:00:10.349> there<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.710> Neptune<00:00:11.610> which<00:00:11.969> is

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
you're hearing there is Neptune which is

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.299 
you're hearing there is Neptune which is
included<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.690> reason<00:00:13.049> seven<00:00:13.410> Neptune<00:00:14.070> as<00:00:14.219> you

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
included in reason seven Neptune as you

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.310 
included in reason seven Neptune as you
can<00:00:14.460> see<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.759> pitch<00:00:15.150> adjuster<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.929> voice

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
can see is a pitch adjuster and voice

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.890 
can see is a pitch adjuster and voice
synth<00:00:17.160> now<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.029> were<00:00:18.150> hearing<00:00:18.359> was<00:00:18.480> an

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
synth now what you were hearing was an

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.529 
synth now what you were hearing was an
extremely<00:00:19.609> affected<00:00:20.609> sound<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.359> can

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
extremely affected sound that you can

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.540 
extremely affected sound that you can
get<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:21.810> Neptune<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.890> Neptune<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.400> can

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
get with Neptune with Neptune you can

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.900 
get with Neptune with Neptune you can
also<00:00:23.760> use<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.840> subtly<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.430> correct<00:00:26.789> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
also use it subtly to just correct the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.419 
also use it subtly to just correct the
notes<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:28.050> singer<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.619> staying<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
notes so your singer is staying in the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.030 
notes so your singer is staying in the
scale<00:00:29.730> without<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> noticeable<00:00:31.320> effect<00:00:31.769> of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
scale without the noticeable effect of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.190 
scale without the noticeable effect of
the<00:00:32.250> auto<00:00:32.820> correction<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> could<00:00:34.170> just

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the auto correction so you could just

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.810 
the auto correction so you could just
turn<00:00:34.500> down<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:34.800> correction<00:00:35.280> speed<00:00:35.520> probably

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
turn down your correction speed probably

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.060 
turn down your correction speed probably
and<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.809> would<00:00:36.960> maybe<00:00:37.170> take<00:00:37.680> down<00:00:37.920> your

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
and you would maybe take down your

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.600 
and you would maybe take down your
kitchens<00:00:39.050> preserve<00:00:40.050> some<00:00:40.379> expression<00:00:41.070> turn

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
kitchens preserve some expression turn

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.840 
kitchens preserve some expression turn
it<00:00:41.730> back<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.660> could<00:00:42.809> turn<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.230> down

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
it back on and I could turn it down

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.240 
it back on and I could turn it down
there<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:44.969> go<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> wouldn't<00:00:46.920> hear

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
there we go and then you wouldn't hear

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.180 
there we go and then you wouldn't hear
so<00:00:47.550> much<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.360> corrections<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.100> can

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
so much of the corrections so as you can

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.189 
so much of the corrections so as you can
see<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.640> change<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.329> scale<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
see you can change your scale so I'm in

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.630 
see you can change your scale so I'm in
a<00:00:52.260> natural<00:00:52.649> minor<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.980> could<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> say<00:00:53.610> O

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
a natural minor I could go to say O

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.720 
a natural minor I could go to say O
mixolydian<00:00:54.620> chromatic<00:00:55.620> major<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.610> got

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
mixolydian chromatic major we got

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
mixolydian chromatic major we got
harmonic<00:00:57.149> minor<00:00:57.270> Dorian<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.680> also<00:00:58.800> do

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
harmonic minor Dorian you can also do

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
harmonic minor Dorian you can also do
like<00:00:59.039> custom<00:00:59.550> scales<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.300> turning<00:01:00.750> notes<00:01:00.930> on

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
like custom scales like turning notes on

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.969 
like custom scales like turning notes on
or<00:01:01.289> off<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.090> Neptune<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.439> change<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
or off so on Neptune you can change the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.560 
or off so on Neptune you can change the
input<00:01:05.280> types<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.850> could<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.360> low

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
input types if you could do to like low

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359 
input types if you could do to like low
frequency<00:01:07.110> input<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.680> there's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
frequency input if there's a lot of

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.359 
frequency input if there's a lot of
vibrato<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.210> live<00:01:09.450> mode<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.100> MIDI<00:01:11.100> mode

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
vibrato you have live mode in MIDI mode

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.420 
vibrato you have live mode in MIDI mode
you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.729> use<00:01:11.970> MIDI<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.630> pitch<00:01:13.260> adjust<00:01:13.770> it's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you can use MIDI to pitch adjust it's

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.030 
you can use MIDI to pitch adjust it's
also<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.760> voice<00:01:15.150> synth<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> voice

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
also a voice synth so with the voice

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
also a voice synth so with the voice
synth<00:01:17.580> feature<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:18.720> Neptune<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
synth feature you can use Neptune as a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
synth feature you can use Neptune as a
harmony<00:01:20.310> processor<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.030> generate

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
harmony processor and generate

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.740 
harmony processor and generate
polyphonic<00:01:22.380> voices<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.909> monophonic

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
polyphonic voices out of a monophonic

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.230 
polyphonic voices out of a monophonic
input<00:01:25.560> signal<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.340> it'd<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.610> sort<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> similar

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
input signal so it'd be sort of similar

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
input signal so it'd be sort of similar
to<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> vocoder<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.189> use<00:01:29.369> Neptune

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
to like a vocoder but if you use Neptune

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.020 
to like a vocoder but if you use Neptune
it<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.119> be<00:01:30.210> more<00:01:30.619> natural<00:01:31.619> more<00:01:32.250> transparent

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
it will be more natural more transparent

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
it will be more natural more transparent
so<00:01:33.210> let's<00:01:33.540> turn<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> him<00:01:34.259> back<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.619> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
so let's turn it up to him back on and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
so let's turn it up to him back on and
then<00:01:35.220> I'll<00:01:35.369> turn<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> correction<00:01:36.329> speed<00:01:36.540> way

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
then I'll turn the correction speed way

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.300 
then I'll turn the correction speed way
up<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.340> turn<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.579> kitchens<00:01:39.270> turn<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.310> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
up and turn up my kitchens turn up the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.210 
up and turn up my kitchens turn up the
correction<00:01:41.759> speed<00:01:42.560> turn<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> way<00:01:43.950> down

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
correction speed turn that way down

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.520 
correction speed turn that way down
serve<00:01:44.850> expressions<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.869> we'll<00:01:46.259> play<00:01:46.409> with

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
serve expressions and we'll play with

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.160 
serve expressions and we'll play with
the<00:01:46.619> formant<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.909> transpose<00:01:48.720> features

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the formant and the transpose features

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.179 
the formant and the transpose features
here's<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.890> major<00:01:50.220> scale<00:01:51.380> here's<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.500> mixolydian

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
here's a major scale here's a mixolydian

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.440 
here's a major scale here's a mixolydian
scale<00:01:54.290> root<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.500> C<00:01:55.890> let<00:01:56.670> me<00:01:56.820> change<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.600> F<00:01:59.450> so

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
scale root in C let me change it to F so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.499 
scale root in C let me change it to F so
I'll<00:02:00.600> go<00:02:00.689> back<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.049> natural<00:02:01.649> minor<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.880> now<00:02:03.450> we

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
I'll go back to natural minor and now we

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.190
