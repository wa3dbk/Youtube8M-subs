00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
on US TV but having that HBO platform

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.510 
on US TV but having that HBO platform
and<00:01:12.780> pairing<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> network<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.920> often<00:01:14.369> as

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and pairing on the network as often as

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.840 
and pairing on the network as often as
he<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:14.909> he's<00:01:15.869> built<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.320> his<00:01:16.500> ratings<00:01:17.009> he's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
he has he's built up his ratings he's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
he has he's built up his ratings he's
built<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.540> his<00:01:19.070> respect<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.880> US<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:22.049> think

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
built up his respect in the US I think

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.710 
built up his respect in the US I think
he's<00:01:22.680> becoming<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.369> better<00:01:23.549> fighter<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.509> what

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
he's becoming a better fighter but what

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.590 
he's becoming a better fighter but what
I<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.680> he's<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.060> spot

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I like is that he's not in just one spot

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.770 
I like is that he's not in just one spot
when<00:01:28.200> his<00:01:28.950> last<00:01:29.159> two<00:01:29.430> fights<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:30.479> was

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
he you do pretty well like 8,000 and the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.520 
he you do pretty well like 8,000 and the
other<00:01:34.890> one<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> wasn't

a big enough venue his fight against

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
a big enough venue his fight against
Marco<00:01:39.720> Antonio<00:01:40.079> Rubio<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> Mexican<00:01:41.130> Mexican

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
because in my opinion looking

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.760
