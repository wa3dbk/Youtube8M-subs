00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.550 
best on and say you're playing solo one
day<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:02.420> do<00:03:02.750> well<00:03:02.930> on<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.140> map<00:03:03.320> you're

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
day and you do well on a map you're

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.500 
day and you do well on a map you're
going<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:03.830> like<00:03:03.980> that<00:03:04.010> map<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.610> if<00:03:04.970> there's<00:03:05.420> a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
going to like that map and if there's a

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.850 
going to like that map and if there's a
map<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.900> can<00:03:06.020> sistent<00:03:06.320> lee<00:03:06.410> do<00:03:06.530> well<00:03:06.710> on

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
map that you can sistent lee do well on

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.140 
map that you can sistent lee do well on
you're<00:03:07.010> going<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.280> like<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.400> map<00:03:07.610> even<00:03:07.760> more

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
you're going to like that map even more

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.570 
you're going to like that map even more
so<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.320> just<00:03:09.530> kind<00:03:09.710> of<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.950> little<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.370> little

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
so it's just kind of a little a little

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.700 
so it's just kind of a little a little
formula<00:03:11.060> for<00:03:11.210> how<00:03:11.300> the<00:03:11.630> mats<00:03:11.840> are<00:03:12.020> created<00:03:12.470> and

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
formula for how the mats are created and

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.800 
formula for how the mats are created and
if<00:03:13.040> you've<00:03:13.700> watched<00:03:14.030> any<00:03:14.240> other<00:03:14.420> videos<00:03:14.780> and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
if you've watched any other videos and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.030 
if you've watched any other videos and
things<00:03:15.230> like<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.380> on<00:03:15.560> college<00:03:15.860> did<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:15.980> go

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
things like that on college did you go

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.710 
things like that on college did you go
is<00:03:16.310> people<00:03:16.580> complaining<00:03:16.940> about<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.240> map<00:03:17.450> size

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
is people complaining about the map size

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.640 
is people complaining about the map size
a<00:03:17.900> lot<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:19.460> know<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:20.270> recognize<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.350> the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
is coming out with the next generation

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.030 
is coming out with the next generation
consoles<00:03:29.990> and<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.380> might<00:03:30.530> make<00:03:30.680> things<00:03:30.710> more

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
consoles and that might make things more

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.130 
consoles and that might make things more
interesting<00:03:31.100> because<00:03:31.870> admirers<00:03:32.870> are<00:03:32.990> going

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
interesting because admirers are going

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.740 
interesting because admirers are going
to<00:03:33.230> have<00:03:33.350> specific<00:03:33.890> 6v6<00:03:34.250> maps<00:03:34.790> like<00:03:35.420> in<00:03:35.570> black

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
to have specific 6v6 maps like in black

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.660 
to have specific 6v6 maps like in black
ops<00:03:35.930> 2<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.230> know<00:03:36.350> like<00:03:36.500> standoff<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.250> cargo

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
ops 2 you know like standoff and cargo

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.460 
ops 2 you know like standoff and cargo
it<00:03:37.940> meant<00:03:38.330> like<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.660> there's<00:03:38.870> but<00:03:39.110> they<00:03:39.410> were

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
it meant like that there's but they were

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.350 
it meant like that there's but they were
designed<00:03:39.860> specifically<00:03:40.400> for<00:03:40.490> 6<00:03:40.760> p-6<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.270> they

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
designed specifically for 6 p-6 and they

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.830 
designed specifically for 6 p-6 and they
were<00:03:41.420> not<00:03:41.630> angry<00:03:42.080> on<00:03:42.230> war<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:43.420> right<00:03:44.420> now<00:03:44.450> all

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
were not angry on war so right now all

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.310 
were not angry on war so right now all
the<00:03:45.050> maps<00:03:45.260> are<00:03:45.590> 6<00:03:46.550> p-6<00:03:46.850> so<00:03:47.330> I'm<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:48.080> kind<00:03:48.200> of

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
the maps are 6 p-6 so I'm just kind of

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.050 
the maps are 6 p-6 so I'm just kind of
curious<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.980> how<00:03:49.430> that's<00:03:49.610> going<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.820> play<00:03:49.910> out

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
curious and how that's going to play out

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.110 
curious and how that's going to play out
because<00:03:50.510> playing<00:03:50.900> like<00:03:51.550> 99<00:03:52.550> ground<00:03:52.850> war<00:03:53.030> on

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
because playing like 99 ground war on

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.060 
because playing like 99 ground war on
strike<00:03:53.420> zone<00:03:53.690> could<00:03:53.930> be<00:03:54.020> pretty<00:03:54.200> crazy<00:03:54.590> or

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
strike zone could be pretty crazy or

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.650 
strike zone could be pretty crazy or
playing<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.610> on<00:03:55.670> this<00:03:55.850> tab<00:03:56.000> evening<00:03:56.330> is<00:03:56.420> this

all the camos put that weapon and the
camera<00:04:11.360> system<00:04:11.690> works<00:04:11.900> similar<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.260> black<00:04:12.410> ops

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
camera system works similar to black ops
