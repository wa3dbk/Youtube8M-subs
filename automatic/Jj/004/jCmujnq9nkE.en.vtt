00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
has a figure 8 polar pattern which means

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
has a figure 8 polar pattern which means
it's<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.699> pick<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.000> sound<00:00:54.300> both<00:00:54.480> in

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
it's going to pick up sound both in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.720 
it's going to pick up sound both in
front<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.230> behind<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.980> microphone<00:00:56.520> and

front and behind the microphone and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.400 
front and behind the microphone and
that's<00:00:57.180> definitely<00:00:57.719> something<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.079> want<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that's definitely something you want to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.869 
that's definitely something you want to
keep<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.739> mind<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:59.370> you're<00:00:59.520> thinking<00:00:59.550> about

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
keep in mind when you're thinking about

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240 
keep in mind when you're thinking about
mic<00:01:00.239> replacement<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.079> also<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> environment

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
mic replacement and also the environment

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.680 
mic replacement and also the environment
that<00:01:02.340> you're<00:01:02.460> recording<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.329> these<00:01:03.449> next

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that you're recording in in these next

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.420 
that you're recording in in these next
examples<00:01:03.870> I'll<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.619> experimenting<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
examples I'll be experimenting with a

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.039 
examples I'll be experimenting with a
couple<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.760> different<00:01:05.880> things<00:01:06.090> firstly<00:01:06.780> we'll

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
couple of different things firstly we'll

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080 
couple of different things firstly we'll
start<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> fairly<00:01:07.979> standard<00:01:08.340> approach<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
start with a fairly standard approach to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.120 
start with a fairly standard approach to
making<00:01:09.330> acoustic<00:01:10.049> guitar<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
making acoustic guitar which is

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890 
making acoustic guitar which is
positioning<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.820> mark<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.210> 10<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.630> 12

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
positioning the mark about 10 to 12

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.050 
positioning the mark about 10 to 12
inches<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> guitar<00:01:13.920> directly<00:01:14.430> pointed

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
inches from the guitar directly pointed

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.630 
inches from the guitar directly pointed
at<00:01:15.270> where<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.720> neck<00:01:15.960> meets<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.619> body<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
at where the neck meets the body and the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
at where the neck meets the body and the
idea<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.540> will<00:01:18.720> give<00:01:18.840> us<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.080> fairly

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
idea here is this will give us a fairly

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
idea here is this will give us a fairly
balanced<00:01:19.860> sound<00:01:20.130> between<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.909> brightness<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
balanced sound between the brightness of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.899 
balanced sound between the brightness of
the<00:01:21.570> strings<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.830> resonance<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
the strings and the resonance of the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
the strings and the resonance of the
guitar<00:01:24.240> body<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> second<00:01:25.710> example<00:01:25.830> I'll

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
guitar body in the second example I'll

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
guitar body in the second example I'll
bring<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> mic<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.240> touch<00:01:27.450> closer<00:01:27.869> about

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
bring the mic in a touch closer about

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.219 
bring the mic in a touch closer about
six<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> eight<00:01:28.860> inches<00:01:29.009> from<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> guitar

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
six to eight inches from the guitar

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.170 
six to eight inches from the guitar
slightly<00:01:31.229> angled<00:01:31.650> across<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.189> body<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
slightly angled across the body and this

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.609 
slightly angled across the body and this
is<00:01:33.240> something<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.900> do<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.229> we're<00:01:34.380> wanting

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
is something we can do if we're wanting

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.469 
is something we can do if we're wanting
a<00:01:34.650> bit<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:34.920> thickness<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.579> bottom<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.210> in

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
a bit more thickness and bottom and in

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.359 
a bit more thickness and bottom and in
the<00:01:36.630> sound<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> microphones<00:01:37.799> capturing

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the sound that the microphones capturing

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.490 
the sound that the microphones capturing
so<00:01:38.640> let's<00:01:39.119> take<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> listen<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.290> what<00:01:40.439> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
so let's take a listen and see what you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:03:01.600 
so let's take a listen and see what you
think

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.490 

hopefully<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.660> was<00:03:02.780> able<00:03:03.050> to<00:03:03.080> give<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.350> a

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
just heard there's a silky quality to

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.330 
just heard there's a silky quality to
the<00:03:12.020> top-end<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.500> this<00:03:12.650> microphone<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.310> I

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
the top-end of this microphone that I

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.550 
the top-end of this microphone that I
really<00:03:13.760> like<00:03:13.970> from<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.960> short<00:03:15.170> tests<00:03:15.410> that

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
really like from the short tests that

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.740 
really like from the short tests that
I've<00:03:15.680> done<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.220> far<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.940> think<00:03:17.030> this<00:03:17.300> mic<00:03:17.510> makes

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.630 
I've done so far I think this mic makes
it<00:03:17.870> quite<00:03:18.140> easy<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.620> get<00:03:18.920> a<00:03:18.950> nice<00:03:19.190> sounding

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
it quite easy to get a nice sounding

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.120 
it quite easy to get a nice sounding
tone<00:03:19.960> before<00:03:20.960> you<00:03:21.110> even<00:03:21.350> get<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:21.830> mixing

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
tone before you even get to the mixing

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.770 
tone before you even get to the mixing
stage<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.700> project<00:03:23.180> which<00:03:23.330> is<00:03:23.510> certainly

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780
