00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
whatever circulated around and as I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.490 
whatever circulated around and as I
think<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.630> plenty<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> room<00:01:10.350> for

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
think there's plenty of room for

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.179 
think there's plenty of room for
multiple<00:01:10.950> people<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.439> he
