time<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.129> me<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.549> maybe<00:01:06.030> try<00:01:06.330> something<00:01:06.720> new

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
time for me to maybe try something new

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.399 
time for me to maybe try something new
so<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.890> thought<00:01:08.189> I'd<00:01:08.280> try<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.490> um<00:01:09.170> what<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> have

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
so I thought I'd try it um what I have

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.740 
so I thought I'd try it um what I have
mine<00:01:10.590> set<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.400> i<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> set<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
mine set to is i have it set about the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.280 
mine set to is i have it set about the
same<00:01:13.140> angle<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:14.369> 9000<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.020> spring

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
same angle as my 9000 on the spring

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.399 
same angle as my 9000 on the spring
tension<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.920> pretty<00:01:17.640> much<00:01:17.880> all<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.720> um

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
tension is pretty much all the way up um

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
tension is pretty much all the way up um
one<00:01:19.799> things<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> made<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> comment<00:01:20.820> with

one things that made the comment with

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.359 
one things that made the comment with
the<00:01:21.060> 9000<00:01:21.630> s<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.780> sometimes<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> take

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the 9000 s are sometimes if you take

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.520 
the 9000 s are sometimes if you take
petals<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.820> put<00:01:24.150> them<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
petals you put them all the way up you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.649 
petals you put them all the way up you
get<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.270> almost<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.409> unbearable<00:01:28.490> resistance

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
get a almost like unbearable resistance

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.460 
get a almost like unbearable resistance
to<00:01:31.100> unbearable<00:01:32.100> resistance<00:01:33.110> while<00:01:34.110> playing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to unbearable resistance while playing

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.910 
to unbearable resistance while playing
and<00:01:34.860> these<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:35.909> seem<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.590> these

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and these don't seem to have it so these

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.660 
and these don't seem to have it so these
are<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.369> way<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:39.920> these<00:01:40.920> are<00:01:41.369> maybe

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
are all the way up on these are maybe

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
are all the way up on these are maybe
about<00:01:41.880> five<00:01:42.240> inches<00:01:42.450> five<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> half<00:01:43.380> inches

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
about five inches five and a half inches

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.800 
about five inches five and a half inches
away<00:01:43.920> from<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.250> head<00:01:44.430> um<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.270> do<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.750> at

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
away from the head um I do have it at

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.679 
away from the head um I do have it at
the<00:01:45.960> pointed<00:01:46.950> part<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:47.460> i<00:01:47.700> probably<00:01:48.270> will

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the pointed part which i probably will

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.660 
the pointed part which i probably will
change<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.189> said<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> haven't

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.169 
have the spring set to the i guess you
could<00:02:04.409> call<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.070> maximum<00:02:05.909> arm<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
could call it the maximum arm so it

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.729 
could call it the maximum arm so it
it'll<00:02:09.179> send<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> pedalboard<00:02:09.869> back<00:02:10.229> as<00:02:10.500> fast

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
it'll send the pedalboard back as fast

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.020 
it'll send the pedalboard back as fast
as<00:02:11.039> possible

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
as possible

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.290 
as possible
um<00:02:14.690> yeah<00:02:15.690> um<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.890> don't<00:02:17.550> really<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:18.000> any<00:02:18.180> real

um yeah um I don't really have any real
stories<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.080> pedal<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.470> don't<00:02:19.650> really

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
stories about this pedal I don't really

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.980 
stories about this pedal I don't really
have<00:02:19.950> anything<00:02:20.130> bad<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> say<00:02:20.640> um<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.959> said

it<00:02:46.680> does<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.130> offset<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:48.570> does<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:48.959> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
it does have the offset it does have the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.280 
it does have the offset it does have the
offset<00:02:49.410> chain<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.950> which<00:02:50.790> actually<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.570> was

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
offset chain on which actually I was

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.780 
offset chain on which actually I was
very<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.890> know<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.040> didn't<00:02:53.310> believe<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.610> I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
very you know I didn't believe that I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.390 
very you know I didn't believe that I
really<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.450> know<00:02:54.480> added<00:02:54.959> some<00:02:55.110> speed<00:02:55.410> and

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
really you know added some speed and

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.620 
really you know added some speed and
power<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.420> really<00:02:57.660> does<00:02:57.989> arm<00:02:59.120> not<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> huge

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
power but it really does arm not a huge

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.910 
power but it really does arm not a huge
huge<00:03:00.840> band<00:03:01.170> fan<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:02.010> longboards<00:03:02.940> I'm<00:03:03.060> sorry<00:03:03.269> um

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
huge band fan of longboards I'm sorry um

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.990 
huge band fan of longboards I'm sorry um
but<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:06.410> i<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.280> these<00:03:08.459> i<00:03:08.519> like<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
but I i really like these i like the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.080 
but I i really like these i like the
heel<00:03:09.209> plate<00:03:09.510> um<00:03:09.950> these<00:03:10.950> are<00:03:11.220> actually<00:03:11.700> unlike

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
heel plate um these are actually unlike

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.310 
heel plate um these are actually unlike
the<00:03:12.269> access<00:03:12.870> arm<00:03:14.510> these<00:03:15.510> are<00:03:15.690> actually<00:03:16.110> easier

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
the access arm these are actually easier

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.000 
the access arm these are actually easier
to<00:03:16.560> control<00:03:16.799> at<00:03:17.070> high<00:03:17.250> speeds<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.799> are<00:03:19.799> from

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
to control at high speeds and are from

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.620 
to control at high speeds and are from
what<00:03:20.130> I've<00:03:20.250> played<00:03:20.549> on<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:20.850> my<00:03:21.030> electric<00:03:21.450> kit

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
what I've played on on my electric kit

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.080 
what I've played on on my electric kit
these<00:03:22.230> are<00:03:22.530> easier<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.220> play<00:03:23.400> high<00:03:23.579> speeds<00:03:23.880> and

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
these are easier to play high speeds and

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.300 
these are easier to play high speeds and
a<00:03:24.329> lot<00:03:24.570> easier<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:25.019> play<00:03:25.290> at<00:03:25.410> slow<00:03:25.650> speeds<00:03:26.070> on

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
a lot easier to play at slow speeds on

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.280 
a lot easier to play at slow speeds on
the<00:03:26.390> Cobra<00:03:27.390> coil<00:03:27.660> which<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:27.989> thought<00:03:28.140> was

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
the Cobra coil which I thought was

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.920 
the Cobra coil which I thought was
actually<00:03:28.650> kind<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:28.920> dumb<00:03:29.190> thing<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.570> really

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
actually kind of a dumb thing it really

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.150 
actually kind of a dumb thing it really
does<00:03:31.170> feel<00:03:31.200> good<00:03:31.500> um<00:03:33.140> I'll<00:03:34.140> put<00:03:34.650> up<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.829> review

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
does feel good um I'll put up a review

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.890 
does feel good um I'll put up a review
on<00:03:35.310> these<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.760> from<00:03:35.970> first<00:03:36.239> glance<00:03:36.630> these

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
on these but from first glance these

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.330 
on these but from first glance these
things<00:03:37.200> seem<00:03:37.890> very<00:03:38.250> well<00:03:38.519> built<00:03:38.760> um<00:03:40.130> not<00:03:41.130> as

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
things seem very well built um not as

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.479 
things seem very well built um not as
well<00:03:41.549> built<00:03:41.850> as<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:43.140> 9000<00:03:43.920> s<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.100> definitely

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
well built as the 9000 s and definitely

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.060 
well built as the 9000 s and definitely
not<00:03:44.730> as<00:03:44.940> well<00:03:45.359> built<00:03:45.630> as<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.140> axis<00:03:46.620> I'm<00:03:46.799> not

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
not as well built as the axis I'm not

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.479 
not as well built as the axis I'm not
very<00:03:47.250> happy<00:03:48.090> with<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.660> plastic<00:03:49.530> washers
