00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.910
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.220
 a canal 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.119
 today, it's about solid state 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.980
 drive or solid state disks ssds 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.900
 I have to admit that I belong to them 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.480
 So far, it has not made much sense in one 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.100
 ssd because I have big ones 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.710
 Hard disks are installed relatively 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.640
 cheap and why a ssd and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.969
 Now I have the step of pure 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.480
 curiosity but dared and give me a cuddle 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.899
 550 added in a 256 gb variant 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.440
 the n550 in short is the successor 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:57.569
 the very popular m 500 you currently 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.780
 for about what lies to me so 70 euro gets 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:03.609
 the l 550 is a lot more expensive 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.370
 but since I have this one for the price 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.100
 Of course, 500 got stapi 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.430
 not the real big difference 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.799
 between these two variants is the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.150
 one of the new generation has one 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:23.050
 increased storage of 240 240 gb of m 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.760
 500 to 256 gigabytes and one 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.190
 theoretical i pay extra 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.850
 theoretical faster read and 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.770
 write speed 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.500
 what is the big advantage of a ssd 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.000
 you can get a ssd like in vienna great 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.350
 So we do not think of usb sticks 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.360
 mechanical components like a 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.710
 normal hdd and thus are the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.420
 Read access times and 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.730
 Write speeds are quite a bit 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.730
 better and that speeds up your system 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.040
 hugely you are watching a ssd benchmark 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.560
 Run in the background how fast the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.060
 n550 works for me wants you 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.820
 Of course not withheld what that 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.480
 whole in practice means as a small one 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.030
 info I have on the ssd windows 8.1 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.010
 installed as a trial and have the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.709
 system was added at boot time and that 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.849
 you can just with your hdd 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.720
 Compare system 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.519
 to make you a picture like 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.050
 you can see the system drives in 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.000
 null commanix high and is ready for use 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.769
 but to you the speed of one 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.380
 system to be able to demonstrate 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.150
 I also installed Battlefield 4 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.760
 will be missing much more known for 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.260
 his long loading times and have 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.450
 just four maps and its 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.150
 Loading times recorded how fast you got 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.459
 could be in the game if you have a ssd 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.599
 owns before I want to show you this 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.290
 However, I have some of you 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.909
 saying goodbye 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.769
 I thank you for watching and 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.930
 wish you much pleasure in the comparison 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.930
 until then at bayern ev
