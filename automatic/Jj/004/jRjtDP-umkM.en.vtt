00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.699
 raft wood tray for your 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.699
 pets the book them breast or dolls 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.300
 two square raft wood materials 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.190
 A rectangle of wood balsa glue 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.190
 for wood and a toothpick 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.840
 here as you can see we have the pets 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.540
 of the books of spite we have a 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.990
 kitten or an iguana a puppy and also 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.560
 we have a chick as well as a 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.890
 pure puppy as you can see here what 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.659
 Let's do today is a little tray for 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.360
 our chick so that our 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.990
 chick can eat in the tray and 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.300
 let's do it using balsa wood 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.159
 which is a wood that is sold in the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.800
 craft stores is a way 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.750
 fine and can also be found 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.750
 at hardware stores and other stores 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.290
 let's use two squares and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.750
 also a rectangle and squares 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.390
 they can be resized depending 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.850
 of so that they are going to use the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.299
 tray for either a doll or for 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.280
 your pet tell them breast I will put a 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.950
 little bit of glue in this container 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.299
 so I can work much easier with 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.299
 the glue and with the wood 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.630
 step number 1 put some glue 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.700
 on the edge of the rectangle 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.700
 do this on both sides 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:40.500
 step number 2 put the squares in 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.500
 each edge 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.640
 step number 3 let the tray dry 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.640
 a flat surface 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.880
 step number 4 paint the tray you 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.370
 You can use porfi paint and also 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.010
 tempera paint but in this case I 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.410
 I'm going to use a nail polish to 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.410
 so the tray lasts much longer 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.769
 I hope you liked our video 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.489

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.489
 goodbye
