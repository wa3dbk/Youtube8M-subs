00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
reached the point where we passed

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.960 
reached the point where we passed
inspection<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.590> we're<00:01:15.860> kind<00:01:16.100> of<00:01:16.220> organizing

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
inspection and we're kind of organizing

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.630 
inspection and we're kind of organizing
things<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.890> finally<00:01:18.890> think<00:01:19.220> we've<00:01:19.400> come<00:01:19.610> up

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
things and finally think we've come up

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.120 
things and finally think we've come up
with<00:01:19.850> an<00:01:19.940> idea<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.300> use<00:01:21.020> all<00:01:21.290> these<00:01:21.500> excess

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
with an idea to use all these excess

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.620 
with an idea to use all these excess
cinder<00:01:22.520> blocks<00:01:22.730> at<00:01:23.030> least<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.510> know

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
cinder blocks at least you know

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.870 
cinder blocks at least you know
temporarily<00:01:24.250> what<00:01:25.250> probably<00:01:25.460> going<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.670> do<00:01:25.760> is

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
temporarily what probably going to do is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.460 
temporarily what probably going to do is
start<00:01:26.180> moving<00:01:27.020> them<00:01:27.520> under<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.440> under<00:01:30.440> the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
start moving them under the under the

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.360 
start moving them under the under the
shed<00:01:31.130> here<00:01:31.550> and<00:01:32.290> maybe<00:01:33.290> build<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.770> makeshift

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
shed here and maybe build a makeshift

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.370 
shed here and maybe build a makeshift
foundation<00:01:35.060> wall<00:01:35.240> it's<00:01:35.510> only<00:01:35.690> temporary

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
foundation wall it's only temporary

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.810 
foundation wall it's only temporary
you<00:01:36.620> know<00:01:36.710> we're<00:01:36.830> not<00:01:36.950> going<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.100> use<00:01:37.160> concrete

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
you know we're not going to use concrete

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.160 
you know we're not going to use concrete
and<00:01:38.000> make<00:01:38.120> it<00:01:38.270> permanent<00:01:38.480> because<00:01:38.900> we're

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
and make it permanent because we're

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.390 
and make it permanent because we're
thinking<00:01:39.350> we're<00:01:39.620> going<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.770> use<00:01:39.920> these<00:01:40.130> bricks

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
thinking we're going to use these bricks

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.310 
thinking we're going to use these bricks
later<00:01:40.640> on<00:01:40.880> but<00:01:41.150> just<00:01:41.360> get<00:01:41.990> them<00:01:42.080> out<00:01:42.170> of<00:01:42.260> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
later on but just get them out of the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.140 
later on but just get them out of the
way<00:01:42.440> we're<00:01:42.740> thinking<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:43.160> just<00:01:43.880> kind<00:01:44.090> of

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
way we're thinking of just kind of

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.910 
way we're thinking of just kind of
lining<00:01:44.450> them<00:01:44.540> up<00:01:44.630> along<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.650> know<00:01:45.800> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
lining them up along the you know the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.090 
lining them up along the you know the
posts<00:01:46.310> here<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.700> making<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.680> yeah<00:01:48.680> just<00:01:48.920> a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
posts here and making a yeah just a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.760 
posts here and making a yeah just a
temporary<00:01:50.030> wall<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:50.960> we'll<00:01:51.320> see<00:01:51.560> how<00:01:51.710> that

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
temporary wall so we'll see how that

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.580 
temporary wall so we'll see how that
goes<00:01:52.000> well<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.360> was<00:01:53.810> able<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.020> get<00:01:54.140> rid<00:01:54.320> of<00:01:54.350> one

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
goes well I was able to get rid of one

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.570 
goes well I was able to get rid of one
pallet<00:01:56.710> guess<00:01:57.710> that<00:01:57.890> other<00:01:57.980> pallet<00:01:58.340> I'll<00:01:58.430> just

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
pallet guess that other pallet I'll just

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.790 
pallet guess that other pallet I'll just
have<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.850> sit<00:01:59.030> there<00:01:59.270> until<00:01:59.450> we

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800
