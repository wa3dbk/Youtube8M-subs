are exiting these would be the locations

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.700 
are exiting these would be the locations
where<00:00:16.190> you<00:00:16.219> find<00:00:16.670> the<00:00:17.570> sensory<00:00:18.080> structures

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
where you find the sensory structures

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.950 
where you find the sensory structures
which<00:00:19.400> are<00:00:19.580> responsible<00:00:19.910> for<00:00:20.269> detecting

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
which are responsible for detecting

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.279 
which are responsible for detecting
linear<00:00:21.289> acceleration<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:23.720> position<00:00:24.169> of

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
linear acceleration and the position of

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
membranous labyrinth where it's colored

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.350 
membranous labyrinth where it's colored
pink<00:00:30.199> in<00:00:30.380> this<00:00:30.589> model<00:00:30.980> you<00:00:31.579> would<00:00:31.699> find<00:00:32.029> a

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
pink in this model you would find a

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.529 
pink in this model you would find a
fluid<00:00:32.990> called<00:00:33.710> perilymph<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.969> perilymph

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
fluid called perilymph the perilymph

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.310 
fluid called perilymph the perilymph
is<00:00:35.629> very<00:00:36.140> similar<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:36.640> cerebrospinal<00:00:37.640> fluid

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
is very similar to cerebrospinal fluid

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.840 
is very similar to cerebrospinal fluid
it<00:00:39.320> has<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.559> higher<00:00:39.860> concentration<00:00:40.160> of<00:00:40.640> sodium

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
it has a higher concentration of sodium

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.330 
it has a higher concentration of sodium
than<00:00:41.210> potassium<00:00:41.780> inside<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:43.039> membranous

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
than potassium inside the membranous

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.459 
than potassium inside the membranous
labyrinth<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:44.090> would<00:00:44.600> find<00:00:44.840> a<00:00:45.109> different

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
labyrinth you would find a different

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.560 
labyrinth you would find a different
kind<00:00:45.649> of<00:00:45.739> fluid<00:00:46.070> called<00:00:46.340> endolymph<00:00:46.550> and<00:00:47.390> the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
kind of fluid called endolymph and the

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.540 
kind of fluid called endolymph and the
endo<00:00:47.899> lymph<00:00:48.199> contains<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.340> higher

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
endo lymph contains a higher

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.849 
endo lymph contains a higher
concentration<00:00:49.820> of<00:00:50.390> potassium<00:00:50.829> than<00:00:51.829> sodium

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
concentration of potassium than sodium

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.410 
concentration of potassium than sodium
and<00:00:52.609> so<00:00:53.449> for<00:00:53.690> this<00:00:53.809> reason<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:54.410> is<00:00:54.469> similar

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
and so for this reason it is similar

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.810 
and so for this reason it is similar
composition<00:00:56.420> to<00:00:56.840> what<00:00:57.410> is<00:00:57.530> found<00:00:58.100> inside<00:00:58.370> the

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
composition to what is found inside the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.840 
composition to what is found inside the
settle<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.989> endolymphatic<00:01:00.679> fluid<00:01:01.370> is<00:01:01.609> going

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
settle the endolymphatic fluid is going

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.270 
settle the endolymphatic fluid is going
to<00:01:01.969> be<00:01:02.030> produced<00:01:02.449> by<00:01:03.440> cells<00:01:03.739> in<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.100> cochlea

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
to be produced by cells in the cochlea

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.660 
to be produced by cells in the cochlea
and<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:05.870> going<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.080> be<00:01:06.170> drained<00:01:06.530> from<00:01:07.040> the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
and it is going to be drained from the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.760 
and it is going to be drained from the
memories<00:01:08.120> labyrinth<00:01:08.540> by<00:01:08.750> way<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.020> a
