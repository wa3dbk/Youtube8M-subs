00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 let's see here says one of the temperatures 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:12.719
 cooler was recorded in Antarctic 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:17.279
 minus 128 degrees fahrenheit and one of the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.150
 warmer temperatures was 134 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.910
 degrees fahrenheit this was in the valley 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.330
 of death california then the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.640
 question is how many degrees of difference 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.480
 there is between the coldest temperature and the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.899
 hotter thinking about this a little bit what 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.610
 what I will do is place a number line 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:42.360
 vertical to look like a thermometer 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.879
 and here we go to because we are talking 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.850
 of temperature then here I'm going to put 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.789
 the vertical number line and more or less 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.920
 over here will be 0 0 degrees fahrenheit 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.230
 which is not very relevant because if 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.120
 were degrees celsius we would be 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.870
 freezing but in this case in 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.480
 fahrenheit 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.000
 the freezing happens until 32 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.830
 degrees then let's say that there is 0 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.350
 degrees fahrenheit and what I'm going to do 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.990
 is to place 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.420
 in these points on the number line 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.030
 vertical now here it says that the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.420
 coldest temperature was minus 128 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.350
 degrees fahrenheit that would be pretty much 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.549
 over here and let's say that one of the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.789
 warmer temperatures was 134 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.340
 degrees that is more or less around here is 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.560
 a positive number and now well when 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.630
 they ask us for the difference between the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.909
 coldest temperature and the hottest 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.929
 what they are essentially asking us 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.240
 is what is the distance there 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.950
 here how much does this distance between the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.830
 coldest temperature and the hottest 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.340
 there are several ways of thinking about this one 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.409
 of them is to start in the coldest and 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.050
 you climb up to the hottest then 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.240
 do you think how much should I add or can you 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.850
 think about the difference between the 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 coldest and the hottest so 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.509
 you can take the higher number than in this 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.470
 case is 134 and this subtracts is the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.300
 fewer then we will subtract 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.220
 128 negatives 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.140
 minus 128 and with this we will know which is the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.140
 difference between these two 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.910
 ajam numbers and it will be a positive number 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.520
 because we are subtracting the number 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.280
 greater the smaller number and this will give you 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.590
 exactly this distance now there is 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.830
 different ways of doing this the 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.470
 first we would know that if we subtract a 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.500
 negative number this is the same as 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.790
 add the positive then what I want 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:52.570
 to say with this is that this here is 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:56.020
 exactly the same as 134 plus 128 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.120
 and why this happens notes that 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.470
 we want we want to know this distance 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:08.110
 true then at this distance is what 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.540
 same as 134 this distance 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:19.019
 what I'm marking here 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:22.260
 134 plus this other distance from 0 to 128 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.750
 and adding these two distances the rose and 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.629
 the green we have the total distance the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.909
 which is what they are asking us 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.840
 that we simply add those two 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:37.340
 distances and we have the answer 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:42.560
 and now it comes 134 minus minus 128 is 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:46.550
 equal to 134 plus 128 which is the same 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.530
 this here is the same I will put here 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.550
 this is just as in fact what I'm going to do to 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:04:00.210
 each part 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:04.350
 and I put here 134 128 plus 128 this is 84 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.710
 is equal to 12 one plus three plus two is 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.070
 equal to six and two plus two equals 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.360
 two 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.730
 the answer is 262 degrees fahrenheit 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.769
 so how many degrees of difference are there 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:22.430
 between the coldest temperature and the most 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.430
 warm are 262 degrees fahrenheit
