00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
we're going to be learning how to do

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.079 
we're going to be learning how to do
today<00:00:54.609> on<00:00:55.120> your<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.569> swords<00:00:55.899> we<00:00:56.019> exit<00:00:56.530> see<00:00:56.679> is

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
today on your the swords we exit see is

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.819 
today on your the swords we exit see is
we're<00:00:58.089> going<00:00:58.179> to<00:00:58.239> create<00:00:58.569> a<00:00:58.899> kill<00:00:59.319> counter

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
we're going to create a kill counter

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.410 
we're going to create a kill counter
using<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.850> scoreboard<00:01:01.329> system<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:03.269> you<00:01:04.269> can

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
using the scoreboard system now you can

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.960 
using the scoreboard system now you can
pause<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.290> video<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:06.460> know<00:01:06.550> write<00:01:06.760> down

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
pause the video to you know write down

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.210 
pause the video to you know write down
this<00:01:07.180> but<00:01:07.450> I'll<00:01:07.780> try<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.200> remember<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.620> put<00:01:08.950> all

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
this but I'll try to remember to put all

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.149 
this but I'll try to remember to put all
the<00:01:09.640> text<00:01:10.030> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.320> video<00:01:11.530> description<00:01:11.649> down

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
the text in the video description down

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.899 
the text in the video description down
below<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:14.140> can<00:01:14.170> just<00:01:14.320> copy<00:01:14.619> paste<00:01:15.009> and<00:01:15.340> you

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
below so you can just copy paste and you

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.149 
below so you can just copy paste and you
can<00:01:16.030> mess<00:01:16.149> around<00:01:16.180> with<00:01:16.689> it<00:01:16.869> so<00:01:17.530> what<00:01:18.040> this

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
can mess around with it so what this

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.999 
can mess around with it so what this
first<00:01:19.890> command<00:01:20.890> does<00:01:21.189> is<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:23.049> creates<00:01:23.649> a

first command does is it creates a
scoreboard<00:01:24.610> objective<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:26.950> command

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
scoreboard objective now this command

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.700 
scoreboard objective now this command
starts<00:01:28.060> with<00:01:28.299> scoreboard<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:29.259> start<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.680> game

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
starts with scoreboard to start the game

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
sometimes you see it when you first set

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.350 
sometimes you see it when you first set
it<00:03:37.620> up<00:03:37.830> sometimes<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.400> don't<00:03:38.580> until<00:03:39.060> it

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
it up sometimes you don't until it

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.090 
it up sometimes you don't until it
actually<00:03:39.390> has<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:39.990> number<00:03:40.350> in<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.650> right<00:03:41.040> now

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
actually has a number in it right now

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.600 
actually has a number in it right now
it's<00:03:41.430> set<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.000> zero<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.020> let<00:03:43.890> me<00:03:43.980> show<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.190> I've

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
got a paper here and we don't like

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.620 
got a paper here and we don't like
creepers<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.820> we're<00:03:47.940> going<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.150> kill<00:03:48.330> them<00:03:48.420> and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
creepers so we're going to kill them and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.600 
creepers so we're going to kill them and
as<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.740> can<00:03:49.890> see<00:03:49.920> over<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.030> side<00:03:51.209> here<00:03:52.610> my

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
as you can see over on the side here my

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.350 
as you can see over on the side here my
kill<00:03:53.850> count<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.420> set<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.230> 1<00:03:55.760> now<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:57.150> also

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
kill count is set to 1 now this also

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.040 
kill count is set to 1 now this also
works<00:03:57.600> for<00:03:58.160> chickens<00:03:59.160> as<00:03:59.820> you<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.600> see<00:04:00.720> it's

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
works for chickens as you can see it's

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.290 
works for chickens as you can see it's
now<00:04:01.200> incremented<00:04:01.770> 22<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.120> some

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
now incremented 22 and I have some

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.120 
now incremented 22 and I have some
chicken<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.280> it<00:04:05.280> also<00:04:05.459> works<00:04:05.760> for<00:04:05.940> villagers

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
chicken and it also works for villagers

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.640 
chicken and it also works for villagers
so<00:04:08.130> it'll<00:04:08.490> work<00:04:08.610> for<00:04:08.820> all<00:04:09.360> animals<00:04:09.720> villagers

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
so it'll work for all animals villagers

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.380 
so it'll work for all animals villagers
and<00:04:10.950> all<00:04:11.400> different<00:04:11.670> kinds<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.940> mobs<00:04:12.180> it

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
and all different kinds of mobs it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.150 
and all different kinds of mobs it
doesn't<00:04:12.690> differentiate<00:04:13.140> between<00:04:13.440> hostile

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
doesn't differentiate between hostile

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.180 
doesn't differentiate between hostile
and<00:04:14.370> regular<00:04:15.020> it<00:04:16.020> basically<00:04:16.200> just<00:04:16.440> counts<00:04:17.100> how

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
and regular it basically just counts how

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.120 
and regular it basically just counts how
much<00:04:17.459> of<00:04:17.580> a<00:04:17.670> mass<00:04:17.820> murderer<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.450> are<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:19.130> then

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
much of a mass murderer you are and then

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.860 
much of a mass murderer you are and then
this<00:04:20.370> final

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.950 

command<00:04:24.870> here<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.490> again<00:04:26.490> it's<00:04:27.210> calling<00:04:27.870> the

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
command here is again it's calling the

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.200 
command here is again it's calling the
scoreboard<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:29.700> has<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.940> do<00:04:30.060> with

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
scoreboard and it has to do with

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.920 
scoreboard and it has to do with
objectives<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.350> we're<00:04:32.310> going<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.490> remove<00:04:32.930> the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
objectives and we're going to remove the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.420 
objectives and we're going to remove the
objective<00:04:34.590> called<00:04:34.860> kills<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:38.250> just

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
objective called kills and it just

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.610 
objective called kills and it just
removed<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.150> as<00:04:39.390> you<00:04:39.510> can<00:04:39.630> see<00:04:39.840> it's<00:04:40.350> gone

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
removed it so as you can see it's gone

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.640 
removed it so as you can see it's gone
and<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.550> didn't<00:04:41.820> just<00:04:41.850> set<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:42.630> zero<00:04:42.840> it's

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
and it didn't just set it to zero it's
