00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 well we are here in the part of the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.719
 worst of career and to ride them 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.450
 first we will be assembling the ones that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.490
 I already have them assembled but we spent so 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.470
 simple you can go back to making cáceres and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.119
 as in fact 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 the first ones we need is going to be 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.930
 sampling 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.930
 our end of career here 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.650
 that I have it 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.390
 working 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:37.050
 and what I have done has been to catch them 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.890
 of a measure so that in a very 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 big very small 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.120
 probably do not enter us for the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.080
 holes between breasts in the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.330
 party so I think this has been 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.360
 first enlarge the piece because of 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.640
 Metric 3 is rare to find the ones in 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.250
 little ones that is that it is to enlarge a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.040
 little because they were meant and because 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.150
 I risked breaking them but I was looking 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.640
 it went well and it arrived 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.040
 good at what this has been to put it 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.320
 here over and once you put them 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.370
 over I have placed on the screw 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.140
 this 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:21.230
 this would be your hole let's say original 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.880
 this one here is because I did it like 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.510
 it does it then it is placed first is the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.450
 screw is placed when more or less 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:34.010
 straight and if the second a small mark 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.770
 with a regulator or with a screwdriver 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.260
 putting pressure on and we need the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.470
 mark then the little first hole 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.840
 with a screwdriver to have the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.580
 brand and once it's there 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.260
 because I bark less then you can go 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:55.290
 lowering everything and good get off quero 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:59.640
 and screws are put to the shit 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:04.090
 to end of career plastic nut and so 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.509
 with everyone until we have these 3 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:15.040
 leave the cables a little long because 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:18.450
 it's amazing but good the finger 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.450
 the one of the pp 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.109
 in a good position to teach it 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.109
 ah 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:38.560
 the first of the army look here 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:41.610
 right here neither here nor there nor so 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.610
 because here we have all the whole 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.140
 electronics 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.240
 so 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:56.990
 the cushions on spears and outside 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.990
 better for inside and there it stays 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.230
 that is to place and then more 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:06.310
 quiet and I will continue to teach a 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.980
 collector then we go to the negative 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.230
 from vélez 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.880
 let's first be in the libero axis 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.170
 which is this 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.170
 and it's OK 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.720
 valera 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:35.780
 we choose another 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.780
 another arrogant and we place it 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.780
 the idea is and 4 in gasteiz do not do it 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.310
 very very 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:51.220
 very closed and protrusions and screws 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.130
 the idea is against the four more of 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:00.989
 those counted of jewels and you can go 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.989
 regulating will be able to see better 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.800
 now 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.200
 to her be pretty 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.290
 what is to put sport in the part of 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.920
 back on this side and the tourist to 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.920
 what are we 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.210
 and it's placed here 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.170
 So when I used to back them 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.120
 his face 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.420
 this post and throw it to and the penis 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.420
 the joint 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.820
 the mechanism that the square is made of wood 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.810
 and backwards and blogs 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.260
 we are rotating for ai qing strip for 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:51.160
 back description is then he will know 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.160
 that this is the axis 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.629
 it's worth now finally is the axis of the 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.340
 x 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:06.230
 the negative 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.230
 so we arrived at the furniture 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.550
 and it's going now 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:23.240
 the s x so is this 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.210
 but this is the negative is in the part 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.759
 left taking as point of 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.949
 reference in which the engine yo and 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:34.759
 also of laso meters fife I have it 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:38.539
 I have it in front you can place it behind 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:39.979
 but I see it a community would be 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.039
 place it from behind because it bothers you 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.669
 but I like what they were placing 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.669
 in front of 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.949
 good as energy but ahead because 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.240
 I like to see how the 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:06:01.020
 consumption of belts and others 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.290
 and good 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.290
 as you wish 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.880
 all the design because this is free 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.880
 do not 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:20.849
 yes, if you enter then you are going to 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:25.280
 see why we can improve 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.280
 now even that if one 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.540
 free to do something that was days and 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.680
 also the bar 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:38.820
 from above we could use all of them with 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.820
 easy that information 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:45.840
 as well as sharing the tasks 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:50.970
 leaving in new companies far away 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:55.520
 who have had it and other rolls live it 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:59.449
 explained the last last 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:02.629
 the end of the race for this side 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:05.349
 unfold me as the day of the people and 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:05.349
 I'm going to dress the suit 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.930
 they are placed here 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:21.849
 any medium artist then like this 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:21.849
 when they are passing games when you go to 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:32.080
 the s 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:33.849
 Well, if you do it, you can stop by here 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.120
 and well I'm going to see for 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:40.770
 explain how to place your site as 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.810
 he was as he was armed let's say 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.759
 Isabel must mainly be placed 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.870
 after since 6 thanks for these things 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:48.360
 yours 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:51.660
 I'm going to express here for example it's not going to 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:57.210
 go because I would like 

00:07:51.660 --> 00:08:01.860
 do not leave us company for nothing 

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:05.090
 and well then the idea and opening and 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:10.669
 place them like this 

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:14.530
 after the video and with the blog if 

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:14.530
 you want and good until another
