00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
the expressive teacher that he was and I

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
have to tell you listening back to these

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.300 
have to tell you listening back to these
recordings<00:04:14.850> years<00:04:15.850> later<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.890> was<00:04:17.979> really<00:04:18.280> a

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
recordings years later it was really a

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.990 
recordings years later it was really a
very<00:04:18.430> moving<00:04:19.209> experience<00:04:19.950> because<00:04:20.950> I<00:04:21.280> mean

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
very moving experience because I mean

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.460 
very moving experience because I mean
first<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.300> all<00:04:22.419> it's<00:04:22.750> like<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:23.050> can<00:04:23.229> close<00:04:23.440> my

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
first of all it's like I can close my

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.340 
first of all it's like I can close my
eyes<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.070> I'm<00:04:24.160> back<00:04:24.580> in<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:25.060> room

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
eyes and I'm back in that room

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.860 
eyes and I'm back in that room
with<00:04:25.470> him<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.770> mean<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:25.920> remember<00:04:26.420> where<00:04:27.420> he<00:04:27.720> was

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
with him I mean I remember where he was

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.260 
with him I mean I remember where he was
standing<00:04:28.410> when<00:04:28.860> he<00:04:28.980> said<00:04:29.250> certain<00:04:29.670> things<00:04:29.700> to

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
standing when he said certain things to

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.450 
standing when he said certain things to
me<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.920> it's<00:04:31.920> very<00:04:31.980> vivid<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.920> I<00:04:34.920> really

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
me and it's very vivid so I I really

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.540 
me and it's very vivid so I I really
started<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.420> remember<00:04:37.140> in<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.530> very<00:04:37.560> intense

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
started to remember in a very intense

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.460 
started to remember in a very intense
way<00:04:38.700> all<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.450> things<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.810> he<00:04:39.900> taught<00:04:40.110> me<00:04:40.290> and

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
way all the things that he taught me and

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.690 
way all the things that he taught me and
I<00:04:40.530> started<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.860> think<00:04:40.950> about<00:04:41.310> things<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.580> I

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
I started to think about things that I

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.600 
I started to think about things that I
had<00:04:41.880> forgotten<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.630> was<00:04:43.320> able<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.620> bring<00:04:44.250> back

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
had forgotten and was able to bring back

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.930 
had forgotten and was able to bring back
into<00:04:44.910> my<00:04:45.150> playing<00:04:45.480> again<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:47.400> hope<00:04:47.790> that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
into my playing again and I hope that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.390 
into my playing again and I hope that
you<00:04:48.240> will<00:04:48.600> have<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.810> similar<00:04:49.020> experience

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
you will have a similar experience

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.190 
you will have a similar experience
listening<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.760> these<00:04:50.880> recordings<00:04:51.540> when<00:04:52.110> you

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
listening to these recordings when you

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.080 
listening to these recordings when you
listen<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.650> recordings<00:04:53.130> I<00:04:53.280> do<00:04:53.340> encourage

you to follow along with the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.190 
you to follow along with the
transcriptions<00:04:57.210> because<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.690> can<00:04:57.810> be<00:04:57.900> hard<00:04:58.140> to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
transcriptions because it can be hard to

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.140 
transcriptions because it can be hard to
