 move gives one arrives plus Brazil is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 eliminated and this is a channel and time that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.779
 will be the first challenge 30 videos 30 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.150
 days 16 to 31 and I'll teach you or give 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.550
 a legal freedom for your nexus 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.240
 to teach how to unlock in long 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.079
 how to do ruth and how to install a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.219
 song consoled me marie colvin 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.170
 customized to explain each 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.290
 of these procedures that we are going to do 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.360
 first I'll give you a notion of oil 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.489
 which is every process since I go 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.039
 make a parallel with computers 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.649
 after all, smartphones are 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.219
 pocket computers with the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.280
 phone nowadays you sign it's a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.250
 computer are LicÃ¡ and perhaps 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.190
 cells but speak blond centuries when 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.479
 you turn on your computer it appears 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.330
 loading windows and if you have 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.299
 other operating systems trakking 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.570
 know a little more a computer 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:19.080
 puts two operating systems 13 I know 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.290
 there put windows seven world 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.630
 linux and leaves multiple systems 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.180
 and a contact for you. 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.200
 navigate between these systems 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.960
 operational 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.850
 You need to get in the big blond box. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.820
 most appliances in a book or 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.680
 book you even need to block 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.509
 them so that you can install a 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.360
 11 an operating system or for whom 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 do not know is an operating system 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.229
 customize here is not from the factory 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.439
 Google is not the standard may even be 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.460
 based on google default or other 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.130
 but she is 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.590
 the kick reminds you when you 're 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.360
 installing any software on your 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.369
 a program on your computer 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.340
 He asks you to continue. 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.649
 needs permission from the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.470
 computer administrator because it is a 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.170
 default comes blocked you do 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.989
 some things on the computer more in 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.480
 windows case is much easier simple 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.840
 and that you click 5 and ready you already 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.230
 is acting as an administrator or 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.239
 for you to install for you to modify 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.450
 some things in the systems you do not 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.120
 system you need a permission from 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.760
 administrator and what the Czech 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.090
 it means root you have a 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.430
 permission to access the system root and 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.560
 make any changes you want 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.840
 have access and lastly a song 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.519
 recovery with the song another recovery 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.730
 another layer of your system 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.700
 operating system that allows you to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.459
 and things for her and also allows 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.970
 you do for example how hyper that is 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:03.579
 erase your data allows you to install and 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.739
 you can usually hear that 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.070
 When are you going to install something for the 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.320
 by the feature and is called flash 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.989
 So when someone talks, it flashes. 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.880
 of rudge for his song e commerce 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.340
 So you already know what the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.430
 flash is only you remember that arrow as 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.329
 if you are a flash you install it already comes 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.190
 wrap by default on any wall 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.400
 more is quite limited when you install 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.850
 a song or a personalized one 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.299
 you can do countless things like a 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.329
 backup by influencing the files that 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:44.760
 you want to install modifications install 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:48.989
 new roms even take the device 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.689
 I'll take it, then this is the bass. 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.269
 you need to know before you start 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:55.769
 to all this whole procedure a 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.459
 very important thing makes the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.180
 procedure by placing the risk in its 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.640
 account 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.610
 I'll pass the procedure as it is done. 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.340
 and is tested and approved even because I 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.440
 I testo several times anything I 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.670
 I'll talk in total, this is necessary. 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.690
 much attention and if you escape a step you want 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.269
 a little detail that can go wrong 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:24.240
 can something happen with your love it? 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.060
 then and only becomes quite clear that 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.260
 you're doing you know you 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:35.940
 is doing and the risk is totally yours 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.160
 Ok, you can ask questions about here. 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.919
 comments on youtube is very complicated 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.960
 Best answer any questions you enter the 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.139
 group on Facebook that has a link on 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.620
 description to get you out of doubt 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.020
 you have about it're ok or the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.830
 procedure or any error you may have 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.099
 happened all there in the group can not 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.669
 did not put here who suffers is that I 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:06.570
 I'll show you if it's called nexus cut tuck. 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.780
 it suits any nexus but I go 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.300
 leaving the list may be some 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.289
 any change in business 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:21.780
 out but I believe that most 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:25.800
 90% to 95% of the two devices 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:29.639
 nexus they serve with this tool is 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.780
 a tool of sensation of it and it 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.810
 can 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.860
 ruth for him he may be in a song 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:40.050
 micou it has several commands and and I 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.780
 I think that from every manufacturer of the device 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.620
 should have one and software was 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.770
 developed by a flash and he 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.490
 depends entirely on donations then 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.620
 if you want 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.240
 winter to a little button down the 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.669
 software for you from any 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.470
 work amounts of aid in the car 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.289
 that I'll show you 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.009
 it's almost a magic trick you just 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:07.650
 need to follow some commands that he 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:11.610
 runs software scripts is very 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:14.669
 based on scripts you just speak what 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.710
 You want to do it and he does it all 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.410
 automatically, as if you 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.860
 I was there step by step doing each 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.680
 every thing usually takes it in the 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.319
 script does this automatically is 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.139
 very simple it is very easy to be 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:33.840
 made for any appliance next 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.150
 so come on and you will not forget 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.940
 How about you already clicked I liked it now 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.620
 add to favorites and there at the end 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.900
 you from that shared that we 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.210
 we combined tube than the previous one 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.460
 while I was editing realize that 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.750
 the video was extremely long what 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.270
 is not cool 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.490
 and not to be tiring I'll post 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.159
 to part 2 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.440
 tomorrow then just wait a little 

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:01.500
 that you will already have access to the second 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.199
 part of this video with the tutorial step 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.320
 step for you to do all the concepts 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.580
 which have been explained in practice in your 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.449
 nexus device 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.449
