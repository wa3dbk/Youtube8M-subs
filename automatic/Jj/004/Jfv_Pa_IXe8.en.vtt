 both legs are learning to make a turn for this 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.840
 keep moving with two legs on

 rear pins 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.729
 slide and in the usual position press 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.200
 heels in the board and then turn them 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.380
 using his knees as leverage and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.540
 shoulders for balance Take 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.250
 level stand for turning the main 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.710
 sliding elements 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.350
 are balance the ability to keep weight 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 on the front foot and practice skill 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.390
 slips necessary to drive on 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.820
 harry and go to the new armchair stage 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.400
 armchair 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.960
 scary only green newcomer 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.119
 but if you are already confident on 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.549
 snow then lift just complements your 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.350
 impressions of the movement most 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.110
 Cases required for the front leg 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.210
 remained in the mount and the strap was 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.130
 always dressed on other lifts 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.579
 for example gondolas may be asked to take off 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.860
 snowboard and take it with you make sure 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.040
 what place type lifts and know 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.710
 rules for handling them and slowly 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.060
 drive up to the landing site 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.360
 landing stop most cases 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.660
 there is a stop sign necessary 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.310
 put a snowboard in the center of the mark when 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.080
 front seats fit the landing site 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.670
 in 100 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.700
 you follow him place pointer 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.550
 landing look at the chair and make sure 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.860
 that she is not skewed then the chair 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.080
 get close to you sit on it base 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.000
 while keeping straight until you get off 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.920
 ramps 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.780
 sitting on the chair gently shift the weight 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.160
 body in the back lower the bar 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.750
 safety and enjoy the views 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.760
 ask all your questions 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.090
 lift operator and don't forget that 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.490
 on the mountain, everyone was once new at 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.630
 disembarking from the chair immediately remember all 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.190
 sliding elements raise the bar 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.080
 safety turn the body into 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.230
 direction of the ramp wait for the chair 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.959
 takes you to the landing site when the board 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.530
 securely stand on the ramp install 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.260
 back foot on a snowboard and straighten up with 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.270
 ramps need to drive fast here 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.660
 at the top let's start working out 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.510
 riding and turnaround basics settle down on 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:19.100
 board on a flat surface that will allow 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.230
 delay it from sliding off many 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.239
 snowboarders love to sit on mounts 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.180
 This position allows you to quickly get up and 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:30.019
 move put on the rear mounts and 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.430
 we can begin to work out 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.959
 turns on the front and back repent in 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.130
 both bends are used mechanics 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.150
 upper body rotate the body in 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.030
 direction of rotation 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.500
 bend your knees and relax them 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.500
 it helps control movement 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.360
 let's turn on the rear edge turn 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.760
 performed on the rear edge of the snowboard 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.350
 transfer the weight to the front heel upper 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.530
 part of the body must remain on one 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.580
 lines with the trajectory of the movement of the board 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.870
 keep your knees straight 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.610
 get ready for a turn 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.519
 use your knees to steer 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.269
 snowboarding in turn when entering a turn 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.070
 a snowboard will bend under your weight 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.080
 keep balance this is needed for 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.200
 order to use the whole turn and 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.040
 bend the board if you press on the board 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.920
 fingers but 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.380
 she will ride on the front cante mechanic 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.990
 body remains the same bend your knees 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.060
 relax body is centered 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.250
 bard load on the apron 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.350
 when making a turn, save 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.570
 body balance when stopping technique 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.830
 the same 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.920
 shift the center of gravity to the edge and 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.920
 guide the board perpendicular to the slope 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.840
 remember keep balance on the board and 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.380
 start turning the body in his 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.970
 side bend the knees traverse help 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.330
 control speed and save 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.010
 balance at ending 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:03.320
 if you slow down push 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.090
 the front foot is surely the secret of successful 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.270
 skating is to always ride on 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.040
 turning conti in this position aboard 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.330
 always stable out of it is possible 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.330
 following items
