00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.590
 hi, I'm here with another one 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.540
 part for this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.130
 valentina i have to say that in my opinion 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.520
 this is the prettiest I've done for 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.080
 this year and I particularly like it 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.360
 especially for this effect 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.220
 marble that is made in a very simple way 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.200
 fast it is without water 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.160
 now I leave you the long video tutorial 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.530
 all are bye bye Stefano base now 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.360
 is letting it dry now I take it 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.129
 this beautiful color that it really is 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 a wonderful thing 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.790
 so I tell you that it is the kiko in the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.780
 war of 277 is a beautiful rose 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.570
 vivacious micro glitterato unfortunately it is 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.079
 unintentionally disconnected the video 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.790
 then practically the pink enamel of the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.969
 kiko must be applied to the little finger 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.070
 average is an index if necessary to give one 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.110
 double pass is not even needed 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.259
 to wait for it to be done 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.910
 the ring finger is the thumb to do this 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.110
 we'll need a spot for the tip 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.610
 thin is also a white glaze for 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.530
 avoid committing a little to today 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.590
 let's not give up at the time we start 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.610
 from the ring finger from a beautiful past of 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.840
 white enamel a little thicker than 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.720
 chan's usually we put some polish 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.880
 rose on a base with the door 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.880
 from the small tip 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.430
 it's easier to do than to say 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.180
 I would hardly know how 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.180
 explain 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.660
 nothing we have to mix well 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.819
 rose with white to create precisely 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.840
 this is this candy effect 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:23.760
 puree of white with the spot 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.760
 let's start putting in pink 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.800
 practically the easiest thing to do 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.180
 world and it's done in two seconds 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.360
 if we want to enrich another bit 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:45.640
 we take some white nail polish 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:49.740
 our clean sport of course and 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.740
 enrich by making small dots 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.780
 now let it dry for a minute 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.709
 in the end we finish everything with one 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.360
 double pass after coat we give the first one 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.510
 let it dry and we also give it 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.510
 second
