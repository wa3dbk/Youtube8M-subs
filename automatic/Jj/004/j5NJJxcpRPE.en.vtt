if you notice other people in your life
that<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.330> these<00:00:09.720> different<00:00:10.170> types<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:11.160> makes

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
that are these different types it makes

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.590 
that are these different types it makes
perfect<00:00:11.760> sense

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
perfect sense

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.940 
perfect sense
and<00:00:13.310> the<00:00:14.310> aura

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.160 

functions<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:20.210> help<00:00:20.540> you<00:00:22.270> fulfill<00:00:23.270> and<00:00:23.960> follow

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
functions to help you fulfill and follow

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.769 
functions to help you fulfill and follow
your<00:00:24.410> strategy<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.570> projectors<00:00:26.570> have<00:00:26.600> a

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
your strategy so projectors have a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.480 
your strategy so projectors have a
really<00:00:27.200> hard<00:00:27.590> time<00:00:27.800> following<00:00:28.100> their

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
really hard time following their

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.550 
really hard time following their
strategy<00:00:29.000> it's<00:00:29.180> not<00:00:29.360> as<00:00:29.570> easy<00:00:29.750> as<00:00:30.050> a<00:00:30.080> generator

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
strategy it's not as easy as a generator

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.679 
strategy it's not as easy as a generator
let's<00:00:31.070> just<00:00:31.340> look<00:00:31.520> at<00:00:31.640> this<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:32.029> projectors

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
let's just look at this so projectors

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.220 
let's just look at this so projectors
are<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:34.100> type<00:00:34.370> that<00:00:35.210> they're<00:00:35.600> really<00:00:35.870> here<00:00:36.050> to

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
are the type that they're really here to

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.470 
are the type that they're really here to
guide<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:36.710> direct<00:00:36.770> other<00:00:37.220> people<00:00:37.700> and

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
guide and direct other people and

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.390 
guide and direct other people and
they're<00:00:38.780> they're<00:00:39.230> really<00:00:39.260> smart<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.309> they

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
they're they're really smart and they

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.910 
they're they're really smart and they
have<00:00:40.640> like<00:00:40.910> this<00:00:41.120> gifted<00:00:41.629> intellect<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.500> so

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
have like this gifted intellect and so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.290 
have like this gifted intellect and so
it's<00:00:43.250> like<00:00:43.489> well<00:00:44.090> why<00:00:44.739> doesn't<00:00:45.879> everyone<00:00:46.879> come

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
it's like well why doesn't everyone come

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.720 
it's like well why doesn't everyone come
to<00:00:47.540> me<00:00:47.720> to<00:00:48.170> get<00:00:48.320> all<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:48.710> wisdom<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:49.400> I<00:00:49.460> have

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
to me to get all this wisdom that I have

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.110 
to me to get all this wisdom that I have
I<00:00:50.320> what's<00:00:51.320> best<00:00:51.620> here<00:00:51.980> but<00:00:52.280> nobody<00:00:52.670> asked<00:00:53.060> me

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
I what's best here but nobody asked me

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.200 
I what's best here but nobody asked me
so<00:00:53.750> what<00:00:54.230> happens<00:00:54.590> with<00:00:54.739> projectors<00:00:55.399> is<00:00:56.000> they

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
so what happens with projectors is they

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.040 
so what happens with projectors is they
end<00:00:56.360> up<00:00:56.450> feeling<00:00:57.050> bitter<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:57.950> left<00:00:58.160> out<00:00:58.370> and

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
end up feeling bitter and left out and

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.720 
end up feeling bitter and left out and
exhausted<00:01:00.050> because<00:01:00.530> they're<00:01:00.770> keep<00:01:00.920> trying<00:01:01.309> to

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
exhausted because they're keep trying to

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.180 
exhausted because they're keep trying to
get<00:01:01.880> people<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.300> connect<00:01:02.660> with<00:01:02.780> them<00:01:03.070> so<00:01:04.070> if

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
get people to connect with them so if

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.580 
get people to connect with them so if
you<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.460> think<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:04.910> that<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.960> projector

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
you just think of that of the projector

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.380 
you just think of that of the projector
and<00:01:06.800> how<00:01:06.979> their<00:01:07.190> aura<00:01:07.399> is<00:01:07.610> actually<00:01:08.119> working

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
and how their aura is actually working

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.810 
and how their aura is actually working
is<00:01:08.869> that<00:01:09.380> they're<00:01:09.560> not<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:10.130> kind<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.490> person

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
is that they're not the kind of person

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.370 
is that they're not the kind of person
that's<00:01:10.940> supposed<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.300> be<00:01:11.390> turned<00:01:11.780> on<00:01:12.050> all<00:01:12.350> the

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
that's supposed to be turned on all the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.969 
that's supposed to be turned on all the
time<00:01:13.420> they're<00:01:14.420> they're<00:01:14.869> like<00:01:15.170> taking<00:01:15.560> things

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
time they're they're like taking things

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.840 
time they're they're like taking things
in<00:01:16.550> and<00:01:17.030> not<00:01:17.869> completely<00:01:18.680> taking<00:01:19.220> all<00:01:19.490> the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
in and not completely taking all the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.700 
in and not completely taking all the
energy<00:01:20.300> in<00:01:20.390> but<00:01:20.570> they're<00:01:20.750> taking<00:01:20.960> things<00:01:21.410> in

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
energy in but they're taking things in

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.530 
energy in but they're taking things in
and<00:01:21.920> they're<00:01:22.040> wanting<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.549> find<00:01:22.880> out<00:01:23.090> where

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
and they're wanting to find out where

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.710 
and they're wanting to find out where
can<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.229> best<00:01:24.590> be<00:01:25.040> utilized<00:01:25.250> because<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:26.240> don't

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
can I best be utilized because I don't

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.570 
can I best be utilized because I don't
have<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.020> same<00:01:27.229> energy<00:01:27.680> as<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:27.830> manifesting

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
have the same energy as a manifesting

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.630 
have the same energy as a manifesting
generator<00:01:29.119> I'm<00:01:29.479> here<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.869> guide<00:01:30.020> and<00:01:30.320> direct

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
generator I'm here to guide and direct

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.910 
generator I'm here to guide and direct
but<00:01:31.640> I<00:01:31.670> want<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.180> be<00:01:32.299> part<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.780> team<00:01:33.049> so

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
but I want to be part of the team so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.670 
but I want to be part of the team so
they're<00:01:34.159> taking<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:34.729> energy<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:35.900> then

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
they're taking this energy in and then

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.310 
they're taking this energy in and then
when<00:01:37.400> they<00:01:37.549> find<00:01:37.880> what<00:01:38.290> something<00:01:39.290> that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
when they find what something that

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.929 
when they find what something that
really<00:01:39.619> connects<00:01:40.189> with<00:01:40.310> them<00:01:40.610> what<00:01:40.850> it

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
really connects with them what it

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.149 
really connects with them what it
resonates<00:01:41.630> with<00:01:41.869> them<00:01:42.080> then<00:01:42.590> they<00:01:42.830> really

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
resonates with them then they really

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.670 
resonates with them then they really
focus<00:01:43.700> their<00:01:43.909> energy<00:01:44.420> on<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:48.409> a

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
focus their energy on it so for a

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.670 
focus their energy on it so for a
projector<00:01:49.490> they<00:01:49.970> say<00:01:50.270> your<00:01:50.570> strategy<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.380> wait

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
projector they say your strategy is wait

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.580 
projector they say your strategy is wait
to<00:01:51.830> be<00:01:51.979> invited<00:01:52.299> well<00:01:54.009> how<00:01:55.009> does<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.250> work

invited it's like everyday life a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.850 
invited it's like everyday life a
projector<00:02:10.410> can<00:02:11.160> still<00:02:11.780> think<00:02:12.780> about<00:02:12.989> how<00:02:13.620> this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
projector can still think about how this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.540 
projector can still think about how this
aura<00:02:14.160> works<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:14.880> go<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.300> store<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
aura works so they go to the store and

where<00:02:56.519> they<00:02:56.640> get<00:02:56.760> their<00:02:56.970> energy<00:02:57.120> from<00:02:57.530> we<00:02:58.530> get

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
where they get their energy from we get

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.050 
where they get their energy from we get
their<00:02:58.860> energy<00:02:59.010> from<00:02:59.400> when<00:02:59.640> somebody
