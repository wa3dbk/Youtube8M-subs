00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.740
 little bit the steamer that I come to create 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.640
 which is already strong that I do not create that I 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.010
 come from rosstat 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.769
 so he is he and 108 besides I'm going 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.120
 put some characteristic points 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.400
 I am Belgian put them in wisdom 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.170
 then had to put them in intelligence 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.000
 good it's not serious insult and not 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.159
 focused his young lose five points 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.299
 of the two features it's not 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.729
 serious so 108 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:50.379
 so I said I'll go right away 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.570
 show a little less my surf 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.500
 so it's more of a support stuff because 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.799
 that my my steamer you will see is 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.260
 more supports it and so that first of all the 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.869
 hooded choice monkeys so 115 in 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.979
 vitality 45 in intelligence a few 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.479
 damage some resistance and that's it 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.920
 the ring and ron so this will be my case 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.229
 it's a little care so I get to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.900
 to do the 500 points is enough 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.150
 nice 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.080
 the fire alliance dallas so I had not 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.000
 what is their sole so I 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.760
 maybe change the cape of the king 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.070
 monkey who gives a little cow I you the 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.710
 show I shut up that takes a little 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.580
 initiative is a bit of a pity 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.300
 the clean dragodinde take emerald 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.190
 boots off field a pmp to 57 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.470
 intelligence is not necessarily 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.300
 good I fugue belt 92 of 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.400
 vitality of the wise and without toll is 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.790
 pity 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.909
 a little chela no 100 or even vitality and 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:59.110
 an oissu the lette i do not know how 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:02:01.060
 it is pronounced so well that's what 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.430
 I wanted to say ah yes you see that 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.020
 my theme on dofus and red is 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.360
 Antoine who gave me this is nice 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.250

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.260
 victory show you that in blue and in 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.300
 glass so I can show you quickly 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.860
 do the blue 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.930
 blue light well that's it looks like 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:25.110
 so I'm going to show you the spells 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.190
 so i have vapor level kathak tyrrell 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.050
 first aid to treat a little 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.190
 the one not shaking this call for the spell 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.930
 special armor to protect the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.150
 sucker a little crazy bulls 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.180
 and evolution and breakwaters that makes 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.940
 as there is a sacrifice on on the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.270
 turret so here I am going to launch the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.010
 fight 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.930
 so I do not know if I find I'm going 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.670
 able to show they did not 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.130
 to be able to show the special care spell 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.080
 but I can already showed a little bit 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.310
 that I can do 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.400
 so often what I start playing 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.280
 to me as natural I booster 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.010
 with the little scuba I throw 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.860
 he goes port that taps the creative natural 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.320
 who types in both my 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.880
 to the character and I put myself a tactic 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.320
 well I'm not crazy the live is 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.150
 well that I can show you a little 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.360
 how much of a material is level 1 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.400
 he does it heals different and little 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.290
 on both poles I came to a few 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.020
 same time sony drawing so we go 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:30.110
 start with the boom is the beat 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:33.870
 so it's the shepherd does 144 damage x 2 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.860
 it's not bad so I'm going to enjoy it 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.980
 I will move my tower to hall and we will 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.380
 continue with so the fate very report 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.989
 useful when there are lines of sight that 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.910
 lets me type in mass that makes 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:53.010
 nice damage 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.630
 so here is then a spell in 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.260
 diagonal who steals a little bit of life 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:03.630
 which is called flibuste rob dibble 71 of 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.790
 life and I can run twice so I 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:11.040
 will be able to evolve my tyrrell head 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.530
 Marvel does this pardon level level 3 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.979
 here and I will activate the special spell 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.750
 ambush like these are nine of 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.530
 damage in all the elements so I 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.209
 do 65 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.919
 I make a week with one is the beat 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.860
 there I think I 'm going to be banged 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.360
 by my own harmonious but all there 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.190
 will have an update that will really 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.890
 good but good 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.450
 and that's the damage and 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.970
 it's especially good that ambush 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.720
 matour she can be here at the other end 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.660
 map 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.979
 I can get to hit her so I 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.720
 will show you a little the care that I 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.550
 can do for example with first aid 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.120
 so 174th can do it only one 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.430
 time is the problem I do not care and 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.290
 my babysitter and I also have the cac 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.600
 can sometimes be well cared for not all 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.340
 time it's really dg quite risky 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.620
 so here I'm doing out of 25 I managed to 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.210
 make 500 and sometimes I did 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:12.470
 that type so you see it's really 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:14.480
 quite risky 79 373 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.520
 so here I have you pretty much to 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.780
 show my steamer his stuff his 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.910
 characteristics 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.220
 if I had some low questions 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.990
 do not hesitate I'm here I think I 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.940
 will show you packages of men from 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.320
 south but as I believe that the 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.890
 stimulants did not play much 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.480
 my rating 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.160
 so I often find myself against 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.080
 level 60 is not necessarily great 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.430
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.210
 we end up for her opts for a 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.210
 next video
