00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.359
 the second query has reached us 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.510
 internet from somewhere not 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.400
 identified says so I read his verse 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.440
 with respect to the seal of the holy spirit 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.000
 what I understood is that all 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.609
 believers we are sealed by the spirit 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.279
 holy the moment we receive Christ 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.140
 as our savior the problem is that 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.570
 in the church where he brought me together they have 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.550
 taught that the believer should seek to be 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.890
 sealed by the holy spirit and that 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.470
 when this happens it manifests itself in the 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.020
 ability to speak in tongues I have not 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.300
 had this experience I will thank you 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.300
 your comments on this matter 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.940
 as we already expressed it in our 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 article that has been read by you 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.050
 believer is sealed by the spirit 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.840
 holy the same moment that receives 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.930
 christ as savior this is not our 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.329
 personal opinion about it but what 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.030
 clearly and forcefully teaches the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.700
 bible let me quote the text in the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 which is based is clear teaching is 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.729
 find in Ephesians 1 from 11 to 14 the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.310
 bible says in it 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.220
 we also had inheritance because 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.410
 having been predestined according to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.320
 purpose of who does all things 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.479
 according to the design of his will in order 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.780
 that we are to praise his glory 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.640
 we who first 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.369
 we were waiting on Christ in him too 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.039
 you having heard the word of 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.070
 truth the gospel of your salvation 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.440
 and having believed in him you were 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.229
 sealed with the holy spirit of the 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.990
 promise that is the earnest of our 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.780
 inheritance until the redemption of the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.220
 acquired position to praise his 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.649
 glory 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.790
 speaking of Christ the apostle Paul says 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.970
 that in him 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.119
 likewise we had inheritance having been 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.520
 predestined according to the purpose of 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.950
 that does all things according to 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.110
 design of his will so that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.590
 let us be to praise his glory 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.810
 we who first 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.140
 we were waiting in Christ about this 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.390
 we could say so many beautiful things 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.079
 but they will be in another moment for now 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.090
 Suffice it not to know that God has poured 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.190
 spectacular blessings on everyone 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.670
 those who have trusted in Christ 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.320
 as a savior within those 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.380
 wonderful spiritual blessings 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.950
 is just being sealed with the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.769
 holy spirit the text says in it is 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.709
 to say in Christ you are also 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.109
 say all the believers having heard 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.170
 the word of truth the gospel of 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:56.430
 your salvation and having believed in 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.700
 you were sealed with the spirit 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.760
 of the promise we owe everything to Christ 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.219
 without him nothing of what we have could be 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.799
 our text says that we the 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.439
 believers having heard the message of 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:13.530
 gospel or the word of truth and 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.719
 having believed in this message is to say 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.290
 having received Christ as our 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.680
 savior 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.709
 we were sealed with the holy spirit is 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.989
 the law of cause and effect the cause is 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.590
 have heard the gospel and have believed 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:31.799
 in it the effect is to be sealed with the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.590
 holy spirit when this work happened 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.019
 of being sealed with the holy spirit 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.290
 Well, look how it has been conjugated 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.750
 verb to be in the phrase you say you were 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.599
 sealed with the holy spirit of the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.019
 promise this verb is in past tense 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.700
 which it means something that happened in the 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.120
 moment of receiving Christ as 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.939
 savior does not say you are sealed time 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.060
 present nor will you be sealed time 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:03.180
 future says you were sealed time 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.519
 past this means then that 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.280
 every believer has been sealed with the 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.609
 holy spirit of promise the instant 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.709
 same that received Christ as savior 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:16.859
 because it is the presence of Christ in the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.410
 believer what guarantees among others 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:22.440
 many things being sealed with the 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.360
 Holy spirit of promise do not forget 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.389
 that Christ comes to the life of the person 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.590
 the moment the person receives it 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:34.020
 as savior and not before and not after the 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.479
 passage goes on saying that the spirit 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.849
 saint of the promise is the earnest 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.610
 our inheritance until the redemption of 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.430
 possession acquired the spirit itself 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.330
 of god comes to dwell in the believer and 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.789
 ensure and preserve your eternal salvation 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.150
 the seal of which Paul speaks refers 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.880
 to an official identification mark 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.030
 which is placed in a letter or document 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.840
 I contract a document like this sealed 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.940
 acquires validity and security there 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.220
 four fundamental truths that 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.900
 result of this seal the first 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.380
 security 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:17.580
 the second authenticity the third 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:19.470
 property and the fourth authority the 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.889
 Holy spirit is given by God to the 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.130
 believer as a promise or a guarantee 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.560
 of his future inheritance in glory all 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.259
 this serves as a foundation to assert 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.900
 that the believer should not seek to be 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.810
 sealed by the holy spirit because already 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.360
 has been sealed by God with the spirit 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.900
 holy of promise the moment you believed 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.210
 in Christ and received him as savior 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:49.289
 so much so that nowhere in the 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.680
 bible is exhorted or is ordained 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.740
 hints that a believer should seek to be 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.539
 sealed with the holy spirit 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.460
 ending the gift of tongues was 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.340
 given not to all believers but 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:06.479
 only to some as they demonstrate 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.660
 texts like 1st Corinthians 12 from 29 to 30 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:12.000
 this being the case, it is to be expected that not all 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.760
 they have had the gift of languages but 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.900
 however all were sealed 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.900
 in the holy spirit
