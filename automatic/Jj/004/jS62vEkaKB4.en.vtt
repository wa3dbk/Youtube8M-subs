this one music listen as the sample I

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.210 
this one music listen as the sample I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
you know I know I have access to a lot
of<00:01:55.860> red<00:01:56.100> yarn<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.119> I'll<00:01:57.240> probably<00:01:57.420> try<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
of red yarn so I'll probably try to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.940 
of red yarn so I'll probably try to
match<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.229> red<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.890> top<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.130> red<00:02:00.950> so

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
match the red and do the top and red so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.560 
match the red and do the top and red so
this<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> border<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> second

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
this is going to be a border on a second

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.130 
this is going to be a border on a second
red<00:02:03.719> towel<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.659> decide<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
red towel and a little decide on the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
red towel and a little decide on the
tops<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:08.160> they<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.879> know<00:02:09.000> we're<00:02:09.209> going

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
tops so they just you know we're going

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.390 
tops so they just you know we're going
away<00:02:09.599> soon<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.619> figured<00:02:10.950> they'd<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.250> be

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
away soon and I figured they'd just be

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.480 
away soon and I figured they'd just be
nice<00:02:11.580> as<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.319> little

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
nice as a little

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.320 
nice as a little
justice<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:15.520> just<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.580> little<00:02:16.730> cracky<00:02:17.030> thing

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330
