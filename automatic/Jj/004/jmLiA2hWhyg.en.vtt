villains or the fiercest foes with the
Marvel<00:00:38.280> Universe<00:00:38.420> figures<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> pretty<00:00:41.520> cool

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.819 

the<00:00:46.739> lizard<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> big<00:00:48.360> fan<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.899> well

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the lizard not a big fan of this well

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.090 
the lizard not a big fan of this well
not<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> big<00:00:50.129> fan<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:52.050> villain<00:00:53.010> per<00:00:53.730> se<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
not a big fan of the villain per se and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.229 
not a big fan of the villain per se and
the<00:00:56.100> figure<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.640> bit<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> letdown

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the figure is a little bit of a letdown

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.420 
the figure is a little bit of a letdown
in<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:58.170> opinion<00:00:59.180> it<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.140> way<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
in my opinion it is in a way just a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.539 
in my opinion it is in a way just a
reduced<00:01:03.359> version<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:05.010> six-inch

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
reduced version of the six-inch

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.780 
reduced version of the six-inch
spider-man<00:01:08.060> lizard<00:01:09.060> figure<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.790> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
spider-man lizard figure and the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
spider-man lizard figure and the
difference<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.630> well<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> head

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
difference really is well the head

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.700 
difference really is well the head
sculpt<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.580> long<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> think<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> lot<00:01:15.330> better

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
sculpt as long as I think a lot better

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.620 
sculpt as long as I think a lot better
paying<00:01:16.759> definitely<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> mean<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.299> terms<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
paying definitely but I mean in terms of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
paying definitely but I mean in terms of
the<00:01:18.750> figure<00:01:19.080> itself<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.159> just

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the figure itself it's not really just

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.060 
the figure itself it's not really just
shrunken<00:01:20.909> down<00:01:21.619> this<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:22.799> doesn't<00:01:22.950> have

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
shrunken down this one doesn't have

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
shrunken down this one doesn't have
knees<00:01:23.420> but<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.479> has<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> waist<00:01:24.960> joint<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.500> one

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
knees but it has a waist joint this one

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.550 
knees but it has a waist joint this one
doesn't<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.009> waist<00:01:26.250> joint<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:26.729> has<00:01:26.880> knees

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
doesn't have a waist joint but has knees

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:36.950 
doesn't have a waist joint but has knees
so<00:01:31.579> well<00:01:34.159> detail<00:01:35.159> wise<00:01:35.430> these<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.630> great

not to pop it in come on anyway they're

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.590

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
idiot-proof it's poseable in a way you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.300 
idiot-proof it's poseable in a way you
could<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.479> make<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> go<00:02:07.229> 360<00:02:08.039> it's

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
could just go make it go 360 it's

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.520 
could just go make it go 360 it's
supposed<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> ball<00:02:09.539> joint<00:02:09.899> right

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
supposed to have a ball joint right

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.589 
supposed to have a ball joint right
there<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.180> shape<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
there but because of the shape of the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.230 
there but because of the shape of the
tail

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
tail

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.900 
tail
the<00:02:13.810> only<00:02:14.080> movement<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.220> do<00:02:15.490> with<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
the only movement it can do with the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.870 
the only movement it can do with the
ball<00:02:16.090> joint<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.480> just<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.640> really

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
ball joint is just this and it really

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.990 
ball joint is just this and it really
just<00:02:19.120> does<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.040> poseable<00:02:21.040> yes<00:02:21.490> but<00:02:21.820> not

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
just does this so poseable yes but not

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.720 
just does this so poseable yes but not
really<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.840> mean<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.290> that's<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.250> really<00:02:24.520> is

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
really I mean it that's it really is

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.450 
really I mean it that's it really is
more<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.390> stand<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.530> then<00:02:26.830> redo<00:02:27.370> you

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
more of just a stand and then redo you

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.310 
more of just a stand and then redo you

even<00:02:37.030> fully<00:02:37.390> be<00:02:37.600> poseable<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:38.550> costs<00:02:39.550> would

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
even fully be poseable but costs would

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.620 
even fully be poseable but costs would
go<00:02:39.700> up<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:41.380> know<00:02:41.610> okay<00:02:42.610> having<00:02:43.270> said<00:02:43.600> all
