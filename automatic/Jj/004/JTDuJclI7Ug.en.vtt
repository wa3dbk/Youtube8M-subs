00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.689
 DEA 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.820
 This is what I devised and released from Mets 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.700
 It is a stroke trainer 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.070
 Of stroke 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.730
 After correction 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.870
 Illusion is a tool to correct 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.590
 How to use 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:34.480
 Attach to this old tip and stroke it and shake it 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.640
 I'm going to stroke, but the old ones turn at the same time as not touching straight 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 so 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.910
 In this way 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.190
 This is what happens when the stroke trainer leans to the right 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.180
 It will be like this after Darin 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.670
 As this does not lean 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.260
 If you can stroke 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.640
 At the same time old 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 I hope that straight touch 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:06.570
 Put out immediately straight stroke so as not to shift even take back 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.570
 Yes at the same time there are three types of height 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.430
 From the side 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.690
 First of all, this height is the same height below 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.920
 And now let's reverse it and this time 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.260
 Center height 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.070
 Next time 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:30.190
 Then by this time it's the same store, but by doing so 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.780
 Stroke the same store below horizontally 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.080
 sense 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.840
 Sense to stroke the same store in the middle horizontally 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.710
 Ueno Do shop 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.750
 Is it while you stroke horizontally? 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.270
 The three are Oh 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:52.440
 Here it is one Tsukimasu longer to learn 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.850
 The same line as the width of the ball is attached 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:01.370
 That move 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.880
 By holding it together and looking for the position of the face that this looks perfectly centered 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.300
 Symbiosis of illusion also coterie 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.009
 Do 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:14.340
 Yes, it is a practice method using this, but at first it is normal 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:19.400
 Do not rotate this stroke trainer 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.400
 122 in the sense of actually erasing 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.850
 High 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.670
 Practice with a feeling like 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.730
 I actually with the cue ball Kedomo other one is I'm a little difficult 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.820
 If it gets too strong , 9 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.160
 Since there is also a danger of damage to the Practice with lighter 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.120
 so 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.180
 This difficult or tip gets heavy with this stroke trainer 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.300
 Because 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.060
 You will be in a state where it is very easy to get stumped 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:51.410
 For example , if you attach the right, the course will 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.500
 It in line 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.500
 It is practice to spit the center more accurately 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.430
 I think it's relatively straight now, but 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.160
 Such a feeling really makes a center 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.290
 further 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.130
 It is difficult but 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.320
 It is in fact stop shop 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.320
 If this is also not wearing a center fairly accurate 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.190
 Hmm 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.300
 There is something I can do 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:37.300
 First of all it is difficult to make it successful 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:42.460
 When you practice in a practice swing it to practice with lightly actually cue ball has been stable 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:45.660
 It feels like it feels straight when you touch it straight and I think it is very easy to understand 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.660
 Please try it by all means
