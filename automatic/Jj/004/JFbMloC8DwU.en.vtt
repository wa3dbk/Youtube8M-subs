which ever one you decide to use they
will<00:01:02.160> all<00:01:02.309> work<00:01:02.609> okay<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> main<00:01:04.379> thing

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
will all work okay but the main thing

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.109 
will all work okay but the main thing
that<00:01:04.589> you've<00:01:04.799> got<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.010> remember<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.460> every<00:01:06.000> one

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that you've got to remember is every one

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.020 
that you've got to remember is every one
of<00:01:06.240> them<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.540> different<00:01:07.140> okay<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.640> each<00:01:08.790> one

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of them is different okay and each one

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.820 
of them is different okay and each one
of<00:01:09.060> them<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.450> take<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.020> learning<00:01:10.560> curve<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of them will take a learning curve to

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.070 
of them will take a learning curve to
use<00:01:11.250> once<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.119> learn<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.510> learning<00:01:12.869> curve

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
use once you learn that learning curve

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.950 
use once you learn that learning curve
everything<00:01:14.040> will<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.189> fine<00:01:14.280> okay<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
everything will be fine okay but the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
everything will be fine okay but the
same<00:01:16.140> techniques<00:01:16.590> apply<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.280> each<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
same techniques apply to each one of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.270 
same techniques apply to each one of
them<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.090> myself<00:01:18.600> prefer<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.380> use<00:01:19.619> walmart

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
them I myself prefer to use walmart

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.179 
them I myself prefer to use walmart
color<00:01:20.939> place<00:01:21.210> flat<00:01:21.960> white<00:01:22.189> ninety-seven

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
color place flat white ninety-seven

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.670 
color place flat white ninety-seven
cents<00:01:23.430> yes<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.869> does<00:01:25.049> take<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> learning

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
cents yes this does take a learning

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.590 
cents yes this does take a learning
curve<00:01:25.830> okay<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> said<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
curve okay just like I said on all of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
curve okay just like I said on all of
them<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.140> once<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.619> down<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:29.369> stuff

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
them but once you get it down this stuff

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.399 
them but once you get it down this stuff
works<00:01:29.759> great<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:30.659> ninety-seven<00:01:31.170> cents

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
works great and it's ninety-seven cents

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560 
works great and it's ninety-seven cents
I<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:32.220> go<00:01:32.310> buy<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> case<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.150> them<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.420> whether

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I can go buy a case of them for whether

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.240 
I can go buy a case of them for whether
you<00:01:33.689> could<00:01:33.810> buy<00:01:33.990> GWS<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:37.250> we'll

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you could buy GWS for all right so we'll

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.730 
you could buy GWS for all right so we'll
cover<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> basing<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.240> another<00:01:39.689> later<00:01:40.290> how<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
cover the basing in another later how to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.289 
cover the basing in another later how to
paint<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.119> sure

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
paint this one is just going to be sure

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.240 
paint this one is just going to be sure
one<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.630> priming<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.530> without<00:01:43.740> further<00:01:43.799> ado

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
one about priming so without further ado

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.650 
one about priming so without further ado
let's<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> priming

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.260 

okay<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.780> first<00:01:52.930> step<00:01:53.230> is<00:01:53.440> it's<00:01:53.860> kind<00:01:54.070> of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
okay the first step is it's kind of

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.580 
okay the first step is it's kind of
self-explanatory<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.900> may<00:01:56.050> be<00:01:56.080> stupid<00:01:56.350> but

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
self-explanatory and may be stupid but

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.620 
self-explanatory and may be stupid but
the<00:01:56.950> thing<00:01:57.130> gotta<00:01:57.310> do<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.940> shake<00:01:58.210> this<00:01:58.360> sucker

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
the thing gotta do is shake this sucker

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.440 
the thing gotta do is shake this sucker
up<00:01:58.720> really<00:01:58.930> good<00:01:59.160> you<00:02:00.160> know<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:04.240> want<00:02:04.420> to

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
up really good you know you want to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.720 
up really good you know you want to
shake<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:04.750> thing<00:02:04.810> up<00:02:05.110> for<00:02:05.290> at<00:02:05.350> least<00:02:05.730> two

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
shake this thing up for at least two

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.030 
shake this thing up for at least two
minutes<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.120> minute<00:02:07.450> or<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:07.720> shake<00:02:08.680> it<00:02:08.710> up<00:02:08.860> is

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
minutes a minute or so shake it up is

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.889 
minutes a minute or so shake it up is
good<00:02:09.250> rotating<00:02:09.880> around<00:02:09.970> get<00:02:10.420> everything

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
good rotating around get everything

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.120 
good rotating around get everything
worked<00:02:11.140> up<00:02:11.320> in<00:02:11.470> there<00:02:11.650> because<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.980> don't

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
worked up in there because you don't

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.130 
worked up in there because you don't
want<00:02:12.190> any<00:02:12.460> of<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.700> nasty<00:02:13.420> stuff<00:02:13.480> for<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.020> to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
want any of the nasty stuff for it to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.770 
want any of the nasty stuff for it to
not<00:02:14.170> stick<00:02:14.590> or<00:02:14.770> anything<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.490> shake<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.300> up<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
not stick or anything so shake it up the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.200 
not stick or anything so shake it up the
best<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.260> possibly<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.830> all<00:02:18.340> right<00:02:18.580> that's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
best you possibly can all right that's

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.690 
best you possibly can all right that's
the<00:02:19.360> first<00:02:19.600> step<00:02:25.620> ok<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.980> next<00:02:27.010> step<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.550> want

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
the first step ok the next step you want
