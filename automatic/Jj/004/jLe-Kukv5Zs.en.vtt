00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 good works with me but very worth 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 too bad you do it because it 's something 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.120
 sensational and takes a minute 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:49.739

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.780
 jelly

 nothing more than that you're with jam 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.770
 want to use good streets that I recommend a 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.629
 matter of taste not brand was alone 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.170
 when more is the flavor 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:14.790
 its taste I think it has everything to do with 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.450
 This is an excuse to be talking about 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.409

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.700

 minus a finger a little less to do only 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.979
 For that, for you to see in cheese. 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.340
 I'll get the jam a little bit 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.710

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:05.299

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:09.450
 pepper and one with another 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.209

 a detail if cutting very fine stay 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.840
 30 seconds to hold much more 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.120
 going out is going to be a thing, it's not an idea 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.070
 so run a little thicker 30 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.110
