meters<00:00:54.120> away<00:00:54.710> actually<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.809> one<00:00:57.809> kilometre

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
meters away actually I'm a one kilometre

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.119 
meters away actually I'm a one kilometre
away<00:00:58.410> from<00:00:58.710> home<00:01:00.110> almost<00:01:01.110> one<00:01:01.379> kilometre

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.490 

video<00:01:05.129> video<00:01:05.430> video<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.060> still<00:01:06.210> clear<00:01:06.630> making

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
video video video is still clear making

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.889 
video video video is still clear making
a<00:01:07.590> turn<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.369> realized<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.300> forgot

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
a turn because I just realized I forgot

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.020 
a turn because I just realized I forgot
to<00:01:10.410> set<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.740> failsafe<00:01:11.280> which<00:01:12.149> actually<00:01:12.979> says

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
to set the failsafe which actually says

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.600 
to set the failsafe which actually says
as<00:01:15.030> soon<00:01:15.090> as<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> lost<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.930> signal<00:01:16.399> return<00:01:17.399> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
as soon as you lost the signal return to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
as soon as you lost the signal return to
home<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.210> activated<00:01:18.690> so<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:19.560> going

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
home will be activated so what I'm going

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.050 
home will be activated so what I'm going
to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.100> put<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.910> cruise<00:01:21.270> throttle<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
to do is put it on a cruise throttle and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.030 
to do is put it on a cruise throttle and
written<00:01:24.060> let<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> return<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.229> home<00:01:25.410> actually

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
written let it return to home actually

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.810 
written let it return to home actually
so<00:01:26.940> right<00:01:27.149> now<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.860> 800<00:01:28.860> meters<00:01:29.190> away<00:01:29.340> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
so right now we are 800 meters away and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.260 
so right now we are 800 meters away and
300<00:01:30.390> meters<00:01:30.690> high<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:32.520> take<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:32.880> goggles

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
300 meters high and I take my goggles

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.150 
300 meters high and I take my goggles
off<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.840> I'm<00:01:34.140> pretty<00:01:34.440> sure<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.770> plane<00:01:35.009> is

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
off because I'm pretty sure my plane is

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.060 
off because I'm pretty sure my plane is
coming<00:01:35.310> back<00:01:35.670> perfectly<00:01:36.539> safe<00:01:39.860> there's<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
coming back perfectly safe there's the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.280 
coming back perfectly safe there's the
point<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.430> coming<00:01:41.700> back<00:01:41.850> Misha<00:01:42.270> oh<00:01:42.630> well

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
point it's coming back Misha oh well

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.430 
point it's coming back Misha oh well
there<00:01:43.440> are<00:01:43.500> 300<00:01:43.950> meters<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.340> coming<00:01:44.640> back<00:01:45.440> so

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
there are 300 meters is coming back so

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.020 
there are 300 meters is coming back so
you<00:01:46.500> don't<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> worry<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.400> you<00:01:47.640> lose<00:01:47.820> your

you don't have to worry if you lose your

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.289 
you don't have to worry if you lose your
video<00:01:48.330> feeds<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.229> lose<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:50.299> controls

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
video feeds if you lose your controls

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.030 
video feeds if you lose your controls
you<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:52.080> don't<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> worry<00:01:52.890> your

you actually don't have to worry your

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.250 
you actually don't have to worry your
plane<00:01:53.310> will<00:01:53.490> actually<00:01:53.880> come<00:01:54.119> back<00:01:54.299> itself<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
plane will actually come back itself you

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.760 
plane will actually come back itself you
see<00:01:55.439> I'm<00:01:55.650> not<00:01:55.830> doing<00:01:56.280> anything<00:01:56.549> here<00:01:56.939> just

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
see I'm not doing anything here just

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.649 
see I'm not doing anything here just
holding<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.100> plane<00:01:59.340> is

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
holding it and the plane is

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.940 
holding it and the plane is
automatically<00:02:00.659> back<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.439> right<00:02:01.590> now<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.799> have

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
automatically back so right now I have

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.219 
automatically back so right now I have
no<00:02:01.979> trouble<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.760> actually<00:02:03.210> gliding<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
no trouble it's actually gliding and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.980 
no trouble it's actually gliding and
maintaining<00:02:04.920> its<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.280> home<00:02:05.610> point<00:02:06.000> way<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
maintaining its a home point way so it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.780 
maintaining its a home point way so it
will<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.200> keep<00:02:07.619> circling<00:02:07.890> around<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.640> I

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
will just keep circling around here I

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.699 
will just keep circling around here I
will<00:02:09.179> end<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.929> will<00:02:10.080> set<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.440> failsafe

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
will end it and I will set the failsafe

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.240 
will end it and I will set the failsafe
on<00:02:11.250> my<00:02:11.570> channeling<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:14.180> actually

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
on my channeling that is actually

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.410 
on my channeling that is actually
I<00:02:15.280> can<00:02:15.520> set<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.000> sail<00:02:16.210> right<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:19.030> just

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
I can set the sail right now I just

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.420 
I can set the sail right now I just
realized<00:02:20.050> all<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.320> need<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.620> do<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:20.950> press<00:02:21.190> this

realized all I need to do is press this
button<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:22.060> arch<00:02:22.870> yet<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:24.210> for<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.240> few<00:02:25.420> seconds

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
button on arch yet and for a few seconds

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.080 
button on arch yet and for a few seconds
and<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.170> will<00:02:26.320> be<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.560> failsafe<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:27.580> let<00:02:27.850> me<00:02:27.880> do

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
and it will be the failsafe so let me do

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.430 
and it will be the failsafe so let me do
it<00:02:28.120> all<00:02:28.750> right<00:02:28.840> i<00:02:29.140> turn<00:02:29.410> off<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:30.100> RP<00:02:30.550> edge<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
it all right i turn off the RP edge I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.360 
it all right i turn off the RP edge I
move<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.620> plan<00:02:32.890> at<00:02:33.250> some<00:02:33.580> position<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:36.040> set

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
move the plan at some position and I set

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.350 
move the plan at some position and I set
my<00:02:36.550> throttle<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.120> fifty<00:02:37.480> percent<00:02:42.090> maybe<00:02:43.090> more

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
my throttle to fifty percent maybe more

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.290 
my throttle to fifty percent maybe more
than<00:02:43.540> fifty<00:02:43.840> percent<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:45.220> will<00:02:45.850> turn<00:02:46.090> on

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
than fifty percent and I will turn on

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.570 
than fifty percent and I will turn on
