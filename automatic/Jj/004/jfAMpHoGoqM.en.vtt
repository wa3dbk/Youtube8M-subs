my interest in 3d printing derives from

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.890 
my interest in 3d printing derives from
being<00:00:54.590> able<00:00:54.740> to<00:00:54.950> create<00:00:55.300> quite<00:00:56.300> complex

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
being able to create quite complex

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.470 
being able to create quite complex
objects<00:00:57.680> very<00:00:57.860> easily<00:00:58.100> because<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.790> this<00:00:59.270> new

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
objects very easily because of this new

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.260 
objects very easily because of this new
technology<00:00:59.600> is<00:01:00.440> very<00:01:00.680> simple<00:01:01.040> now<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.270> realize

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
technology is very simple now to realize

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.530 
technology is very simple now to realize
ideas<00:01:03.170> between<00:01:03.800> being<00:01:04.489> quite<00:01:04.850> complex<00:01:05.269> to

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
ideas between being quite complex to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.690 
ideas between being quite complex to
make<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:06.290> be<00:01:06.380> working<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.740> mr.<00:01:06.979> project<00:01:07.430> with

make to be working the mr. project with
the<00:01:08.150> ever<00:01:08.360> after<00:01:08.740> it's<00:01:09.740> really<00:01:09.950> exciting<00:01:10.190> and

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
the ever after it's really exciting and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.359 
the ever after it's really exciting and
for<00:01:11.540> me<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:12.020> like<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.380> possibility<00:01:13.340> of

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
for me I like the possibility of

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.880 
for me I like the possibility of
creating<00:01:14.360> something<00:01:14.600> new<00:01:14.930> but<00:01:15.590> maybe<00:01:15.770> I

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
creating something new but maybe I

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.530 
creating something new but maybe I
wouldn't<00:01:16.220> have<00:01:16.400> made<00:01:16.790> in<00:01:17.060> any<00:01:17.420> other

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
wouldn't have made in any other

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.930 
wouldn't have made in any other
circumstance<00:01:18.140> or<00:01:18.290> maybe<00:01:18.550> it<00:01:19.550> might<00:01:19.700> shed

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
circumstance or maybe it might shed

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.400 
circumstance or maybe it might shed
light<00:01:19.970> on<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.830> idea<00:01:21.830> or<00:01:22.010> approached<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:23.420> new

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
light on a idea or approached a new

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:33.590 
light on a idea or approached a new
possibility<00:01:24.770> for<00:01:25.250> migration<00:01:25.790> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.120 

I<00:01:34.820> suppose<00:01:36.080> I've<00:01:37.080> often<00:01:37.320> thought<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.740> how

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
I suppose I've often thought about how

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.810 
I suppose I've often thought about how
it<00:01:38.159> looked<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.790> recreate<00:01:39.600> my<00:01:39.810> stuff<00:01:40.110> 3d<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it looked to recreate my stuff 3d in the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.289 
it looked to recreate my stuff 3d in the
past<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.360> nearly<00:01:42.780> did<00:01:43.020> some<00:01:43.200> work<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:44.299> couple

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
past I nearly did some work a couple

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.580 
past I nearly did some work a couple
years<00:01:45.479> ago<00:01:45.570> with<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.930> photographer<00:01:46.440> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
years ago with a photographer to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.280 
years ago with a photographer to
recreate<00:01:47.070> some<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.580> my<00:01:47.940> head<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.810> shoulders

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
recreate some of my head and shoulders

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.800 
recreate some of my head and shoulders
sort<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> portraits<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.210> feather<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.600> claw

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810

little<00:01:54.030> bit<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.240> animal<00:01:54.659> bits<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.289> pieces<00:01:56.240> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
little bit of animal bits and pieces you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.430 
little bit of animal bits and pieces you
know<00:01:57.330> I'm<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.570> interested<00:01:57.869> see<00:01:58.229> how<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
know I'm just interested see how it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.840 
know I'm just interested see how it
looks<00:01:58.619> like<00:01:58.950> three<00:01:59.159> dimensionally<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> guess

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
looks like three dimensionally I guess

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.310 
looks like three dimensionally I guess
it'll<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.210> another<00:02:00.570> way<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.960> approaching

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
it'll just be another way of approaching

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.249 
it'll just be another way of approaching
the<00:02:01.710> way<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> work<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.149> having<00:02:04.110> ever

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the way that I work and having ever

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.139 
the way that I work and having ever
thought<00:02:04.710> about<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.369> go<00:02:05.520> might<00:02:05.759> what

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
thought about what they go might what

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.969 
thought about what they go might what
might<00:02:06.360> make<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.929> or<00:02:07.110> before<00:02:07.440> image<00:02:07.740> oh

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
might make up this or before image oh

what<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.510> got<00:02:43.290> those<00:02:43.410> ideas<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.220> then<00:02:44.670> went<00:02:44.820> away

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
what we got those ideas I then went away

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.170 
what we got those ideas I then went away
and<00:02:45.769> recreated<00:02:46.769> them<00:02:47.040> within<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.610> specialist

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and recreated them within a specialist

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.470 
and recreated them within a specialist
3d<00:02:48.540> design<00:02:48.930> software<00:02:49.910> which<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
3d design software which is the

difficult part where once we've got that
design<00:02:54.359> then<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.870> designs<00:02:55.650> ready<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.130> sent

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
design then the designs ready to be sent

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.030 
design then the designs ready to be sent
away<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.390> be<00:02:57.510> printed<00:02:57.720> overnight<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.680> a
