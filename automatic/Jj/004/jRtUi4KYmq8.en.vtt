line off without using a rubber band or

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.129 
line off without using a rubber band or
the<00:00:08.910> little<00:00:09.179> line<00:00:09.330> clips<00:00:09.660> which<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.990> line

the little line clips which the line

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.499 
the little line clips which the line
clips<00:00:10.380> work<00:00:10.559> but<00:00:10.910> they<00:00:11.910> never<00:00:12.090> worked<00:00:12.330> good

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
clips work but they never worked good

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.039 
clips work but they never worked good
enough<00:00:13.160> now<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.630> most<00:00:15.630> polls<00:00:15.870> have

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
enough now this is a most polls have

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.630 
enough now this is a most polls have
labels<00:00:16.440> on<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.859> most<00:00:17.070> poles<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
labels on the most poles are about the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.029 
labels on the most poles are about the
same<00:00:17.760> direction<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> labels<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:19.890> way

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
same direction on the labels so the way

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.390 
same direction on the labels so the way
I<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:21.050> label<00:00:22.050> facing<00:00:22.560> out<00:00:22.710> because<00:00:23.189> it's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
I do it is label facing out because it's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.429 
I do it is label facing out because it's
the<00:00:23.460> only<00:00:23.519> way<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:24.119> right-handed<00:00:24.840> if<00:00:25.289> you're

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the only way I'm right-handed if you're

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
the only way I'm right-handed if you're
left<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.740> might<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.010> different<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:26.490> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
left here I might be different but you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.099 
left here I might be different but you
could<00:00:27.180> probably<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> opposite<00:00:27.930> for

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
could probably do it the opposite for

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.620 
could probably do it the opposite for
left-handed<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:28.849> all<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.060> do<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.390> kind

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
left-handed but all you do is you kind

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.020 
left-handed but all you do is you kind
of<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:31.230> your<00:00:31.380> line<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.590> tag<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.189> which<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> on

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
of have your line or tag on which is on

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.630 
of have your line or tag on which is on
the<00:00:33.480> spool<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> line<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.040> come<00:00:35.430> around

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the spool of line and you come around

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.479 
the spool of line and you come around
the<00:00:35.969> bottom<00:00:36.300> with<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.510> finger<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> you're

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the bottom with your finger so you're

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.360 
the bottom with your finger so you're
making<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.730> loop<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.030> top<00:00:39.739> take<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.890> tag<00:00:41.129> in

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
making a loop up top take your tag in

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.479 
making a loop up top take your tag in
I'll<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.480> real<00:00:42.600> quick<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.050> show<00:00:43.200> you

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
I'll do it real quick so I can show you

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.360 
I'll do it real quick so I can show you
so<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> take<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:46.190> that's<00:00:47.190> usually

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
so I take it like that that's usually

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.510 
so I take it like that that's usually
how<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.670> starts<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.239> gotta<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> mess

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
how it starts like that gotta be a mess

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.650 
how it starts like that gotta be a mess
take<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.099 

those<00:00:54.660> guys<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:55.020> watching<00:00:55.170> too<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> did

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
those guys are watching too so all I did

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.189 
those guys are watching too so all I did
is<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.410> went<00:00:58.590> under<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.039> went<00:00:59.520> under<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.760> loop

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
is I went under I went under that loop

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.399 
is I went under I went under that loop
come<00:01:01.199> back<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.649> loop<00:01:01.859> right<00:01:02.100> here<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
come back to this loop right here so it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.830 
come back to this loop right here so it
kinda<00:01:04.650> looks<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.830> that

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
kinda looks like that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
kinda looks like that
almost<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.020> pretzel<00:01:07.229> knot<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.030> when

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
almost like a pretzel knot and then when

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300 
almost like a pretzel knot and then when
you<00:01:09.119> pull<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.330> tight<00:01:09.770> it<00:01:10.770> holds<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.130> line

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you pull that tight it holds your line

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.340 
you pull that tight it holds your line
on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.520> spool<00:01:11.810> it's<00:01:12.810> pretty<00:01:12.960> quick<00:01:13.170> when

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
on the spool it's pretty quick when

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.210 
on the spool it's pretty quick when
you're<00:01:13.439> doing<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:13.979> you're<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you're doing it like then you're in a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
you're doing it like then you're in a
hurry<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.820> am<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> time<00:01:15.450> but<00:01:16.080> when

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
hurry like I am all the time but when

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.260 
hurry like I am all the time but when
you<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.380> take<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.650> off<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> take<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
you go take it off if you take off the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
you go take it off if you take off the
same<00:01:18.450> way<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.630> put<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> label

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
same way you put it on with the label

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.109 
same way you put it on with the label
facing<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:22.409> gotta<00:01:22.590> pull<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.830> off<00:01:23.119> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
facing out you gotta pull it off the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.399 
facing out you gotta pull it off the
knot<00:01:24.299> comes<00:01:24.509> out<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> worry<00:01:25.170> about

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
knot comes out so not to worry about

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.780 
knot comes out so not to worry about
cutting<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> piece<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.100> Nod<00:01:26.220> off<00:01:26.400> or<00:01:26.610> anything

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
cutting a piece of Nod off or anything

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.490 
cutting a piece of Nod off or anything
so<00:01:27.060> didn't<00:01:27.270> he<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.420> tie<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.720> line<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.140> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
so didn't he just tie your line on and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.590 
so didn't he just tie your line on and
go<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> splitting<00:01:29.130> your<00:01:29.250> line<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.700> virtually

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
go to splitting your line but virtually

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
good for holding a holding in line fast

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270 
good for holding a holding in line fast
