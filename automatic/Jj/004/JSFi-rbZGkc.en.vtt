the<00:00:18.220> style<00:00:18.310> of<00:00:18.610> what<00:00:18.789> was<00:00:18.910> happening<00:00:19.770> spoken

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
the style of what was happening spoken

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.110 
the style of what was happening spoken
to<00:00:20.860> worrying<00:00:21.040> about<00:00:21.190> whether<00:00:21.640> I<00:00:21.730> should<00:00:21.880> do

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
to worrying about whether I should do

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.610 
to worrying about whether I should do
the<00:00:22.240> gap<00:00:22.390> course<00:00:22.660> and<00:00:22.900> he'd<00:00:23.080> agreed<00:00:23.350> it'd<00:00:23.470> be<00:00:23.590> a

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
the gap course and he'd agreed it'd be a

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.800 
the gap course and he'd agreed it'd be a
good<00:00:23.770> idea<00:00:23.920> I<00:00:24.370> really<00:00:25.150> wanted<00:00:25.360> to<00:00:25.510> get<00:00:25.600> better

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
good idea I really wanted to get better

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.380 
good idea I really wanted to get better
at<00:00:26.020> skiing<00:00:26.290> and<00:00:26.620> thought<00:00:27.160> that<00:00:27.340> be<00:00:27.550> and<00:00:28.270> it's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
at skiing and thought that be and it's

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.790 
at skiing and thought that be and it's
great<00:00:28.540> to<00:00:28.600> get<00:00:28.780> the<00:00:28.870> qualification<00:00:29.470> as<00:00:29.590> well

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
great to get the qualification as well

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.310 
great to get the qualification as well
and<00:00:30.040> so<00:00:30.940> that's<00:00:31.330> particularly<00:00:31.900> why<00:00:32.020> I<00:00:32.050> chose

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
and so that's particularly why I chose

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.970 
and so that's particularly why I chose
his<00:00:32.649> course<00:00:32.890> I<00:00:33.570> would<00:00:34.570> say<00:00:34.870> there<00:00:35.379> was<00:00:35.620> a

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
his course I would say there was a

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.700 
his course I would say there was a
complete<00:00:36.250> mixture<00:00:37.120> of<00:00:37.300> skis<00:00:38.170> on<00:00:38.380> the<00:00:38.410> course

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
complete mixture of skis on the course

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.670 
complete mixture of skis on the course
some<00:00:39.010> people<00:00:39.040> were<00:00:39.990> pretty<00:00:40.990> good<00:00:41.200> probably

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
some people were pretty good probably

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.350 
some people were pretty good probably
almost<00:00:41.829> instructor<00:00:42.520> level<00:00:42.730> already<00:00:42.820> some

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
almost instructor level already some

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.850 
almost instructor level already some
people<00:00:43.630> had<00:00:43.720> only<00:00:43.870> done<00:00:44.079> maybe<00:00:44.290> about<00:00:44.560> six

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
people had only done maybe about six

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.520 
people had only done maybe about six
weeks<00:00:45.010> skiing<00:00:45.820> before<00:00:45.940> but<00:00:46.390> of<00:00:46.570> those<00:00:47.140> people

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
weeks skiing before but of those people

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.350 
weeks skiing before but of those people
later<00:00:47.739> also<00:00:48.220> done<00:00:48.700> quite<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:48.910> few<00:00:48.970> of<00:00:49.149> Orleans

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
later also done quite a few of Orleans

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.510 
later also done quite a few of Orleans
courses<00:00:49.720> before<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:50.739> we're<00:00:50.950> good<00:00:51.160> skiers

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
courses before and so we're good skiers

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.370 
courses before and so we're good skiers
for<00:00:51.790> people<00:00:52.149> that<00:00:52.270> only<00:00:52.450> done<00:00:52.810> that<00:00:52.960> level<00:00:53.320> of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
for people that only done that level of

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.010 
for people that only done that level of
experience<00:00:54.210> typically<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.570> would<00:00:55.600> come<00:00:55.870> up<00:00:55.989> to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
experience typically we would come up to

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.049 
experience typically we would come up to
a<00:00:56.170> couple<00:00:56.320> of<00:00:56.559> runs<00:00:56.739> first<00:00:57.070> meet<00:00:57.550> up<00:00:57.790> with<00:00:57.940> the

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
a couple of runs first meet up with the

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.870 
a couple of runs first meet up with the
coaches<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.840> go<00:00:59.440> through<00:00:59.770> a<00:01:00.010> warm-up<00:01:00.520> stretch

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
coaches and go through a warm-up stretch

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.090 
coaches and go through a warm-up stretch
session<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.570> then<00:01:02.320> split<00:01:02.649> off<00:01:02.800> into<00:01:02.980> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
session and then split off into the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.760 
session and then split off into the
various<00:01:03.430> groups<00:01:03.670> that<00:01:03.850> we<00:01:03.910> were<00:01:04.030> in<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:05.019> on

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
various groups that we were in and on

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.760 
various groups that we were in and on
one<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.579> the<00:01:06.729> Warrens<00:01:07.329> training<00:01:07.840> weeks<00:01:08.049> it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
one of the Warrens training weeks it

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.980 
one of the Warrens training weeks it
would<00:01:09.030> vary<00:01:10.030> depending<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:10.690> what<00:01:10.810> we<00:01:10.900> were

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
would vary depending on what we were

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.630 
would vary depending on what we were
focusing<00:01:11.409> on<00:01:11.560> so<00:01:11.710> we<00:01:11.799> might<00:01:11.979> be<00:01:12.100> focusing<00:01:12.549> on

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
focusing on so we might be focusing on

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.640 
focusing on so we might be focusing on
something<00:01:12.820> like<00:01:13.180> short<00:01:13.930> radius<00:01:14.170> turns<00:01:14.229> and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
something like short radius turns and

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.500 
something like short radius turns and
we'd<00:01:14.740> go<00:01:14.799> through<00:01:15.190> do<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.760> lot<00:01:15.940> of<00:01:15.970> exercises

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
we'd go through do a lot of exercises

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.530 
we'd go through do a lot of exercises
the<00:01:16.930> coaches<00:01:17.290> would<00:01:17.470> do<00:01:18.030> one-to-one<00:01:19.030> feedback

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
the coaches would do one-to-one feedback

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.469 
the coaches would do one-to-one feedback
twice<00:01:20.080> a<00:01:20.110> week<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:20.530> do<00:01:20.710> video<00:01:21.010> analysis<00:01:21.549> and

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
twice a week we do video analysis and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
doing well and and so skiing down things

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.289 
doing well and and so skiing down things
now<00:04:00.829> would<00:04:01.069> go<00:04:01.220> down<00:04:01.459> anything<00:04:01.909> that<00:04:02.269> I

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
now would go down anything that I

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.149 
now would go down anything that I
dreamed<00:04:03.109> of<00:04:03.259> doing<00:04:03.379> at<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.590> start<00:04:03.799> of<00:04:03.889> course

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
dreamed of doing at the start of course

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.349 
dreamed of doing at the start of course
so<00:04:05.030> for<00:04:05.419> ankle<00:04:05.900> flex<00:04:06.169> we<00:04:06.349> did<00:04:06.500> quite<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.769> lot<00:04:06.919> of

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
so for ankle flex we did quite a lot of

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.089 
so for ankle flex we did quite a lot of
skiing<00:04:08.359> maybe<00:04:08.599> on<00:04:08.780> one<00:04:08.959> leg<00:04:09.229> or<00:04:09.470> hopping

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
skiing maybe on one leg or hopping

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.589 
skiing maybe on one leg or hopping
around<00:04:10.189> turns<00:04:10.519> to<00:04:10.699> show<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:11.000> importance<00:04:11.479> of

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
around turns to show the importance of

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.589 
around turns to show the importance of
that<00:04:11.889> for<00:04:12.889> lateral<00:04:13.040> control<00:04:13.549> we<00:04:13.729> would<00:04:13.879> do<00:04:14.120> I'm

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 
that for lateral control we would do I'm

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.939 
that for lateral control we would do I'm
focusing<00:04:15.109> on<00:04:15.169> keeping<00:04:15.409> our<00:04:15.650> life<00:04:15.799> together

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
focusing on keeping our life together

for stealing was inside leg we'd have

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.720 
for stealing was inside leg we'd have
our<00:04:29.140> hands<00:04:30.140> on<00:04:30.260> all<00:04:30.410> inside<00:04:31.130> leg<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.490> actually

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
pulling this I across to make sure that

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.190 
pulling this I across to make sure that
we<00:04:33.830> were<00:04:33.950> doing<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.960> making<00:04:35.960> sure<00:04:36.050> we<00:04:36.170> have

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
we were doing that making sure we have

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.430 
we were doing that making sure we have
the<00:04:36.410> right<00:04:36.440> hip<00:04:36.770> movement<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.940> again<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:39.050> dry

the right hip movement so again a dry

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.350 
the right hip movement so again a dry
land<00:04:39.710> exercise<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.460> actually<00:04:40.760> push<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.240> hip

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
land exercise to actually push the hip

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.150 
land exercise to actually push the hip
across<00:04:41.600> and<00:04:41.870> make<00:04:41.960> sure<00:04:41.990> that<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.410> would<00:04:42.950> hit

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
across and make sure that that would hit

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.070 
across and make sure that that would hit
the<00:04:43.280> wall<00:04:43.460> first<00:04:43.760> or<00:04:44.120> have<00:04:44.570> a<00:04:44.600> partner<00:04:44.960> there

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
the wall first or have a partner there

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.010 
the wall first or have a partner there
too<00:04:45.200> catchy<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.880> this<00:04:47.510> was<00:04:47.690> one<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.840> the

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
too catchy and this was one of the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.420 
too catchy and this was one of the
things<00:04:48.200> when<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.410> done<00:04:48.740> one<00:04:48.920> of<00:04:49.010> Warren's

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
things when I done one of Warren's

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.370 
things when I done one of Warren's
courses<00:04:49.820> before<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.900> really<00:04:51.110> makes

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
courses before that it really makes

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.110 
courses before that it really makes
sense<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:52.250> everything<00:04:52.670> that<00:04:52.760> we're<00:04:52.940> talking

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
sense and everything that we're talking

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.750 
sense and everything that we're talking
about<00:04:53.450> and<00:04:53.900> talking<00:04:54.830> about<00:04:54.950> the<00:04:55.130> biomechanics

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
about and talking about the biomechanics

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.040 
about and talking about the biomechanics
and<00:04:55.850> why<00:04:56.030> we're<00:04:56.240> doing<00:04:56.390> this<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.810> why<00:04:56.840> we're

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
and why we're doing this and why we're

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.110 
and why we're doing this and why we're
doing<00:04:57.140> that<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.620> just<00:04:57.860> makes<00:04:58.040> sense<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.670> then

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
doing that it just makes sense and then

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.750 
doing that it just makes sense and then
when<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.330> try<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.600> it<00:05:00.080> works<00:05:00.320> so<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.370> is<00:05:01.430> sort

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
when you try it it works so it is sort

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.060 
when you try it it works so it is sort
of<00:05:01.910> different<00:05:02.570> from<00:05:02.780> what<00:05:03.110> traditional<00:05:03.620> ski

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
of different from what traditional ski

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.310 
of different from what traditional ski
instructors<00:05:04.550> would<00:05:04.730> potentially<00:05:05.030> do<00:05:05.510> but<00:05:06.080> it

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
instructors would potentially do but it

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.340 
instructors would potentially do but it
works<00:05:07.450> I'd<00:05:08.450> recommend<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:09.020> cost<00:05:09.230> to

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
works I'd recommend the cost to

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.150 
works I'd recommend the cost to
absolutely<00:05:09.860> anybody<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.520> asked<00:05:10.730> about<00:05:10.880> it
