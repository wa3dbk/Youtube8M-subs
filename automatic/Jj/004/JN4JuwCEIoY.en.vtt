a<00:00:25.710> brand<00:00:26.010> new<00:00:26.040> pioneer<00:00:26.670> equipment<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.300> I'm

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
a brand new pioneer equipment and I'm

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.550 
a brand new pioneer equipment and I'm
just<00:00:27.450> going<00:00:27.600> to<00:00:27.630> show<00:00:28.020> you<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.200> couple<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.440> the

just going to show you a couple of the
features<00:00:29.100> that<00:00:29.250> I'm<00:00:29.850> liking<00:00:30.360> I'm<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
features that I'm liking I'm in the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.870 
features that I'm liking I'm in the
Pioneer<00:00:31.860> CDJ<00:00:32.450> 2000<00:00:33.500> one<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:34.740> it's<00:00:35.130> really

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
Pioneer CDJ 2000 one of them it's really

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.240 
Pioneer CDJ 2000 one of them it's really
really<00:00:36.120> good<00:00:36.330> is<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.810> needle<00:00:37.470> search<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
really good is the needle search and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.979 
really good is the needle search and
I'll<00:00:38.310> just<00:00:38.430> show<00:00:38.880> you<00:00:38.910> how<00:00:39.210> that's<00:00:39.480> working<00:00:39.720> at

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
I'll just show you how that's working at

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.620 
I'll just show you how that's working at
the<00:00:40.050> minute<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.830> a<00:00:41.210> basically<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.330> run<00:00:42.450> your

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
the minute it's a basically you run your

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.470 
the minute it's a basically you run your
finger<00:00:43.050> across<00:00:43.370> this<00:00:44.370> trap<00:00:44.640> marker<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.239> it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
finger across this trap marker here it

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.330 
finger across this trap marker here it
just<00:00:45.690> quickly<00:00:46.470> flicks<00:00:46.830> through<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.130> trap

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
just quickly flicks through the trap

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.910 
just quickly flicks through the trap
lets<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.670> review<00:00:47.940> things<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.440> really

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
lets you review things really really

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.530 
lets you review things really really
quickly<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.580> also<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:50.970> well<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.270> attracts

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
quickly and also as well and attracts

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.900 
quickly and also as well and attracts
play<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.190> as<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.430> probably<00:00:53.610> see<00:00:53.790> from

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
play in as you can probably see from

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.450 
play in as you can probably see from
this<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.360> quite<00:00:54.600> close<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> platter<00:00:56.160> you

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
this it's quite close to the platter you

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.560 
this it's quite close to the platter you
could<00:00:56.580> actually<00:00:56.700> probably<00:00:56.910> accidentally

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
could actually probably accidentally

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.180 
could actually probably accidentally
knock<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.110> mix<00:00:58.290> but<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.500> thankfully

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
knock that in the mix but it thankfully

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.670 
knock that in the mix but it thankfully
keeps<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.640> locked<00:01:00.110> so<00:01:01.110> you<00:01:01.170> actually<00:01:01.350> can't

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
keeps it locked so you actually can't

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.530 
keeps it locked so you actually can't
just<00:01:01.890> skip<00:01:02.220> through<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> track<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> mix

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
just skip through a track when you mix

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.359 
just skip through a track when you mix
in<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.440> wanted<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.770> actually<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.130> that

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
in if you wanted to actually do that

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.350 
in if you wanted to actually do that
while<00:01:05.490> it's<00:01:05.610> playing<00:01:05.759> you<00:01:05.970> switch<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
while it's playing you switch the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.270 
while it's playing you switch the
platter<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.500> run<00:01:07.680> through<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.100> like

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
platter and you can run through it like

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.090 
platter and you can run through it like
that<00:01:08.660> you<00:01:09.660> can<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.080> responsive<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.800> it

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that you can see how responsive it is it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.430 
that you can see how responsive it is it
can<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.060> start<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> loop<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
can really start to get to a loop in a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.190 
can really start to get to a loop in a
track<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.800> wanted<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.840> wanted<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.899> get<00:01:16.050> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
track if you wanted to wanted to get to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.990 
track if you wanted to wanted to get to
it<00:01:16.290> also<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.550> do<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:17.790> hit<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> loop

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
it also if you do actually hit a loop

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.100 
it also if you do actually hit a loop
you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.420> back<00:01:21.450> through<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you can actually go back through the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
you can actually go back through the
track<00:01:24.740> maybe<00:01:25.740> go<00:01:25.979> back<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> will<00:01:26.759> not<00:01:26.910> let

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
track maybe go back to it will not let

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
track maybe go back to it will not let
you<00:01:27.149> actually<00:01:27.420> pass<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.560> jump<00:01:29.039> straight<00:01:29.310> back

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you actually pass it jump straight back

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.309 
you actually pass it jump straight back
into<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.880> loop<00:01:30.060> which<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> good<00:01:31.050> little

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
into the loop which is a good little

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.930 
into the loop which is a good little
additional<00:01:31.890> feature<00:01:32.190> which<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.670> sort<00:01:32.910> of

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
additional feature which I'm sort of

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.440 
additional feature which I'm sort of
going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.179> be<00:01:33.240> pausing<00:01:33.569> to<00:01:33.869> use<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:35.190> that's

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
going to be pausing to use so that's

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.630 
going to be pausing to use so that's
sort<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.539> emulating<00:01:37.020> vinyl<00:01:37.979> sort<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
sort of emulating vinyl sort of how it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.889 
sort of emulating vinyl sort of how it
used<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.149> skipping<00:01:39.750> through<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
used to be just skipping through the

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.840 
used to be just skipping through the
track<00:01:40.200> oh<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.860> needle<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.490> it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
track oh you're the needle and it's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.609 
track oh you're the needle and it's
obviously<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.450> more<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.660> emulate<00:01:42.959> vinyl<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
obviously the more you emulate vinyl the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.169 
obviously the more you emulate vinyl the
better<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.100> because<00:01:44.160> that's<00:01:44.550> where<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.060> all

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
better it is because that's where we all

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.779 
better it is because that's where we all
started<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.899> sort<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.200> we<00:01:47.009> all<00:01:47.130> began<00:01:47.429> really

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
started and sort of we all began really

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.330 
started and sort of we all began really
on<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.750> pioneered<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.440> another<00:01:49.770> belting

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
on the so pioneered on another belting

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.730 
on the so pioneered on another belting
job<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.850> emulating<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.020> good<00:01:52.170> old<00:01:52.350> vinyl

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.980 

another<00:01:55.740> quality<00:01:56.160> feature<00:01:56.459> on<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> CDJ<00:01:57.209> 2000

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
another quality feature on the CDJ 2000

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.410 
another quality feature on the CDJ 2000
is<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.319> hot<00:01:58.590> cues<00:01:58.890> because<00:01:59.819> before<00:02:00.119> when<00:02:00.300> you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
is the hot cues because before when you

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.850 
is the hot cues because before when you
actually<00:02:00.509> used<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> take<00:02:00.959> your<00:02:01.080> hot<00:02:01.440> cue<00:02:01.619> point

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
actually used to take your hot cue point

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.900 
actually used to take your hot cue point
you<00:02:01.950> had<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.100> try<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.429> them<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.580> precise

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
you had to try and get them as precise

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.400 
you had to try and get them as precise
as<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.179> want<00:02:03.300> but<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.660> can<00:02:03.929> quantize

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
as you want but now you can quantize

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.130 
as you want but now you can quantize
them<00:02:04.709> so<00:02:04.830> we're<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.100> show<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.429> here<00:02:06.140> you've

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
them so we're just show you here you've

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.300 
them so we're just show you here you've
got<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.349> take<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.709> if<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.130> do<00:02:08.190> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
got to take one if you want to do it

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
got to take one if you want to do it
like<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> offbeat<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.330> randomly<00:02:10.050> take

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
like on the offbeat just randomly take

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.390 
like on the offbeat just randomly take
you<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:11.599> you<00:02:12.599> see<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.830> always<00:02:14.040> gonna<00:02:14.130> hit

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
you of you see it's always gonna hit

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.030 
you of you see it's always gonna hit
bang<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> first<00:02:15.530> for<00:02:16.530> speed<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:16.920> it's

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
bang on the first for speed so it's

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.680 
bang on the first for speed so it's
taken<00:02:17.400> away<00:02:17.580> about<00:02:17.730> human<00:02:18.150> error<00:02:18.330> and

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
taken away about human error and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.559 
taken away about human error and
allowing<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.650> sort<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.270> not<00:02:21.270> being

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
allowing you to sort of just not being

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.630 
allowing you to sort of just not being
too<00:02:21.780> precise<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.530> worrying<00:02:22.800> about<00:02:22.860> getting

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
too precise and worrying about getting

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.120 
too precise and worrying about getting
it<00:02:23.730> bang<00:02:23.970> gong<00:02:24.209> which<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.620> good<00:02:25.620> feature<00:02:25.800> for

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
it bang gong which is a good feature for

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.440 
it bang gong which is a good feature for
me<00:02:26.190> because<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.459> think<00:02:26.580> when<00:02:26.760> you've<00:02:26.849> got<00:02:26.970> stuff

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
me because I think when you've got stuff

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.780 
me because I think when you've got stuff
like<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:29.040> going<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.280> allow<00:02:29.490> you<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.670> be

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
like that it's going to allow you to be

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.490 
like that it's going to allow you to be
more<00:02:29.940> creative<00:02:30.180> about<00:02:30.599> worrying<00:02:31.170> about<00:02:31.260> being

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
more creative about worrying about being

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.440 
more creative about worrying about being
too<00:02:31.829> precise<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.489> getting<00:02:32.700> things<00:02:32.819> bang<00:02:33.180> gong

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
too precise of getting things bang gong

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.600 
too precise of getting things bang gong
so<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.379> quantize<00:02:34.799> in

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so the quantize in

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.480 
so the quantize in
that<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.330> also<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:37.710> loop<00:02:37.920> as<00:02:38.130> well<00:02:38.310> as

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
that and also the loop as well as

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.100 
that and also the loop as well as
quantizing<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.180> great<00:02:39.420> thing<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:39.990> it's

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
quantizing is a great thing and it's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.330 
quantizing is a great thing and it's
going<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.440> allow<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.040> be<00:02:41.130> more

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
going to just allow you to be more

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.620 
going to just allow you to be more
creative<00:02:41.670> DJ<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.610> with<00:02:47.790> fantastic<00:02:48.360> feature

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
creative DJ and with fantastic feature

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.710 
creative DJ and with fantastic feature
is<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:50.220> actually<00:02:50.550> emulation<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.270> vinyl

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
is the actually emulation of a vinyl

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.150 
is the actually emulation of a vinyl
again<00:02:51.780> here<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.860> jogwheel

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
again here you with the jogwheel

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.000 
again here you with the jogwheel
adjustment<00:02:54.230> here<00:02:55.230> I'll<00:02:55.320> just<00:02:55.440> show<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.650> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
adjustment here I'll just show you a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.330 
adjustment here I'll just show you a
spin<00:02:56.400> by<00:02:56.520> do<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:56.910> slack<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.920> can<00:02:59.070> see<00:02:59.250> how

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
spin by do it on slack you can see how

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.120 
spin by do it on slack you can see how
responsive<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.800> if<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:01.980> actually

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
responsive that is and if you actually

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.060 
responsive that is and if you actually
turn<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.610> all<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.630> way<00:03:03.750> clockwise<00:03:04.110> actually

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
turn it all the way clockwise actually

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.220 
turn it all the way clockwise actually
when<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.250> guys<00:03:05.400> get<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:06.030> get<00:03:06.810> your<00:03:06.900> hands<00:03:07.140> on

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
when you guys get to get your hands on

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.170 
when you guys get to get your hands on
them<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.440> can<00:03:07.530> actually<00:03:07.680> feel<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.430> stiffness

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
them you can actually feel the stiffness

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.610 
them you can actually feel the stiffness
words<00:03:09.390> before<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.959> map<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.290> use<00:03:10.380> math

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
words before on the map to use math

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.980 
words before on the map to use math
freeze<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:12.030> sort<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.300> turn<00:03:12.450> if<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.630> couldn't

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
freeze you sort of turn if you couldn't

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.750 
freeze you sort of turn if you couldn't
actually<00:03:13.140> feel<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:14.010> stiffness<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.550> jog

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
actually feel the stiffness in a jog

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.590 
actually feel the stiffness in a jog
wheel<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.330> far<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:16.560> be<00:03:16.650> sure<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.040> see<00:03:17.600> is

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
wheel but it's far to be sure you see is

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.600 
wheel but it's far to be sure you see is
much<00:03:19.020> stiffer<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:20.160> turn<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.489> all<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
much stiffer that is you turn it all the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.190 
much stiffer that is you turn it all the
way<00:03:20.700> back

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.320 

and<00:03:25.200> again<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.650> me<00:03:25.709> that's<00:03:26.010> emulating<00:03:26.849> vinyl

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
and again for me that's emulating vinyl

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.080 
and again for me that's emulating vinyl
great<00:03:27.709> whereas<00:03:28.709> I've<00:03:28.890> been<00:03:29.340> in<00:03:29.430> many<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.730> club

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
great whereas I've been in many a club

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.089 
great whereas I've been in many a club
when<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.450> obviously<00:03:30.810> play<00:03:30.959> on<00:03:31.110> vinyl<00:03:31.379> and<00:03:32.010> I

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
when you obviously play on vinyl and I

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.350 
when you obviously play on vinyl and I
used<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.310> try<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.489> get<00:03:32.700> like<00:03:32.819> effect<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.330> used

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
used to try and get like effect I used

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.530 
used to try and get like effect I used
to<00:03:33.599> bend<00:03:33.840> records<00:03:34.730> actually<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.390> get

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
to bend records actually just to get

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.000 
to bend records actually just to get
them<00:03:36.690> slacker<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:37.319> we'd<00:03:37.440> spin<00:03:37.620> back<00:03:37.769> on<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
them slacker so we'd spin back on the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.710 
them slacker so we'd spin back on the
platter<00:03:38.250> or<00:03:38.700> you'd<00:03:38.849> bend<00:03:39.209> them<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.450> other<00:03:39.569> way

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
platter or you'd bend them the other way

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.809 
platter or you'd bend them the other way
to<00:03:39.780> make<00:03:39.930> them<00:03:40.170> stiff<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.620> no<00:03:40.769> obviously<00:03:41.700> you

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
to make them stiff and no obviously you

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.470 
to make them stiff and no obviously you
just<00:03:41.970> got<00:03:42.209> with<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.200> flick<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.650> switch<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:45.299> to

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
just got with a flick of a switch is to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.089 
just got with a flick of a switch is to
simulate<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:46.019> vile<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> good

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
simulate in vile just like in the good

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.850 
simulate in vile just like in the good
old<00:03:47.160> days<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:48.360> success<00:03:48.870> not<00:03:49.140> many<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.470> record

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
old days the success not many a record

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.229 
old days the success not many a record
when<00:03:50.129> I've<00:03:50.250> been<00:03:50.400> doing<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:50.849> clubs

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
when I've been doing that in clubs

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.820
