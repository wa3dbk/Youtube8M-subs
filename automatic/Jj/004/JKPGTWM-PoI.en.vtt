00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
we can you know but because for the

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.140 
we can you know but because for the
image<00:05:59.569> the<00:05:59.719> elbow<00:06:00.169> going<00:06:00.440> in<00:06:00.590> there<00:06:00.800> yeah<00:06:01.150> so

image the elbow going in there yeah so

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.839 
image the elbow going in there yeah so
that's<00:06:03.050> their<00:06:03.319> job<00:06:03.500> so<00:06:03.889> if<00:06:04.009> they<00:06:04.129> crash<00:06:04.430> that's

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849

no money for the next month so that's

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.740 
no money for the next month so that's
why<00:06:06.830> they<00:06:07.009> wear<00:06:07.250> armor<00:06:07.759> they<00:06:08.090> wear<00:06:08.240> very<00:06:08.539> big
