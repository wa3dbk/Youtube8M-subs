00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.000
This is Kerrigan. There is a wave of Zerg advancing on this position. ...

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.200
... We need immediate evacuation.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.600
What happened to Kerrigan wasn't your fault.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.300
Belay that order. We're moving out.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.000
What? You're not gonna just leave her!

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.300
Vengeance doesn't factor into this. Our Revolution is about freedom.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.000
When you figure it out, let us know. We are waiting on you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.300
Sir, Dominion ships warping in.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.900
Sweet mother mercy.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.600
Bout time, we kicked this revolution into overdrive.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.800
Feels like old times already.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.200
The answers you seek lie within.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.200
Jim Raynor represents a clear and present threat to this dominion.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.500
Prince Valerian, we have Zerg attack waves incoming.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.500
Kerrigan, what's she after?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.500
She's come to finish the job.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.300
Raynor, you're in way over your head.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.700
We will see about that.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.100
Tell me, why I shouldn't kill you right now?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.300
Because I can offer you, what you have always wanted.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.700
PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.600
If the Zerg wipe everyone out, it's all been for nothing.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.500
Stand in row.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.500
THAT WILL CHANGE

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.400
So I am going back to Char...

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.800
EVERYTHING

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.600
... to get the job done.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.800
Now that's the commander, I have been waiting for.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Because the one thing I know, ...

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.900
... some things are just worth fighting for.
