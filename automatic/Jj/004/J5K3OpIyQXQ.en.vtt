00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.180
 we met in the year 2003 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.630
 I do not remember well the date in the month Perez says that we had a couple that 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.629
 is creating 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.469
 I do not remember who looked for who complained we are people according to area 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.230
 age 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.980
 sex this theme 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.659
 at that time the mst was not so well known 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.800
 that's why the political party 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.230
 time goes by 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.480
 after a timekeeper we pass the directions to give by the rcn 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.140
 these moments the pp counted was the team that I liked 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.200
 and he advised me how to get that right 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.730
 since to the boy contact 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.230
 to identify them later and some details of their personality or 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.570
 something physical 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.740
 and two how could you identify 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.400
 I have fought but good wave 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.100
 one day you asked me for a phone 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.730
 we stayed talking until about three in the morning 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.410
 the next day the same 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.930
 this moment we understand that nothing mattered 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.130
 I think we do not even have dreams 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.170
 a week 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.310
 of time so personally 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.110
 on Thursday, September 11, 2003 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.210
 this day was the house of some friends 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.630
 and remember 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.800
 I had to win 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.200
 totalize a friend 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.310
 so it was 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.530
 I put a direct pulley in viana 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.439
 a without it is still august 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.230
 and in this pact that according to mosquera scenic art 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.250
 with obviously a half mast 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.620
 I did not have with much that for wants said 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.210
 a trustee of tranquility 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.310
 of this total 11 of cristina that at this moment affirmed little the picket in this 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.570
 photo but good 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.560
 that match 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 they had me to go 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.280
 the champion 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.260
 and we went for a drink and coffee 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 and we accept it in this part of the bar 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.660
 higuain obviously we ask for head 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.310
 The moment I want to buy you cigarettes 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.460
 and he asks me if I wanted something 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.660
 it explains with ramón pi 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.149
 repeat 2 it was enough with the p 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.910
 ineco the expected 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.240
 of memory I still have the blanket 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.960
 the same day that you will register the payment of me 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.550
 and compete 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.409
 Daniela 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.359
 they are very, very annoying, you are a little bit crazy 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.359
 but the same public for skiing going very well 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.339
 I knew him from the beginning 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.170
 when you took me home before getting out of the car 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.209
 min 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.980
 good 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.839
 see you 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.589
 will say that everything is fine 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.589
 inite 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.869
 and how did I understand that you had to have you directly repeated 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:28.969
 everything comes 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.949
 and I got off 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:35.109
 the next day we spoke by telephone of claims to give us the past 13 of 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.779
 September 2003 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:37.829
 today affects us 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:38.889
 in flowers 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.889
 and we do not accept one of these goals 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.189
 in a moment we stared at each other and neither of us 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.789
 I was going to say something until I made you 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:49.889
 the concello 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.809
 we imitate theme 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.080
 witnesses look at it 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.579
 and how they criticized me I veto that I do not know why it does not give me 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.719
 ll 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.719
 forgive me telling you this but let's go soon 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:04.789
 at that time it was a little more direct than now 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.579
 we went to the car and in a moment it is still talking about anything 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.709
 and he had something like that 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.469
 like he was missing something 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:13.640
 and I made myself 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.959
 they were missing 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.959
 and we gave them our first album 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.479
 At the beginning we found ourselves in the cafe as our first exit 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.150
 it is and hacienda firms 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
 saying that on October 9, 2003 you would marry me 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:30.679
 asking competes with the date but 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:32.539
 you met with gaza 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.929
 here I have the definite evidence to marry me and so 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.569
 After several exits our courtship was built 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.929
 and soon we began to know more 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:45.119
 our taste 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.419
 our weaknesses and strengths 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:48.720
 our whims 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.079
 the children who had 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.299
 our sorrows more afraid than tusk too 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.709
 will highlight 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.609
 obviously more than you are 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.339
 and lend us eyes 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.379
 in this I did adapt 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.719
 we had many vacations together 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.719
 some world and loneliness 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.609
 some normal 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:10.589
 and others 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:13.799
 deluxe 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.359
 we have fun together 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.919
 we fought very little 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.689
 we know our machines the company 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.950
 We learned to love more as such as 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.419
 and in this case our difference 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.830
 I learned is that I must respect what the pulpero 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.950
 ibón neck 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.110
 understand what disorder is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.249
 and here I have other evidence of this 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.719
 sometimes you passed the computer 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.840
 isabá cooking costa rica 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.530
 but the best part is that despite all these differences 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.599
 the lid 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.639
 and we do not accept as such as leaving aside our shortcomings 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.860
 and thinking about the commitment we have 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.200
 as for example in our project 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.240
 but none of that 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.189
 this capital was built 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.040
 in our courtship we also had many marriages 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.300
 and so many times 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.110
 we had with this tarp rule and it's not that we're left wondering when 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.620
 that day will come 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.620
 and I can assure you that they always do 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:11.110
 higuaín 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.199
 that day, finally blind, we are living with this family and friends 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.520
 what else can we ask for? 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.909
 it's not about putting you will continue 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.710
 and they were happy ever after 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.610
 all right 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.629
 it's good that they know
