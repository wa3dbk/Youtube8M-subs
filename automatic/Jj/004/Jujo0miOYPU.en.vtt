00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.779
 Hey, everyone, everything's alright. 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.650
 Tranquil tranquility is in this video I 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:34.040
 I wanted to comment on a cause 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.900
 happened something that happened with 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.210
 cb 300 and when he was returning from 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.670
 campinas was already well proof of the next 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.430
 San Jose there would rotate about one hundred 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.930
 and a few miles and when 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:51.260
 we went to make a roundabout 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:54.530
 access to a predator an excellent building of the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.260
 dom Pedro for work pinto is the bike 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.390
 I heard a noise not for kaka was 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.100
 dude the noise is the one like a car 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.860
 making curve behind me the car 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.630
 it was very old and it is he who 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.630
 stop the car and kind of 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.190
 m is ignored the possibility of the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.290
 and I passed when he reduced the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.080
 speed and then to stop. 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.900
 no toll 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 then I saw that the noise continued and in the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.080
 The time that I went to him was decreasing. 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.270
 as death slowed 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.180
 Then I could conclude is the bike the cbb is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.930
 making a noise and I do not know what it is 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.900
 and I know it called the noise went along 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.730
 It's a stop on the shoulder and then I 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.920
 I stayed for almost 40 minutes trying 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.920
 find where an auditor of sound came from 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.430
 I imagined that it was from relation and 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.670
 I stayed with lubricant on time. 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.340
 so I spent the double on the bike 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.130
 the current in the power cut away 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.850
 and continued I passed on the part of 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.170
 bearing gives access there is continued 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.050
 making noise 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.690
 I even passed a brake system 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:18.120
 noise continued and I did not know where 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.310
 pass the noise not though I thought 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.590
 I will be making noise in the front right 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.360
 not cheap because for someone to be 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.260
 something does not happen on the bike and 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.840
 I thought about continuing the rethane that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.100
 taught the party continued result of the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.140
 trip 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.480
 we sat down and my boyfriend sitting on 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.480
 motorcycle began to swing back as if 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.040
 we had a kick in the rear not 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.800
 bring this moncho 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.720
 then the strange people first stone 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.400
 closed work 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.350
 I quit then the bike can be a 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.650
 thing on the shaft will be the shaft breaks good 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.420
 I know how to stop the bike. 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.739
 to dissipate, then we went 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.170
 pushing the bike up to a roast chicken 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.240
 in short, I went back home 70 for now 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.910
 the fear of something happening 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.290
 I got home and stopped the bike left. 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.090
 a long time stopped there after we had 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.980
 to buy something to eat 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.020
 I did not receive it to see if she 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.910
 was still making noise it is tava 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:18.000
 halt the same effect when it arrived 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.130
 on Monday morning I took acb to my 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.020
 mechanic and I said look, it's making noise 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.630
 When I took it to him, it did not make a sound. 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.110
 I was then to check some 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.490
 thing has he glanced over and 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.440
 probably talked a report to the 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:37.110
 rear wheel bearing 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.390
 sure he dismounted and there he could see 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.470
 that the rear wheel bearing had 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.910
 broke 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.280
 was simply being praised and 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.870
 broken put a picture I took not 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.220
 It is very good because it takes the phone but 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.280
 not to have an idea of â€‹â€‹how the 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.280
 progress 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.310
 the rolling in this way was logical that 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.930
 she was going to sambando one time or another 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.489
 fully rolling time 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.549
 destroyed 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.519
 Ana was enough to screw and 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.010
 the motorcycle shaft was also 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:17.310
 arranged 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:22.680
 that's where the concern was. 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.940
 because the party is rusty 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.530
 It's complicated, do not you think you bought the bike? 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.539
 There's no way you could check if rolling 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.610
 these things are all in order but 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.710
 ride the whole bike 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.510
 take a look over some things 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.510
 which is not everyone looks but look at the 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.880
 iraci look a package I've never seen 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.039
 anyone looking right ii and I found odd 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.220
 This happened so I talked to my 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.440
 mechanical normal telephone is not 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.710
 but from time to time it's good to do 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.169
 lubrication of the bearing and 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.249
 axis and there gives me a concern because 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:06.519
 I never did it on face 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:06.519
 he will stay in a building is very large 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:12.439
 and I never did it on the face then it is 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.089
 I think it might be time to 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:17.839
 do the overhaul I never did 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:21.289
 in the fese but one thing that I remembered 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:23.269
 which may be one of the reasons is that 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:35.179
 bike when I bought it came with license plate 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:37.489
 on the coast and this affects everyone knows 

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:41.049
 when you are going to buy car moto things 

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:41.049
 do not see the time of the sale 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.210
 julie towel ends up corroding a little 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.510
 and I think probably the coast 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.790
 must have occurred there inside the 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.120
 bearing something of the type that 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.130
 ended up wrong and hurt because 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.240
 have to pack new fashion clothes 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.280
 that way 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.170
 then it becomes an afterthought there for when 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.080
 buy motorcycle check if the license plate is not 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.610
 Election if foda verified more in the 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.750
 bike and if she does not have something 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.120
 failed 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.560
 It's something that might be rusty. 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.600
 which is usually an oil bolt 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.430
 apparent but as the vote is new 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.490
 these internal practices will not 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.120
 check but it is always good to 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.890
 Look at buying the bike is very complicated 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.090
 but it's loud but we look better 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:38.720
 The better the videos galera in today is 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.400
 this was more to share and 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.260
 had competed I imagine it to be a 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.350
 300 wave effect cb defect 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:49.850
 after all in a little clothes that I 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:51.500
 I searched the internet to find cases in one of 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.280
 cases that gave this type of problem 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.280
 so it's quiet 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.110
 But that's it, guys. Video 2011 is there. 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.720
 wanted to share with you is more 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:16.210
 anything we are in the comment of 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.040
 deck that everyone there is no reason 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:24.520
 for right right I do not force me to walk 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:30.900
 in the corner still open some galley 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:33.900
