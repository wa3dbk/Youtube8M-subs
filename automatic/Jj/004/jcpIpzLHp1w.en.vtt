 today chance has decided that 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.920
 I had two minutes to draw a 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.429
 one-armed dromedary who plays 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.800

 we're not going to do the modern accordion 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.119

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.649

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.800

 a little wick it's a singer it's 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.979
 a star he managed to overcome his 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.940
 disability and to become a singer I find 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:35.259
