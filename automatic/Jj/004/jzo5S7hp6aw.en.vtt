00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.090
 hello to all and humility 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.410
 I hope you are well and I 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.520
 am delighted to meet you today 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 for a new video 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.150
 but this time not in play you see 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.130
 it's my website directly doing it my 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.420
 match n youtube so then already I 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.619
 wanted to say a little trick you are 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.849
 you as then asked why are you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.840
 not good and intel and all why one 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.759
 wants pasta and subscriptions on the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 side on this side so low that's it 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.660
 simple actually it's just that I have 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.800
 I have not logged in here it is for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 that you do not see but subscription 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.870
 for those who ask me then it's 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.280
 a video about introductions 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 you remember some time ago 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.230
 you said if there are two who have 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.360
 who are artists in the soul etc 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.030
 do not hesitate to make me a little 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.110
 video etc that will make me a great pleasure 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 Well that's what I did and finally 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.289
 that's what I received earlier I 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.909
 received five introductions two videos so 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.159
 done with love and tenderness by 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.439
 subscribers so thank you to them thank you 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.630
 so much so I repeat it again 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.439
 but a job like that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.080
 no matter what it is good or 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.640
 not good or even very difficult to do 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.659
 or not difficult to do me that did not 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.030
 no importance 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.830
 it makes me really happy no matter 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.710
 what you do for me is 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.750
 really essential in the sense that I 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.700
 will never thank you enough for what 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.049
 you do for me and that kind of thing 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.540
 when I get fan art and everything 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.890
 it's super nice maybe there is 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.479
 people who love not break there are some 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.799
 people quarter round it's okay I 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.810
 tell me I love everything you love me 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.369
 do it's always great in the sense 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.350
 where there is work 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.630
 so it deserves something that deserves 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.670
 my look deserves something so 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.640
 Thank you, I leave you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.710

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.060
 three four five in the order the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.820
 description the description of the video 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.299
 there are the nicknames of designers with 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.500
 the number of the introductions and it will be 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.750
 with a voting system 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.129
 Here in right away we are left 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.129
 just after the lease introductions 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.689
 no 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.670
 who said that the gaza rock effect do not know 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.870
 what 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.290
 r- cuckoo everyone then is that 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.330
 did you like it anyway? 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.010
 really better so how are we going to do 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.370
 now because you have to choose 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.650
 a 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.540
 so then the last introduction the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.430
 fifth this is it can he did 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.319
 this is he who did it in one 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.819
 afternoon like that he said to himself I'm going 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.430
 try everything so it's great fun 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.920
 as well as confreres youtuber the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.629
 do it so thank you to him and thank you 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.430
 obviously all the others huh I want 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.110
 to say I thank them so much there is 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.510
 no problem on it but it is that 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.860
 it's nice to have more 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.069
 youtuber who are interested in what we 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.620
 done and it's pretty cool that's otherwise 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.360
 me then I will tell you when 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.220
 even the one I prefer the one I 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.650
 prefers it's number two because 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.230
 the number 2 the designer me enormously 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.940
 ask questions and in the sense that at 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.079
 every time I sent him Thursday 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.479
 I think it's a bit 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.220
 pity it could be improved he has 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.989
 immediately work and so on and then 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.880
 it took a long time to do it and everything 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.800
 so he really got involved in that 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.320
 and I think that it deserves a 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.280
 investment like that in a 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.320
 introduction it still deserves a 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.180
 big reward in the sense that in 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.460
 more to be really very very beautiful and 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.260
 very well done 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.690
 I think that maybe it's 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.720
 nice for him to say that his 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.479
 work has been rewarded for being years in 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.720
 introduction of my videos but in all 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:52.010
 case the other four for me are 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.320
 just as apt to have their chance so 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.870
 the goal now is that you vote 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.430
 1 2 3 4 or 5 you are you can 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.160
 vote only for one introduction 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.650
 like that it will avoid too many accounts 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.539
 difficult so I will count and then I 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.060
 you say thank you everyone for voting 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.620
