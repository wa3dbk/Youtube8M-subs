00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.120
 Greetings to all Hispanics we are 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.990
 in the lounge towards 2014 from l tuzsa 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.500
 presenting a new brand of 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.490
 microphones lewis microphones 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.540
 Lewis comes to offer a series of 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.029
 microphones differentiated with 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.730
 specific characteristics we started a 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.580
 little by the high-end that are microphones 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.800
 thought for the study the 940 is a 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.720
 double element transistor valves that 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.540
 allows us to mix between the two 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.309
 signals the 840 is a microphone too 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 high- end all valves series 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.600
 elec we have a whole scale of models 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.950
 more thought equally for the home studio 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.079
 with change of polar pattern with change of 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 with different performance filters 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.360
 We are also presenting as a novelty 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.430
 the 550 ft which is what we have here 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.379
 this is a prototype microphone in the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.879
 that a modification of the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.100
 structure of the microphone moving the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.480
 electronic capsule and modifying 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.880
 the electronics of the previous one so that 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.060
 you get a circuitry with zero 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.289
 you see of own noise then we have 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.570
 stereo pair microphones for percussion 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.610
 especially interesting the 640 rex that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.020
 is a microphone for bass drum with double 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.289
 capacitor element 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.950
 directly with the two signals if 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:31.250
 we went to the range of microphones 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.740
 vowels here we have 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.800
 and a proposal of microphones 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.470
 wireless in divercity 2 with a single 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.520
 receiver and then very interesting the range 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.520
 of vocal microphones 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.590
 a little following the house policy 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.630
 that everyone offers something that is a 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.610
 little different in this case the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.970
 vocal microphones when we take them off 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.070
 the hood have the switches inside 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.470
 of attenuation 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.870
 in this case change of polar pattern 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.850
 in the lighting of external LEDs 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.560
 this is the 940 it's a microphone 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.510
 hand capacitor we have the 840 that 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.700
 is a handheld microphone also in the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.160
 what 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.019
 being a dynamic microphone includes a 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.730
 previous that is fed by phantom with 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.160
 what we have a signal that conserving 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.330
 the dynamic microphone tympanum has 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.080
 a level more similar to that of a 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.819
 condenser the classic sets for 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.239
 battery and as a novelty 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.590
 as a special novelty was presented in the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.079
 Frankfurt fair and we have here the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.239
 only prototype there is the microphone 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.239
 with 650 usb 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.709
 this is a microphone 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.370
 stereo with double capsule in x and that 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.190
 incorporates a small sock that 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.190
 box allows us to connect by usb to 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.310
 iphone and it works as an interface 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.680
 audio we have 2 stereo input 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.560
 a headphone output against 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.959
 stereo output headphones midi port 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.240
 the microphone can work in a 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.790
 Hyper stereo microphone configuration 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.500
 cardio and hyper cardio and other input 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.810
 line is to say I sing and I play the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.959
 guitar and I record it all at the entrance 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.920
 line stereo directly and in the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.680
 iphone will work together with 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.620
 an application that is being developed 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.840
 in which we detect the microphone and 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.160
 we have the possibility to record the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.500
 signal 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.630
 and good a series of simple functions 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.190
 of edition 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.560
 the zoom points dialing and so on 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.250
 and this microphone we hope it's 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.230
 available in a few months and the price 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.640
 what we hope you have is below 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.380
 the 400 euros 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.330
 so this is a bit 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:13.110
 a little bit a summary of the lewis brand and 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.110
 foreros see you in the forum
