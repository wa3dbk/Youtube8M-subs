to<00:03:59.540> do<00:03:59.690> however<00:04:00.079> but<00:04:00.680> with<00:04:00.799> some<00:04:00.980> practice

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
to do however but with some practice

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.710 
to do however but with some practice
you'll<00:04:01.610> learn<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.940> perfect<00:04:02.390> moment<00:04:02.690> in

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
you'll learn the perfect moment in

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.810 
you'll learn the perfect moment in
battle<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.230> attempt<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.010> when<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.489> do

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
battle to attempt this and when you do

battle to attempt this and when you do
put<00:04:05.060> it<00:04:05.150> off<00:04:05.299> there's<00:04:05.690> nothing<00:04:06.170> more

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
put it off there's nothing more

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.280 
put it off there's nothing more

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
satisfying to do in the game sure the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.600 
satisfying to do in the game sure the
graphics<00:04:09.500> did<00:04:09.860> look<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.130> little<00:04:10.250> bit<00:04:10.400> dated

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
graphics did look a little bit dated

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.910 
graphics did look a little bit dated
even<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:11.299> the<00:04:11.420> game's<00:04:11.600> release<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.590> music

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
even on the game's release and the music

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.229 
even on the game's release and the music
is<00:04:13.040> nothing<00:04:13.430> really<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.760> write<00:04:14.000> home<00:04:14.209> about

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
is nothing really to write home about

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.870 
is nothing really to write home about
but<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.260> character<00:04:15.680> designs<00:04:16.039> our<00:04:16.280> top<00:04:16.549> class

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
but the character designs our top class

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.940 
but the character designs our top class
and<00:04:17.209> it's<00:04:17.660> not<00:04:17.810> really<00:04:18.019> much<00:04:18.200> else<00:04:18.229> like<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:18.859> on

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
and it's not really much else like it on

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.370 
and it's not really much else like it on
the<00:04:18.979> console<00:04:19.539> so<00:04:20.539> if<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.750> love<00:04:20.900> games<00:04:21.169> like

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
the console so if you love games like

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.110 
the console so if you love games like
armored<00:04:21.739> call<00:04:22.039> zone<00:04:22.400> of<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.669> enders<00:04:22.970> and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
armored call zone of the enders and

armored call zone of the enders and
Super<00:04:23.479> Robot<00:04:23.600> spirits<00:04:24.260> then<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.710> really<00:04:25.010> think

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
Super Robot spirits then I really think

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.469 
Super Robot spirits then I really think
this<00:04:25.280> is<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.430> game<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:25.729> could<00:04:26.030> be<00:04:26.120> right<00:04:26.300> at

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
this is a game that could be right at

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.690 
this is a game that could be right at
your<00:04:26.630> street<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.890> not<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.130> most<00:04:28.340> polished

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
your street it's not the most polished

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.490 
your street it's not the most polished
met<00:04:28.940> game<00:04:29.120> I've<00:04:29.270> ever<00:04:29.300> played<00:04:29.539> but<00:04:30.200> there's<00:04:30.320> no

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
met game I've ever played but there's no

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.890 
met game I've ever played but there's no
denying<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:30.950> this<00:04:31.160> is<00:04:31.310> fun<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.729> play<00:04:31.900> it's

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
denying that this is fun to play it's

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.150 
denying that this is fun to play it's
also<00:04:33.080> helped<00:04:33.470> by<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.590> fact<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:33.950> even

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
also helped by the fact that even

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.710 
also helped by the fact that even
without<00:04:34.490> knowing<00:04:34.550> any<00:04:34.910> Japanese<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:35.690> can
