 the links where they can go to download and 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.780
 well not being more water mind endow the 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.520
 game the first thing we find is 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.750
 with this beautiful maid who is going 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.210
 explaining what it is that we have to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.190
 do below how do you see this game 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.610
 is divided by territories that 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.960
 as we are advancing English and that 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.160
 we are advancing to obviously levels 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.810
 let's go unlocking these 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.440
 territories as you see this area 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.440
 deserted this one 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.879
 and diversities zones as described by zone 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.019
 they are already an area that looks more quality and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.640
 good the dora pasta that costs 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.019
 excellently and the truth that here is not 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.089
 you can appreciate it a lot but I think that 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.250
 at the moment you download it and see it in 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.780
 your devices are going to appreciate a lot 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.809
 more and good what we have to do 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.299
 here is to recover our land we 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.640
 called dragoland and prevent the 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.399
 Vikings take over her more than she 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.839
 they are already here and as you can see here 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.789
 Educate our game 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.519
 and be nice to him to be able to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.560
 obviously feed here as nothing 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.460
 I'm going to feed it and we're going to give you the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.119
 rich 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.890
 here what it tells us so it's the 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.320
 next and as I 'm feeding it 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.700
 and as they delimit it in the part 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.700
 top of the screen has obviously 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 had as stress and progressing in the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 4 obviously the trauma acquire more 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 power and we can also 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.490
 we can also claim the gold that comes out 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.070
 for sale as going up the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.540
 level dragon as in her claims 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.020
 to gold 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.360
 and with insurance we can create different 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.700
 You live like that and we can buy 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.290
 dragons but in this case and when creating a 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.150
 habitat I will create the wind habitat 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.670
 what I got here while exposing 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.650
 I also know her well in the place 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.410
 that we want to avoid 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.000
 these scholars the construction more 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.920
 fast with a gem if you saw how 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.720
 make this guide from the moment of 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.880
 build an altar they achieved dragon to the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.970
 as you can see and as I said here 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.970
 lares networks against the Vikings and good 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.940
 here as it does not also create and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.350
 good to go fight back we 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.080
 we said we have to address to 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.610
 our portal and there we will go to the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.620
 struggle not because he studies with that 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.530
 prepared very well so they can 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.190
 fight like that I'll cut him off and 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.260
 we have a vast map to be able to go 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.140
 advancing and obviously go unlocking 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.840
 as in the on the map dragons magicians and 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.120
 As you can see, it is completely folded and map 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.950
 because as we move forward is 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:50.630
 they are retiring to observe first 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.300
 let's attack as in the Viking has 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.490
 a closing dragon and I have my 200 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.350
 dragons 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.480
 and a performance and we're going to give a lot 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.370
 like today 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.370
 they have to do the graphs 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.730
 as the light the only thing that we have to 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.120
 to do is smooth our waiting 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.860
 structured and throw it obviously 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.210
 preferably rather have it in the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.090
 angle of 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.570
 when we are in green so that our 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.480
 attack is greater have greater effectiveness 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:29.220
 as on the island already destroys it and the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:33.030
 Viking gets a little cooler and 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.490
 he will always give us a comment there 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.470
 pillar of the game is very interesting that 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.709
 in a really cozy story 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.750
 and good as they see the cattle there in a 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:47.130
 chest and they give me gold and some food for 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.480
 our dragons the same but we grow 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.819
 all the video do not forget your crises of 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.660
 alain tell and see you in the next 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.660
 video chat
