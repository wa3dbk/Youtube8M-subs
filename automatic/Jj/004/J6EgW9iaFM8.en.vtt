keyboard you're not going to ride a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.870 
keyboard you're not going to ride a
battery<00:02:13.750> anytime<00:02:14.110> soon<00:02:14.320> if<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.530> do<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.820> just

battery anytime soon if you do it just

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.090 
battery anytime soon if you do it just
have<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.840> double<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.170> batteries<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.860> box

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
have to double a batteries in the box

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.520 
have to double a batteries in the box
included<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:18.910> that's<00:02:19.090> that's<00:02:19.390> good<00:02:19.720> that<00:02:20.410> they

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
included so that's that's good that they

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.400 
included so that's that's good that they
include<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:21.420> let's<00:02:22.420> take<00:02:22.630> out<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.870> actual

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
include that let's take out the actual

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.880 
include that let's take out the actual
contents<00:02:24.070> we<00:02:24.220> have<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.610> keyboard<00:02:25.090> itself<00:02:25.890> and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
contents we have the keyboard itself and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.150 
contents we have the keyboard itself and
here<00:02:27.490> i<00:02:27.520> can<00:02:27.820> see<00:02:27.850> we<00:02:28.150> have<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.750> user's<00:02:29.710> manual

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
here i can see we have the user's manual

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.560 
here i can see we have the user's manual
so<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.610> probably<00:02:30.790> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.090> explain<00:02:31.510> a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
so this is probably going to explain a

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.360 
so this is probably going to explain a
lot<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.960> what<00:02:32.110> these<00:02:32.260> extra<00:02:32.710> buttons<00:02:33.040> do<00:02:33.250> on

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
lot of what these extra buttons do on

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.250 
lot of what these extra buttons do on
the<00:02:33.460> keyboard<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.150> just<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.450> very<00:02:34.660> thin

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
the keyboard this is just a very thin

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500 
the keyboard this is just a very thin
piece<00:02:35.440> paper<00:02:35.590> we<00:02:36.460> get<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.940> instructions

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
piece paper we get all the instructions

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.380 
piece paper we get all the instructions
inside<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.560> user's<00:02:38.830> manual<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.460> I'm<00:02:39.640> gonna

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
inside of the user's manual so I'm gonna

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.030 
inside of the user's manual so I'm gonna
take<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.750> plastic<00:02:41.050> off<00:02:41.350> here<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.770> you<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:41.950> get

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
take the plastic off here so you can get

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.430 
take the plastic off here so you can get
a<00:02:42.070> better<00:02:42.220> feel<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.540> better<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:44.260> can

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
a better feel of you know better you can

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.110 
a better feel of you know better you can
you<00:02:44.860> can<00:02:44.980> see<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> lot<00:02:45.370> better<00:02:45.520> than<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.940> can

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
you can see a lot better than you can

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
you can see a lot better than you can
feel<00:02:46.600> but<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.230> keyboard<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.740> very<00:02:47.920> very<00:02:48.160> slim

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
feel but the keyboard is very very slim

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.570 
feel but the keyboard is very very slim
almost<00:02:50.140> operable<00:02:50.590> actually<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.400> is

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
almost operable actually it is

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.460 
almost operable actually it is
definitely<00:02:51.820> comparable<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.750> thinness<00:02:53.080> of

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
definitely comparable to the thinness of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.640 
definitely comparable to the thinness of
the<00:02:53.910> Mac<00:02:54.910> os10<00:02:55.330> Viet<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.080> know<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.320> apple

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
the Mac os10 Viet you know the apple

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.070 
the Mac os10 Viet you know the apple
keyboard<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.390> just<00:02:58.390> like<00:02:58.540> another<00:02:58.750> keyboard

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
keyboard and just like another keyboard

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.870 
keyboard and just like another keyboard
that<00:02:59.380> I've<00:02:59.500> recently<00:02:59.860> done<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.220> video<00:03:00.400> one<00:03:00.760> you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
that I've recently done a video one you

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.310 
that I've recently done a video one you
got<00:03:01.060> those<00:03:01.239> little<00:03:01.480> adjustable<00:03:02.020> height

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
got those little adjustable height

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.740 
got those little adjustable height
things<00:03:02.620> there<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.000> actually<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.360> good

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
things there so that is actually a good

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.540 
things there so that is actually a good
degree<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:05.110> height<00:03:05.380> for<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.830> size<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.459> this

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
degree of height for the size of this

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.390 
degree of height for the size of this
keyboard<00:03:06.880> itself<00:03:07.440> being<00:03:08.440> wireless<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.250> is

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
keyboard itself being wireless that is

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.660 
keyboard itself being wireless that is
very<00:03:09.670> very<00:03:09.940> nice<00:03:10.360> travel<00:03:10.840> big<00:03:11.080> big<00:03:11.440> keys<00:03:11.739> I

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
very very nice travel big big keys I

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.820 
very very nice travel big big keys I
think<00:03:13.120> they<00:03:13.239> say<00:03:13.690> its<00:03:13.840> ergonomics<00:03:14.440> because<00:03:14.680> if

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
think they say its ergonomics because if

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.070 
think they say its ergonomics because if
you<00:03:14.950> see<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.310> sort<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.940> curved<00:03:16.330> design<00:03:16.600> to

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
you see that sort of a curved design to

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.920 
you see that sort of a curved design to
it<00:03:17.200> have<00:03:17.620> sort<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.250> very<00:03:18.970> shallow<00:03:19.269> v-shaped

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
it have sort of a very shallow v-shaped

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.199 
it have sort of a very shallow v-shaped
design<00:03:20.260> I<00:03:20.530> see<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.100> windows<00:03:21.700> button<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
design I see a windows button on the

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.440 
design I see a windows button on the
bottom<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.870> that's<00:03:23.019> cool<00:03:23.320> um<00:03:24.239> your<00:03:25.239> touchpad

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
bottom so that's cool um your touchpad

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.509 
bottom so that's cool um your touchpad
is<00:03:25.720> going<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.930> be<00:03:26.019> up<00:03:26.170> here<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.800> not<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.100> big

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
is going to be up here it's not that big

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.040 
is going to be up here it's not that big
but<00:03:27.580> it's<00:03:27.940> definitely<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.390> lot<00:03:28.570> bigger<00:03:28.870> than

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
but it's definitely a lot bigger than

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.050 
but it's definitely a lot bigger than
