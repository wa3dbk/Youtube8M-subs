00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
up so as you can see my group is a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.380 
up so as you can see my group is a
little<00:00:17.490> too<00:00:17.730> wide<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> was<00:00:18.210> kind<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
little too wide and I was kind of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.970 
little too wide and I was kind of
uncomfortable<00:00:18.539> i<00:00:19.020> fixed<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.380> grip<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.859> my

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
uncomfortable i fixed my grip in my

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.300 
uncomfortable i fixed my grip in my
later<00:00:20.789> sets<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.720> set<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.410> feeling<00:00:23.130> kind

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
later sets but this set was feeling kind

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:35.240 
later sets but this set was feeling kind
of<00:00:23.369> awkward

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.910 

after<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.090> chin-ups<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.660> move<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.380> cable

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
after I do chin-ups I move on to cable

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.410 
after I do chin-ups I move on to cable
rows<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.400> haven't<00:00:38.610> done<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.850> lifting<00:00:39.150> quite

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
rows I haven't done this lifting quite

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.790 
rows I haven't done this lifting quite
some<00:00:39.630> time<00:00:39.810> so<00:00:40.080> I<00:00:40.140> use<00:00:40.320> pretty<00:00:40.530> lightweight

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
some time so I use pretty lightweight

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
some time so I use pretty lightweight
and<00:00:41.660> I<00:00:42.660> think<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.960> hit<00:00:43.170> four<00:00:43.650> sets<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and I think I hit four sets because I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
and I think I hit four sets because I
didn't<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.300> basically<00:00:45.960> went<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.440> light<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
didn't I basically went to light on a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.470 
didn't I basically went to light on a
set<00:00:47.040> so<00:00:47.130> I<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.340> did<00:00:47.460> another<00:00:47.580> working<00:00:48.000> set<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
set so I just did another working set I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.530 
set so I just did another working set I
think<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.050> doing<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.610> think<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.390> went

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
think I was doing one I think I went

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.840 
think I was doing one I think I went
from<00:00:51.720> 120<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> 150<00:00:53.040> on<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.309> next<00:00:53.550> time<00:00:53.730> I'll

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
from 120 to 150 on this next time I'll

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.729 
from 120 to 150 on this next time I'll
probably<00:00:54.000> start<00:00:54.330> a<00:00:54.420> consistent<00:00:55.080> 150<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.650> then

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
probably start a consistent 150 and then

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.850 
probably start a consistent 150 and then
move<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> weight<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:57.410> trend<00:00:58.410> really<00:00:58.590> focus

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
move up the weight I trend really focus

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.890 
move up the weight I trend really focus
on<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> negative<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.610> list<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.150> I'm

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
on the negative in this list because I'm

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.410 
on the negative in this list because I'm
like<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.170> noob<00:01:01.410> idiot<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:03.000> obviously<00:01:03.180> not

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
long range of motion all the way up well

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.070 
long range of motion all the way up well
almost<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.150> way<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.510> then<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
almost all the way up and then all the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.399 
almost all the way up and then all the
way<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.939> am<00:01:50.939> only<00:01:51.360> doing<00:01:51.450> 60<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.229> for

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
way down I am only doing 60 I go for

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.280 
way down I am only doing 60 I go for
three<00:01:52.650> sets<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.979> 12<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.049> I'm<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.170> get

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
three sets of 12 here and I'm not get

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.570 
three sets of 12 here and I'm not get
out<00:01:55.380> pretty<00:01:55.530> easy<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.950> I'll<00:01:56.009> probably<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:56.400> the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
out pretty easy so I'll probably up the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.910 
out pretty easy so I'll probably up the
way<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.420> maybe<00:01:57.630> 10<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.200> 12<00:01:58.409> reps<00:01:58.619> again

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
way and go for maybe 10 to 12 reps again

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.580 
way and go for maybe 10 to 12 reps again
probably<00:01:59.580> on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.970> otha<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> side<00:02:01.560> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
probably on the otha are on the side of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.940 
probably on the otha are on the side of
10<00:02:01.890> reps<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:03.439> when<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.530> increase<00:02:04.770> your

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
10 reps because when you increase your

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.530 
10 reps because when you increase your
rate<00:02:05.070> obviously<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.579> can't<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:05.970> do<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
rate obviously you can't really do the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.969 
rate obviously you can't really do the
same<00:02:06.750> amount<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.020> reps<00:02:07.259> unless<00:02:07.710> you're

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
same amount of reps unless you're

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:17.410 
same amount of reps unless you're
definitely<00:02:08.310> not<00:02:08.579> going<00:02:08.820> have<00:02:09.030> enough

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.339
