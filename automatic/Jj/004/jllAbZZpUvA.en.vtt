00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi all my name is Nikita I'm 20 years old 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.540
 free time involved 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.219
 developing every second in starcraft 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:09.919
 experience in the map editor me 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.599
 more than a year since july excess version 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.159
 which was april 2010 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.320
 during this time we have made such cards 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.769
 as a result, the Frenchman did not leave attacks and 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.410
 galaxy vampirism is now in 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.509
 developing 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.559
 also plan to build a tutor 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.599
 hand dimensions 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.539
 in the first lesson we will talk about the possibilities 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.589
 starcraft map editor 2 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.850
 First, let's talk about what types of cards you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.930
 can do with it 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.720
 first type 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.810
 map for battles 1 by 1 2 by 2 and so on 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.400
 that is, the cards that are played on 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.990
 Ladygin Batumi 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.090
 second type this card is similar to 7 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.620
 starcraft companies 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 it can also be erp aha so and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.630
 france other shandra 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.940
 The next chips are mini games for example in 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.090
 canada tetris and so on 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.490
 and the last type is this card first person 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.850
 It can be a joke until the five-story building 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.770
 power 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.180
 all this suggests that using 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.700
 starcraft map editor 2 you can make 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.410
 game of almost any genre 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.960
 now let's talk about how much time 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.740
 development of this or 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.170
 different cards 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.310
 consider it on the example itself popular 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.860
 card at the moment 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.450
 elementary defense 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 and development began in the summer of 2006 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.020
 and often about five people 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.130
 one of them was engaged in the relief of the second 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.899
 traders 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.330
 the third case is arable land and nick and so on 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.910
 that is, to clearly distribution 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.860
 responsibilities between developers 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.010
 the effectiveness of this work is much higher 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.030
 than if everyone did one person 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.490
 what does it all mean 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.700
 which means that the creation process 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.540
 seriously maps are no easier than creating 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.310
 full-fledged computer game 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.869
 let's go directly 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.650
 map editor 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.330
 I will tell in the English version 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.040
 tractor cards you ask why 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.270
 non-russian answer is very simple 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.980
 when would the holes go out editor 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.880
 cards no water learning articles 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.120
 in principle was not 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.030
 if they left then they were only on 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.430
 English language 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.150
 naturally immediately started working in 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.430
 english version map editor 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.720
 I hope that English 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.609
 Petr’s places for you 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:12.089
 Now let's go to the construction site map editor 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:13.489
 live file 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.469
 reference 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.169
 to end 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.919
 and first important settings 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.479
 this is optimization of share preservation 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.359
 the first to quickly save that is 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.169
 your paul will be saved quickly 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:26.869
 be big 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:28.709
 second for small files 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.760
 bashar asad spring will be small 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.769
 the size of us stored will be long 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.719
 choose 10 first option 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.939
 since we don’t care about file size a 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.939
 soon save the opposite 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.299
 I recommend choosing the second option 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.989
 when will you publish the cardboard 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:46.859
 Batumi 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.109
 that users are not spending too much 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.929
 downloading it 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:52.679
 also here we can choose settings 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.599
 autosave documents bye 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.340
 To be honest with this tool, I do not 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.310
 use so save every 10 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.179
 minutes 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.089
 the card makes no sense 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.219
 I manually backup card case 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.209
 regularly 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.679
 and always when I want something 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:08.780
 to test 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.099
 while I'm not afraid to spoil the card 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.749
 go to the start section 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.219
 this is the startup parameter of the map editor 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.689
 The first is what module will be 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.459
 open silently on startup 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.479
 of the editor 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.629
 the second which document will open when 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.899
 each run the map editor 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.379
 Surely you have a point Craig is not up to 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:30.129
 the end 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.109
 that is, create a new document that we 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.569
 absolutely not needed 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.479
 since every time we run the editor we 

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.499
 we will spend the extra seconds 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.289
 to create a new card 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:42.439
 here I prefer to choose an item to us 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.639
 that is nothing 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.549
 You can also select direct 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.809
 would tie to the end 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.409
 that is, the sucker editor will 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:50.120
 run 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.030
 the document that you opened in the past 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.839
 time 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:54.599
 next in construction 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.459
 this video is on a construction site 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.959
 there is one nuance 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.659
 if you drive computers 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.089
 the schedule is on the street 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.249
 that is, at low 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:03.979
 You must consider that animation 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.909
 abilities and models will 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.319
 look different from the haya chart or 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.219
 extreme 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.369
 figured out the settings 

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:15.659
 now we will create the simplest map 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.499
 with him craig 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.069
 apparently by the window 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.289
 here we can choose the type of document 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.509
 but it is clear what is 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.749
 mozart is actually like a language library 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:30.689
 programming tool kit with 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.930
 which we can work and connect 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.009
 any map of the future 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.330
 and at other congress 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.689
 this is the library which we connect 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:39.909
 to our map 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.949
 here we can you can choose the world 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.919
 This means that it will not be available. 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.559
 only from battles 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:49.279
 that is, heroes from starcraft 2 you 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.749
 will be unavailable 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.039
 if you need heroes then remove the second 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.020
 item component 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.279
 which includes all limits 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.239
 Also here you can connect other 

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:00.339
 fashion clicking 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.099
 motive aig this crowd 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:05.499
 if you forgot to connect something after 

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.400
 create 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.680
 sump at any time you can pipe 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 connect one or the other could 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.460
 the dimensions of the card go further 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.900
 here if you are not going to do 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.689
 right anshad so I do not recommend Ukraine 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.539
 advice to choose the smallest size 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.539
 map 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.830
 so ozkana and restarting 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.169
 boot map 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.400
 if you choose immediately the size of the card is 256 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.339
 a 256 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.580
 then it will load for a very long time 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.650
 also here choose the texture of the map by 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.999
 on your own 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.929
 if desired, the descendant will also be possible 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:45.339
 to change 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.589
 set the base height map 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.649
 if you need adds a random 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:52.520
 Saturn 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.520
 housing Makei 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.279
 see our cortes left 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.199
 now quickly run through each 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.770
 of the main modules 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.190
 the first module of this is he or 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.090
 relief 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.360
 we are in it 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.159
 in it we can modify 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:10.330
 relief 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
 lay the texture 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.919
 add water 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:21.270
 hill ledges 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.270
 and so on 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.779
 as follows, it is only the module 3 Kirov 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:30.969
 elegantly program certain events 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:33.719
 which occur in our map 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:35.449
 let's say primitivization card 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.159
 we need to set up initial resources 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.430
 each player 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.259
 next he shares this he passes 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:42.469
 raiter 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.789
 here we can change all the properties of the Veneti 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.329
 weapon upgrade their ability their 

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:48.190
 descriptions 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.860
 and so on 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.860
 the next object is the text module 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:58.589
 text module 

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:00.819
 All information is stored here. 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.610
 our cards 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.840
 and last about lobes 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.499
 import module 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:07.339
 It is designed to import models. 

00:07:07.339 --> 00:07:10.069
 texture icon 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:11.879
 More details on each of these modules you 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:13.909
 learn from these lessons 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:15.089
 at the end 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:18.089
 let's create yanita 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.330
 run on the cabinet 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:29.469
 I recommend by the way to learn the hot key 

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:33.129
 they download time search for this or that 

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:34.499
 tool 

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:37.869
 save precious seconds of time 

00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:40.869
 in it kontrol and 9 

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:44.210
 there is one chip here 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.559
 if something changed 

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:49.699
 want your map again 

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:52.819
 test it 

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:54.550

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.550
 just press contra again own 

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.690
 so our map is loaded into 

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.910
 times faster than if we closed the group 

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.149

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.360
