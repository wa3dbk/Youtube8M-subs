00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
it not only is this just razor sharp

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.920 
it not only is this just razor sharp
thin<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.340> also<00:00:23.490> surprisingly<00:00:23.880> got<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
thin but it's also surprisingly got a

thin but it's also surprisingly got a
full<00:00:25.590> HD<00:00:26.189> AMOLED<00:00:26.640> display<00:00:27.119> but<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
full HD AMOLED display but just like the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.560 
full HD AMOLED display but just like the
galaxy<00:00:29.039> s4<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.640> got<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> diamond<00:00:30.390> matrix

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
galaxy s4 it's got that diamond matrix

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.590 
galaxy s4 it's got that diamond matrix
pentile<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:32.099> honestly<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.759> looks<00:00:32.969> really

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
pentile but honestly it looks really

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.410 
pentile but honestly it looks really
sharp<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.559> s4<00:00:34.980> does<00:00:35.420> apparently

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
sharp just like the s4 does apparently

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.500 
sharp just like the s4 does apparently
it's<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> samsung<00:00:36.960> panel<00:00:37.820> now<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.180> see

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it's a samsung panel now you can see

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.690 
it's a samsung panel now you can see
with<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.260> iphone<00:00:40.739> 5s<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
with it with my iphone 5s which is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
with it with my iphone 5s which is
really<00:00:42.120> quite<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> thin<00:00:42.930> device<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.190> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
really quite a thin device and see that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.819 
really quite a thin device and see that
it's<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.910> little<00:00:45.270> bit<00:00:45.539> thinner

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.970 

have<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.190> bit<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.399> a<00:00:48.550> size<00:00:48.760> comparison<00:00:48.999> here<00:00:49.809> I

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
have a bit of a size comparison here I

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.130 
have a bit of a size comparison here I
really<00:00:50.980> like<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.519> gold<00:00:51.760> trim<00:00:52.089> they<00:00:52.780> did<00:00:52.960> make

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
really like the gold trim they did make

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.660 
really like the gold trim they did make
a<00:00:53.170> pretty<00:00:53.469> elegant<00:00:53.739> looking<00:00:54.070> device<00:00:54.370> they've

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
a pretty elegant looking device they've

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.869 
a pretty elegant looking device they've
also<00:00:54.820> got<00:00:55.120> it<00:00:55.239> in<00:00:55.329> black<00:00:55.600> as<00:00:55.870> well<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.699> really

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
also got it in black as well it really

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.729 
also got it in black as well it really
seems<00:00:58.299> that<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.780> thickness<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.260> this<00:00:59.409> device

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
seems that the thickness of this device

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.799 
seems that the thickness of this device
is<00:00:59.979> pretty<00:01:00.399> much<00:01:00.519> limited<00:01:01.149> by<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.570> size

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
is pretty much limited by the size

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.139 
is pretty much limited by the size
needed<00:01:02.260> for<00:01:02.409> the<00:01:02.500> ports<00:01:02.859> look<00:01:03.789> at<00:01:03.850> that<00:01:04.000> that's

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
needed for the ports look at that that's

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.690 
needed for the ports look at that that's
that's<00:01:04.390> pushing<00:01:04.930> it<00:01:05.019> almost<00:01:05.490> I'm<00:01:06.490> going<00:01:06.610> to

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
that's pushing it almost I'm going to

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.570 
that's pushing it almost I'm going to
put<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:06.939> my<00:01:07.030> pocket<00:01:07.479> for<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.659> second<00:01:08.140> I<00:01:08.350> know<00:01:09.340> my

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
put it my pocket for a second I know my

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.300 
put it my pocket for a second I know my
pockets<00:01:09.909> are<00:01:10.000> ridiculous<00:01:10.799> but<00:01:11.799> it's<00:01:11.920> very

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
pockets are ridiculous but it's very

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.389 
pockets are ridiculous but it's very
very<00:01:12.700> very<00:01:12.909> thin<00:01:13.240> I'd<00:01:13.479> imagine<00:01:14.020> if<00:01:15.009> you<00:01:15.250> were

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
very very thin I'd imagine if you were

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.940 
very very thin I'd imagine if you were
to<00:01:15.580> be<00:01:15.700> wearing<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.390> know<00:01:16.420> guy<00:01:16.780> jeans<00:01:17.170> you

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
to be wearing you know guy jeans you

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.010 
to be wearing you know guy jeans you
probably<00:01:18.159> wouldn't<00:01:18.520> feel<00:01:18.820> this<00:01:19.090> at<00:01:19.509> all<00:01:19.780> in

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
probably wouldn't feel this at all in

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.090 
probably wouldn't feel this at all in
there<00:01:20.200> it's<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.979> thin

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
there it's just that thin

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.590 
there it's just that thin
so<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:24.220> terms<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.820> design<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.360> phone

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
so in terms of the design of the phone

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.120 
so in terms of the design of the phone
you<00:01:25.810> can<00:01:25.960> see<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.290> we've<00:01:26.409> got<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.710> proximity

you can see that we've got the proximity

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.609 
you can see that we've got the proximity

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
side I'm not quite used to that and then

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.139 
side I'm not quite used to that and then
we've<00:02:04.899> got<00:02:04.929> a<00:02:05.440> micro<00:02:05.920> SIM<00:02:06.160> card<00:02:06.460> tray<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:06.850> need

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
we've got a micro SIM card tray you need

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.419 
we've got a micro SIM card tray you need
to<00:02:07.270> use<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> sim<00:02:07.750> ejection<00:02:08.050> tool<00:02:08.259> what<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.220> can

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
to use a sim ejection tool what I can

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.210 
to use a sim ejection tool what I can
see<00:02:09.610> here<00:02:09.640> there<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.300> no<00:02:10.570> way<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.110> install<00:02:11.920> a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
see here there is no way to install a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.600 
see here there is no way to install a
micro<00:02:13.030> SD<00:02:13.330> card<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.440> memory<00:02:14.769> is<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.370> as

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
micro SD card so the memory is just as

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.390

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
impressive because I would not be

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.759 
impressive because I would not be

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
about battery life they do have a power

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.839 
about battery life they do have a power
manager<00:02:36.110> setting<00:02:36.500> inside<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:37.010> here<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.640> have

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
manager setting inside of here you have

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.910

what's<00:02:40.220> consuming<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.000> battery<00:02:41.269> power<00:02:41.540> so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
what's consuming the battery power so

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.440 
what's consuming the battery power so
underneath<00:02:42.530> power<00:02:42.890> settings<00:02:43.400> says<00:02:44.000> enable

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
underneath power settings says enable

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.380 
underneath power settings says enable
condition<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.129> can<00:02:46.370> choose<00:02:46.610> when<00:02:47.030> you

condition so you can choose when you
would<00:02:47.629> like<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.140> power<00:02:48.319> saving<00:02:48.739> mode<00:02:48.769> to

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
would like the power saving mode to

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.460 
would like the power saving mode to
activate<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.239> see<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.470> immediately

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
which would be all the time ten percent

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.449 
which would be all the time ten percent
twenty<00:02:54.109> percent<00:02:54.440> thirty<00:02:54.799> percent<00:02:55.099> forty

percent so that's nice you do have some

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.589 
percent so that's nice you do have some
options<00:02:57.470> here<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.790> then<00:02:59.000> we<00:02:59.120> do<00:02:59.239> have<00:02:59.420> some

it's got a little bit of a green to it
so<00:03:52.170> taking<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.770> look<00:03:52.800> at<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.130> camera<00:03:53.520> we<00:03:53.640> have

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
so taking a look at the camera we have

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.280 
so taking a look at the camera we have
two<00:03:53.940> different<00:03:54.090> cameras<00:03:54.570> on<00:03:54.720> here<00:03:54.960> we<00:03:55.080> have

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
two different cameras on here we have

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.860 
two different cameras on here we have
just<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.860> normal<00:03:56.190> camera<00:03:56.430> applications<00:03:57.120> but

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
just the normal camera applications but

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.480 
just the normal camera applications but
what<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.020> like<00:03:58.200> about<00:03:58.230> what<00:03:58.590> gionee<00:03:58.890> does<00:03:59.130> here

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
what I like about what gionee does here

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.010 
what I like about what gionee does here
is<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.850> underneath<00:04:00.150> settings<00:04:00.630> you've<00:04:00.810> got<00:04:00.990> a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
is that underneath settings you've got a

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.660 
is that underneath settings you've got a
bunch<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.830> different<00:04:01.950> settings<00:04:02.460> for<00:04:02.610> the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
camera so you can mess around with the
