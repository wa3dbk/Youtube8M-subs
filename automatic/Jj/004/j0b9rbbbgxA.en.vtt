 I take you as my wife. 

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.207

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.410
 --- and as long as we're together. 

00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:41.011
 - How nice when I remembered the old times ... 

00:00:41.012 --> 00:00:43.312

 ONLY BEGINNING 

00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:16.617
 -This is impossible. 

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:24.518
 - The baby's growing up, it's dangerous ... 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.619
 ...too fast. 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.720
 - He's trying to get out. 

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.021
 -You shouldn't. 

00:01:31.222 --> 00:01:32.322
 -You did that. 

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:34.623
 - I can't see the future of Bella anymore. 

00:01:35.624 --> 00:01:38.924
 - You know they feed them before it's too late. 

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.825
 - At that moment you will try to trap a enemy soon. 

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:47.426
 - I'm skeptical that you're Bella. 

00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:48.427
 - I'm the one who lost you. 

00:01:48.528 --> 00:01:49.828
 - What is it --- 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.929

 -Are you ready ? They're coming for Bella. 

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:55.832
 - They won't even talk. 

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:58.633
 - If you're going to kill him, I'm the first! 

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:14.934
 -Bell to! 

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.235
