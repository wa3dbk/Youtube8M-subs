00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 or techno nauta after a long day 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.120
 of work we finish in the best way 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.500
 with the galaxy s 5 here in our hand 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.219
 Well yes we have attended the presentation 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 to a long awaited 5 pack and so 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.679
 publicized online, we have 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.839
 been first city we have strained 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.160
 very fast after trying all the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.990
 ham sandwiches we could 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 us that the first row and already 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.949
 we have in our hands the piece of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 galaxy s 5 that today I good to great 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.730
 traits I would highlight that it has a design 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.470
 very similar to the previous versions 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 as for example the 04 even the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.059
 galaxy no 3 this is pretty much like 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.489
 and good the first things that you see 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.920
 So at first glance it's good that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.079
 screen is 5.1 inches and that's 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.230
 important to note are not 5.2 as 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.079
 I could think with resolution full hd or hd 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 it is not exact as was also thought 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.710
 otherwise good we will continue to see 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.710
 the design as we said is a bit 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.120
 similar to the previous models but in 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.829
 the back we find ourselves with 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.559
 a back cover that although it is of 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.940
 good plastic looks like it 's 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.100
 Well, a little rubber does not give you a 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.470
 feeling with holes with dots and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.590
 I also have the feeling that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.150
 is prepared for the water that well 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.790
 expiration has water resistance 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.650
 has a screen of 67 that what 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.190
 basically allows after resisting 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.800
 Water 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.590
 we do not recommend that you mate with him 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.230
 in a river niÃ¡gara if it is not a with that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.660
 with this terminal but yes that is 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.550
 resist to press rain and others and 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.500
 other setbacks with water is a 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.120
 of the main novelties of this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.890
 samsung galaxy s 5 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.930
 On the other hand I would also highlight 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.800
 the specifications then to large 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.150
 features the 2800 milliamp battery 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.130
 maybe we enter a tad more having 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.630
 consider the size of the device but 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.090
 I think it holds up pretty well 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.410
 it holds up pretty well the day in fact it 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.380
 said he's going to come with a mode of 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.210
 Battery saving that will allow to endure 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.970
 with 10 percent up to 24 hours in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.979
 standby because it will leave the colors to a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.420
 side if you pass the screen to white and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.119
 black when you see yourself in the situation 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 critique of the battery and also 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.259
 commenting on performance 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.880
 highlight the quad-core processor 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.979
 to 200 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.890
 good otherwise we can tell you that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.870
 finally it brings a way of security 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.450
 of fingerprint recognition in this 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.920
 case is on the same button a little bit being 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.810
 the apple line but that works 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.510
 a different way you have to put your finger 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.070
 over and down like this and it would take us this 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.930
 and this moment does not really work 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.130
 because you have to configure what we will talk about 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.640
 in another moment more carefully 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.380
 but well it works that way and 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.170
 we keep talking about the camera my camera 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.220
 the good camera upload megapixels goes up 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.060
 the three 16 megapixel feet we have a 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.250
 camera than in the presentation in this 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.680
 aspect taking good pictures is to the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.660
 users we ask often and in this case 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.610
 not only do we have more megapixels, but 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.550
 we have a much more focus on 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.020
 fast in this case the camera have influenced 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.540
 also quite the presentation for 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.550
 focus on 0.3 seconds that is if 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.050
 we see for example go to ronaldinho 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.660
 in front of our noses because what 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.730
 we can capture because we can have a 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.170
 very fast approach is something that has been 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.820
 one of the great novelties of this 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.260
 camera and good if it was ronaldinho not 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.000
 it would be so difficult 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.720
 it's one of the things that have called the most 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.290
 the attention of this camera and eye to the data 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.510
 you see this this let's say flash there's 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.190
 here, it is not a flash in the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.610
 presentation have told us that here 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:35.050
 there is a cardiovascular sensor that is 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.420
 to control the pulsations in 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.010
 effect in this case yes good one is 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.570
 flash but the others are sensors 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.340
 sensors that serve for this 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.900
 punctually another of the things 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.510
 interesting is that the 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.160
 touchwiz interface feels a bit more 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.860
 that nothing we notice here when we go to 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.310
 settings to the settings and we see that it is 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.480
 full of different options than good 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.570
 maybe they vary a bit but good here 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.810
 up we have the quick options 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.700
 we also have an option to here 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.360
 being to the left of the menu we 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.050
 we find a kind of magazine 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.360
 let's also say 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.070
 in the htc mobile and so on that is also 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.110
 similar where we can hang good 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.580
 our favorite applications of 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.040
 facebook and others and go see the 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.810
 news technically now that will have 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.280
 that being here I do not know on the other hand I 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.650
 I think it's also important to highlight 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.170
 that can be synchronized with the galaxy 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.090
 gear 2 which is the new smart watch of the 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.330
 company and also with the band 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.410
 samsung 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.510
 the new one has already been left is that of 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.150
 serve we can find both 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.220
 terminals or both devices here 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.960
 we show it here we have it 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.570
 here next you can synchronize 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.580
 and for exercise and fitness 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.400
 from day to day because it can be a 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.960
 perfect accessory good we make a 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.930
 farewell all color with the screen of 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.910
 start of samsung galaxy s 5 more 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.760
 forward we will make more videos analyzing it 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.170
 for specifications and good nothing else 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.790
 to say for now if only 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.380
 say goodbye more as always 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.910
 subscribe to our channel if you do not 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.470
 you have done that you see the list of 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.720
 reproduction that we are preparing from 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.240
 this mobile world congress 2014 that is 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.950
 very full of videos and finally that 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.570
 share this video and all those who
