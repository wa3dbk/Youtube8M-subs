00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.140
 we will see 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.250
 and 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.580
 what pink wave how is it years or the cousin 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.920
 alone and good but I'm very good at this 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.160
 I have a very good news for you 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.439
 bald and is that the xbox 360 will support 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.599
 2 terabyte hard drives the console 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.520
 will receive a major update and 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.369
 good as they had announced in March 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.560
 a group of users elected from 360 then 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.360
 has had access to the previous program 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.770
 service that allows them to install new 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.720
 updates and improvements in their 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.550
 systems before they are released to 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.110
 general public that program already 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
 I found available a long time ago 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.430
 the xbox one but good apparently one of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.920
 the features most requested by 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.690
 users of the 360 ​​because they have finally been 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.640
 well implemented in what is the most 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 recent update is about the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.570
 possibility to use hard drives 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.850
 external devices up to 2 terabytes for 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 store games avatar add-ons and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.770
 many more things the previous limit was 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.259
 much smaller then at 32 gb without further 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.549
 remember then good is also announced 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.710
 that the system will no longer require 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.780
 reservation storage at 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.790
 that the space on your hard drive will yield 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.530
 a little more and also that way it will be possible 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.760
 use two external hard drives at 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.250
 Same time 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.010
 this update is made public very 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.140
 very soon so well you know go 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.730
 buying your 2 terabyte disk this 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.080
 they will be occupying it for obviously 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.610
 the new update and they can 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.590
 download all the games in my case I 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 I have about 250 games 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.610
 digital ones which I have to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.160
 be erasing to obviously download 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.680
 another and play and then erase that is 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.150
 download another and so the truth is very 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.100
 frustrating and here I would like to have 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.810
 all the games on the console and the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.040
 can not be true even though I already 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.020
 I have a disc of a terabyte, not what 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.670
 you can use so with this 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.650
 update obviously I'm going to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.910
 can connect and can download all 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.100
 the games and so not having to erase 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.120
 none more or less today I already have a 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.920
 320GB disc and I have like 110 games 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.050
 downloaded now there are more imagine 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.270
 sorry having what are two terabytes 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.610
 how many can I have in the console the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.100
 this news is truly impressive 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.860
 I like the personal thing very much and when 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.320
 I read this the truth I was surprised 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.240
 quite and it really made me very happy 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.150
 so well I hope you too 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.410
 you liked the news and that it is 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.480
 just as happy as me 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.069
 memories use social networks 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.480
 for Madrid it's like this if you have any 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 doubt or something simply that a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.720
 I will try to comment on 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.400
