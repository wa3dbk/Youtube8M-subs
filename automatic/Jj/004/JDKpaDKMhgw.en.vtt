them off instead to have all of the
relation<00:02:16.300> here<00:02:17.080> again<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.830> levels

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
relation here again we have the levels

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.540 
relation here again we have the levels

then<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.270> have<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.920> relation<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.130> North

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
then we have a relation of the North

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.910 
then we have a relation of the North

you go to view click on relation here

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.270 
you go to view click on relation here
you<00:02:38.710> have<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.950> possibility<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.840> position<00:02:40.840> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
you have the possibility of position a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.100 
you have the possibility of position a
relation<00:02:42.280> icon<00:02:42.610> as<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.120> can<00:02:43.270> see<00:02:43.510> right<00:02:43.540> well

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
relation icon as you can see right well

from<00:02:44.800> right<00:02:45.160> to<00:02:45.550> left<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:46.090> could<00:02:46.570> just<00:02:47.470> position

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
from right to left I could just position

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.590 
from right to left I could just position
it<00:02:48.160> here<00:02:48.520> there's<00:02:48.850> different<00:02:49.209> ways<00:02:49.330> of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
it here there's different ways of

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.860 
it here there's different ways of
turning<00:02:50.320> this<00:02:50.650> around<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.310> could<00:02:51.700> click<00:02:52.570> on<00:02:52.720> it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
turning this around I could click on it

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.760 
turning this around I could click on it
the<00:02:53.620> big<00:02:53.980> circle<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.239> could<00:02:55.480> rotate<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.590> and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
the big circle and I could rotate it and

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.610 
the big circle and I could rotate it and
then<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.190> can<00:02:57.760> get<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.150> relation<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.290> not

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
then you can get a relation that is not

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.910 
then you can get a relation that is not
parallel<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.730> x<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.420> y<00:03:01.600> axis<00:03:02.140> I<00:03:02.380> could

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
parallel to the x and y axis I could

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.760 
parallel to the x and y axis I could
also<00:03:03.040> do<00:03:03.310> something<00:03:03.640> else<00:03:04.030> or<00:03:04.959> just<00:03:05.020> simply

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
also do something else or just simply

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.000 
also do something else or just simply
bit<00:03:06.130> in<00:03:06.280> here<00:03:06.550> click<00:03:07.270> on<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.420> icon<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:07.989> as<00:03:08.680> you

can<00:03:09.160> see<00:03:09.190> here<00:03:09.489> i<00:03:09.640> can<00:03:10.030> click<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.750> these<00:03:11.220> boxes

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
can see here i can click on these boxes

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.880 
can see here i can click on these boxes
and<00:03:12.400> if<00:03:13.090> i<00:03:13.209> click<00:03:13.480> this<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.200> will<00:03:14.260> create<00:03:14.650> a

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
relation in this direction and i could

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.280 
relation in this direction and i could
remove<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.430> one<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:18.880> will<00:03:19.000> also<00:03:19.209> delete<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
remove this one it will also delete the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
was just rotate a little bit I just do

was just rotate a little bit I just do
it<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.989> way<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.440> we<00:03:35.980> don't<00:03:36.130> know<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.790> exact

this verse 8 of this line for example

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.420 
this verse 8 of this line for example
could<00:03:45.640> be<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:46.000> go<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.780> architecture<00:03:47.709> create

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
could be that go to architecture create

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.140 
could be that go to architecture create
a<00:03:48.459> wall<00:03:48.880> picked<00:03:49.690> lines<00:03:50.130> pick<00:03:51.130> a<00:03:51.310> line<00:03:51.610> from<00:03:51.940> the

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
a wall picked lines pick a line from the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.240 
a wall picked lines pick a line from the
existing<00:03:53.049> model<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.799> will<00:03:53.890> create<00:03:54.160> a

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
existing model and then it will create a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.570 
existing model and then it will create a
wall<00:03:54.610> then<00:03:55.060> we<00:03:55.180> can<00:03:55.330> go<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.650> view<00:03:56.650> activate<00:03:57.400> a

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
wall then we can go to view activate a

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.020 
wall then we can go to view activate a
relation<00:03:58.090> now<00:03:58.989> it<00:03:59.290> recognized<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.430> there<00:04:00.940> is

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
relation now it recognized that there is

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.140 
relation now it recognized that there is
a<00:04:01.060> wall<00:04:01.420> here<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:01.810> maybe<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:03.100> want<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.489> make<00:04:04.120> a

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
a wall here and maybe you want to make a

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.080 
a wall here and maybe you want to make a
parallel<00:04:04.720> relation<00:04:05.620> just<00:04:06.040> here<00:04:06.310> so<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.820> could

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
parallel relation just here so I could

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.630 
parallel relation just here so I could
just<00:04:07.650> move<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.860> clothes<00:04:09.040> around<00:04:09.190> here<00:04:09.549> you

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
just move the clothes around here you

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.819 
just move the clothes around here you
can<00:04:09.790> see<00:04:09.970> it's<00:04:10.120> flip<00:04:10.630> if<00:04:10.959> you'd<00:04:11.230> want<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.500> look

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
can see it's flip if you'd want to look

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.370 
can see it's flip if you'd want to look
from<00:04:12.790> this<00:04:13.000> side<00:04:13.239> or<00:04:13.480> this<00:04:13.510> side<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:14.140> could

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
from this side or this side it could

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.920 
from this side or this side it could
maybe<00:04:14.620> with<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.040> side<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:16.419> reason<00:04:16.600> for

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
maybe with this side so the reason for

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.259 
maybe with this side so the reason for
for<00:04:17.410> creating<00:04:18.010> this<00:04:18.160> wall<00:04:18.400> was<00:04:18.549> just<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:18.970> have

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
for creating this wall was just to have

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.400 
for creating this wall was just to have
it<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.750> intelligent<00:04:20.680> snap<00:04:21.370> function<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:23.080> I

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
it this intelligent snap function so I

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.190 
it this intelligent snap function so I
