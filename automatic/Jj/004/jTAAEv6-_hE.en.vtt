to<00:03:04.639> want<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.880> feed<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.239> chain<00:03:05.510> through<00:03:05.780> that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
to want to feed the chain through that

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.069 
to want to feed the chain through that
hole<00:03:09.459> depending<00:03:10.459> on<00:03:10.549> where<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.760> is<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.900> may

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
hole depending on where that is you may

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.750 
hole depending on where that is you may
have<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.290> lot<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.680> slack<00:03:12.919> or<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.220> little<00:03:13.489> slack

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
have a lot of slack or a little slack

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.870 
have a lot of slack or a little slack
with<00:03:14.299> your<00:03:14.510> safety<00:03:14.840> chain<00:03:15.370> take<00:03:16.370> up<00:03:16.609> enough

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
with your safety chain take up enough

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.240 
with your safety chain take up enough
slack<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:17.930> wear<00:03:18.109> that<00:03:18.349> no<00:03:18.799> matter<00:03:18.950> how<00:03:19.190> the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
slack so wear that no matter how the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.940 
slack so wear that no matter how the
trailer<00:03:19.849> tongue<00:03:20.180> moves<00:03:20.870> or<00:03:21.230> as<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:21.650> would<00:03:21.769> say

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
trailer tongue moves or as we would say

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.550 
trailer tongue moves or as we would say
articulates<00:03:22.930> you're<00:03:23.930> not<00:03:24.079> going<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.349> do<00:03:24.440> this

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
articulates you're not going to do this

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.659 
articulates you're not going to do this
chain<00:03:24.769> is<00:03:24.889> not<00:03:25.010> going<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.220> drag<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.639> ground

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
chain is not going to drag on the ground

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.400 
chain is not going to drag on the ground
so<00:03:26.000> one<00:03:26.180> technique<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.750> you<00:03:26.840> can<00:03:26.900> do<00:03:27.169> is<00:03:27.319> you

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
so one technique that you can do is you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.960 
so one technique that you can do is you
can<00:03:27.530> twist<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.919> chain<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> little<00:03:28.280> bit

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
can twist the chain a little bit

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.580 
can twist the chain a little bit
that<00:03:29.970> will<00:03:30.090> take<00:03:30.240> up<00:03:30.360> some<00:03:30.540> slack<00:03:30.750> then<00:03:31.440> you're

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
that will take up some slack then you're

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.010 
that will take up some slack then you're
going<00:03:31.710> to<00:03:31.860> feed<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.310> through<00:03:32.340> itself<00:03:33.020> then

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
going to feed it through itself then

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.990 
going to feed it through itself then
you're<00:03:34.110> going<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.260> take<00:03:34.380> this<00:03:34.530> rubber

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
you're going to take this rubber

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.250 
you're going to take this rubber
