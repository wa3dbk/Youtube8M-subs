otherwise it's basically like having to
configure<00:00:47.550> every<00:00:48.000> individual<00:00:48.539> unit<00:00:49.039> if<00:00:50.039> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
configure every individual unit if you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.790

then you can also change the scale of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.450 
then you can also change the scale of
those<00:01:06.840> unit<00:01:07.110> frames<00:01:07.290> their<00:01:07.770> height<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.310> width

those unit frames their height and width
multiplier<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> I'll<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:09.659> this

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
multiplier and I'll get to all this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
multiplier and I'll get to all this
later<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.290> their<00:01:10.710> horizontal<00:01:11.040> position<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
later and their horizontal position in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.710 
later and their horizontal position in
the<00:01:11.729> vertical<00:01:11.939> position<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> group's<00:01:14.189> menu

the vertical position the group's menu

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
the vertical position the group's menu
allows<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> change<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.680> lot<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> aspects

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
allows you to change a lot of aspects

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
allows you to change a lot of aspects
about<00:01:17.369> things<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.790> your<00:01:17.909> party<00:01:18.150> where<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
about things like your party where you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.560 
about things like your party where you
can<00:01:18.720> change<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.860> height<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.400> width<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.360> each

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
can change the height and width of each

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300 
can change the height and width of each
individual<00:01:22.140> frame<00:01:22.170> well<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> guess<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> will

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
individual frame well I guess that will

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.280 
individual frame well I guess that will
you<00:01:23.430> change<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:23.939> collectively<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:25.170> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
you change them all collectively but it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.780 
you change them all collectively but it
can<00:01:25.409> also<00:01:25.470> change<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.070> position<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
can also change the position of the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.630 
can also change the position of the
spacing<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:28.259> lot<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> other<00:01:29.130> options<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
spacing and a lot of other options that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.630 
spacing and a lot of other options that
are<00:01:29.729> available<00:01:30.890> it'll<00:01:31.890> regularly<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.490> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
are available it'll regularly out of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.050 
are available it'll regularly out of
there<00:01:32.850> under<00:01:33.600> modules<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> change<00:01:35.060> or

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
there under modules you can change or

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
there under modules you can change or
you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.180> enable<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.720> disable<00:01:36.780> modules<00:01:37.409> just

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you can enable and disable modules just

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.590 
you can enable and disable modules just
like<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.860> pitbull<00:01:38.159> 3<00:01:38.400> i've<00:01:38.610> disabled<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.479> of

like in pitbull 3 i've disabled a lot of

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.730 
like in pitbull 3 i've disabled a lot of
them<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:39.780> i<00:01:39.900> thought<00:01:40.110> weren't<00:01:40.350> particularly

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
them but i thought weren't particularly

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.219 
them but i thought weren't particularly

little<00:03:43.940> wired<00:03:44.269> or<00:03:44.630> wider<00:03:44.989> than<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:46.040> target

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
little wired or wider than the target

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.030 
little wired or wider than the target
frame<00:03:46.579> just<00:03:47.060> because<00:03:47.299> we<00:03:47.450> change<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:48.040> a

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
frame just because we change that a

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.659 
frame just because we change that a
couple<00:03:49.790> things<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.030> note<00:03:50.150> first

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
couple things to note first

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.039 
couple things to note first
unfortunately<00:03:52.669> you<00:03:53.180> can<00:03:53.450> out<00:03:53.599> you<00:03:53.630> can<00:03:53.959> no

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
unfortunately you can out you can no

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.789 
unfortunately you can out you can no
longer<00:03:54.290> mouse<00:03:54.739> over<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.910> scroll<00:03:56.299> bar<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.799> or

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
longer mouse over the scroll bar to or

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.240 
longer mouse over the scroll bar to or
the<00:03:57.919> slider<00:03:58.099> to<00:03:58.280> change<00:03:59.090> with<00:03:59.599> but<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.950> can

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
the slider to change with but you can

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.550 
the slider to change with but you can
enter<00:04:01.639> values<00:04:02.060> in<00:04:02.209> these<00:04:02.329> little<00:04:02.510> boxes<00:04:02.720> so

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
enter values in these little boxes so

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.490 
enter values in these little boxes so
let's<00:04:03.709> say<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:03.829> wanted<00:04:04.069> this<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.340> be<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:05.200> 15<00:04:06.200> to

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
let's say I wanted this to be to 15 to

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.949 
let's say I wanted this to be to 15 to
40<00:04:06.799> I<00:04:06.859> guess<00:04:07.069> is<00:04:07.310> what<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:07.459> wanted<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.970> be<00:04:08.060> you

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
40 I guess is what I wanted it to be you

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.839 
40 I guess is what I wanted it to be you
can<00:04:09.349> add<00:04:09.530> that<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:10.069> you<00:04:10.220> can<00:04:10.400> do<00:04:10.489> that<00:04:10.609> in

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
can add that and you can do that in

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.990 
can add that and you can do that in
increments<00:04:11.329> of<00:04:11.569> 1<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:13.220> can<00:04:13.519> help<00:04:13.880> with

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
increments of 1 it can help with

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.659 
increments of 1 it can help with
precision<00:04:14.799> in<00:04:15.799> terms<00:04:16.639> of<00:04:16.849> sizing<00:04:17.329> etc<00:04:18.669> and

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
precision in terms of sizing etc and

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.069 
precision in terms of sizing etc and
that's<00:04:19.910> for<00:04:20.120> each<00:04:20.239> time<00:04:20.479> you<00:04:20.570> see<00:04:20.719> a<00:04:20.750> slider

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
that's for each time you see a slider

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.100 
that's for each time you see a slider
for<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.500> most<00:04:21.680> part<00:04:21.829> you<00:04:21.979> can<00:04:22.159> do<00:04:22.340> that

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
for the most part you can do that

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.589 
for the most part you can do that
and<00:04:23.379> so<00:04:24.189> these<00:04:24.430> three<00:04:24.610> options<00:04:25.060> here<00:04:25.449> under

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
and so these three options here under

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.689 
and so these three options here under
the<00:04:25.719> general<00:04:25.870> tab<00:04:25.990> change<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.400> overall

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
the general tab change the overall

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.550 
the general tab change the overall
appearance<00:04:28.419> of<00:04:28.719> the<00:04:28.810> frame<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.259> you<00:04:29.349> can

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
appearance of the frame so you can

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.959 
appearance of the frame so you can
increase<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.159> height<00:04:30.310> of<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.520> frame<00:04:30.729> or<00:04:30.939> the

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 
increase the height of the frame or the

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.719 
increase the height of the frame or the
width<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.389> frame<00:04:31.539> it<00:04:32.250> indirectly<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.490> guess

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
width of the frame it indirectly I guess

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.760 
width of the frame it indirectly I guess
effects<00:04:34.150> in<00:04:34.389> the<00:04:34.569> other<00:04:34.810> sizes<00:04:35.020> of<00:04:35.259> individual

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
effects in the other sizes of individual

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.390 
effects in the other sizes of individual
bars<00:04:35.979> but<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:37.300> but<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.800> mostly<00:04:39.159> just

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
bars but on the but it mostly just

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.570 
bars but on the but it mostly just
changes<00:04:39.909> how<00:04:40.360> big<00:04:40.659> and<00:04:40.840> small<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:42.280> entire

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
changes how big and small the entire

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.909 
changes how big and small the entire
frame<00:04:42.939> is<00:04:43.830> editing<00:04:44.830> bars<00:04:45.069> is<00:04:45.430> very<00:04:45.819> similar<00:04:46.090> to

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
frame is editing bars is very similar to

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.249 
frame is editing bars is very similar to
editing<00:04:47.919> bars<00:04:48.129> and<00:04:48.310> pitbull<00:04:48.580> three<00:04:49.080> one<00:04:50.080> nice

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
editing bars and pitbull three one nice

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.209 
editing bars and pitbull three one nice
feature<00:04:50.289> is<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:51.039> can<00:04:52.620> have<00:04:53.620> individual

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.219 
feature is that you can have individual

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:56.580 
feature is that you can have individual
bar<00:04:54.400> textures<00:04:54.969> so<00:04:55.479> as<00:04:55.629> you<00:04:55.750> can<00:04:55.870> see<00:04:56.110> when<00:04:56.560> I

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
bar textures so as you can see when I

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.170 
bar textures so as you can see when I
pick<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:57.099> under<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.580> general<00:04:57.759> tab<00:04:57.909> and

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
pick that under the general tab and

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.570 
pick that under the general tab and
applied<00:04:58.419> it<00:04:58.449> to<00:04:58.569> both<00:04:58.840> but<00:04:59.800> later<00:04:59.979> as<00:05:00.340> you'll

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
applied it to both but later as you'll

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.499 
applied it to both but later as you'll
see<00:05:00.759> i<00:05:00.789> can<00:05:01.029> pick<00:05:02.490> unique<00:05:03.490> textures<00:05:04.180> for<00:05:04.360> each

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
see i can pick unique textures for each

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.379 
see i can pick unique textures for each
bar<00:05:04.750> spacing<00:05:05.740> just<00:05:06.340> changes<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.699> spacing<00:05:07.210> in

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
bar spacing just changes the spacing in

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.379 
bar spacing just changes the spacing in
between<00:05:07.449> each<00:05:08.050> bar<00:05:08.729> so<00:05:09.729> you<00:05:09.759> no<00:05:09.939> longer<00:05:10.000> have

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
between each bar so you no longer have

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.909 
between each bar so you no longer have
to<00:05:10.539> use<00:05:10.659> your<00:05:10.779> blank<00:05:11.050> space<00:05:11.319> in<00:05:11.349> order<00:05:11.770> to

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
to use your blank space in order to

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.649 
to use your blank space in order to
create<00:05:12.099> spacing<00:05:12.849> differential<00:05:13.360> between<00:05:13.449> the

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
create spacing differential between the

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.459 
create spacing differential between the
two<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.650> then<00:05:14.830> patting<00:05:16.349> increases<00:05:17.349> and

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
two and then patting increases and

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:20.550 
two and then patting increases and
decreases<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:18.099> padding<00:05:18.460> around<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:19.349> edge<00:05:20.349> of

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
decreases the padding around the edge of

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.019 
decreases the padding around the edge of
the<00:05:20.620> unit<00:05:20.919> frame<00:05:21.099> so<00:05:21.310> that<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.520> can<00:05:21.669> have<00:05:21.849> more

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029 
the unit frame so that you can have more

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:25.860 
the unit frame so that you can have more
complicated<00:05:22.270> borders<00:05:24.629> looking<00:05:25.629> at<00:05:25.779> the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
complicated borders looking at the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.180 
complicated borders looking at the
health<00:05:26.050> bar<00:05:26.229> you'll<00:05:26.439> see<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.620> couple<00:05:26.860> of<00:05:27.009> things

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
health bar you'll see a couple of things

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.740 
health bar you'll see a couple of things
you<00:05:27.310> can<00:05:27.460> enable<00:05:27.789> or<00:05:27.849> disable<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.360> health<00:05:28.509> bar

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
you can enable or disable the health bar

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.100 
you can enable or disable the health bar
but<00:05:29.500> you<00:05:29.529> can<00:05:29.710> also<00:05:29.830> change<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.310> size<00:05:31.110> the

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
but you can also change the size the

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.589 
but you can also change the size the
position<00:05:32.529> and<00:05:32.770> then<00:05:33.310> again<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.060> texture<00:05:34.419> so<00:05:34.569> I

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
position and then again the texture so I

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.959 
position and then again the texture so I
could<00:05:34.810> have<00:05:34.960> this<00:05:35.110> be<00:05:35.289> just<00:05:35.949> awful<00:05:36.279> texture<00:05:36.789> or

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
could have this be just awful texture or

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.490 
could have this be just awful texture or
I<00:05:37.029> could<00:05:37.810> have<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.139> just<00:05:38.469> be<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.740> same<00:05:40.500> side

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
I could have it just be the same side

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.149 
I could have it just be the same side
changes<00:05:42.180> basically<00:05:43.180> can<00:05:43.930> create<00:05:44.199> a<00:05:44.229> vertical

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
changes basically can create a vertical

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.899 
changes basically can create a vertical
unit<00:05:45.430> frame<00:05:45.639> if<00:05:45.819> you<00:05:45.940> pick<00:05:46.150> left<00:05:46.629> or<00:05:46.839> right<00:05:47.909> it

depletes<00:05:51.939> in<00:05:52.180> this<00:05:52.419> direction<00:05:52.659> rather<00:05:53.349> than

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
depletes in this direction rather than

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.829 
depletes in this direction rather than
that<00:05:54.129> direction<00:05:54.550> but<00:05:55.330> if<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.569> leave<00:05:55.689> them

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
that direction but if you leave them

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.450 
that direction but if you leave them
both<00:05:56.020> as<00:05:56.169> Center<00:05:56.529> they<00:05:56.949> will<00:05:57.129> just<00:05:57.310> be

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
both as Center they will just be

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.029 
both as Center they will just be
standard<00:05:57.909> horizontal<00:05:58.479> bars<00:05:58.659> this<00:05:59.589> allows<00:05:59.800> you

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
standard horizontal bars this allows you

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.379 
standard horizontal bars this allows you
to<00:06:00.189> create<00:06:00.339> a<00:06:00.520> hub<00:06:00.699> there<00:06:00.879> are<00:06:00.969> a<00:06:01.000> couple<00:06:01.120> other

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
to create a hub there are a couple other

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:02.939 
to create a hub there are a couple other
features<00:06:01.629> that<00:06:01.960> allow<00:06:02.080> you<00:06:02.259> to<00:06:02.439> create<00:06:02.589> a<00:06:02.740> HUD

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
features that allow you to create a HUD

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.640 
features that allow you to create a HUD
and<00:06:03.819> so<00:06:04.300> keep<00:06:04.629> those<00:06:04.779> in<00:06:04.930> mind<00:06:04.960> if<00:06:05.199> that's<00:06:05.319> the

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
and so keep those in mind if that's the

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.980 
and so keep those in mind if that's the
direction<00:06:05.770> you<00:06:06.069> want<00:06:06.099> to<00:06:06.310> go<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.839> can<00:06:07.839> also

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
direction you want to go you can also

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.350 
direction you want to go you can also
change<00:06:08.259> the<00:06:08.409> bar<00:06:08.680> height<00:06:08.919> which<00:06:09.430> basically

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
change the bar height which basically

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.790 
change the bar height which basically
changes<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:10.990> amount<00:06:11.080> of<00:06:11.289> space<00:06:11.469> that<00:06:11.529> it

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
changes the amount of space that it

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.079 
changes the amount of space that it
takes<00:06:11.949> up<00:06:12.099> within<00:06:12.339> the<00:06:12.460> unit<00:06:12.729> frame<00:06:12.939> it

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:13.089 
takes up within the unit frame it

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:14.579 
takes up within the unit frame it
doesn't<00:06:13.330> actually<00:06:13.449> change<00:06:13.689> unit<00:06:14.199> frame<00:06:14.379> size

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:14.589 
doesn't actually change unit frame size

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:17.490 
doesn't actually change unit frame size
you<00:06:15.460> can<00:06:15.610> switch<00:06:15.849> it<00:06:16.000> to<00:06:16.050> fill<00:06:17.050> instead<00:06:17.409> of

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
you can switch it to fill instead of

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.170 
you can switch it to fill instead of
deplete<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:18.310> can<00:06:18.490> reverse<00:06:18.879> the<00:06:19.029> direction

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
deplete you can reverse the direction

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.939 
deplete you can reverse the direction
instead<00:06:19.689> of<00:06:20.050> right<00:06:20.229> to<00:06:20.379> left<00:06:20.529> it<00:06:20.710> could<00:06:20.830> go

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
instead of right to left it could go

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:22.529 
instead of right to left it could go
left<00:06:21.159> to<00:06:21.310> right<00:06:21.370> or<00:06:21.520> bottom<00:06:21.909> up<00:06:22.180> instead<00:06:22.479> of

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
left to right or bottom up instead of

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.740 
left to right or bottom up instead of
top<00:06:22.810> down<00:06:23.729> you<00:06:24.729> can<00:06:24.879> also<00:06:25.000> change<00:06:25.270> the<00:06:25.479> full

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
top down you can also change the full

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.779 
top down you can also change the full
opacity<00:06:26.020> which<00:06:26.620> is<00:06:26.860> what<00:06:27.159> appears<00:06:27.550> when<00:06:27.699> the

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
opacity which is what appears when the

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.329 
opacity which is what appears when the
bar<00:06:28.000> has<00:06:28.569> something<00:06:29.050> in<00:06:29.169> it<00:06:29.289> and<00:06:29.439> then<00:06:30.009> the

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
bar has something in it and then the

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.399 
bar has something in it and then the
empty<00:06:30.639> opacity<00:06:31.149> there's<00:06:31.659> a<00:06:31.750> ghost<00:06:31.959> bar<00:06:32.229> behind

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
empty opacity there's a ghost bar behind

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.570 
empty opacity there's a ghost bar behind
each<00:06:33.039> one<00:06:33.339> of<00:06:33.370> these<00:06:33.550> bars

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
each one of these bars

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.700 
each one of these bars
and<00:06:34.819> then<00:06:35.060> reducing<00:06:35.870> the<00:06:35.930> empty<00:06:36.199> opacity

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
and then reducing the empty opacity

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.360 
and then reducing the empty opacity
changes<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:38.409> you<00:06:39.409> can<00:06:39.560> also<00:06:39.680> change<00:06:39.949> colors

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
changes that you can also change colors

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.820 
changes that you can also change colors
or<00:06:40.580> create<00:06:41.449> a<00:06:41.509> custom<00:06:41.870> color<00:06:42.020> and<00:06:42.319> that's<00:06:42.680> the

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
or create a custom color and that's the

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.520 
or create a custom color and that's the
same<00:06:43.009> between<00:06:43.280> the<00:06:43.460> two<00:06:43.610> of<00:06:43.729> them<00:06:43.879> and<00:06:44.810> just<00:06:45.439> to

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
same between the two of them and just to

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.629 
same between the two of them and just to
give<00:06:45.650> you<00:06:45.710> a<00:06:45.740> quick<00:06:45.860> example<00:06:45.889> if<00:06:46.340> you<00:06:46.400> wanted

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
give you a quick example if you wanted

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.469 
give you a quick example if you wanted
to<00:06:46.759> create<00:06:47.030> a<00:06:47.060> HUD<00:06:47.300> let's<00:06:48.020> say<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:50.150> wanted

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
to create a HUD let's say you wanted

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:53.350 
to create a HUD let's say you wanted
this<00:06:50.539> the<00:06:51.469> left<00:06:51.620> hand<00:06:51.830> side<00:06:51.949> in<00:06:52.580> power<00:06:52.909> bar<00:06:53.150> on

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
this the left hand side in power bar on

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.730 
this the left hand side in power bar on
the<00:06:53.479> right<00:06:53.509> hand<00:06:53.840> side<00:06:53.960> and<00:06:54.319> you<00:06:54.409> can<00:06:54.560> see<00:06:54.710> that

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
the right hand side and you can see that

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.059 
the right hand side and you can see that
looks<00:06:55.210> ridiculous<00:06:56.349> but<00:06:57.349> if<00:06:57.439> you<00:06:57.530> go<00:06:57.650> back<00:06:57.830> to

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:58.069 
looks ridiculous but if you go back to

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:00.010 
looks ridiculous but if you go back to
the<00:06:58.159> general<00:06:58.460> tab<00:06:58.639> here<00:06:59.090> and<00:06:59.539> you<00:06:59.689> inverse

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
the general tab here and you inverse

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.319 
the general tab here and you inverse
heights
