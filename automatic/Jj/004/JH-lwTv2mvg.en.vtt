00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.700 
obviously spawn at the hub location
which<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:52.430> set<00:00:52.720> so<00:00:53.720> in<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.960> config<00:00:54.380> you<00:00:54.530> can

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
which you set so in the config you can

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
edit a variety of things so we're going

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.690 
edit a variety of things so we're going
to<00:00:56.900> go<00:00:57.050> over<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.380> in<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.800> second<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:58.430> here<00:00:58.610> we

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
to go over that in a second so here we

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.550 
to go over that in a second so here we
are<00:00:58.730> in<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.060> plugins<00:00:59.390> folder<00:00:59.540> and<00:00:59.930> if<00:01:00.290> we<00:01:00.440> go

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
are in the plugins folder and if we go

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.290 
are in the plugins folder and if we go
into<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.800> central<00:01:01.100> hub<00:01:01.250> plus<00:01:01.489> we<00:01:02.030> have<00:01:02.180> these

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
into the central hub plus we have these

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.999 
into the central hub plus we have these
two<00:01:02.540> files<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.079> bottom<00:01:03.350> one<00:01:03.470> is<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
two files so the bottom one is the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.399 
two files so the bottom one is the
location<00:01:04.759> which<00:01:04.879> set<00:01:05.059> in<00:01:05.150> game<00:01:05.360> for<00:01:06.079> the<00:01:06.140> spawn

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
location which set in game for the spawn

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.580 
location which set in game for the spawn
and<00:01:06.649> in<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:07.490> config<00:01:07.999> is<00:01:08.210> all<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.079> important

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
and in the config is all the important

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.440 
and in the config is all the important
values<00:01:10.069> that<00:01:10.219> you<00:01:10.310> can<00:01:10.399> change<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.299> let's

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
values that you can change so let's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.419 
values that you can change so let's
start<00:01:11.719> at<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:11.929> bottom<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:12.409> this<00:01:13.039> is<00:01:13.310> the

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:13.429 
start at the bottom and this is the

start at the bottom and this is the
title<00:01:14.119> menu<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:14.780> when<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.049> join<00:01:15.319> this<00:01:15.710> pops<00:01:15.950> up

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
title menu so when you join this pops up

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.629 
title menu so when you join this pops up
you<00:01:16.549> can<00:01:16.700> change<00:01:16.939> that<00:01:17.179> if<00:01:18.079> you<00:01:18.139> want<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.639> the

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:22.120 
you can change that if you want and the
tab<00:01:19.969> menu<00:01:20.149> where<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:20.929> could<00:01:21.139> make<00:01:21.319> a<00:01:21.530> website

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
tab menu where you could make a website

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.609 
tab menu where you could make a website
or<00:01:22.490> information<00:01:23.359> about<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.659> server<00:01:23.929> maybe

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
or information about the server maybe

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.190 
or information about the server maybe
the<00:01:24.799> server<00:01:25.009> name<00:01:25.219> up<00:01:25.399> here<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.200> craft<00:01:27.200> server

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
the server name up here so craft server

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.160 
the server name up here so craft server
something<00:01:30.200> like<00:01:30.319> that<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:30.880> here<00:01:31.880> we<00:01:32.119> have<00:01:32.450> all

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
something like that and here we have all

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.989 
something like that and here we have all
the<00:01:33.560> important<00:01:34.130> features<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:34.729> can<00:01:34.850> turn

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
the important features that you can turn

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.559 
the important features that you can turn
on<00:01:35.209> and<00:01:35.359> off<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.289> for<00:01:36.530> example<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:38.090> can<00:01:38.299> clear

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
on and off so for example you can clear

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.090 
on and off so for example you can clear
venturi<00:01:38.929> on<00:01:39.049> joying<00:01:39.350> if<00:01:39.499> you've<00:01:39.649> got<00:01:39.950> a

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
venturi on joying if you've got a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.370 
venturi on joying if you've got a
plug-in<00:01:40.609> which<00:01:40.850> gives<00:01:41.539> automatically<00:01:42.170> gives

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
plug-in which gives automatically gives

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.149 
plug-in which gives automatically gives
you<00:01:42.469> items<00:01:42.859> such<00:01:43.280> as<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.490> compass<00:01:43.999> and<00:01:45.159> trails

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
you items such as a compass and trails

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.699 
you items such as a compass and trails
and<00:01:46.850> other<00:01:47.090> stuff<00:01:47.389> like<00:01:47.569> that<00:01:47.709> disable

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
and other stuff like that disable

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.249 
and other stuff like that disable
placing<00:01:49.130> blocks<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.880> want<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:51.109> people
