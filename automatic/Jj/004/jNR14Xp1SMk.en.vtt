00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
excited for the game I think that you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:57.280 
excited for the game I think that you
can<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.450> lot<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> fun<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:42.989> there

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:06.240 

we<00:00:57.829> haven't<00:00:58.010> gettin<00:00:58.190> up<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.340> goal<00:00:58.579> that's<00:00:58.850> right

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.790 

yeah<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:07.280> think<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.640> shows<00:01:07.880> that<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:09.350> we<00:01:09.560> can

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
yeah I think it shows that that we can

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.719 
yeah I think it shows that that we can
go<00:01:10.100> in<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.880> have<00:01:11.300> success<00:01:11.800> and<00:01:12.800> it<00:01:12.920> as<00:01:13.220> a

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
go in and and have success and it as a

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.490 
go in and and have success and it as a
team<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:14.420> builds<00:01:14.720> confidence<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:17.170> yeah<00:01:18.170> just

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
team it builds confidence and yeah just

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.890 
team it builds confidence and yeah just
that<00:01:18.650> that<00:01:19.190> we<00:01:19.940> can<00:01:20.090> go<00:01:20.210> into<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:20.630> kind<00:01:20.869> of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
that that we can go into that kind of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.390 
that that we can go into that kind of
environment<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.690> not<00:01:23.690> know<00:01:24.259> that<00:01:24.530> we're

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
environment and and not know that we're

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.930 
environment and and not know that we're
gonna<00:01:25.490> lose<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.300> game<00:01:26.479> but<00:01:27.430> yeah<00:01:28.430> just<00:01:28.729> just

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
still was a little bit nervous before

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.320 
still was a little bit nervous before
the<00:03:03.800> game<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.250> warm-ups<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.030> when<00:03:05.239> the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
national anthems were playing I think

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.690

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
everyone was probably a little nervous

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.680 
everyone was probably a little nervous

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
best team ever no I I think I think that

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.879 
best team ever no I I think I think that
as<00:04:21.829> soon<00:04:21.889> as<00:04:22.160> you<00:04:22.280> start<00:04:22.520> thinking<00:04:22.669> that<00:04:22.970> way

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
as soon as you start thinking that way

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.279 
as soon as you start thinking that way
your<00:04:24.889> performance<00:04:25.490> will<00:04:25.699> go<00:04:26.600> down<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.870> think

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
your performance will go down I think

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.990 
your performance will go down I think
you<00:04:28.220> know<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.889> mark<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.370> good

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
you know the the mark of a good

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.230 
you know the the mark of a good
professional<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.889> it's<00:04:33.889> going<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.370> playing

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
professional is it's going in playing

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.850 
professional is it's going in playing
game<00:04:35.510> like<00:04:35.690> Matt<00:04:35.870> did<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.320> then<00:04:36.410> coming<00:04:36.710> back

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
game like Matt did and then coming back

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.980 
game like Matt did and then coming back
here<00:04:37.039> and<00:04:37.280> playing<00:04:37.550> exactly<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.510> same<00:04:38.690> way<00:04:38.840> so

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
here and playing exactly the same way so

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.900 
here and playing exactly the same way so
I<00:04:39.380> don't<00:04:39.949> think<00:04:40.100> you<00:04:40.160> can<00:04:40.310> really<00:04:40.460> look<00:04:40.669> at<00:04:40.789> as

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
confidence is a huge part and and we

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.760 
confidence is a huge part and and we
definitely<00:05:43.790> gained<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.300> lot<00:05:44.450> of<00:05:44.600> it<00:05:44.720> so<00:05:45.020> we're

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
definitely gained a lot of it so we're

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.320 
definitely gained a lot of it so we're
you<00:05:46.190> know<00:05:46.220> we're<00:05:46.580> just<00:05:46.610> going<00:05:46.880> to<00:05:46.910> have<00:05:47.060> to<00:05:47.090> use

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.490 
that experience is what we're going to
take<00:05:53.920> yeah<00:05:54.920> for<00:05:55.430> not<00:05:55.880> not<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.750> certain<00:05:57.320> play
