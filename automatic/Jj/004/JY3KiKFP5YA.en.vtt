Redfield<00:00:06.089> from<00:00:06.420> Hot<00:00:06.600> Toys<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:07.639> have<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.820> say<00:00:09.030> I

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
Redfield from Hot Toys I have to say I

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.140 
Redfield from Hot Toys I have to say I
actually<00:00:09.980> it's<00:00:10.980> very<00:00:11.070> hard<00:00:11.490> for<00:00:11.639> me<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.880> decide

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
actually it's very hard for me to decide

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.950 
actually it's very hard for me to decide
which<00:00:12.389> Chris<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.750> like<00:00:12.960> better<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:14.360> mean<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.690> guess

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
which Chris I like better I mean I guess

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.800 
which Chris I like better I mean I guess
I<00:00:16.490> guess<00:00:17.490> overall<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.910> kind<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.300> like<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.630> one

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I guess overall I kind of like this one

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.599 
I guess overall I kind of like this one
a<00:00:18.840> little<00:00:18.960> better<00:00:19.170> only<00:00:20.100> because<00:00:20.400> there's

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
a little better only because there's

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.320 
a little better only because there's
been<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.820> couple<00:00:21.890> improvements<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.430> various

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
been a couple improvements to various

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.609 
been a couple improvements to various
things<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.750> we'll<00:00:24.960> get<00:00:25.050> into<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.260> little<00:00:25.410> bit

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
things that we'll get into a little bit

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.250 
things that we'll get into a little bit
later<00:00:25.939> although<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> still<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:28.170> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
later although some of the still some of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.109 
later although some of the still some of
the<00:00:28.380> problems<00:00:28.859> still<00:00:29.340> persist<00:00:29.789> from<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the problems still persist from the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.530 
the problems still persist from the
other<00:00:30.269> Chris<00:00:30.570> as<00:00:30.750> well<00:00:31.850> for<00:00:32.850> example<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
other Chris as well for example the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
other Chris as well for example the
headset<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:34.559> I'll<00:00:34.680> get<00:00:34.860> there's<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.309> different

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
headset but I'll get there's a different

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
headset but I'll get there's a different
problem<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.270> Chris<00:00:36.570> than<00:00:36.750> there<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:36.989> on

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
problem on this Chris than there was on

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.360 
problem on this Chris than there was on
the<00:00:37.260> other<00:00:37.410> Chris<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:37.829> I'll<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.309> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the other Chris but I'll get into that a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.420 
the other Chris but I'll get into that a
little<00:00:38.550> later<00:00:39.469> but<00:00:40.469> apparently<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.070> Resident

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
little later but apparently in Resident

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.319 
little later but apparently in Resident
Evil<00:00:41.610> 5<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:43.800> stars<00:00:44.280> version<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> Chris<00:00:45.149> is

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
Evil 5 this stars version of Chris is

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.069 
Evil 5 this stars version of Chris is
actually<00:00:46.010> unlockable<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.840> mercenaries<00:00:48.840> mode

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
actually unlockable in mercenaries mode

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.500 
actually unlockable in mercenaries mode
and<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.500> think<00:00:49.710> also<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> campaign<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.940> think

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and I think also in the campaign I think

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
and I think also in the campaign I think
you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.960> play<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.289> him<00:00:52.500> instead<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> BSAA

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
you can play as him instead of the BSAA

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.330 
you can play as him instead of the BSAA
Chris<00:00:54.320> but<00:00:55.320> apparently<00:00:55.680> he<00:00:55.770> also<00:00:55.800> looked<00:00:56.219> like

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
Chris but apparently he also looked like

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.889 
Chris but apparently he also looked like
this<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> earlier<00:00:57.270> games<00:00:57.600> only

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
this in some of the earlier games only

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.810 
this in some of the earlier games only
apparently<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> less<00:00:58.980> beefy<00:00:59.460> version<00:00:59.989> but

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
apparently a less beefy version but

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.670 
apparently a less beefy version but
pretty<00:01:02.820> much<00:01:02.879> accessories<00:01:03.570> wise<00:01:03.750> he<00:01:04.110> actually

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
pretty much accessories wise he actually

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.609 
pretty much accessories wise he actually
doesn't<00:01:04.949> come<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.519> much<00:01:05.820> overall

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
doesn't come with that much overall

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.480 
doesn't come with that much overall
compared<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.710> some<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.010> other<00:01:08.130> figures

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
compared to some of the other figures

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550 
compared to some of the other figures
like<00:01:08.640> Wesker<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> lot<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> stuff<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.470> that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
like Wesker had a lot of stuff here that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
like Wesker had a lot of stuff here that
doesn't<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.950> too<00:01:11.130> much<00:01:11.540> but<00:01:12.540> he<00:01:12.659> has<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
doesn't have too much but he has a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.679 
doesn't have too much but he has a
couple<00:01:13.260> big<00:01:14.010> things<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.509> up

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
couple big things that kind of make up

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.249 
couple big things that kind of make up
for<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.460> but<00:01:17.460> he<00:01:18.030> comes<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.990> sheath

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
for it but he comes with this sheath

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.550 
for it but he comes with this sheath
that<00:01:19.560> attaches<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.700> his<00:01:21.180> vest<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
take that out because once you get that

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.730

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
Wesker's magnum Chris's is just a little

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.359 
Wesker's magnum Chris's is just a little
more<00:01:59.219> gold<00:01:59.490> than<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:01.670> he<00:02:02.670> comes<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.240> an

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
more gold than this is he comes with an

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.800 
more gold than this is he comes with an
extra<00:02:05.369> shirt<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.210> worn<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
extra shirt that can be worn with the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.830 
extra shirt that can be worn with the
BSAA<00:02:07.290> Chris<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.979> guess<00:02:08.340> like<00:02:09.330> from<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
BSAA Chris I guess like from the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.820 
BSAA Chris I guess like from the
beginning<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> game<00:02:10.530> when<00:02:10.709> you're

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
beginning of the game when you're

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.920 
beginning of the game when you're
walking<00:02:10.979> when<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> first<00:02:11.580> meet<00:02:11.790> Sheva

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
walking when you first meet Sheva

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.670 
walking when you first meet Sheva
he<00:02:13.680> comes<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.189> the<00:02:14.959> standard<00:02:15.959> sidearm<00:02:16.260> which

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
he comes with the standard sidearm which

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.110 
he comes with the standard sidearm which
I<00:02:16.769> must<00:02:16.920> say<00:02:17.010> has<00:02:17.219> a<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.489> better<00:02:17.640> holster

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
I must say has a much better holster

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.699 
I must say has a much better holster
this<00:02:18.299> time<00:02:18.510> because<00:02:18.719> it<00:02:18.840> actually<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.290> molded

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
this time because it actually is molded

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.979 
this time because it actually is molded
to<00:02:19.859> fit<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.129> gun<00:02:20.689> he<00:02:21.689> has<00:02:21.810> his<00:02:21.959> basic<00:02:22.409> sidearm

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
to fit the gun he has his basic sidearm

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.420 
to fit the gun he has his basic sidearm
with<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> removable<00:02:25.319> clip<00:02:25.709> as<00:02:26.069> usual<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:28.430> it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
with a removable clip as usual and it

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.899 
with a removable clip as usual and it
slides<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.540> easily<00:02:31.280> once<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.700> there

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
slides in very easily once you get there

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:33.229 
slides in very easily once you get there
go

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
go

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.940 
go
slides<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.019> very<00:02:34.200> easily<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:34.769> you<00:02:34.829> can

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
slides in very easily and then you can

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.610 
slides in very easily and then you can
bring<00:02:35.099> this<00:02:35.250> back<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.819> hold<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.629> in<00:02:36.750> place<00:02:36.870> very

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
bring this back to hold it in place very

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.869 
bring this back to hold it in place very
good<00:02:37.950> improvement<00:02:38.280> over<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.849> other<00:02:39.000> figure

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
good improvement over the other figure

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.819 
good improvement over the other figure
and<00:02:41.959> he<00:02:42.959> pretty<00:02:43.200> much<00:02:43.319> comes<00:02:43.560> with<00:02:43.739> the

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
and he pretty much comes with the

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.659 
and he pretty much comes with the
headset<00:02:44.219> and<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.459> couple<00:02:44.639> extra<00:02:45.000> pouches<00:02:45.419> and

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:46.669 
headset and a couple extra pouches and

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.830 
headset and a couple extra pouches and
here's<00:02:47.669> the<00:02:47.819> problem<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.299> have<00:02:48.480> with<00:02:48.629> this

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
here's the problem I have with this

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.599 
here's the problem I have with this
headset<00:02:50.930> whereas<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.230> other<00:02:52.379> Kriss<00:02:53.099> 4

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
headset whereas the other Kriss 4

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.240 
headset whereas the other Kriss 4
headset<00:02:54.030> would<00:02:54.269> not<00:02:54.480> stay<00:02:55.079> on<00:02:55.349> his<00:02:55.560> ear<00:02:55.859> this

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
headset would not stay on his ear this

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.339 
headset would not stay on his ear this
one<00:02:56.489> stays<00:02:56.760> in<00:02:56.790> pretty<00:02:57.239> well<00:02:57.980> however

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
one stays in pretty well however

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.140 
one stays in pretty well however
apparently<00:03:01.349> there's<00:03:02.159> a<00:03:02.219> little<00:03:02.489> clip<00:03:02.760> right

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
apparently there's a little clip right

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.140 
apparently there's a little clip right
here<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:04.200> holds<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.829> wire<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.669> the<00:03:05.790> headset

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
here that holds this wire to the headset

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.800 
here that holds this wire to the headset
and<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:07.139> fell<00:03:07.349> off<00:03:07.969> so<00:03:08.969> I<00:03:09.000> guess<00:03:09.389> when<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:09.659> comes

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and it fell off so I guess when it comes

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.240 
and it fell off so I guess when it comes
to<00:03:09.900> these<00:03:10.019> headsets<00:03:10.469> if<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:10.919> ain't<00:03:11.040> one<00:03:11.219> thing

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
to these headsets if it ain't one thing

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.909 
to these headsets if it ain't one thing
it's<00:03:11.489> another<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:13.200> hopefully<00:03:13.590> that'll<00:03:13.799> be

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
it's another so hopefully that'll be

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:19.729 
it's another so hopefully that'll be
easily<00:03:14.340> fixable<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:16.190> last<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.400> not<00:03:17.519> least<00:03:18.739> he

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
easily fixable and last but not least he

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.819 
easily fixable and last but not least he
comes<00:03:19.979> with<00:03:20.220> an<00:03:20.459> enormous<00:03:20.849> minigun<00:03:21.680> which<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
comes with an enormous minigun which you

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.649 
comes with an enormous minigun which you
can<00:03:23.010> unlock<00:03:23.129> in<00:03:23.519> Resident<00:03:23.879> Evil<00:03:24.090> 5<00:03:24.269> there's

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
can unlock in Resident Evil 5 there's

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.330 
can unlock in Resident Evil 5 there's
the<00:03:24.810> pack<00:03:25.639> here's<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.790> bullet<00:03:27.000> ammo<00:03:27.449> chain

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
and here's the gun itself that he holds

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.039 
and here's the gun itself that he holds
and<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:33.510> rotates<00:03:34.319> like<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:35.569> I'll<00:03:36.569> post<00:03:36.780> him

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
and this rotates like that I'll post him

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.420 
and this rotates like that I'll post him
with<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.379> little<00:03:37.650> later<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.949> show<00:03:38.129> it<00:03:38.280> off

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
with that a little later to show it off

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.949 
with that a little later to show it off
but<00:03:40.729> get<00:03:41.729> more<00:03:41.879> of<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.060> close-up<00:03:42.329> view<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.810> them

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
but get more of a close-up view of them

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.399 
but get more of a close-up view of them
once<00:03:43.799> again<00:03:44.129> the<00:03:44.280> face<00:03:44.489> sculpt<00:03:44.909> is<00:03:45.409> accurate

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
once again the face sculpt is accurate

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.429 
once again the face sculpt is accurate
is<00:03:46.500> very<00:03:46.739> accurate<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.509> little<00:03:48.959> different

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
is very accurate it's a little different

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.099 
is very accurate it's a little different
but<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.829> same<00:03:50.129> it<00:03:50.370> looks<00:03:50.519> like<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
but it's the same it looks like the

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.530 
but it's the same it looks like the
sculpting<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.229> terms<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.739> like<00:03:53.239> him<00:03:54.239> having

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
sculpting in terms of like him having

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.969 
sculpting in terms of like him having
like<00:03:54.689> almost<00:03:55.019> like<00:03:55.199> a<00:03:55.259> little<00:03:55.470> 5<00:03:55.680> o'clock

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979

shadow over a beard is a little

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.719 
shadow over a beard is a little
different<00:03:58.229> than<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.470> other<00:03:58.620> verse<00:03:58.919> cult<00:03:59.250> but

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
different than the other verse cult but

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.110 
different than the other verse cult but
overall<00:04:00.000> it's<00:04:00.239> pretty<00:04:00.359> much<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.750> same<00:04:00.780> the

overall it's pretty much the same the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.539 
overall it's pretty much the same the
vest<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.419> very<00:04:03.780> nice<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.169> combat<00:04:04.560> vest<00:04:04.889> the

for resident evil or for Chris Redfield

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.110 
for resident evil or for Chris Redfield
I<00:04:23.310> suppose

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.060 

honestly<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.240> think<00:04:27.840> overall<00:04:28.230> I<00:04:28.410> will<00:04:28.680> say<00:04:28.890> that

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
honestly I think overall I will say that

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.970 
honestly I think overall I will say that
this<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.910> better<00:04:30.300> looking<00:04:30.720> figure<00:04:30.980> just

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
this is a better looking figure just

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.400 
this is a better looking figure just
because<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.700> like<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.270> details<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.200> like

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
because I like the details and I like

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.790 
because I like the details and I like
the<00:04:34.940> added<00:04:36.230> improvements<00:04:37.230> that<00:04:37.380> they've<00:04:37.590> done

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
the added improvements that they've done

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.440 
the added improvements that they've done
I<00:04:37.980> mean<00:04:38.100> -<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.580> fact<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.120> stupid

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
I mean - the fact that the stupid

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.080 
I mean - the fact that the stupid
headset<00:04:39.840> fell<00:04:40.200> off<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.530> damn<00:04:40.740> wire<00:04:41.090> it's

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
headset fell off the damn wire it's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.060 
headset fell off the damn wire it's
actually<00:04:42.690> sticks<00:04:42.960> in<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.170> zero<00:04:43.440> a<00:04:43.500> lot<00:04:43.650> easier

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
actually sticks in a zero a lot easier

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.710 
actually sticks in a zero a lot easier
because<00:04:44.220> it's<00:04:44.550> kind<00:04:44.790> of<00:04:44.910> curved<00:04:45.480> and

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
because it's kind of curved and

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.620 
because it's kind of curved and
contorted<00:04:46.230> a<00:04:46.290> little<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.620> actually<00:04:46.920> fit<00:04:47.190> in

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
contorted a little to actually fit in

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.450 
contorted a little to actually fit in

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
honestly I'm probably putting it right

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.240

back<00:05:36.840> in<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.110> box<00:05:37.290> after<00:05:37.500> this<00:05:37.770> because<00:05:38.190> I

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
back in the box after this because I

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.409 
back in the box after this because I
don't<00:05:38.400> have<00:05:38.520> any<00:05:38.640> place<00:05:38.760> to<00:05:38.790> put<00:05:38.880> them<00:05:39.120> so<00:05:39.300> it's

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
don't have any place to put them so it's

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.990 
don't have any place to put them so it's
kind<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.600> pointless<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:40.520> make<00:05:41.520> life<00:05:41.730> harder

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000

accessories are cheap I mean this is
just<00:06:04.050> a<00:06:04.290> really<00:06:04.560> thin<00:06:04.590> hollow<00:06:05.130> plastic<00:06:05.870> but<00:06:06.870> in

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
just a really thin hollow plastic but in

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.810 
just a really thin hollow plastic but in
this<00:06:07.290> instance<00:06:07.530> it<00:06:07.919> actually<00:06:08.370> works<00:06:08.580> because

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
this instance it actually works because

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.520 
this instance it actually works because
if<00:06:09.090> it<00:06:09.210> was<00:06:09.330> heavy<00:06:09.570> he<00:06:09.810> probably<00:06:10.080> would<00:06:10.260> be<00:06:10.350> so

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
if it was heavy he probably would be so

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.610 
if it was heavy he probably would be so
back<00:06:10.740> heavy<00:06:10.980> he'd<00:06:11.160> fall<00:06:11.400> over<00:06:11.669> continuously

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
back heavy he'd fall over continuously

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:21.430 
back heavy he'd fall over continuously
so<00:06:13.940> it<00:06:14.940> works<00:06:15.240> for<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:15.930> this<00:06:16.440> time<00:06:16.650> around<00:06:18.050> but

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.300 

that's<00:06:22.440> pretty<00:06:22.800> much<00:06:22.980> about<00:06:23.190> it<00:06:23.370> for<00:06:23.790> Chris<00:06:24.090> I

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
that's pretty much about it for Chris I

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.830 
that's pretty much about it for Chris I
really<00:06:26.310> like<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.669> figure<00:06:27.000> I<00:06:27.180> think<00:06:27.540> they<00:06:27.660> did

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
really like the figure I think they did

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.820 
really like the figure I think they did
a<00:06:27.870> great<00:06:28.590> job<00:06:28.620> on<00:06:28.919> them<00:06:30.080> my<00:06:31.080> only<00:06:31.290> regret<00:06:31.560> is<00:06:31.590> of

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
a great job on them my only regret is of

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.920 
a great job on them my only regret is of
course<00:06:32.070> that<00:06:32.400> I<00:06:32.730> now<00:06:33.360> would<00:06:33.419> like<00:06:33.539> to<00:06:33.810> get

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
course that I now would like to get

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.020 
course that I now would like to get
stars<00:06:34.229> Wesker<00:06:34.770> which<00:06:35.010> is<00:06:35.340> going<00:06:35.669> to<00:06:35.820> be

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
stars Wesker which is going to be

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.559 
stars Wesker which is going to be
impossible<00:06:36.690> because

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569 
impossible because

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.510 
impossible because
I refused<00:06:38.319> to<00:06:38.379> ever<00:06:38.529> spend<00:06:38.919> that<00:06:39.099> much<00:06:39.309> for<00:06:39.490> a

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
I refused to ever spend that much for a

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.589 
I refused to ever spend that much for a
figure<00:06:39.849> again<00:06:40.149> ie<00:06:40.929> predators<00:06:41.729> so<00:06:42.729> I<00:06:43.179> may<00:06:43.539> be

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 
figure again ie predators so I may be

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.429 
figure again ie predators so I may be
kind<00:06:44.289> of<00:06:44.409> stuck<00:06:44.710> without<00:06:45.099> the<00:06:45.339> stars<00:06:45.849> version

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:46.439 
kind of stuck without the stars version

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:51.600 
kind of stuck without the stars version
but<00:06:47.439> I<00:06:48.389> would<00:06:49.389> highly<00:06:49.539> recommend<00:06:49.719> you<00:06:50.709> picking

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
but I would highly recommend you picking

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.649 
but I would highly recommend you picking
them<00:06:51.669> up<00:06:51.789> if<00:06:51.939> you<00:06:52.029> can<00:06:52.179> find<00:06:52.330> them<00:06:52.479> for<00:06:52.569> a

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:52.659 
them up if you can find them for a

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:55.230 
them up if you can find them for a
reasonable<00:06:53.050> price<00:06:53.169> I<00:06:53.439> actually<00:06:53.759> found<00:06:54.759> him<00:06:55.029> as

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
reasonable price I actually found him as

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.679 
reasonable price I actually found him as
kind<00:06:55.419> of<00:06:55.539> a<00:06:55.659> straggler<00:06:56.349> off<00:06:56.529> of<00:06:56.649> a<00:06:56.800> website

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
kind of a straggler off of a website

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:00.570 
kind of a straggler off of a website
that<00:06:58.689> website<00:06:59.469> has<00:06:59.589> since<00:06:59.860> sold<00:07:00.069> out<00:07:00.309> of<00:07:00.459> him

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
that website has since sold out of him

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.049 
that website has since sold out of him
but<00:07:00.759> they<00:07:00.939> had<00:07:01.089> a<00:07:01.119> couple<00:07:01.389> in<00:07:01.689> stock<00:07:02.020> still<00:07:03.059> the

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:04.059 
but they had a couple in stock still the

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:06.600 
but they had a couple in stock still the
price<00:07:04.330> kind<00:07:04.929> of<00:07:05.080> rose<00:07:05.349> with<00:07:05.830> the<00:07:06.009> value<00:07:06.399> of<00:07:06.520> the

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
price kind of rose with the value of the

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.299 
price kind of rose with the value of the
figure<00:07:06.939> but<00:07:07.149> it's<00:07:07.330> nowhere<00:07:07.599> near<00:07:07.809> it<00:07:08.709> was

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:09.309 
figure but it's nowhere near it was

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:10.920 
figure but it's nowhere near it was
nowhere<00:07:09.520> near<00:07:09.669> the<00:07:10.029> prices<00:07:10.419> they're<00:07:10.569> asking

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
nowhere near the prices they're asking

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.679 
nowhere near the prices they're asking
for<00:07:11.050> him<00:07:11.199> on<00:07:11.349> eBay<00:07:11.729> so<00:07:12.729> I<00:07:12.759> think<00:07:13.089> well<00:07:13.599> I<00:07:13.629> don't

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:13.689 
for him on eBay so I think well I don't

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:15.689 
for him on eBay so I think well I don't
think<00:07:13.899> I<00:07:14.050> got<00:07:14.169> necessarily<00:07:14.680> a<00:07:14.709> killer<00:07:15.069> deal<00:07:15.399> I

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
think I got necessarily a killer deal I

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.989 
think I got necessarily a killer deal I
think<00:07:16.149> I<00:07:16.300> got<00:07:16.569> him<00:07:16.689> for<00:07:16.869> a<00:07:16.899> pretty<00:07:17.110> good<00:07:17.259> price

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:17.999 
think I got him for a pretty good price

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:19.769 
think I got him for a pretty good price
but<00:07:18.999> that's<00:07:19.180> pretty<00:07:19.330> much<00:07:19.449> it

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:19.779 
but that's pretty much it

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:23.309 
but that's pretty much it
and<00:07:20.219> I<00:07:21.219> hope<00:07:21.490> you<00:07:21.639> enjoyed<00:07:21.969> the<00:07:22.089> review<00:07:22.319> I'm
