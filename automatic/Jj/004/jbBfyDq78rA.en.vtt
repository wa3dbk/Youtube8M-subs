00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
experience at 3 well historically the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470 
experience at 3 well historically the
experience<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.100> threes<00:00:35.430> performs<00:00:36.210> very

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
experience that threes performs very

experience that threes performs very
well<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.019> things<00:00:37.199> like<00:00:37.440> walking<00:00:37.949> for

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
well with things like walking for

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.689 
well with things like walking for
example<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.300> we're<00:00:39.480> doing<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:39.930> and

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
example like what we're doing now and

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:49.180 
example like what we're doing now and
even<00:00:41.699> more<00:00:42.000> rigorous<00:00:42.359> activity<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.070> can

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.220 

and<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.699> gauging<00:00:51.149> by<00:00:51.300> what's<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.109> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and if gauging by what's going on on the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 
and if gauging by what's going on on the
screen<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.769> anything<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.309> by<00:00:53.429> the<00:00:54.179> 6th

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
screen is anything to go by the 6th

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.119 
screen is anything to go by the 6th
looks<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.260> shaking<00:00:55.679> a<00:00:55.769> little<00:00:55.920> bit

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
looks like it's shaking a little bit

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
looks like it's shaking a little bit
more<00:00:56.309> than<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.670> z3<00:00:57.120> now<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.499> actually

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
more than the z3 now we can actually

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.250 
more than the z3 now we can actually
force<00:00:59.219> some<00:00:59.579> shake<00:00:59.879> into<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.629> scene<00:01:00.929> by

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
force some shake into the scene by

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.920 
force some shake into the scene by
firstly<00:01:01.859> moving<00:01:02.579> left<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> right<00:01:02.969> quickly<00:01:04.519> and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
firstly moving left to right quickly and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.320 
firstly moving left to right quickly and
it<00:01:06.930> looks<00:01:07.140> pretty<00:01:07.440> static<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> Sony

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it looks pretty static on the Sony

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.890 
it looks pretty static on the Sony
Xperia<00:01:09.630> z3<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.280> now<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.820> twist<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.690> left

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
Xperia z3 and now we can twist from left

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.490 
Xperia z3 and now we can twist from left
to<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.230> quickly<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:16.700> finally<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.940> and<00:01:18.330> down

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.990 

so<00:01:22.500> yeah<00:01:22.680> gauging<00:01:23.160> by<00:01:23.190> what's<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.730> on<00:01:23.850> on

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so yeah gauging by what's going on on

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.220 
so yeah gauging by what's going on on
the<00:01:24.150> screen<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> experience<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.020> three

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
the screen the experience that three

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.690 
the screen the experience that three
looks<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.800> doing<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> better<00:01:26.580> job

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
looks to be doing the better job

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.510 
looks to be doing the better job
although<00:01:27.120> this<00:01:27.750> may<00:01:28.200> come<00:01:28.470> through<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.370> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
although this may come through in on the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.300 
although this may come through in on the
iPhone<00:01:29.910> in<00:01:30.180> post<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.350> we'll<00:01:31.800> see<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.130> final

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
iPhone in post so we'll see the final

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.030 
iPhone in post so we'll see the final
clip<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> confirm<00:01:33.300> that<00:01:33.620> now<00:01:34.620> we're<00:01:34.830> going<00:01:34.950> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
clip to confirm that now we're going to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.430 
clip to confirm that now we're going to
test<00:01:35.340> out<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.940> these<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.480> cope<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.930> zooming

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
test out how these to cope with zooming

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.740 
test out how these to cope with zooming
zooming<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.010> another<00:01:38.370> big<00:01:38.610> part<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.180> image

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
zooming is another big part of image

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.500 
zooming is another big part of image
stabilization<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.430> we'll<00:01:41.640> zoom<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
stabilization so we'll zoom in on the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.030 
stabilization so we'll zoom in on the
same<00:01:42.900> element<00:01:43.440> and<00:01:44.300> the<00:01:45.590> Sony<00:01:46.590> experience

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
same element and the Sony experience

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
same element and the Sony experience
that<00:01:47.160> three<00:01:47.400> can<00:01:47.550> actually<00:01:47.940> get<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.150> little<00:01:48.390> bit

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that three can actually get a little bit

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.660 
that three can actually get a little bit
closer<00:01:48.900> with<00:01:49.110> digital<00:01:49.620> zoom<00:01:49.860> than<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> iPhone

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
closer with digital zoom than the iPhone

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.520 
closer with digital zoom than the iPhone
so<00:01:51.270> let's<00:01:51.450> get<00:01:51.600> them<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.900> around<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.260> same

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
so let's get them to around the same

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
so let's get them to around the same
point<00:01:53.540> maybe<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:54.960> closer<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.700> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
point maybe a little bit closer and you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.600 
point maybe a little bit closer and you
can<00:01:57.570> see<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.160> they<00:01:59.160> both<00:01:59.370> seem<00:01:59.580> to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
can see right there they both seem to

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.070 
can see right there they both seem to
have<00:01:59.820> locked<00:02:00.030> focus<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.780> we're<00:02:00.900> trying

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
have locked focus on what we're trying

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.260 
have locked focus on what we're trying
to<00:02:01.200> go<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.500> which<00:02:01.620> is<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.860> branch<00:02:02.220> though<00:02:03.120> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to go for which is a branch though the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.150 
to go for which is a branch though the
sony<00:02:03.540> xperia<00:02:03.600> trees<00:02:04.290> may<00:02:04.470> be<00:02:04.500> creeping<00:02:05.070> a

little<00:02:05.400> bit<00:02:05.520> more<00:02:05.700> forward<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.090> back<00:02:06.300> now

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
little bit more forward and back now

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.790 
little bit more forward and back now
let's<00:02:07.170> check<00:02:07.530> out<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.860> wall<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:10.530> image

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
let's check out the wall the image

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.550 
let's check out the wall the image
stabilization<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> said<00:02:11.970> three<00:02:12.180> dozen

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
stabilization on the said three dozen

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.979 
stabilization on the said three dozen
look<00:02:12.650> better<00:02:13.190> though<00:02:13.630> though<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.780> focus

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
look better though though the focus

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.100 
look better though though the focus
isn't<00:02:15.650> quite<00:02:16.130> as<00:02:16.310> OnPoint<00:02:16.870> zooming<00:02:17.870> all<00:02:17.989> the

the<00:02:19.970> set<00:02:20.180> 3<00:02:20.420> can<00:02:20.599> go<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:22.480> then<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.690> can<00:02:23.840> really

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
the set 3 can go and then you can really

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.040 
the set 3 can go and then you can really
see<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.290> focus<00:02:24.890> creep<00:02:25.190> ever<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.670> slightly

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
see that focus creep ever so slightly

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.160

that<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:02.330> phones<00:03:02.720> perform<00:03:03.170> well<00:03:03.380> close<00:03:03.830> up

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
that the phones perform well close up

that the phones perform well close up
but<00:03:04.670> as<00:03:04.819> you<00:03:05.000> move<00:03:05.209> away<00:03:05.360> from<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.900> macro

the actual branches look a little bit

the actual branches look a little bit
more<00:03:31.250> yellow<00:03:31.609> than<00:03:32.120> either<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.540> showcasing

more yellow than either a showcasing
though<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.859> iPhone<00:03:34.370> does<00:03:34.609> look<00:03:34.819> closer<00:03:35.299> in

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
though the iPhone does look closer in

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.530 
though the iPhone does look closer in
terms<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.140> color<00:03:36.380> accuracy<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:37.130> what<00:03:37.540> actually

terms of color accuracy to what actually

terms of color accuracy to what actually
see<00:03:38.810> right<00:03:39.049> now<00:03:39.290> as<00:03:40.040> far<00:03:40.130> as<00:03:40.280> exposure<00:03:40.670> goes

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
see right now as far as exposure goes

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.879 
see right now as far as exposure goes
like<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.329> mentioned<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:41.750> can<00:03:41.989> swipe<00:03:42.319> up<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:42.769> the

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
like I mentioned you can swipe up on the

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.280 
like I mentioned you can swipe up on the
iPhone<00:03:43.340> tap<00:03:43.940> a<00:03:43.970> point<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.480> swipe<00:03:44.720> up<00:03:44.750> in<00:03:45.109> order

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
iPhone tap a point and swipe up in order

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.590 
iPhone tap a point and swipe up in order
to<00:03:45.560> make<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.220> scene<00:03:46.430> brighter<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.090> darker

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
to make the scene brighter and darker

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.379 
to make the scene brighter and darker
which<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.560> really<00:03:49.010> nice<00:03:49.190> addition<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:50.030> iOS

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
which is a really nice addition to iOS

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.390 
which is a really nice addition to iOS
and<00:03:50.750> one<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.380> we<00:03:51.470> wouldn't<00:03:51.709> mind<00:03:51.859> seeing<00:03:52.190> on

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
and one that we wouldn't mind seeing on

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.390 
and one that we wouldn't mind seeing on
Android<00:03:53.209> if<00:03:53.660> we<00:03:54.139> were<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.500> actually<00:03:55.190> test

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
Android if we were to actually test

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.430 
Android if we were to actually test
exposure<00:03:55.850> as<00:03:56.090> far<00:03:56.329> as<00:03:56.450> what<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.810> sky<00:03:57.109> offers

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
exposure as far as what the sky offers

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.360 
exposure as far as what the sky offers
by<00:03:57.590> contrast<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.250> dark<00:03:58.609> scenario<00:03:59.889> then<00:04:00.889> you

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
by contrast to a dark scenario then you

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.000 
by contrast to a dark scenario then you
can<00:04:01.519> see<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:02.780> Sony<00:04:03.019> experience<00:04:03.560> had<00:04:03.709> three

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
can see the Sony experience had three

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.599 
can see the Sony experience had three
shifts<00:04:04.790> for<00:04:05.150> exposure<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:06.310> little<00:04:07.310> bit<00:04:07.430> more

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
shifts for exposure a little bit more

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.069 
shifts for exposure a little bit more
slowly<00:04:08.260> than<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.290> iPhone<00:04:09.950> 6<00:04:10.760> which<00:04:11.329> would<00:04:11.959> be

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
slowly than the iPhone 6 which would be

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.229 
slowly than the iPhone 6 which would be
better<00:04:12.350> for<00:04:12.650> example<00:04:12.739> in<00:04:13.370> flashing<00:04:14.030> light
