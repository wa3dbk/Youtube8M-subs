particular<00:05:19.610> model<00:05:19.940> since<00:05:20.240> we<00:05:20.390> had<00:05:20.540> a<00:05:20.570> masonry

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
particular model since we had a masonry

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.840 
particular model since we had a masonry
base<00:05:21.229> well<00:05:21.470> we<00:05:21.740> put<00:05:21.950> that<00:05:22.100> jealousy<00:05:22.580> windows

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
base well we put that jealousy windows

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.670 
base well we put that jealousy windows
in<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.090> back<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.600> that<00:05:23.660> allows<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.229> cold<00:05:24.410> air

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
in the back and that allows the cold air

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.640 
in the back and that allows the cold air
to<00:05:24.800> come<00:05:24.830> in<00:05:25.010> the<00:05:25.669> cool<00:05:25.910> air<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.510> to<00:05:27.350> help

of their landscape and it was built

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.270 
of their landscape and it was built
before<00:05:47.900> they<00:05:48.380> even<00:05:48.440> thought<00:05:48.710> about<00:05:48.860> putting<00:05:49.100> a

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
before they even thought about putting a

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.520 
before they even thought about putting a
greenhouse<00:05:49.610> on<00:05:49.850> it<00:05:50.000> really<00:05:50.210> it's<00:05:50.840> it's<00:05:51.260> about

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
greenhouse on it really it's it's about

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.800 
greenhouse on it really it's it's about
10<00:05:51.860> by<00:05:52.010> 15<00:05:52.070> so<00:05:52.760> we<00:05:52.850> built<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.270> greenhouse

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
10 by 15 so we built the the greenhouse

eliminated the the finial
the<00:06:00.910> arched<00:06:01.450> door<00:06:01.780> because<00:06:02.260> I<00:06:02.380> thought<00:06:02.560> that

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
the arched door because I thought that

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.410 
the arched door because I thought that

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
house but you can see it's a set on here

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.540 
house but you can see it's a set on here
very<00:06:07.780> nicely<00:06:08.020> we<00:06:08.380> put<00:06:08.590> jalousie<00:06:09.070> windows<00:06:09.100> on

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
very nicely we put jalousie windows on

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.620 
very nicely we put jalousie windows on
the<00:06:09.640> side<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:11.400> add<00:06:12.400> some<00:06:12.700> lower<00:06:12.910> ventilation

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
the side to add some lower ventilation

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
to work with the roof fence again and

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.360 
to work with the roof fence again and
again<00:06:16.300> I<00:06:16.330> think<00:06:16.540> just<00:06:16.900> a<00:06:17.050> beautiful<00:06:17.770> outcome

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
showing a little longer example this is

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.750 
showing a little longer example this is
