00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
 hello all good friends today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.269
 I bring a tutorial on how to put the 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:14.160
 I already know that I told you a long time ago 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.740
 I know how to put them in the tutorial but it's 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.529
 I did pérez pérez and pérez and in the end 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.150
 Well, I was not able to do anything that today 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.250
 I bring and I hope that you 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.880
 well I do not know if you will remember that this is 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.740
 literature I bought them on the page 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.650
 crisis and factory where I also buy 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.410
 piercings dilatations and others and 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.180
 they are pretty good I do not know if they are 75 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.739
 cents are less is that I do not remember 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.690
 Anyway, I'll put the little box 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.519
 information and nothing you have many designs 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.410
 you can pass them, I will also leave the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.510
 crisis website and factors things 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.390
 you want to spend processed in the box 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.809
 information and nothing the only thing you're going to 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.300
 need is a little bit of cotton and a 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.700
 little bit of water 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.910
 and nothing will proceed the first thing that 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.430
 you have to do is remove what is not here 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.230
 remove the plastic 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.470
 the ticos you should not remove it only 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.470
 you must 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.220
 it's worth the next thing you have to do 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.820
 is to put it in the back by the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.760
 back I do not know if you see it 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.340
 has like a few dotted lines in the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.390
 laterally vertical and this is a guide 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.640
 to be able to adapt this literature to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.540
 your lips and it 's very simple it seems 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.730
 a very difficult thing but 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.500
 is what we have to do is 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.120
 from the top you always have 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.860
 to cut the part of down 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.540
 the part above does not have to be touched 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.670
 what we have to do is put the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.939
 top part in heat 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.790
 the top part as if it was smiling like 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.890
 yes smile 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.890
 and put it by our side 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 roughly calculate what's left I 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.509
 I always cut the sides more 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.090
 that nothing because you are going to do more 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.720
 much easier now let's calculate 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.580
 the thickness of the lip 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.530
 if you see that I look over there it's because 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.750
 I have the expert let's go cutting is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.440
 what I'm doing is because he screams 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.840
 band aid 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.200
 dotted line by dotted line best 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.690
 and so I'm calculating more or less 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.600
 One thing first of all you have to have 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.960
 the lips totally dry and totally 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.650
 clean you do not have to have neither gloss nor 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.989
 lipstick 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.670
 nothing nothing like balm 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.939
 lipstick you have to have lips 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.470
 completely dry because if not not not 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.599
 is going to hit next is that nothing 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.900
 moisten the cotton with enough 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.900
 Water 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.380
 first on the top 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.870
 year 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.409
 and now we press the cotton with water 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.409
 and what 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.880
 and now we proceed to the same operation 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.560
 except in the lip work 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.560
 let's go see it the same 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.959
 two 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.500
 and this would be the result as you see 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.080
 it's really original 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.730
 for some kind of party there are 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.940
 also very simple in case you want it 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.790
 bring some night out or in 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.770
 some occasion that I am I bought it 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.560
 for a dance festival in the end not what 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.300
 use use another but there are good ones 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.470
 of many designs there are with glitter 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.009
 there are sailor design with 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.559
 letters of many types as you see have 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.039
 gave built- in brightness but if you want 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:05:01.430
 you can apply a liquid gloss and it goes 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:03.830
 to serve and it will be beautiful for you 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.039
 say that they are very resistant 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.120
 You can not drink or smoke that you eat 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:14.380
 whatever it was going to continue 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.300
 with time already he had a long time is 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.930
 it starts to crack but come on there's no 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.000
 problem like removing it with water a 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.440
 little bit like that if he wants to leave a soap 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.250
 but let's go so I hope you like it 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:30.729
 if you buy lipstadt one on the page 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.439
 crisis factory and you try to put it 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.409
 I hope you send me a picture to 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.699
 twitter or wherever you want and nothing I hope 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:39.309
 that you liked this tutorial 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.479
 how to get some lips status and we 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.479
 We see the following bye
