 but anyway there are many people spoke 10 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.869
 buy the american game the game will come

 dubbed in Portuguese from Brazil with the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.020
 Batman I already say that the game does not come 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.159
 on the Portuguese side of Brazil bought 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.189
 in the United States it's okay but it has a 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.770
 method for you to see which games are going to come 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.500
 in Portuguese or not looking at it is the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.350
 The following unites all its 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.979
 games by codes and you can see this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.299
 code by entering the game link on the site 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.329
 of the psn 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.250
 then you go in there on the site will psn 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.649
 there in the game you will buy that you 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.079
 wants to buy and sees there that it will have a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.479
 This code is generally 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.409
 by the following words and not 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.890
 letters there number which is the following csa 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.159
 accuse is going to simplify accuse 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 five digit digits 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.920
 these five digits can say 'o up to 9 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.259
 beauty already having this in mind already knowing 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.780
 What do you do to find out if the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.879
 game bought at the American will come in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.080
 Portuguese will come dublado in Portuguese 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.760
 of Brazil 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.090
 the first thing you have to have 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.830
 sure that the game will already be dubbed in 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.940
 Portuguese bought from Brazil 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.270
 Brazilian 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.610
 we were out there the anchieta of 4 you already 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.600
 know that the game will come dubbed in 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.580
 Portuguese 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.370
 so if you buy in Brazilian 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.220
 Obviously the game will come dublado knows 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.500
 so uncharted 4 is already a good example and 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.110
 to see if the game will come with this same 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.970
 dubbing in Portuguese bought in 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.570
 What do you do for me? 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.840
 go there on the site of the Brazilian psn 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.110
 click the link of the game enter there 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.900
 purchase of the game and the link up there at 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.780
 your browser you will see the code there 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.630
 generally comprised of cusa and more 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.930
 some numbers there you copy this code 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.060
 I do not know, brother. 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.230
 control v in a block of 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.420
 I do not know 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.560
 the code pici it will be in the link of the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.890
 your browser 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.030
 with this you enter the site of psn 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.160
 go to us at the game link of the 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.920
 even the chartered game goes there and gives a 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.209
 look at the same code if the code was 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.010
 identical 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.440
 You already know that he'll be dubbed in 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.720
 Portuguese brazilian in brazil he 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.750
 will also be dubbed in Portuguese from 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.150
 United States 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.930
 you can already see if the code is the same 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.910
 the game will come vim dublado in Portuguese 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.120
 even charged in the American if the code 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.250
 It was different the game will not come in 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.970
 Portuguese is probably going to come there 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:54.120
 psn local language or if it is not going to come 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.610
 in english charged in psn americana there 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.709
 you will have the doubt is joe but what are 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.019
 these codes so that they serve each 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.050
 code for actions means celamar a 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.600
 different game different content 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.260
 these contents may be dubbing 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.049
 the legend language - these things let's go 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:17.400
 give an example there blues boy band born in 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:22.620
 psn website link will be there 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.850
 code co hsa 00 nine 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.870
 Then you get in the way. 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.900
 cane and there will be the same code in the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.860
 part of blackburn on na psn 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.740
 American will have there code hs 00 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.080
 nine hundred then means that the game 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.490
 bought in the American will also come in 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.040
 Brazilian Portuguese 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.090

 01 7 6 4 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:04.360
 already in the US his code is his 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:07.060
 is if 0 0 1 1 3 3 ie the code is 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.460
 different being the game bought in the 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.890
 American is not the same bought in the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.140
 The game will not come from the Brazilian side. 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.030
