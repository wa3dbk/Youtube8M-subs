00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.814
 Carly Rose Sonenclar - Performance Somewhere Over The Rainbow - (Israel Kamakawiwo'ole) 

00:00:04.758 --> 00:00:12.182
 Somewhere beyond the rainbow. 

00:00:13.655 --> 00:00:16.656
 Right up there. 

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:26.235
 There is a land that I have heard about, 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.664
 once, in a lullaby. 

00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:37.499
 One day, I'm going to wish for a star. 

00:00:37.782 --> 00:00:45.318
 And wake up where the clouds are far from me. 

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:52.237
 Problems melted like lemon drops. 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.999
 Far above the top of the chimneys. 

00:00:56.015 --> 00:01:04.114
 That's where you'll find me. 

00:01:04.354 --> 00:01:09.097
 Somewhere, 

00:01:09.794 --> 00:01:15.429
 over the Rainbow. 

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:21.094
 The skies are blue 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.887
 and dreams, 

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:32.133
 that you dare to dream, 

00:01:33.214 --> 00:01:38.861
 really come true. 

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:46.344
 If little happy blue birds fly, 

00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:48.559
 above the rainbow. 

00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.321
 Because... 

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:53.667
 Oh why... 

00:01:54.006 --> 00:02:06.225
 I can not? 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.483
 "Mother brother"
