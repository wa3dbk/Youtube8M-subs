from the sdb shell other people say the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.750 
from the sdb shell other people say the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
same thing so I don't know if it's just

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.240 
same thing so I don't know if it's just
a<00:02:11.880> bug<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.239> recovery<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:12.870> I've<00:02:13.590> been

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
a bug in the recovery but I've been

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.320 
a bug in the recovery but I've been
using<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.519> phone<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.730> about<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.060> month<00:02:15.209> now

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
using this phone for about a month now

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.280 
using this phone for about a month now
and<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.720> any<00:02:15.959> problems<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:17.750> that's<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.959> huge

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and have any problems so that's a huge

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.380 
and have any problems so that's a huge
issue<00:02:19.440> at<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.739> point<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:21.150> I'm<00:02:21.269> just

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
issue at this point so I'm just

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.880 
issue at this point so I'm just
demonstrating<00:02:21.870> doing<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.050> recovery<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:22.739> but

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
demonstrating doing a recovery here but

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.080 
demonstrating doing a recovery here but
this<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.160> last<00:02:23.310> step<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.850> need<00:02:24.000> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
this is the last step that you need to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.759 
this is the last step that you need to
do<00:02:24.209> before<00:02:24.360> you<00:02:24.570> install<00:02:24.630> custom<00:02:25.110> roms<00:02:25.320> and

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
do before you install custom roms and

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.520 
do before you install custom roms and
kernels<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> hardest<00:02:26.940> thing

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
kernels and this is the hardest thing

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.630 
kernels and this is the hardest thing
you<00:02:28.530> imagine<00:02:28.860> trying<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.160> enter<00:02:29.400> all<00:02:29.519> these

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
you imagine trying to enter all these

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.610 
you imagine trying to enter all these
commands<00:02:30.120> through<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> text<00:02:31.290> input<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
commands through the text input the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.110 
commands through the text input the
phone<00:02:31.800> can<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.130> huge<00:02:32.310> pain<00:02:32.519> in<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> ass<00:02:32.819> and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
phone can be a huge pain in the ass and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.630 
phone can be a huge pain in the ass and
this<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.780> very<00:02:34.019> very<00:02:34.140> case<00:02:35.100> sensitive<00:02:35.549> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
this is very very case sensitive and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.120 
this is very very case sensitive and
everything<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.329> has<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.660> entered

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
everything so it has to be entered

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.050 
everything so it has to be entered
verbatim<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.489> appears<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.910> screen

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
verbatim as it appears on the screen

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.600

here<00:02:41.780> refer<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.900> work<00:02:43.079> so<00:02:43.980> that's<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
here refer to work so that's the the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.800 
here refer to work so that's the the
fourth<00:02:44.880> step<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.299> install<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> custom

recovery once you've done that it's
really<00:02:48.090> really<00:02:48.360> simple<00:02:48.390> basically<00:02:49.049> just<00:02:49.230> you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
really really simple basically just you

download<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> rom<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:51.090> now<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:51.989> was<00:02:52.019> saying

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
download a rom and now like I was saying

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.930
