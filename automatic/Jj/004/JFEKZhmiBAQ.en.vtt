00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.470 
bucks and to me I think that's a little
too<00:05:53.420> much<00:05:53.660> I<00:05:53.930> think<00:05:54.710> this<00:05:55.070> is<00:05:55.310> twenty<00:05:56.000> thirty

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
too much I think this is twenty thirty

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.540 
too much I think this is twenty thirty
at<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:56.930> most<00:05:57.290> and<00:05:57.650> if<00:05:58.010> they<00:05:58.160> had<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.370> lights

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
at the most and if they had the lights

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.280 
at the most and if they had the lights
and<00:05:58.700> sounds<00:05:59.090> I<00:05:59.180> think<00:05:59.240> yeah<00:05:59.660> I<00:05:59.690> totally<00:06:00.020> be

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
and sounds I think yeah I totally be

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.010 
and sounds I think yeah I totally be
worth<00:06:00.320> it<00:06:00.620> but<00:06:00.800> to<00:06:01.580> me<00:06:01.730> it's<00:06:02.060> just<00:06:02.120> it's<00:06:02.900> a

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
worth it but to me it's just it's a

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.390 
worth it but to me it's just it's a
great<00:06:03.110> display<00:06:03.500> piece<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:03.890> can<00:06:04.010> even<00:06:04.220> use<00:06:04.370> it

for<00:06:04.670> cosplay<00:06:05.120> it'd<00:06:05.480> be<00:06:05.750> a<00:06:05.780> little<00:06:05.870> heavy<00:06:06.140> I'd

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
for cosplay it'd be a little heavy I'd

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.140 
for cosplay it'd be a little heavy I'd
be<00:06:06.530> a<00:06:06.560> little<00:06:06.770> worrisome<00:06:07.400> if<00:06:07.580> you<00:06:07.700> dropped<00:06:07.970> it

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
be a little worrisome if you dropped it

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.940 
be a little worrisome if you dropped it
because<00:06:08.330> you<00:06:08.810> might<00:06:08.960> scratch<00:06:09.260> off<00:06:09.470> some<00:06:09.710> paint

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
because you might scratch off some paint

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.130 
because you might scratch off some paint
me<00:06:10.220> I<00:06:10.520> mean<00:06:10.670> there<00:06:10.790> was<00:06:10.880> another<00:06:11.150> collector's

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
me I mean there was another collector's

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.170 
me I mean there was another collector's
edition<00:06:12.530> I<00:06:12.620> had<00:06:12.770> like<00:06:13.010> the<00:06:13.190> hog<00:06:13.400> wheels<00:06:13.790> the

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
edition I had like the hog wheels the

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.300 
edition I had like the hog wheels the
one<00:06:14.360> was<00:06:14.600> a<00:06:14.780> cheaper<00:06:15.410> but<00:06:15.740> it's<00:06:15.920> just<00:06:16.130> like<00:06:16.280> a

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
one was a cheaper but it's just like a

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.460 
one was a cheaper but it's just like a
little<00:06:16.490> Hot<00:06:16.700> Wheels<00:06:16.910> thing<00:06:17.180> and<00:06:17.480> some<00:06:17.990> art<00:06:18.200> I

little Hot Wheels thing and some art I

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.980
