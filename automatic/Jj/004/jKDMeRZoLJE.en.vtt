it<00:00:51.690> across<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.260> organza<00:00:52.680> until<00:00:53.460> there's<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it across the organza until there's a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.470 
it across the organza until there's a
few<00:00:54.210> ripples<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.890> possible<00:00:56.059> now<00:00:57.059> comes<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
few ripples as possible now comes the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.910 
few ripples as possible now comes the
fun<00:00:57.660> part<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:59.000> have<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.180> design<00:01:00.359> right<00:01:00.780> here

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
fun part I have my design right here

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.590 
fun part I have my design right here
obviously<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> since<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.359> can't

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
obviously not all of it since I can't

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.719 
obviously not all of it since I can't
fit<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:03.989> 8<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> half<00:01:04.439> by<00:01:04.559> 11<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> trust

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
fit it on 8 and a half by 11 but I trust

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
fit it on 8 and a half by 11 but I trust
my<00:01:05.909> drawing<00:01:06.270> powers<00:01:08.869> take<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> screen<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
my drawing powers take the screen and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.760 
my drawing powers take the screen and
put<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> facedown<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.210> design<00:01:12.770> aligning

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
put it facedown on your design aligning

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
put it facedown on your design aligning
it<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.729> whole<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.390> design<00:01:15.750> will

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it so that the whole of the design will

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.770 
it so that the whole of the design will
be<00:01:15.990> able<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> fit<00:01:16.650> now<00:01:17.430> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.670> recall<00:01:17.880> there

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
be able to fit now if you recall there

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.539 
be able to fit now if you recall there
were<00:01:18.960> triangles<00:01:19.590> down<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.100> at<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> bottom

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
were triangles down here at the bottom

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.450 
were triangles down here at the bottom
when<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> showed<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> picture<00:01:22.439> earlier<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
when I showed you the picture earlier so

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.039 
when I showed you the picture earlier so
I'm<00:01:23.549> gonna<00:01:23.670> leave<00:01:23.880> space<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.479> them<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
I'm gonna leave space for them here and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.569 
I'm gonna leave space for them here and
now

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.429 

take<00:01:28.579> a<00:01:28.610> number<00:01:29.000> two<00:01:29.180> pencil<00:01:29.259> preferably<00:01:30.259> not

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
take a number two pencil preferably not

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.109 
take a number two pencil preferably not
mechanical<00:01:31.100> because<00:01:31.310> it'll<00:01:31.549> just<00:01:31.579> rip<00:01:31.970> the

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
mechanical because it'll just rip the

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.899 
mechanical because it'll just rip the
organza<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:32.840> then<00:01:33.530> start<00:01:33.860> tracing<00:01:34.250> around

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
organza and then start tracing around

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.109 
organza and then start tracing around
the<00:01:35.149> design

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.539 

now<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.170> we<00:01:39.259> have<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.530> full<00:01:39.710> design<00:01:40.100> here

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
now that we have the full design here

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.980 
now that we have the full design here
we're<00:01:41.090> gonna<00:01:41.210> flip<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.840> screen<00:01:42.109> over<00:01:43.990> grab

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
we're gonna flip the screen over grab

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.669 
we're gonna flip the screen over grab
your<00:01:45.320> Mod<00:01:45.920> Podge<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.700> your<00:01:47.600> paintbrushes<00:01:48.140> and

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.300 

get<00:01:51.679> to<00:01:51.859> work

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
get to work

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.330 
get to work
tracing<00:01:53.270> over<00:01:53.530> everywhere<00:01:54.530> you<00:01:54.709> don't<00:01:55.039> want

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
tracing over everywhere you don't want

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.849 
tracing over everywhere you don't want
the<00:01:55.549> ink<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:56.030> go<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:58.299> just<00:01:59.299> like<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.899> we<00:02:00.619> are

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
the ink to go and just like that we are

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.709 
the ink to go and just like that we are
finished<00:02:01.539> now<00:02:02.539> you<00:02:02.600> can<00:02:02.929> see<00:02:03.399> the<00:02:04.420> glue<00:02:05.420> only

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
finished now you can see the glue only

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.920 
finished now you can see the glue only
exists<00:02:06.619> where<00:02:06.829> I<00:02:06.859> do<00:02:07.100> not<00:02:07.340> want<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.780> ink<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.110> go

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930
