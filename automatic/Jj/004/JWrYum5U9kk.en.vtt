any way an excuse but I think it's worth

any way an excuse but I think it's worth
clearing<00:02:30.530> up<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.980> rules<00:02:31.250> of<00:02:31.459> dogs<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.879> cars

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
clearing up the rules of dogs in cars

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.459 
clearing up the rules of dogs in cars
because<00:02:32.510> there<00:02:32.599> might<00:02:32.719> be<00:02:32.780> people<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.260> think

because there might be people to think

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.559 
because there might be people to think
five<00:02:34.010> minutes<00:02:34.489> at<00:02:34.609> five<00:02:34.790> in<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.060> morning<00:02:35.150> when
