for<00:01:13.370> me<00:01:13.610> such<00:01:13.909> as<00:01:14.180> my<00:01:14.450> lack<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.750> scout<00:01:15.140> in<00:01:15.289> here

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.999

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
I don't see that much gsl but I hear

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.649

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
about a lot of the game so maybe I'll

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.980 
about a lot of the game so maybe I'll
know<00:01:23.780> what<00:01:23.869> he's<00:01:23.990> talking<00:01:24.020> about<00:01:25.329> and<00:01:26.329> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
know what he's talking about and the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:38.620 
know what he's talking about and the
only<00:01:27.170> reason<00:01:27.320> Protoss<00:01:27.859> don't<00:01:28.070> win<00:01:28.219> it<00:01:28.310> all<00:01:28.430> is

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.880 

so<00:01:39.630> he's<00:01:39.810> got<00:01:39.990> his<00:01:40.140> barracks<00:01:40.560> getting<00:01:40.770> his

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so he's got his barracks getting his

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.700 
so he's got his barracks getting his
marine<00:01:41.190> in<00:01:41.510> my<00:01:42.510> barracks<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.930> almost<00:01:43.170> done<00:01:43.440> my

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
marine in my barracks is almost done my

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.950 
marine in my barracks is almost done my
guess<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.130> he<00:01:44.250> has<00:01:44.370> gasteria<00:01:47.510> I'm<00:01:48.510> gonna<00:01:48.690> gasps

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
guess is he has gasteria I'm gonna gasps

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.990 
guess is he has gasteria I'm gonna gasps
steel<00:01:49.380> I'm<00:01:49.680> gonna<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.280> factory<00:01:50.790> really

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
steel I'm gonna get my factory really

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
steel I'm gonna get my factory really
early<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.450> hope<00:01:51.720> he<00:01:51.840> doesn't<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.650> don't

early and hope he doesn't see it I don't

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.910 
early and hope he doesn't see it I don't
know<00:01:52.950> how<00:01:53.159> he<00:01:53.190> won't<00:01:54.080> not<00:01:55.080> getting<00:01:55.440> an<00:01:55.500> orbital

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
know how he won't not getting an orbital

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.080 
know how he won't not getting an orbital
yet<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:58.229> kind<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.650> don't<00:01:58.770> want<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.130> gas<00:01:59.369> but<00:01:59.850> I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
yet I kind of don't want that gas but I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.330 
yet I kind of don't want that gas but I
figured<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.810> gas<00:02:00.960> deal<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.710> yeah

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
figured it to the gas deal so yeah

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:13.250 
figured it to the gas deal so yeah
whatever<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:04.050> i'm<00:02:04.259> already<00:02:04.470> walled<00:02:04.770> out

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
really you don't really need to gas deal

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.520 
really you don't really need to gas deal
turn<00:02:28.150> most<00:02:28.570> turn<00:02:28.780> our<00:02:28.990> can<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> get<00:02:29.350> there
