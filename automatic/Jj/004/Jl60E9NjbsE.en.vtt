00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
next one is a dominant 7 arpeggio so

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.680 
next one is a dominant 7 arpeggio so
this<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.010> exactly<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.880> same<00:02:26.910> as<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.540> other

this is exactly the same as the other

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.479 
this is exactly the same as the other
one<00:02:28.019> except<00:02:28.620> instead<00:02:28.829> of<00:02:28.920> playing<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.310> G

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.800 

also<00:02:35.830> note<00:02:36.160> it's<00:02:36.550> important<00:02:37.060> with<00:02:37.210> as<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.720> can

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
also note it's important with as you can

see my right hand I'm always down piggy

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.800 
see my right hand I'm always down piggy
and<00:02:40.420> then<00:02:41.080> up<00:02:42.180> there's<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> little<00:02:43.300> alternate

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and then up there's a little alternate

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.850 
and then up there's a little alternate
right<00:02:43.930> there<00:02:47.820> okay<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.970> next<00:02:49.150> one<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:50.440> minor

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
right there okay the next one is a minor

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.710 
right there okay the next one is a minor
7<00:02:51.370> arpeggio<00:02:52.410> which<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.910> we've<00:02:54.910> got<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.120> g<00:02:55.360> just

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
7 arpeggio which is we've got the g just

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.690 
7 arpeggio which is we've got the g just
like<00:02:55.840> before<00:02:55.990> except<00:02:56.740> now<00:02:56.770> have<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.250> C<00:02:57.430> sharp

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
like before except now have the C sharp

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.900 
like before except now have the C sharp
here<00:02:58.320> we're<00:02:59.320> playing<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.280> our<00:03:00.490> second

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
here we're playing it with our second

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.140 
here we're playing it with our second
finger<00:03:00.940> on<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.450> C<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.830> just<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.430> go<00:03:04.120> over

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
finger on the C here so just to go over

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.330 
finger on the C here so just to go over
that<00:03:04.540> so<00:03:04.810> we<00:03:04.900> get<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:05.830> fourteenth

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
that so we get the a on the fourteenth

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.300 
that so we get the a on the fourteenth
fret<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.910> g<00:03:07.000> string<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:08.350> see<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.980> the

strength ok and then the last we're

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.150 
strength ok and then the last we're
going<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.100> show<00:03:24.280> you<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.670> minor<00:03:25.030> 7<00:03:25.510> flat<00:03:25.540> 5<00:03:26.160> so

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
this is exactly the same as the E minor

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.460 
this is exactly the same as the E minor
except<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.640> e<00:03:30.670> you're<00:03:31.660> going<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.870> do<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.200> flat

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
except the e you're going to do the flat

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:42.020 
except the e you're going to do the flat
5<00:03:32.830> which<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.190> e<00:03:34.020> so<00:03:35.020> we<00:03:35.500> get<00:03:35.710> a<00:03:36.100> C<00:03:36.970> E<00:03:37.330> flat<00:03:37.510> G

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030
