00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
boo I'm looking at the gimbal platform

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.810 
boo I'm looking at the gimbal platform
and<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.740> find<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.160> about<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.699> have

Caroline here to tell us so one of the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.310 
Caroline here to tell us so one of the
demonstration<00:00:21.330> apps<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.050> i'm<00:00:22.140> going<00:00:22.260> to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
demonstration apps that i'm going to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.040 
demonstration apps that i'm going to
show<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.710> called<00:00:22.740> blue<00:00:23.130> kangaroo<00:00:24.050> which

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
show you is called blue kangaroo which

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.490 
show you is called blue kangaroo which
is<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:26.210> personal<00:00:27.210> shopper<00:00:27.420> type<00:00:27.840> application

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
is a personal shopper type application

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.220 
is a personal shopper type application
and<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> uses<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> gimbal<00:00:29.550> platform<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.140> that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
and it uses the gimbal platform and that

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.110 
and it uses the gimbal platform and that
uses<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.500> couple<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.890> different<00:00:32.189> things<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.940> so

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
uses a couple of different things and so

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.110 
uses a couple of different things and so
what<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> does<00:00:33.570> is

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
what it does is

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.810 
what it does is
over<00:00:35.719> time<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.170> can<00:00:36.489> learn<00:00:37.489> where<00:00:37.789> your

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
over time you can learn where your

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.750 
over time you can learn where your
preferences<00:00:38.420> are<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:39.500> in<00:00:40.010> addition<00:00:40.129> it<00:00:40.579> knows

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
preferences are and in addition it knows

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.310 
preferences are and in addition it knows
what<00:00:40.969> your<00:00:41.090> location<00:00:41.540> is<00:00:41.690> but<00:00:41.930> if<00:00:42.050> you<00:00:42.140> go<00:00:42.260> to

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
what your location is but if you go to

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.069 
what your location is but if you go to
the<00:00:42.410> gimbal<00:00:43.070> tab<00:00:43.309> here<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:44.510> an<00:00:44.629> opt-in

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
the gimbal tab here it's an opt-in

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.500 
the gimbal tab here it's an opt-in
solution<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.250> can<00:00:46.579> easily<00:00:46.730> decide<00:00:47.239> if<00:00:47.390> you

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
solution so you can easily decide if you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.240 
solution so you can easily decide if you
want<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:48.050> application<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:48.949> new<00:00:49.100> information

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
want the application to new information

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.160 
want the application to new information
if<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:49.760> or<00:00:50.030> not<00:00:50.149> no<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:50.600> we're<00:00:50.960> going<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.140> go

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
if you or not no so we're going to go

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.530 
if you or not no so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.379> turn<00:00:51.589> that<00:00:51.739> on

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
ahead and turn that on

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.340 
ahead and turn that on
and<00:00:54.400> let's<00:00:55.400> say<00:00:55.610> that<00:00:55.640> you<00:00:56.030> are<00:00:56.060> going<00:00:56.810> into<00:00:56.990> a

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
and let's say that you are going into a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.480 
and let's say that you are going into a
store<00:00:58.100> and

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
store and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.630 
store and
you<00:01:00.060> your<00:01:00.660> favorite<00:01:00.840> area<00:01:01.800> favorite<00:01:02.220> stores

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you your favorite area favorite stores

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.250 
you your favorite area favorite stores
are<00:01:04.070> bcbg<00:01:05.070> jab<00:01:05.340> or<00:01:05.610> whatever<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.360> may<00:01:06.480> be<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
are bcbg jab or whatever it may be and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.980 
are bcbg jab or whatever it may be and
so<00:01:07.410> as<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.710> enter<00:01:08.040> into<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.370> wall<00:01:08.990> it'll

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
so as you enter into a wall it'll

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.960 
so as you enter into a wall it'll
automatically<00:01:10.620> know<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.070> small<00:01:11.310> you're<00:01:11.490> so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
when you go in it uses the geofencing

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.410 
when you go in it uses the geofencing
capability<00:01:15.910> that<00:01:16.120> cable<00:01:16.390> offers

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420

so in that just a quick high-level
overview<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:39.440> dimple<00:01:40.130> on<00:01:41.120> this<00:01:41.570> application

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
overview of dimple on this application

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
overview of dimple on this application
however

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.580 

other<00:01:44.700> applications<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.750> coming<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.290> end

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
other applications that coming out end

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.050 
other applications that coming out end
of<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.830> month<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.460> discharged<00:01:47.850> their

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
of this month is discharged their

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.950 
of this month is discharged their
application

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
application

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560 
application
and<00:01:49.440> this<00:01:50.130> uses<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:50.909> more

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and this uses to that a little more

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.680 
and this uses to that a little more
features<00:01:52.260> within<00:01:52.470> within<00:01:53.070> Gimple<00:01:53.580> so<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.600> this

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
features within within Gimple so in this

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.480 
features within within Gimple so in this
application<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.350> actually<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> game<00:01:56.220> or

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
application is actually a game or

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.930 
application is actually a game or
Stargell<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:58.190> one<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.400> features<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
Stargell and one of the features that it

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.730 
Stargell and one of the features that it
uses<00:02:00.060> image<00:02:00.570> recognition<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.320> I'll<00:02:01.410> take<00:02:01.590> you

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
uses image recognition so I'll take you

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.420 
uses image recognition so I'll take you
over<00:02:01.950> here

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
over here

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.160 
over here
I<00:02:03.490> know<00:02:03.940> it's<00:02:04.150> pretty<00:02:04.270> quick<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.720> saw<00:02:04.930> before

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
I know it's pretty quick I saw before

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.760 
I know it's pretty quick I saw before
really<00:02:05.770> fast<00:02:05.980> so<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.790> keep<00:02:07.090> watching<00:02:07.240> so<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
really fast so I keep watching so the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.139 
really fast so I keep watching so the
idea<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.280> be<00:02:09.520> able<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.729> build<00:02:09.820> as<00:02:10.030> many

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.950 
idea is to be able to build as many
points<00:02:10.690> as<00:02:10.929> possible

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
points as possible

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.030 
points as possible
but<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.350> look<00:02:12.440> at<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.620> image<00:02:12.890> recognition

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
but if you look at the image recognition

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.260 
but if you look at the image recognition
I<00:02:13.820> just<00:02:14.090> hit<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.330> start<00:02:14.780> start<00:02:15.650> beginning<00:02:16.270> and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
I just hit the start start beginning and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.900 
I just hit the start start beginning and
it<00:02:17.420> already<00:02:17.570> pretty<00:02:18.260> instant<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:19.160> it's<00:02:19.760> pretty

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
it already pretty instant so it's pretty

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.200 
it already pretty instant so it's pretty
impressive<00:02:20.120> there<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:20.990> then<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.500> other

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
impressive there and then the other

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.310
