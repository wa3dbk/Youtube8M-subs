UFX space going through audiobook so you
can<00:00:19.560> see<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.800> works<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.220> audio<00:00:20.550> boss<00:00:20.760> and

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.120 
can see it works with audio boss and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.710 
they're a couple of issues I have with
this<00:00:23.910> program<00:00:24.390> okay<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.400> it's<00:00:29.060> you<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
this program okay so it's you know you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.930 
this program okay so it's you know you
can't<00:00:30.990> save<00:00:31.260> presets<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.730> are<00:00:32.820> no

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
can't save presets and there are no

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.640 
can't save presets and there are no
presets<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.690> can't<00:00:34.620> read<00:00:34.980> what<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.760> says<00:00:36.090> and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
presets I can't read what this says and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.560 
presets I can't read what this says and
I'm<00:00:37.650> not<00:00:37.800> sure<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.130> they<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.329> but<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.450> can

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I'm not sure what they do but you can

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.330 
I'm not sure what they do but you can
get<00:00:39.720> some<00:00:39.750> pretty<00:00:40.050> pretty<00:00:40.440> weird<00:00:40.740> effects<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
get some pretty pretty weird effects it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.930 
get some pretty pretty weird effects it
generates<00:00:41.760> noise<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.020> will<00:00:43.140> appeal<00:00:43.380> to<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
generates noise so it will appeal to the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.120 
generates noise so it will appeal to the
drone<00:00:44.940> type<00:00:47.540> gang<00:00:48.540> who<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.290> add<00:00:49.739> drones

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
drone type gang who like to add drones

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.650 
drone type gang who like to add drones
and<00:00:50.340> stuff<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.640> weird<00:00:50.820> sci-fi<00:00:51.030> stuff<00:00:51.420> three

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and stuff and weird sci-fi stuff three

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
and stuff and weird sci-fi stuff three
things<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.200> some<00:00:52.350> pretty<00:00:52.530> entry<00:00:53.010> way

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
things I can get some pretty entry way

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.190 
things I can get some pretty entry way
affects<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.630> I've<00:00:54.750> got<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.020> going

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
affects it so I've got this going

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.630 
affects it so I've got this going
through<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.560> a<00:00:55.950> UFX<00:00:56.670> space<00:00:58.340> only<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> other

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
through a a UFX space only the other

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.700 
through a a UFX space only the other
thing<00:00:59.850> as<00:01:00.000> well<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.420> volume<00:01:01.110> control<00:01:01.470> area

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
thing as well this volume control area

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
thing as well this volume control area
is<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:02.180> tearing<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:03.300> before<00:01:03.570> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
is really tearing this down before you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:51.340 
is really tearing this down before you
start<00:01:03.960> using<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.430 

so<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.650> gonna<00:01:52.830> bypass<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:54.090> ofx<00:01:54.990> space<00:01:55.230> for

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
so I'm just gonna bypass a ofx space for

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.780 
so I'm just gonna bypass a ofx space for
a<00:01:55.470> sec<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.010> see<00:01:56.190> what<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.460> sounds<00:01:56.670> like

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
a sec just to see what this sounds like

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:09.430 
a sec just to see what this sounds like
on<00:01:57.060> its<00:01:57.210> own

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.030 

and<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:10.070> can<00:02:10.220> see<00:02:10.370> we<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.790> set<00:02:11.360> these<00:02:11.540> XY<00:02:12.140> pad

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
and you can see we can set these XY pad

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.610 
and you can see we can set these XY pad
theatres<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:14.360> pretty<00:02:14.600> much<00:02:14.780> morality<00:02:15.290> that's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
theatres to pretty much morality that's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.440 
theatres to pretty much morality that's
on<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.010> device

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.870 

okay<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:20.040> here<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.520> for<00:02:20.550> your

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
okay and this is down here is for your

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.610 
okay and this is down here is for your
gyroscope<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.810> if<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:21.990> switch<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.440> can

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
gyroscope so if you switch on you can

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.260 
gyroscope so if you switch on you can
move<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.099> iPad<00:02:23.370> around<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:23.760> get<00:02:23.849> sounds<00:02:24.150> like

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
move the iPad around and get sounds like

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.870 
move the iPad around and get sounds like
that<00:02:24.450> let's<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.620> let's<00:02:26.069> put<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.550> xbase

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that let's have a let's put a of xbase

00:02:26.880 --> 00:03:27.290 
that let's have a let's put a of xbase
back<00:02:27.120> up<00:02:27.239> because<00:02:27.330> it's<00:02:27.540> really<00:02:27.599> cool

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:04:13.140 

the<00:03:28.300> killing<00:03:28.720> she<00:03:29.340> fetches<00:03:30.340> your<00:03:30.970> slices

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:31.340 

we<00:04:13.870> can<00:04:14.020> mix<00:04:14.140> between<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.650> two<00:04:14.800> oscillators

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:05:25.240 

the<00:04:32.350> offset<00:04:32.980> low<00:04:33.280> frequency<00:04:33.820> oscillators

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.060 

okay<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.310> we<00:05:26.490> have<00:05:26.580> settings<00:05:26.940> here<00:05:28.070> which

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
okay so we have settings here which

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.790 
okay so we have settings here which
means<00:05:29.250> that<00:05:29.520> we<00:05:29.639> can<00:05:29.880> set<00:05:30.780> up<00:05:30.840> our<00:05:31.139> input<00:05:31.620> MIDI

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
means that we can set up our input MIDI

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.189 
means that we can set up our input MIDI
channel<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:33.470> we<00:05:34.470> can<00:05:34.620> assign<00:05:34.889> our<00:05:36.199> our

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
channel and we can assign our our

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.490 
channel and we can assign our our
everything<00:05:37.850> submit<00:05:38.850> E<00:05:38.880> which<00:05:39.840> is<00:05:39.870> pretty<00:05:40.199> cool

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
everything submit E which is pretty cool

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.180 
everything submit E which is pretty cool
just<00:05:41.250> app<00:05:41.400> info<00:05:41.820> there<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.080> next<00:05:43.350> thing<00:05:43.530> so

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
just app info there is the next thing so

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.890 
just app info there is the next thing so
we<00:05:44.310> can<00:05:44.430> close<00:05:44.580> that<00:05:47.360> so<00:05:48.360> you<00:05:48.419> can<00:05:48.570> see<00:05:48.750> it

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
we can close that so you can see it

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.760 
we can close that so you can see it
sounds<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.919> sounds<00:05:49.979> pretty<00:05:51.500> sounds<00:05:52.500> okay

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
sounds it sounds pretty sounds okay

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.230 
sounds it sounds pretty sounds okay
without<00:05:52.889> the<00:05:53.130> effect<00:05:53.460> but<00:05:53.669> it<00:05:53.760> just<00:05:53.910> sounds

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
without the effect but it just sounds

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
without the effect but it just sounds
better<00:05:54.710> with<00:05:55.710> a<00:05:56.430> space<00:05:57.030> and<00:05:57.419> you<00:05:57.750> could<00:05:57.960> pretty

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
better with a space and you could pretty
