00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
like look we didn't have a flash

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.210 
like look we didn't have a flash
we<00:05:12.419> just<00:05:12.630> used<00:05:12.810> tons<00:05:13.080> of<00:05:13.230> lights<00:05:13.440> we<00:05:14.100> were

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
we just used tons of lights we were

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.340 
we just used tons of lights we were
outside<00:05:14.490> we<00:05:15.240> didn't<00:05:15.450> even<00:05:15.540> have<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.720> background

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
outside we didn't even have a background

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.700 
outside we didn't even have a background
our<00:05:16.830> fish<00:05:17.370> tank<00:05:17.610> was<00:05:17.880> leaking<00:05:18.450> horribly<00:05:19.320> and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
our fish tank was leaking horribly and

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.400 
our fish tank was leaking horribly and
these<00:05:20.280> are<00:05:20.490> what<00:05:20.850> I<00:05:21.060> think<00:05:21.090> are<00:05:21.540> decent<00:05:22.080> photos

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410

these are what I think are decent photos
um<00:05:25.730> so<00:05:26.730> really<00:05:27.570> there's<00:05:27.900> nothing<00:05:27.990> more<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.350> say

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500
