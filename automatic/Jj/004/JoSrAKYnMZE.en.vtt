00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
reason why we're going to do this is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.390 
reason why we're going to do this is
because<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.750> summon<00:01:10.049> our<00:01:10.350> void<00:01:10.680> Walker<00:01:11.040> and

we kill them using grimoire of sacrifice
we<00:01:14.460> gain<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:15.090> his<00:01:15.240> abilities<00:01:16.310> which

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
we gain one of his abilities which

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.820 
we gain one of his abilities which
basically<00:01:17.729> increases<00:01:18.150> our<00:01:18.570> health<00:01:18.840> by<00:01:19.439> thirty

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
basically increases our health by thirty

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.880 
basically increases our health by thirty
percent<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.820> 20<00:01:21.390> seconds<00:01:21.840> now<00:01:22.619> this<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
percent for 20 seconds now this is

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.640

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
in arenas yes and no this is mainly for

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.130 
in arenas yes and no this is mainly for
a<00:02:18.150> 1v1<00:02:18.600> like<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> duel<00:02:19.770> or<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:21.060> 2v2<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.840> you're<00:02:21.990> not

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
a 1v1 like a duel or a 2v2 if you're not

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.170 
a 1v1 like a duel or a 2v2 if you're not
running<00:02:22.320> with<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.620> healer<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.850> actually

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
running with the healer this is actually

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.580 
running with the healer this is actually
very<00:02:24.210> good<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.840> you're<00:02:24.960> not<00:02:25.080> running<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
very good if you're not running with the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.190 
very good if you're not running with the
heel<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.800> 2v<00:02:26.160> tues<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.730> maybe<00:02:27.510> four<00:02:27.870> threes

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
heel of 2v tues and maybe four threes

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.950 
heel of 2v tues and maybe four threes
but<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:29.220> wouldn't<00:02:30.120> recommend<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.570> it's<00:02:30.780> also

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
but I wouldn't recommend it it's also

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.810 
but I wouldn't recommend it it's also
good<00:02:31.350> if<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:32.070> want<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.460> rated
