program called F dot luxe now I like to
pronounce<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.819> flux<00:00:55.609> but<00:00:56.609> this<00:00:56.819> program

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
pronounce it flux but this program

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.899 
pronounce it flux but this program
basically<00:00:57.899> does<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.999> little<00:01:00.140> um<00:01:01.909> problem

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
basically does it a little um problem

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.759 
basically does it a little um problem
which<00:01:03.030> runs<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.719> back<00:01:03.929> on<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.350> computer

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which runs in the back on your computer

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.070 
which runs in the back on your computer
now<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.070> very<00:01:05.400> tiny<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.970> won't<00:01:06.210> take<00:01:06.690> any

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
now it's very tiny so won't take any

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.040 
now it's very tiny so won't take any
space<00:01:07.590> from<00:01:07.770> your<00:01:07.890> computer<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.930> what<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
space from your computer and what it

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.380 
space from your computer and what it
basically<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.460> circle

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
basically is is this this little circle

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.130 
basically is is this this little circle
right<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.720> plugs<00:01:14.180> now<00:01:15.180> what<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.510> does<00:01:15.720> is

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
right here plugs now what it does is

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
right here plugs now what it does is
that<00:01:16.440> when<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.610> takes<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> time<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:20.030> time

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that when it takes the time and time

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.970 
that when it takes the time and time
that<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.840> Sun<00:01:22.110> rises<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.660> sets<00:01:24.660> so<00:01:25.650> let's<00:01:25.830> say

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
that the Sun rises and sets so let's say

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.460 
that the Sun rises and sets so let's say
this<00:01:26.010> night<00:01:26.370> time<00:01:26.930> clocks<00:01:27.930> will<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.290> it's

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
this night time clocks will know it's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.650 
this night time clocks will know it's
nighttime<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.190> what<00:01:29.790> it'll<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.450> it'll

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
nighttime and what it'll do is it'll

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.910 
nighttime and what it'll do is it'll
just<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.680> brightness<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.460> tent<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.920> many

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
just the brightness the tent and many

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.680 
just the brightness the tent and many
little<00:01:35.420> features<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.780> your<00:01:37.500> screen<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
little features of your screen and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.340 
little features of your screen and
basically<00:01:40.460> put<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.360> won't<00:01:42.510> affect

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
basically put it so that it won't affect

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
basically put it so that it won't affect
your<00:01:43.440> eyes<00:01:43.620> and<00:01:44.010> it'll<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.820> easier<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.330> read

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
your eyes and it'll be easier to read

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.340 
your eyes and it'll be easier to read
what's<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> screen<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.960> right<00:01:48.960> now<00:01:48.990> it's

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
what's on the screen so right now it's

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.990 
what's on the screen so right now it's
not<00:01:49.560> doing<00:01:49.830> it<00:01:49.950> because<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.550> in<00:01:50.940> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
not doing it because it's in the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.180 
not doing it because it's in the
afternoon<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.380> stomach<00:01:52.710> still<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.010> but

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
about this program is that it's free you

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.630 
about this program is that it's free you
can<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.680> at<00:02:02.000> stereo<00:02:03.740> system<00:02:04.740> /<00:02:05.010> flux<00:02:05.400> I

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
can get it at stereo system / flux I

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.830 
can get it at stereo system / flux I
will<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.910> it<00:02:05.940> up<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> description

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
will have it up in the description

will have it up in the description
because<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.440> site's<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:09.090> know

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
because the site's a little bit you know

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.369 
because the site's a little bit you know
how<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.780> figure<00:02:10.349> out<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.540> yeah<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.170> can

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
how to figure out so yeah that you can

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.660 
how to figure out so yeah that you can
download<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.069> for<00:02:14.310> vista<00:02:14.519> XP<00:02:15.209> or<00:02:15.599> a<00:02:16.590> mac<00:02:16.890> so

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
download it for vista XP or a mac so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.759 
download it for vista XP or a mac so
yeah<00:02:18.659> it<00:02:18.840> should<00:02:19.140> work<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.409> everything

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
yeah it should work for everything

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.160 
yeah it should work for everything
except<00:02:20.159> you<00:02:20.310> want<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.940> don't<00:02:21.599> probably<00:02:21.750> all

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
