00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
we all learned it in school when it

it's only now that we're starting to

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.979 
it's only now that we're starting to
understand<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.760> mechanism<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.630> how<00:03:48.780> this

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
understand the mechanism of how this

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.140 
understand the mechanism of how this
condition<00:03:49.470> occurs<00:03:49.620> what<00:03:50.430> we<00:03:50.549> can<00:03:50.730> learn<00:03:50.910> from

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
condition occurs what we can learn from

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.789 
condition occurs what we can learn from
this<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.570> while<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.019> sex<00:03:52.260> chromosomes

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
this is that while the sex chromosomes

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.160 
this is that while the sex chromosomes
we<00:03:53.010> carry<00:03:53.370> do<00:03:54.030> determine<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.690> lot<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.900> our
