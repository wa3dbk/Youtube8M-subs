00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.010
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 teaching how to make a great cake 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.340
 bacon and potato 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.910
 for making a cake 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.879
 potato and bacon we are going to need bacon 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.090
 potato salt pepper and grated cheese a 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.379
 cheese that well founded the potato you can 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.510
 see that we cut it with a 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.510
 mandolin very very very fine for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.220
 which then becomes much more simple 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.809
 the bacon we have removed the bark and 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.640
 Exactly the same thing we have gone through the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.250
 laminator and we have some good strips of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.589
 an even thickness to the Potato 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.120
 process is in this mold of plum cake 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.739
 that we have to whom we have put a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.620
 little waxed paper to avoid 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.070
 after it sticks out is this 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.830
 we're just going to be putting layers of 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.110
 bacon always trying to make sure 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.940
 The bacon 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.560
 instead of the beta always the same 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.000
 direction so that when you extract it 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.880
 is much more beautiful and always leaving 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.700
 a good part to close the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.299
 end of the process 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.000
 then we will go filling 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:32.799
 superimposing the layers first 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.799
 interspersing the first and the second 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.430
 until filling the bottom completely 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.880
 well this would be the first step 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 you will see that it was perfectly covered 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.849
 all the background 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.670
 now we would simply go to 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.920
 putting the layers of potato 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.550
 we could square leave it alone to the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.180
 same size then neither is it either 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.180
 necessary 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.430
 let's go putting let's go 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.430
 pressing lightly 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.030
 and once we have stuffed all the bottom 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.230
 what we do is 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.230
 put some pepper 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.200
 and a little salt not in excess because 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.870
 this bacon is smoked and it will give 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.040
 Also some salt intake will 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.040
 let's put some cheese 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.180
 neither in excess 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.320
 and let's move be putting 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.209
 the layers of bacon 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 Y 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.180
 well arrived at this point that would be the 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.180
 last layer let's put it now 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.540
 in the last part d 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.540
 of cheese 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.110
 and we're just going to go 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.520
 being up that part of the bacon 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.690
 that we had left 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.690
 outside the container 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.210
 you see clearly the potato is totally 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.180
 loose but good at the time the 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.430
 that takes temperature in the process of 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.050
 baked because I 'm going like to go 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.760
 releasing part of its fat and this is going to 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.390
 get the whole set 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.030
 if for whatever reason you do not cover the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.260
 whole potato would not happen anything by 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.510
 realize that this then goes to 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.370
 constitute the base then part that 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.109
 we would present would be the top and 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.709
 we would not have any kind of problem 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.709
 good 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.880
 Now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.880
 some aluminum foil 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.360
 let's save it well 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.249
 and we 're going to go to the oven for space 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.840
 about 60 minutes at 180 degrees will depend 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.729
 a little of the thickness you have in the 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.050
 potato however to check it 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.180
 It would be convenient for you to throw me 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.680
 something sharp like a needle 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.020
 a toothpick and see if you enter with 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.560
 ease because I would have already reached 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.960
 ideal point of 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.180
 of cooking so I have not said anything 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.180
 180 degrees 60 minutes 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.050
 we came from the oven , we had it to 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.210
 180 degrees for 60 minutes and what 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.640
 let's do now it's going to be using 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.830
 the silver paper itself we are going to put 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.240
 a mold of plum cake of the same 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.240
 dimensions above 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.170
 to press, we're going to let it temper 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.630
 a little bit and we'll put it in the camera 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.430
 for about two or three hours 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.650
 until everything is all well and good 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.140
 settled and right now we teach you the 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.600
 good result let's move on to 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.880
 unmold after having had it with 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.000
 the rest of refrigerated 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.450
 we are going to remove the silver paper 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.080
 you see here we have the result now we 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.080
 Let's help 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.199
 of the waxed paper 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.330
 let's throw a little bit of each end 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.330
 to keep it well 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.699
 and this would be our bacon cake and 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:02.699
 potato
