for<00:00:15.760> me<00:00:15.880> I<00:00:15.910> don't<00:00:16.059> really<00:00:16.150> have<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:17.790> practice<00:00:18.790> or

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
for me I don't really have a practice or

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.580 
for me I don't really have a practice or
a<00:00:19.000> routine<00:00:19.599> that<00:00:19.720> I<00:00:19.840> have<00:00:20.020> for<00:00:20.200> alternative

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
a routine that I have for alternative

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.040 
a routine that I have for alternative
picking<00:00:20.920> a<00:00:21.369> lot<00:00:22.180> of<00:00:22.210> it<00:00:22.390> is<00:00:22.510> in<00:00:22.660> my<00:00:22.810> hand

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
picking a lot of it is in my hand

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.070 
picking a lot of it is in my hand
position<00:00:23.590> I<00:00:23.800> choke<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.910> pick<00:00:25.060> off<00:00:25.240> really

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
position I choke to pick off really

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.550 
position I choke to pick off really
really<00:00:26.110> shallow<00:00:26.619> so<00:00:26.920> there's<00:00:27.130> not<00:00:27.490> a<00:00:27.520> lot<00:00:27.789> of

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
really shallow so there's not a lot of

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.620 
really shallow so there's not a lot of
material<00:00:29.560> sticking<00:00:30.250> earnings<00:00:30.550> my<00:00:30.670> hand<00:00:30.970> and<00:00:31.240> I

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
material sticking earnings my hand and I

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.360 
material sticking earnings my hand and I
also<00:00:31.810> keep<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.320> pick<00:00:32.529> so<00:00:32.800> that<00:00:32.980> it's<00:00:33.160> it's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
also keep the pick so that it's it's

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.910 
also keep the pick so that it's it's
kind<00:00:33.760> of<00:00:33.820> it's<00:00:34.269> it's<00:00:34.449> almost<00:00:34.690> parallel<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.800> the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
kind of it's it's almost parallel to the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.680 
kind of it's it's almost parallel to the
string<00:00:36.280> but<00:00:36.550> not<00:00:36.730> not<00:00:36.970> too<00:00:37.180> much<00:00:37.420> some<00:00:37.660> people

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
string but not not too much some people

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.299 
string but not not too much some people
when<00:00:37.989> they<00:00:38.019> have<00:00:38.199> this<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.590> pick<00:00:38.800> parallel

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
when they have this to pick parallel

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.880 
when they have this to pick parallel
it's<00:00:39.760> harder<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.300> pick<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.720> string<00:00:41.140> I<00:00:41.379> haven't

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
it's harder to pick the string I haven't

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.950 
it's harder to pick the string I haven't
just<00:00:42.100> a<00:00:42.220> little<00:00:42.430> bit<00:00:42.550> turn<00:00:42.820> so<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.150> it<00:00:43.390> almost

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
just a little bit turn so that it almost

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.620 
just a little bit turn so that it almost
nudges<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.130> string<00:00:45.489> over<00:00:45.700> the<00:00:46.270> other<00:00:46.390> thing

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
nudges the string over the other thing

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.200 
nudges the string over the other thing
too<00:00:46.930> for<00:00:47.170> me<00:00:47.290> with<00:00:47.530> some<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.579> picking

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
too for me with some of the picking

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.110 
too for me with some of the picking
patterns<00:00:49.570> that<00:00:49.690> I<00:00:49.750> have<00:00:49.989> they<00:00:50.980> would<00:00:51.160> just<00:00:51.879> be

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
patterns that I have they would just be

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.000 
patterns that I have they would just be
totally<00:00:52.450> inaudible<00:00:53.260> if<00:00:53.320> there<00:00:53.620> was<00:00:53.739> at<00:00:53.890> the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
totally inaudible if there was at the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.830 
totally inaudible if there was at the
palm<00:00:54.250> muting<00:00:54.550> technique<00:00:54.579> that<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.239> use<00:00:55.570> myself

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
palm muting technique that I use myself

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.740 
palm muting technique that I use myself
I<00:00:56.260> like<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.100> put<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.550> bridge<00:00:58.149> of<00:00:58.329> my<00:00:58.510> hand

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
I like to put the bridge of my hand

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.389 
I like to put the bridge of my hand
right<00:00:58.930> here<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.260> meat<00:00:59.530> of<00:00:59.649> it<00:00:59.770> right<00:01:00.190> across

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
right here the meat of it right across

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.549 
right here the meat of it right across
the<00:01:00.489> bridge<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.450> pickup<00:01:02.110> I<00:01:02.289> mean<00:01:02.469> the

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
the bridge of the pickup I mean the

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.560 
the bridge of the pickup I mean the
bridge<00:01:03.340> there<00:01:03.520> and<00:01:03.789> just<00:01:03.940> kind<00:01:04.149> of<00:01:04.180> wallet

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
bridge there and just kind of wallet

then<00:01:15.189> I<00:01:15.280> go<00:01:15.460> sometimes<00:01:15.850> I'll<00:01:16.180> just<00:01:16.210> cut<00:01:16.509> with<00:01:16.659> a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
then I go sometimes I'll just cut with a

Chinese don't try to consequences
I<00:01:26.299> can't<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.539> can't<00:01:27.810> start<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.320> pattern<00:01:28.530> if

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I can't I can't start a pattern if

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
I can't I can't start a pattern if
there's<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.189> there's<00:01:29.369> four<00:01:29.610> notes<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.030> there

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
there's if there's four notes in there

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.910 
there's if there's four notes in there
and<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.600> doing<00:01:30.930> three<00:01:31.229> notes<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.680> want<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and I'm doing three notes and I want to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.609 
and I'm doing three notes and I want to
down<00:01:32.070> pick<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:34.320> alternate<00:01:36.409> because<00:01:37.409> of

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
down pick on the alternate because of

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.260 
down pick on the alternate because of
the<00:01:37.740> timing<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.250> gonna<00:01:38.429> do<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> fourth<00:01:39.030> note

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the timing I'm gonna do the fourth note

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.960 
the timing I'm gonna do the fourth note
it's<00:01:39.479> gonna<00:01:39.600> be<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> same<00:01:40.049> thing<00:01:40.850> it's<00:01:41.850> gonna

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it's gonna be the same thing it's gonna

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.639 
it's gonna be the same thing it's gonna
be<00:01:42.149> an<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.420> pick<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> fourth<00:01:43.140> note<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
be an up pick on the fourth note if I

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.559 
be an up pick on the fourth note if I
want<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> down<00:01:44.130> pick<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.700> down<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.299> down

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
want to down pick and I go down up down

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.399 
want to down pick and I go down up down
down<00:01:45.829> it's<00:01:46.829> gonna<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:47.280> time<00:01:48.170> suspect<00:01:49.170> when<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
down it's gonna the time suspect when I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.359 
down it's gonna the time suspect when I
want<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.770> go<00:01:49.890> from<00:01:50.149> four<00:01:51.149> string<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.929> string

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
want to go from four string to string

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.039 
want to go from four string to string
sometimes<00:01:53.369> I'll<00:01:53.759> start<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.270> an<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.630> pick<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
sometimes I'll start with an up pick and

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.020 
sometimes I'll start with an up pick and
then<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.319> down<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.310> try<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.580> keep<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.909> as

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
then go down as I try and keep it as

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.779 
then go down as I try and keep it as
flowing<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.569> possible<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:58.170> between<00:01:58.560> notes<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
flowing as possible in between notes the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.279 
flowing as possible in between notes the
other<00:01:59.849> thing<00:02:00.149> too<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.569> cheat<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> lot<00:02:01.080> when

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
other thing too is I cheat a lot when

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.630 
other thing too is I cheat a lot when
you're<00:02:01.409> asking<00:02:01.679> me<00:02:01.799> how<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.130> back<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> forth

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
you're asking me how I go back and forth

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.449 
you're asking me how I go back and forth
between<00:02:02.729> strings<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.709> lank<00:02:04.709> my<00:02:05.009> finger<00:02:05.369> either

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
between strings I lank my finger either

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.399 
between strings I lank my finger either
on<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.729> pick<00:02:05.939> up<00:02:06.060> ring<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> strings

position so the palm was facing up I
could<00:02:48.239> pull<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.540> muscle<00:02:48.840> up<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.109> way<00:02:49.319> I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
could pull the muscle up this way I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.930 
could pull the muscle up this way I
could<00:02:49.560> close<00:02:50.069> my<00:02:50.100> hand<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.609> everything<00:02:50.760> like

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
could close my hand and everything like

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940 
could close my hand and everything like
this<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.299> my<00:02:51.480> hand<00:02:51.720> was<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:52.319> this<00:02:52.530> position

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
this if my hand was in this position

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.800 
this if my hand was in this position
where<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> palm<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.579> facing<00:02:53.730> down<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.329> couldn't

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
where the palm is facing down I couldn't

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.930 
where the palm is facing down I couldn't
do<00:02:54.870> nothing<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.260> just<00:02:55.470> hung<00:02:55.829> like<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.310> so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
do nothing I just hung like that so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.349 
do nothing I just hung like that so
because<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.450> guitar<00:02:58.220> in<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.430> position<00:02:59.910> you

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
because the guitar in this position you

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.610 
because the guitar in this position you
know<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.600> palm<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.930> facing<00:03:01.079> up<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.440> would

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
know the palm is facing up you would

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.440 
know the palm is facing up you would
think<00:03:01.829> that<00:03:01.950> something<00:03:02.250> could<00:03:02.400> happen<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.000> it

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
think that something could happen and it

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.849 
think that something could happen and it
was<00:03:03.540> fine<00:03:03.840> going<00:03:04.079> this<00:03:04.260> way<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:04.560> when<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.680> had

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
was fine going this way but when I had

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.620 
was fine going this way but when I had
to<00:03:04.950> pull<00:03:05.160> my<00:03:05.190> hand<00:03:05.549> back<00:03:05.700> down<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:06.090> way<00:03:06.359> I

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
to pull my hand back down this way I

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.479 
to pull my hand back down this way I
couldn't<00:03:07.260> get<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> muscle<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:07.889> pull<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.250> way

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
couldn't get the muscle to pull this way

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.460 
couldn't get the muscle to pull this way
so<00:03:09.090> some<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.660> things<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.049> did<00:03:10.260> when<00:03:10.440> I

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
so some of the things that I did when I

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.229 
so some of the things that I did when I
was<00:03:10.590> trying<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:11.130> rehabilitate<00:03:11.340> my<00:03:11.850> arm<00:03:12.030> and

was trying to rehabilitate my arm and

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.750 
was trying to rehabilitate my arm and
this<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:13.049> would<00:03:13.230> be<00:03:13.260> before<00:03:14.220> any<00:03:14.370> guitar

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
this this would be before any guitar

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.250 
this this would be before any guitar
player<00:03:15.000> was<00:03:15.180> injured<00:03:15.540> their<00:03:15.720> arm<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.200> they

player was injured their arm and they

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.690 
player was injured their arm and they
think<00:03:16.500> it's<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.829> end<00:03:16.859> of<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.069> world<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:17.489> not
