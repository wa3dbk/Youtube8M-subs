 our faculty was and will be a forge 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.750
 personnel for the chemical industry 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 enterprises of organizations in the field of protection 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.160

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.440
 technology 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.690
 among the teachers of the department 50 percent 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.200
 work directly in production 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.780
 and associated with the process 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.640
 the department is equipped with modern facilities 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.390
 measurement and safety diagnostics 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.390
 productions 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.460
 the department produces specialists in two 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.270
 profile within the direction 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.490
 chemical Technology 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.900
 this chemical technology is inorganic 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.540
 substances 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.280
 and chemical technology refractory 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.280
 non-metallic and silicate materials 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.880
 The department produces specialists in 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.010
 fundamental and applied 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.210
 chemistry 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.260
 graduates work in positions 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.990
 chemical analyst 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.370
 head of laboratory leading specialist 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.270
 research assistant 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.679
 so the game is to release specialists in two 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.429
 profile within the direction 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.460
 chemical Technology 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.800
 This technology and processing of polymers 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.370
 synthetic chemical technology 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.300
 biologically active substances 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.170
 chemical pharmaceuticals and 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.170

 specialists in the field of energy 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.659
 and resource-saving processes in 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.609
 chemical technology of petrochemistry and 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.920

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.269
 use of natural resources 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.489
 after army service in the ninety-fifth 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.349
 year came came to the factory because 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.659
 that education college energy 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.000
 but without professional experience in the 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.519
 It did not take works just apparatchiks 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.239
 so that further well as if to advance on 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.209
 waited a long time so-called. 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.319
 you must have a higher education 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.170
 worked two three years arrived 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.930
 flowed and after 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.239
 became a senior couple then a master 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.130
 then the head of the shift now 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.130
 I work here the color of the head is taught 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.660
 specialists in the field of energy and 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.170
 resource saving processes in chemical 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.850

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.370
 cook on the eponymous department 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.500
 graduates can work on such 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.930
 positions as a design engineer 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.750
 design engineer mechanical engineer 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.790
 leading specialist many graduates for 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.680
 a fairly short time to climb 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.060
 career ladder and become 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.400
 shift supervisors 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.400
