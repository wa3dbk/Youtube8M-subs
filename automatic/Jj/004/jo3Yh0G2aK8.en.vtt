as<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.439> sure<00:00:01.469> you<00:00:01.740> guys<00:00:01.829> are<00:00:02.100> familiar<00:00:02.250> with

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:04.009 
as I'm sure you guys are familiar with

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.470 
as I'm sure you guys are familiar with
call<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.040> duty<00:00:05.400> comes<00:00:05.520> out<00:00:05.759> with<00:00:05.970> several

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
call of duty comes out with several

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.700 
call of duty comes out with several
passes<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.580> they<00:00:08.580> limit<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.059> rate<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.240> fire

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
passes and they limit the rate of fire

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.070 
passes and they limit the rate of fire
so<00:00:10.710> um<00:00:11.250> most<00:00:12.030> people<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.480> get<00:00:12.599> around<00:00:12.780> that

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
so um most people to get around that

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.600 
so um most people to get around that
they<00:00:13.259> just<00:00:13.440> slow<00:00:13.620> down<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.250> rate<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.429> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
they just slow down the rate of the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
they just slow down the rate of the
power<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> controller<00:00:15.360> shoot<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:15.809> but

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
power that the controller shoot at but

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.240 
power that the controller shoot at but
with<00:00:16.949> us<00:00:17.520> we'll<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.000> doing<00:00:18.529> something<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.890> I've

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
with us we'll be doing something as I've

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.370 
with us we'll be doing something as I've
been<00:00:20.279> shown<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> video<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> be

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
been shown in the video I'm going to be

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.609 
been shown in the video I'm going to be
called<00:00:22.619> jitter<00:00:22.890> mode<00:00:24.199> basically<00:00:25.199> what<00:00:25.590> it

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
called jitter mode basically what it

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.150 
called jitter mode basically what it
does<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:26.279> will<00:00:26.820> shoot<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:27.869> we'll<00:00:28.160> reload

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
does it will shoot and then we'll reload

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.069 
does it will shoot and then we'll reload
and<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:30.359> cancel<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> reload<00:00:32.210> that<00:00:33.210> way<00:00:33.360> it

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and then cancel the reload that way it

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.690 
and then cancel the reload that way it
allows<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.710> around<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.010> patch<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.610> it

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
allows you to get around the patch so it

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.810 
allows you to get around the patch so it
doesn't<00:00:36.059> affect<00:00:36.570> your<00:00:36.809> rate<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.930> fire<00:00:37.820> no

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
doesn't affect your rate of fire no

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.580 
doesn't affect your rate of fire no
other<00:00:38.940> sellers<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.840> right<00:00:40.020> now<00:00:40.260> it's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
other sellers have this right now it's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.779 
other sellers have this right now it's
um<00:00:41.899> somebody<00:00:42.899> really<00:00:43.050> new<00:00:43.340> going<00:00:44.340> down<00:00:44.489> side

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
um somebody really new going down side

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.670 
um somebody really new going down side
to<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> can't<00:00:45.719> stay<00:00:45.930> sculpt<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to it is that you can't stay sculpt in a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.910 
to it is that you can't stay sculpt in a
dream<00:00:47.210> because<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.960> reloading<00:00:49.770> than

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
dream because it's reloading than

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.630 
dream because it's reloading than
camping<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.370> reload<00:00:52.070> but<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.430> does

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
camping the reload but it does

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
camping the reload but it does
significant<00:00:54.329> increase<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.379> rate<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> fire<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
significant increase your rate of fire I

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.459 
significant increase your rate of fire I
can<00:00:56.219> see<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:57.000> online<00:00:57.149> match<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
can see this is an online match and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
can see this is an online match and
normally<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.550> would<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.789> affected<00:01:00.149> by<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
normally it would be affected by the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.529 
normally it would be affected by the
past<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.520> case<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
past but in this case it's not as you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
past but in this case it's not as you
keep<00:01:04.500> significantly<00:01:05.159> faster<00:01:05.369> than<00:01:05.790> what

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
keep significantly faster than what

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.480 
keep significantly faster than what
anyone<00:01:06.299> else<00:01:06.390> had<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:06.900> now<00:01:07.490> something

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
anyone else had it right now something

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.580 
anyone else had it right now something
to<00:01:08.580> show<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> couple<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> weapons

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
to show you with a couple of weapons

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.480 
to show you with a couple of weapons
just<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> capable<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.610> doing<00:01:13.490> so

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
just what this is capable of doing so

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.280 
just what this is capable of doing so
again<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.000> all<00:01:15.150> brand-new<00:01:15.810> no<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.170> else

again this is all brand-new no one else

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.850 
again this is all brand-new no one else

one way to describe it it works with a
friggin<00:01:34.159> show<00:01:34.430> calls<00:01:34.909> would<00:01:35.060> be<00:01:35.180> five<00:01:35.390> as<00:01:35.869> well

nothing but and flawlessly online
because<00:02:07.250> because<00:02:07.429> we<00:02:07.729> got<00:02:07.850> around<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.239> rate

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
because because we got around the rate

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.140 
because because we got around the rate
of<00:02:08.420> products<00:02:09.280> are<00:02:10.280> usually<00:02:10.640> affected<00:02:11.000> by<00:02:11.090> the

of products are usually affected by the

of products are usually affected by the
time

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.530 

just<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.380> going<00:02:34.650> those<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.160> video<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.910> being

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
just so going those this video is being

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.900 
just so going those this video is being
made<00:02:36.780> after<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.260> September<00:02:38.190> third<00:02:38.430> call<00:02:38.820> of

made after the September third call of

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.870 
made after the September third call of
duty<00:02:39.090> four<00:02:39.390> patch<00:02:40.250> fortunately<00:02:41.250> reduce<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
duty four patch fortunately reduce the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.220 
duty four patch fortunately reduce the
rate<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.060> fire<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.480> you're<00:02:42.660> allowed<00:02:42.900> and

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
rate of fire that you're allowed and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.830 
rate of fire that you're allowed and
this<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.040> what's<00:02:44.910> possible<00:02:45.330> with<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.630> jitter

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
this is what's possible with the jitter

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.970 
this is what's possible with the jitter
mode<00:02:47.990> now<00:02:48.990> you<00:02:49.050> can<00:02:49.200> see<00:02:49.380> that's<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.620> lot<00:02:49.800> faster

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
mode now you can see that's a lot faster

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.560 
mode now you can see that's a lot faster
and<00:02:50.190> what<00:02:50.370> anyone<00:02:51.270> else<00:02:51.390> currently<00:02:51.900> has<00:02:53.570> other

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
and what anyone else currently has other

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.110 
and what anyone else currently has other
