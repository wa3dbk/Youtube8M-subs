gardening<00:00:17.140> raised<00:00:18.140> beds<00:00:18.470> are<00:00:18.650> just<00:00:18.949> what<00:00:19.099> they

gardening raised beds are just what they

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.249 
gardening raised beds are just what they
sound<00:00:19.490> like<00:00:19.579> mounds<00:00:20.269> of<00:00:20.359> soil<00:00:20.689> that<00:00:20.839> made<00:00:21.169> it

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
sound like mounds of soil that made it

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.499 
sound like mounds of soil that made it
to<00:00:21.349> various<00:00:21.710> shapes<00:00:22.039> they<00:00:22.759> offer<00:00:22.939> lots<00:00:23.300> of

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:23.509 
to various shapes they offer lots of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.659 
to various shapes they offer lots of
advantages<00:00:24.109> in<00:00:24.169> the<00:00:24.380> garden<00:00:24.710> they<00:00:25.189> warm<00:00:25.519> up

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
advantages in the garden they warm up

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.640 
advantages in the garden they warm up
sooner<00:00:26.089> and<00:00:26.300> dry<00:00:26.539> out<00:00:26.689> faster<00:00:27.199> in<00:00:27.289> the<00:00:27.380> spring

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
sooner and dry out faster in the spring

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.200 
sooner and dry out faster in the spring
making<00:00:28.130> it<00:00:28.249> easier<00:00:28.550> for<00:00:28.609> you<00:00:28.789> to<00:00:28.820> get<00:00:29.029> in<00:00:29.119> the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
making it easier for you to get in the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.450 
making it easier for you to get in the
garden<00:00:29.390> they're<00:00:30.079> easier<00:00:30.409> to<00:00:30.470> plant<00:00:30.829> weed<00:00:31.249> and

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
garden they're easier to plant weed and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.700 
garden they're easier to plant weed and
fertilize<00:00:31.970> and<00:00:32.449> since<00:00:32.899> they're<00:00:33.109> raised<00:00:33.379> up

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
fertilize and since they're raised up

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.619 
fertilize and since they're raised up
you<00:00:33.890> won't<00:00:34.039> be<00:00:34.129> stepping<00:00:34.579> on<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.820> soil<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:35.600> you

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
you won't be stepping on the soil so you

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.750 
you won't be stepping on the soil so you
won't<00:00:35.870> be<00:00:35.930> compacting<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.469> roots<00:00:36.770> now<00:00:37.460> raised

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
won't be compacting the roots now raised

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.000 
won't be compacting the roots now raised
beds<00:00:38.090> are<00:00:38.269> great<00:00:38.539> for<00:00:38.989> clay<00:00:39.230> soil<00:00:39.590> because

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
beds are great for clay soil because

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.560 
beds are great for clay soil because
clay<00:00:40.280> is<00:00:40.399> so<00:00:40.550> hard<00:00:40.789> to<00:00:40.940> work<00:00:41.059> with<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.390> raised

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
clay is so hard to work with the raised

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.420 
clay is so hard to work with the raised
beds<00:00:41.870> make<00:00:42.079> them<00:00:42.230> easier<00:00:42.559> but<00:00:43.129> if<00:00:43.219> you<00:00:43.309> have

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
beds make them easier but if you have

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.759 
beds make them easier but if you have
sandy<00:00:43.910> soil<00:00:44.210> it'll<00:00:44.750> dry<00:00:44.989> out<00:00:45.019> really<00:00:45.170> fast<00:00:45.620> so

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
sandy soil it'll dry out really fast so

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.139 
sandy soil it'll dry out really fast so
you<00:00:45.829> might<00:00:46.039> want<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.250> avoid<00:00:46.370> using<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.969> raised

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
you might want to avoid using a raised

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.270 
you might want to avoid using a raised
bed<00:00:47.199> there<00:00:48.199> are<00:00:48.289> two<00:00:48.440> different<00:00:48.800> types<00:00:48.949> of

temporary raised beds like these are

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.630 
temporary raised beds like these are
made<00:00:53.660> each<00:00:53.870> spring<00:00:54.469> you<00:00:55.039> can<00:00:55.190> make<00:00:55.370> them<00:00:55.519> in

made each spring you can make them in
any<00:00:55.910> different<00:00:56.329> shape<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.809> fit<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.289> space

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
is creating drainage spaces so that the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.160 
is creating drainage spaces so that the
water<00:01:58.530> will<00:01:58.829> drain<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.130> whenever<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.789> rains

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170
