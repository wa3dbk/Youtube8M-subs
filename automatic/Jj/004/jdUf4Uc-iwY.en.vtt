00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.530
 this is the online five-cylinder engine 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.599
 new femsa 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.869
 the approximate price 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.349
 mexico that the new pom 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.729
 with 15 7 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.730
 is 279 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 the 200 pesos 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.550
 has a displacement of 2 points 5 liters 20 valves 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.660
 turbocharger feed with inter cooler has system 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.970
 multipoint electronic injection six-speed manual transmission 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 of very close relationships with each other 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.420
 this powertrain allows to accelerate from zero to one hundred kilometers per hour in six 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.040
 points at 8 seconds at sea level 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 and to continue accelerating we could reach a top speed 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.920
 the 42 kilometers per hour 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.180
 the great rigidity of the body 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.840
 makes it possible to perceive even the movement of infections to 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.550
 through the film seat and the steering wheel 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 the medium to fast curves are your element 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.480
 therefore absolutely neutral 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.990
 and great adherence 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.380
 synthetic truce 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.680
 delivering its power from just above idle 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.260
 at 1603 pockets per minute 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.469
 and until you reach the injection cut 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:26.479
 at six thousand eight hundred revolutions per minute 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 makes the federation something very explosive 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.350
 and horsepower allows to maintain average 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.070
 happiness without great effort 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.430
 the firmness of the chassis makes it support extreme angles and very variable loads 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.550
 on intricate roads 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.120
 so that it behaves noble and predictable at all times 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.359
 because alex ziegler the limit of his tires 225 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.070
 pierre 18 92 double uu 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.490
 which by the way is very broad accepting it well 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.369
 relationship with the driver when the address is lightened 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.369
 allowing to react in time 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.629
 if that does not happen 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:11.770
 the stability 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.960
 electronic braking distribution 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.709
 and emergency braking assistance 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.259
 so that in addition to follow 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:24.699
 is protective of its occupants for which there was done by sas air and 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.809
 five safety belts of 13 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.869
 with pretensioners 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:33.629
 The brake system consists of four ventilated discs 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.679
 and assistance systems 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:37.249
 of antiblocking
