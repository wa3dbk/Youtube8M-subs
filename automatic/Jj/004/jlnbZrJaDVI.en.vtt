you need to do it one you need some type
of<00:00:26.290> a<00:00:26.560> top<00:00:26.830> for<00:00:27.369> your<00:00:27.550> poles<00:00:28.419> at<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:29.020> center<00:00:29.320> of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
of a top for your poles at the center of

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.620 
of a top for your poles at the center of
your<00:00:29.560> spiral<00:00:30.399> so<00:00:30.700> someone's<00:00:31.029> not<00:00:31.149> sticking

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
your spiral so someone's not sticking

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.380 
your spiral so someone's not sticking
their<00:00:32.079> hands<00:00:32.290> down<00:00:32.560> in<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.390> having

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
their hands down in and and having

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.030 
their hands down in and and having
catching<00:00:34.960> rainwater<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.559> all<00:00:35.649> kinds<00:00:36.010> of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
catching rainwater and all kinds of

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.330 
catching rainwater and all kinds of
things<00:00:36.250> so<00:00:36.460> we<00:00:37.149> have<00:00:37.270> chosen<00:00:37.480> a<00:00:37.770> sphere<00:00:38.770> that

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
things so we have chosen a sphere that

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.120 
things so we have chosen a sphere that
we<00:00:39.579> attach<00:00:40.329> to<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.630> top<00:00:40.870> a<00:00:41.200> lot<00:00:41.620> of<00:00:41.770> people

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
we attach to the top a lot of people

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.950 
we attach to the top a lot of people
would<00:00:42.520> think<00:00:42.550> well<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:42.969> can<00:00:43.180> just<00:00:43.239> weld<00:00:43.570> that<00:00:43.750> on

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
would think well I can just weld that on

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.710 
would think well I can just weld that on
that<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.620> this<00:00:44.770> case<00:00:44.980> don't<00:00:45.580> do<00:00:45.820> it<00:00:45.970> it's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
that in this case don't do it it's

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.420 
that in this case don't do it it's
better<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:47.110> attach<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.560> with<00:00:47.590> screws<00:00:48.040> on<00:00:48.310> the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
better to attach it with screws on the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.980 
better to attach it with screws on the
inside<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.940> pipe<00:00:49.770> too<00:00:51.150> when<00:00:52.150> they<00:00:52.270> move

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
inside of the pipe too when they move

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.830 
inside of the pipe too when they move
this<00:00:53.200> and<00:00:53.590> powder-coated<00:00:54.580> finish<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.270> your

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
this and powder-coated finish the your

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.690 
this and powder-coated finish the your
product<00:00:56.350> they<00:00:56.620> need<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:56.920> be<00:00:57.070> able<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.280> hold<00:00:57.490> it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
product they need to be able to hold it

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.980 
product they need to be able to hold it
and<00:00:57.880> that's<00:00:58.030> one<00:00:58.210> of<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.360> ways<00:00:58.480> that<00:00:58.690> they<00:00:58.840> can

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
and that's one of the ways that they can

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.900 
and that's one of the ways that they can
hold<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.290> by<00:00:59.440> sticking<00:00:59.680> something<00:01:00.070> inside<00:01:00.550> so

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
hold it by sticking something inside so

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.580 
hold it by sticking something inside so
that's<00:01:01.690> one<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.020> reason<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.290> don't<00:01:02.380> want

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
that's one of the reason you don't want

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.439 
that's one of the reason you don't want
to<00:01:02.650> do<00:01:02.740> that<00:01:02.890> another<00:01:03.310> piece<00:01:03.579> that<00:01:03.640> we<00:01:04.119> use<00:01:04.269> for

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
to do that another piece that we use for

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.260 
to do that another piece that we use for
a<00:01:04.509> handrail<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.700> is<00:01:06.850> one<00:01:07.000> of<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.150> we

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
a handrail this is one of the we

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.880 
a handrail this is one of the we
normally<00:01:07.630> use<00:01:07.720> this<00:01:08.049> is<00:01:08.229> a<00:01:08.259> piece<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.710> two<00:01:08.860> by

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
normally use this is a piece of two by

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.789 
normally use this is a piece of two by
one<00:01:09.040> channel<00:01:09.670> 1/8<00:01:10.000> thick<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:11.110> works<00:01:11.350> quite

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
one channel 1/8 thick it works quite

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.190 
one channel 1/8 thick it works quite
well<00:01:11.920> because<00:01:12.729> you<00:01:12.939> can<00:01:13.119> roll<00:01:13.329> it<00:01:13.360> there's

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
well because you can roll it there's

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200 
well because you can roll it there's
enough<00:01:14.470> strength<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.579> be<00:01:15.670> able<00:01:15.759> to<00:01:15.880> do<00:01:16.030> that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
enough strength to be able to do that

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.090 
enough strength to be able to do that
and<00:01:16.540> also<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:19.150> will<00:01:19.390> twist<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.140> that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
and also it will twist and that that

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.730 
and also it will twist and that that
helps<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.580> as<00:01:21.760> you<00:01:22.000> put<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:22.780> rehand<00:01:23.320> rail<00:01:23.530> on

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
helps you as you put that rehand rail on

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.320 
helps you as you put that rehand rail on
to<00:01:24.130> your<00:01:24.670> spiral<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:26.110> pickets<00:01:26.530> normally<00:01:27.520> that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
to your spiral the pickets normally that

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.950 
to your spiral the pickets normally that
we<00:01:28.479> have<00:01:28.600> use<00:01:28.900> our<00:01:29.229> 3/4<00:01:29.979> by<00:01:30.610> 3/4<00:01:31.270> square<00:01:31.510> tubing

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
we have use our 3/4 by 3/4 square tubing

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.039 
we have use our 3/4 by 3/4 square tubing
and<00:01:32.500> it's<00:01:32.740> an<00:01:32.890> old<00:01:33.040> six<00:01:33.340> five<00:01:33.580> wall<00:01:34.049> thickness

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
and it's an old six five wall thickness

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.370 
and it's an old six five wall thickness
on<00:01:35.260> it<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.710> works<00:01:35.979> great<00:01:36.430> for<00:01:37.060> pickets<00:01:37.810> and

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
on it it works great for pickets and

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.090 
on it it works great for pickets and
then<00:01:39.130> also<00:01:39.909> our<00:01:40.320> Center<00:01:41.320> pipe<00:01:41.530> doesn't<00:01:41.920> need

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
then also our Center pipe doesn't need

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.920 
then also our Center pipe doesn't need
to<00:01:42.190> be<00:01:42.310> heavy<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.790> would<00:01:43.060> choose<00:01:43.330> to<00:01:43.600> use

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
to be heavy it would choose to use

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.460 
to be heavy it would choose to use
something<00:01:44.170> fairly<00:01:44.619> light<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:47.020> add<00:01:47.229> a<00:01:47.260> lot

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
something fairly light and not add a lot

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.920 
something fairly light and not add a lot
of<00:01:47.500> weight<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.670> but<00:01:49.000> if<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.270> can<00:01:49.360> see<00:01:49.600> this

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
of weight to it but if you can see this

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.289 
of weight to it but if you can see this
is<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.409> 4<00:01:50.740> by<00:01:51.270> 1/8<00:01:52.270> thick<00:01:53.100> tubing<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.310> it's

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
is a 4 by 1/8 thick tubing and it's

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.960 
is a 4 by 1/8 thick tubing and it's
exactly<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:55.990> 4<00:01:56.320> inches<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.650> diameter<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.909> you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
exactly a 4 inches in diameter so you

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.570 
exactly a 4 inches in diameter so you
can<00:01:58.510> find<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:58.900> it's<00:01:59.110> not<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.560> pipe<00:01:59.950> it's<00:02:00.340> a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
can find that it's not a pipe it's a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.490 
can find that it's not a pipe it's a
tubing<00:02:01.299> and<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.810> takes<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:02.080> little<00:02:02.170> bit<00:02:02.409> of

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
tubing and so it takes a little bit of

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.859 
tubing and so it takes a little bit of
looking<00:02:02.619> around<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.130> get<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.490> one<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.119> then

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
looking around to get that one and then

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.009 
looking around to get that one and then
also<00:02:05.530> we<00:02:05.799> use<00:02:05.920> diamond<00:02:06.369> plate<00:02:07.019> 10-gauge

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
also we use diamond plate 10-gauge

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.360
