00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.740
 hello everyone and welcome to couple kits 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.180
 Today we will make a marbling style design 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.820
 to water for nails 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.210
 It seems difficult but it is really super 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.210
 simple 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.340
 so the first thing we will do is paint 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.340
 a base on all nails 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.510
 you do not necessarily have to use a 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.250
 base but it seems to me that it helps 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.980
 colors stand out more 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.320
 I decided to make a retro design with orange 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.020
 and pink so I used orange for the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.480
 base then what we will do is put 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.480
 tape around our nails like this 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.350
 this is so that when we submerge 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.460
 nails in the water do not make us a 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.460
 disaster everywhere 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.300
 The trick for marbling in water is 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.629
 hit the nail polish like this 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.590
 and then we remove it in this way with 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.119
 a tooth stick 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.119
 and this creates the design 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.650
 Take out what's left in the water using a 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.409
 hyssop and you have to be the same for 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.680
 each nail you can do two at a time like 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.680
 you will see 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.600
 and the excess before removing the nails 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.600
 Water 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.010
 Now let it dry and take out the tape 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.390
 and use a cotton swab with acetone to remove 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 any excess of enamel 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.420
 now it's the other hand 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.030
 you can try different types of enamel 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.820
 to see which works best for this 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.729
 technique 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.030
 and remember that the water must be at 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.950
 room temperature and there they have it 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.180
 they are great 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.010
