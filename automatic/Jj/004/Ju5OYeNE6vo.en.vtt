00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hello, good afternoon, I made this mirror 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.849
 with newspaper I hope you like it and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.969
 do and help me share this 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.070
 tutorial is not new but I am 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.680
 editing and the materials that we're going to 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.939
 use are I'm going to use this 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.760
 mirror that I had or that I have and I'm going to 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.769
 to be a wood this too what 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.740
 you can do with cardboard but I sent 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:37.160
 make a wood a centimeter more 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.790
 large than normal and it would be 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.960
 the main thing later we will use a 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:48.020
 little tube or a wooden stick scissors 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.320
 Glue the acrylic paints 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.050
 paintings are going to be similar to the color 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.550
 I'm going to use acrylic green paint 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.400
 and something metallic green ocher color something 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.970
 that everything is in metallic tones the 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.970
 Newspaper 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.040
 our little stick that I already mentioned to you 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.820
 silicone gun 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.300
 the brooch mentioned that he will go back 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.510
 our wood a pencil and I'm going to 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.740
 use this is from a liquor store for 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.900
 I serve as mold and will 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.120
 start 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.170
 we will fold our newspaper in half 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.390
 and we are going to cut it this is small and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.150
 having it cut we're going to start 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.180
 make our newspaper tubes and 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.960
 we are going to occupy the stick of material to 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.220
 final we will apply glue and these 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.110
 let's do many 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.580
 and we are going to join two sticks 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.120
 of newspaper and what we are going to use 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:05.360
 will be our mold I will apply a 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:08.270
 little bit of silicon and we're going to start 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:13.270
 use our mold and let's go 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:16.530
 rounding or accommodating that form 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.600
 I'll apply glue later 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.480
 At the end 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.400
 I will put there you can apply tantito 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.910
 glue so that it does not fall apart like 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.910
 me in the end we will put silicone 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.810
 Y 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 i 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.240
 do not 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.470
 we're just going to try to take off 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:55.690
 the silicon that we paste at the beginning for 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.610
 have our figure finished now 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.070
 let's take our pencil and 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.810
 we will start to make a small circle 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:08.750
 with our newspaper tube 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.750
 and at the end we will stick it with silicone 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.980
 Y 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.819
 we will put this circle or paste it 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.989
 in our previous figure with the 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:34.600
 silicon we accommodate our little circle and 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.590
 let's flatten a bit for what 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.610
 it sticks completely and these will be 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.610
 all our figures 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.520
 we will stick three strips around 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.010
 our wood and this we will do with the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.010
 silicone only 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.200
 i 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.580
 i 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.820
 and well here I already stuck a part of 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.330
 pieces but on the top and of 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.800
 down I need to dry very well 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:55.840
 how it looks so that it covers me the sides 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.840
 and that looks even 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.400
 let's paint with red carmine the 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.560
 three newspaper strips with care 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.360
 so as not to stain the next one because there 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.360
 we will apply the green color 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.440
 since we apply the color red carmine 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:21.090
 you're just going to add copper and also 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.090
 so you are going to paint it 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.690
 then we will start painting the green and 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:32.690
 we are also going to apply either the green 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.410
 metallic alone or the green with the metallic 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:41.120
 to give it another tonality and you have to 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:45.940
 dilute the paint a little 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.940
 that enter the entire bed 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.130
 Y 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:05.160
 before pasting the following figures 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:08.480
 I'm going to paint them with the ocher color and with 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.350
 a similar metal 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:17.330
 and then here I already have almost all my 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:22.630
 painted figures and then we continue 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.630
 applying the other paint that is 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:36.750
 and well I have my well-off figures 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.780
 and only only I'm missing some 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.099
 but I have to check that they are well 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.770
 couple so that our 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:48.470
 mirror with newspaper look cute and 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.449
 Well I hope that my work has 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.940

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.460
