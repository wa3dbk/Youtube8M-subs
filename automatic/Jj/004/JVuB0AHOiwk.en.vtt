00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.610
 So it goes on with the road to one 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:15.839
 100 1000 pharma skills and at 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.430
 Last time I had 99 1529 and that 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.490
 try a little better now 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.220
 because now I'm just playing with 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.430
 drones off hamm and the black bird and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 what else comes to it 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.130
 Maybe some of you have 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.599
 I do not know I want next 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 the follow here more or less 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.420
 internet on but i can 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 imagine that one or the other 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
 wonder why was a negative 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.480
 precision with me with the pharma stands 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.070
 that's just because it's a call 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.870
 of duty back if you have so many 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.000
 has degrees in cod with a water 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.010
 then yes, so to speak, takes the precision 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.829
 an inverse value so easy 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.840
 - 17 percent so here after what 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.670
 one has and then knows each other again 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.469
 tried to approach the old value 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.449
 one then, so to speak, or goes the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.489
 Precision then zero again 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.590
 or direction the old 16 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:19.430
 percent of that is going so slowly now 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.430
 to fight to zero in the bg flag 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.320
 and I'm not really into it yet 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.320
 this game in here 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:55.920
 she should actually have that born 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.920
 they are not coming 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:11.369
 come back from the leyen 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.350
 Now he's up there 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.319
 OK 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.049
 okay there has that 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:55.110
 Only the hit market is still up 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:03:03.900
 once no klemmer has laid age 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:05.790
 what is currently still blatant me that 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.900
 yet prestigious 15 why are they so 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.900
 bad in this game 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.500
 I do not understand something like that 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.099
 Actually, one is this spot 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.099
 invincible 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.640
 we have this over here now 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:59.820
 Middle over something unfavorable that yourself 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.820
 always something up 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.140
 but also wants every time high 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.000
 and he knows again no no no 

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.240
 No 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.290
 after such a bad timing after 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.290
 that already illegal 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:37.320
 you will stay why are you? 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.320
 these opponents are so crass 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.759
 shoot at me counts 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.169
 hey man the game ends up 200 too 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.650
 30 or something that is so embarrassing 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.650
 in this game 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.129
 blinded 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:18.449
 he is also all ghosts 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:32.039
 he also fights with your own flag 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.039
 in the corner of course that 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:52.949
 that is so cheap so accurate 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:15.180
 the spot of the fire ring too gross what the 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:23.730
 door course kills me it was so 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:26.270
 Of course I have to get rid of it, that's it 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.270
 dead again 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.350
 again a flirtatious comes the whole 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.350
 time there 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:01.320
 so come on 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:11.100
 now the stupid is still there 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:14.280
 no no no no no I am still 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:19.350
 a very, really, we have got it 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:22.260
 but not because of my dear team 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:30.530
 made because my dear team meter 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:35.190
 spared because mister opponent team is 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:38.400
 well 43 kills opponents had 29 yards 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:43.370
 puncto that was prestige 15 that is 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.540
 just so sad that is so sad 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:51.810
 how long did the gameplay go seven 

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:54.810
 only minutes so what my god so then 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:57.960
 Let's see how many kills 

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:02.280
 itself now with the fans still need so 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:06.720
 I have it 566 I have 37 

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:09.390
 sometimes I can still calculate 37 ps 

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.100
 i just made it well so i mean 

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.150
 Hope you enjoyed it I say 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.510
 bye until next time 

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.510
