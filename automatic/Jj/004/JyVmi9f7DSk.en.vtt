00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.080
 extras 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.110
 I do not leave here to subscribe to the channel 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.990
 new one not in a link is in the description and 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.720
 After that you'll like it in this video. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 here will not drop the right finger and 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.980
 now 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.500
 After that we'll go to the tutorial 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.620
 of today's total today 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.220
 It is we will make the start of the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.270
 interior that will teach who has a 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.090
 I base a bank up there 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 the exchange these things then this base 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.960
 What you will learn is then wheel clip 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.000
 show 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.120
 now we are going to look and in the chassis of 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.190
 thumbnails that have some higher part 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.070
 than the other when we can 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.009
 gluing the base of hilux chassis has tact 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.679
 Even if you understand, we'll go there. 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.920
 cutting the highest part 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:13.670
 now you take the stylus and cut to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.670
 be happy 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.829
 to make the base we will use layers 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.960
 of notebook 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.890
 now is the part that we will get 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.189
 a ruler and take the measurements there gives 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.490
 miniature chassis for us to power 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.580
 cut the base understood after you 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.689
 took measurements from the chassis of the thumbnail 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:48.710
 Just get a pen and scratch it for 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.130
 the top of the notebook and then made 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.390
 this will only cut clipping where you 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.390
 scratched with the pen 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.760
 now that you've cut out then you 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.799
 put it in the chassis of the mini to see if 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.530
 It's good, you have to make some adjustments. 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:16.530
 still done that we will cover the base and 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.510
 com is to see to file this part and win 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.239
 the floor of the miniature understood 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.930
 Then you 'll use the pen to risk it. 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.870
 around the base and then just cut 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.220
 use the scissors to cut where you 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.459
 the pen was still bea 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.570
 Then after you trimmed it's up to you. 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:43.920
 pick up the base will use super bonder 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.910
 from there you get the super bonder and 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.130
 base 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.330
 Vixi just asked if that's where 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:55.580
 I'm going to the grocery store and it's a joke. 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.580
 done nothing will not stick and 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.350
 now caught is to see there only gets scolding necklace 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.350
 in the bag 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.120
 So now we've finished making the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.390
 little boy base 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.780
 Now, what are we going to do? 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.930
 super bonder pass in hilux chassis 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.060
 there and then base paste on hilux 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.219
 there was already personal filÃ© there then paste 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:04:00.549
 That's it, that's what I ended up doing. 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:04:06.639
 until the next tutorial noise there does not 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:12.540
 off the door is doing 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.540
 mother came back and that was the world and 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:32.710
 makes noise and makes noise when you 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:35.190
 take your hand off the mother noise is not now 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.190
 what is going to start
