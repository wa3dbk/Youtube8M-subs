guys<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.559> mask<00:01:04.799> animation<00:01:05.339> freeze<00:01:05.610> glitch

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
guys is the mask animation freeze glitch

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.880 
guys is the mask animation freeze glitch
basically<00:01:06.780> what<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.080> trick<00:01:07.350> does<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
basically what this trick does is it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.320 
basically what this trick does is it
makes<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.160> so<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.580> actions<00:01:09.030> freeze

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
while you're doing them and it's just

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.020 
while you're doing them and it's just
really<00:01:10.770> funny<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> ride<00:01:11.520> around<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> do

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
really funny when you ride around and do

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
really funny when you ride around and do
different<00:01:12.390> things<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.870> so<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.440> order

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
different things with this so in order

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.750 
different things with this so in order
to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:13.980> you're<00:01:14.160> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> want<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.550> start

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
to do this you're going to want to start

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.580 
to do this you're going to want to start
off<00:01:14.910> by<00:01:14.940> picking<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.480> mask<00:01:15.690> that<00:01:15.960> corresponds

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
off by picking a mask that corresponds

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.060 
goes with the facepalm and the devil
mask<00:01:24.330> goes<00:01:24.600> along<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> DJ<00:01:25.500> animation

now<00:01:26.340> currently<00:01:26.730> these<00:01:26.880> are<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.120> only<00:01:27.240> ones

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
now currently these are the only ones

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.090 
now currently these are the only ones
that<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.720> off<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> top<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.440> head<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.010> if

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that know off the top of my head but if

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.560 
that know off the top of my head but if
I<00:01:29.160> do<00:01:29.220> find<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> list<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.940> which<00:01:30.120> masks

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I do find a list of which masks

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.330 
I do find a list of which masks
correspond<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.260> each<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.100> leave<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
correspond to each one I will leave it

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.830 
correspond to each one I will leave it
in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.550> description<00:01:33.000> below<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:33.690> that
