00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
 the most expected attraction of the day in relation to their residences since 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.420
 has been scaled 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.220
 in the state the fabric is the set of cells and will be different that will 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.349
 work with a common purpose 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.959
 life has been the owner 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.810
 the word of order is recovery 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.400
 it is characterized by that reason of the disease 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.789
 and has the ability to contract 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.789
 and thus allow our people to move 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:28.099
 should in principle be the holder 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.729
 the vascular tissue the cardiac striatum 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.770
 investigated escalettes 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.160
 different issue mainly in the contraction activity of being voluntary 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.069
 or involuntary 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:42.440
 and where they will find themselves allowing movement 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.080
 in the case of muscle 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.750
 it is what is characterized by whether they are given information informed 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.750
 they are conrad created and it makes sense to meet our visits 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.610
 in white there is no voluntary movement are already visible the city 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.540
 account are decisive for the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.600
 a volunteer also characterized by being large 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.869
 an example of contraction that happens in our visits are the movements 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.090
 peristaltic end of morning shift 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.290
 along the digestive tract, we also present their position and 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.400
 is also promoted by the city of flowers 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.980
 another school fabric 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.840
 tissues comarca cardiac striatum 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.650
 he is so called because that was his home and salted they have these standards 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.690
 said he traveled two newspapers today when he spotted a microscope 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.790
 these stories nothing but a lot is an arrangement being with home of 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.420
 the sets of one of the daughters contracts 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.460
 it is clear that it has been the holder even though it has only the opposite 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.580
 sakineh 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.150
 we decided to headline 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.460
 instigated to cardiac cgm the pms 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.530
 these proteins against the organized decision forming this pattern says 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.270
 sad 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.100
 I talked 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.630
 when they see a bottle 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.110
 in the case it is investigated cardiac that is present in the heart 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.990
 the name of giggs né 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.469
 and he will then make an involuntary heart-pounding friends beat 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.610
 now certainly the city contraction of the heart 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.090
 it is here that the Senate differentiated on the night of this Tuesday that went from 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.009
 slower and not necessarily a victim 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:21.770
 are little details that come 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.339
 and remember that these 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:29.259
 the sindipoc is the one to guarantee one hour the decision comes to create the site we warm 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:32.359
 want great resistance 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.880
 we are with several genetic series 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.110
 it also has a striped cardiac slang pattern 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.470
 only those who do not know today hanged action siemsen pattern of 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.889
 ranking 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.749
 and we observe the stars something interesting 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:51.120
 they are mukano created one can be ginóbili one finds pressures in the 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:55.389
 periphery denoting that there is an intense metabolic activity of the cells 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.059
 that composes this type of music 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:01.540
 he has this name because besides the stretch marks he carries from the ranks to the 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:02.130
 wings 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.519
 son of one of the involuntary movements 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.979
 interesting to remember 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.489
 the next 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:15.079
 some voluntary movements can sometimes be conveyed in a way that is not 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.819
 to be analyzed as is the case of breath control then you 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.770
 breathe existed 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.719
 they inspire you have to contract 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:27.179
 but maybe the diaphragm muscle 

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:29.789
 at this point it can be voluntary 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:34.289
 I can choose your development or in some of the times it happens that you 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.960
 does not rationalize stabilization, he commented 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.040
 of the bulb but it turned out he is not like the Communists he is one of three 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.180
 affiliated skeletons now the movements are also are voluntary and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.860
 you have to remind them that we usually have this activity 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.769
 contraction to err 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.650
 I do not know if you ever saw 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.769
 but on June 15 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.880
 we misunderstood my bet of tim brazil 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.260
 about the types of muscle fibers we talk about slow fibers 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.960
 fast prices these fibers are 15 are the muscle cells 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.949
 that make up the federal police 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:17.279
 difficult to have the largest number of slow fibers receives the stuttgart the 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.799
 doctor 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.319
 if you remember if you split 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.999
 I have used for readjustments you have the highest number of fast fibers said 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.850
 to the police that the net 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.060
 I have a musician. 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.150
 the exposure 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.129
 It's worth quenched. 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.960
 We also have another class on June 19th. 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.520
 talking about what mechanisms involved 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.470
 the process of muscle contraction 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.150
 worth to check in 667
