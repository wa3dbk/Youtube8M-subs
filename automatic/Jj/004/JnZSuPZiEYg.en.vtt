okay<00:00:02.689> since<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:04.100> myself<00:00:05.100> didn't<00:00:05.940> find<00:00:06.180> any

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
okay since I myself didn't find any

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.839 
okay since I myself didn't find any
videos<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.049> anyone<00:00:07.589> doing<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.950> bass<00:00:08.189> Paramore

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
videos of anyone doing a bass Paramore

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:18.290 
videos of anyone doing a bass Paramore
and<00:00:09.860> I<00:00:10.860> thought<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.940> make<00:00:12.870> one<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:16.730> yeah<00:00:17.730> let's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and I thought I make one so yeah let's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.960 
and I thought I make one so yeah let's
get<00:00:18.420> started<00:00:20.630> okay<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.100> the<00:00:23.100> materials<00:00:23.699> you'll

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
get started okay so the materials you'll

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.070 
get started okay so the materials you'll
need<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:25.170> real<00:00:25.680> pedal<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.250> course<00:00:27.949> a

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
need is a real pedal of course a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.850 
need is a real pedal of course a
solderer<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.439> optional<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.719> guess<00:00:34.710> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
solderer is optional I think I guess you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.869 
solderer is optional I think I guess you
could<00:00:35.040> use<00:00:35.219> my<00:00:35.460> tape<00:00:35.820> or<00:00:36.149> something<00:00:37.190> but<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
could use my tape or something but I

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.090 
could use my tape or something but I
think<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.420> connection<00:00:39.660> will<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.590> with

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
think the connection will be there with

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.639 
think the connection will be there with
the<00:00:41.190> solder<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:46.879> eighth<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.180> an<00:00:48.300> inch<00:00:48.420> mono<00:00:49.260> plug

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the solder a eighth of an inch mono plug

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.910 
the solder a eighth of an inch mono plug
a<00:00:51.620> magnet

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
a magnet

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360 
a magnet
I<00:00:52.949> took<00:00:53.579> mine<00:00:53.940> from<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.420> stock<00:00:55.350> pillow<00:00:55.680> I'll

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I took mine from the stock pillow I'll

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.670 
I took mine from the stock pillow I'll
show<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.329> later<00:01:00.829> some<00:01:01.829> speaker<00:01:02.370> wire

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
show you that later some speaker wire

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.820 
show you that later some speaker wire
you<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.860> speak<00:01:05.159> over

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.730 

and<00:01:10.010> a<00:01:12.460> relay<00:01:16.120> okay<00:01:17.120> so<00:01:17.180> how<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.780> remove<00:01:18.440> the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
and a relay okay so how to remove the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.310 
and a relay okay so how to remove the
magnet<00:01:19.190> from<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.620> from<00:01:21.620> the<00:01:21.800> stock<00:01:22.070> pebble<00:01:22.520> is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
magnet from the from the stock pebble is

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:50.510 
magnet from the from the stock pebble is
pretty<00:01:24.320> easy

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.100 

so<00:01:51.520> then<00:01:51.850> they<00:01:52.090> smoke<00:01:52.479> in<00:01:52.659> here

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
so then they smoke in here

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.800 
so then they smoke in here
I<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:54.460> if<00:01:54.820> you<00:01:54.970> can<00:01:55.270> see<00:01:55.540> I<00:01:57.780> use<00:01:58.780> a

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
I know if you can see I use a

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:13.949 
I know if you can see I use a
screwdriver<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.740> just<00:01:59.950> press<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:00.490> out<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
screwdriver and just press it out and

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.110 
screwdriver and just press it out and
then<00:02:14.170> you're<00:02:14.290> just<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:18.580> press<00:02:18.849> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
then you're just like you you press the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.330 
then you're just like you you press the
thing<00:02:19.330> down<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.010> don't<00:02:27.190> have

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
thing down like that so you don't have

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.170 
thing down like that so you don't have
to<00:02:27.519> worry<00:02:27.700> about<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.120> big<00:02:28.360> part<00:02:28.630> now<00:02:28.840> or

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
to worry about that big part now or

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.170 
to worry about that big part now or
anytime<00:02:31.860> now<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.370> orange<00:02:33.880> bar

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
anytime now it's just this orange bar

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
anytime now it's just this orange bar
and<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.750> screw<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:36.420> losing<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.510> screws<00:02:37.810> here

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
and you screw you losing the screws here

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.650 
and you screw you losing the screws here
and<00:02:38.640> here<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.670> magnets<00:02:43.090> right<00:02:43.480> here<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
and here and the magnets right here and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.979 
and here and the magnets right here and
it's<00:02:46.660> glued<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.250> small<00:02:48.549> hole<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.690> have

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
it's glued in a small hole so you have

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.610 
it's glued in a small hole so you have
to<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.959> just<00:02:53.080> bent<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.860> edges<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.150> that

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
to I I just bent the edges of that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.250 
to I I just bent the edges of that
circle<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.549> hole<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.269> just<00:02:59.019> spent<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
circle of that hole I just spent the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.960 
circle of that hole I just spent the
edges<00:02:59.650> so<00:02:59.829> I<00:02:59.859> can<00:03:00.130> get<00:03:00.280> them<00:03:00.459> could<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:00.850> get

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
edges so I can get them could we get

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.190 
edges so I can get them could we get
magnet<00:03:01.750> out<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.299> guess<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.019> could<00:03:05.170> just

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
magnet out but I guess you could just

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.670 
magnet out but I guess you could just
use<00:03:06.040> some<00:03:06.250> glue<00:03:07.049> solvent<00:03:08.049> or<00:03:08.260> something<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:11.470> I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
use some glue solvent or something but I

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.930 
use some glue solvent or something but I
mean<00:03:11.950> my<00:03:12.370> method<00:03:12.760> works<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:15.329> okay<00:03:16.329> so<00:03:16.359> now<00:03:16.810> with

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
mean my method works so okay so now with

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.640 
mean my method works so okay so now with
with<00:03:18.940> all<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.269> materials<00:03:19.989> gathered

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.270 

including<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.579> electrical<00:03:25.180> tape

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
including the electrical tape

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.020 
including the electrical tape
I<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.840> now<00:03:29.470> show<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.280> next<00:03:30.550> step<00:03:33.030> which

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
I can now show you the next step which

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.920 
I can now show you the next step which
is<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.570> test<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:36.540> connections<00:03:37.540> and<00:03:37.750> stuff

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
is to test the connections and stuff

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.850 
is to test the connections and stuff
before<00:03:38.170> you<00:03:38.440> solder<00:03:39.600> everything<00:03:43.140> be<00:03:44.140> careful

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
before you solder everything be careful

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.820 
before you solder everything be careful
not<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.040> drop<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.060> relay<00:03:46.690> or<00:03:46.720> stuff<00:03:47.320> because<00:03:47.710> I

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
not to drop the relay or stuff because I

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.500 
not to drop the relay or stuff because I
think<00:03:47.920> it's<00:03:48.280> very<00:03:48.550> fragile<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:50.970> think<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.180> will

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
think it's very fragile I think it will

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.560 
think it's very fragile I think it will
easily<00:03:52.750> break<00:03:54.840> start<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.960> game<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:57.570> just

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
easily break start the game you just

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.190 
easily break start the game you just
start<00:03:58.990> again<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.180> give<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.750> second<00:04:02.670> and

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
start again and give that a second and

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:14.520 
start again and give that a second and
then<00:04:05.200> you<00:04:05.380> go<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.880> practice<00:04:06.880> mode

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.740 

if<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.190> wonder<00:04:15.959> what<00:04:16.959> these<00:04:17.170> socks<00:04:17.650> are<00:04:18.750> you

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
if you wonder what these socks are you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.670 
if you wonder what these socks are you
could<00:04:19.989> just<00:04:20.200> go<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:22.170> you<00:04:23.170> just<00:04:23.530> google<00:04:24.130> and

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
could just go to you just google and

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.700 
could just go to you just google and
Rock<00:04:26.680> Band<00:04:26.710> drum<00:04:27.390> softmod<00:04:29.550> okay<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:31.710> we're

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
Rock Band drum softmod okay so we're

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:41.600 
Rock Band drum softmod okay so we're
gonna<00:04:32.830> go<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.070> practice

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610
