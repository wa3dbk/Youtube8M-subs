00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.030
 what then I that they are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:10.380
 born little stopgaps little 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.269
 he asks then I see you nothing 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 sicily this moment therefore if they are 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.730
 antonio no longer exists and therefore not 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.119
 we know in which then antonio in the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.519
 his legacy gave me the channel then 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.510
 news in which now but certainly a proxy 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.260
 fire someone who left you 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:35.190
 in the sale of licenses he realizes that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.540
 we have but maybe they don't know how it works 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.410
 maybe not everyone knows then about 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 these bumps work like this in here 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.100
 there are toto sheets of folded sheets 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.950
 and then become that of agropoli sheets 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.050
 bent there are rule questions 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.550
 euros he needs and play with 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.140
 we really are very ignorant about 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.300
 these things we will do best 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.739
 of the 3 and we see that it happens or I don't have to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.020
 help we open will pause the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.600
 video yes I should not go in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 comments when the leader thinks about it 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.960
 put the main comment already 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.790
 start writing after the end send it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.450
 when it is looked at apartment building and we see e 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.450
 you can't escape 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.640
 go go if the first one as false because 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.210
 then zelda happened because to us it is 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.310
 happened zelda okay then how do you do a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.860
 call yourself a fan of zelda if you don't know that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.060
 this screenshot comes from this 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.060
 specific title of the saga 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.750
 ocarina of time is the only case it is hot 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.350
 actually i think it's 3d you know this can 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.610
 tell us I don't know if you can pass this 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.780
 law is not that he sees it to the maximum yes 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.790
 but if he would be captain 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.050
 crap all 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.640
 I am ashamed of the obviousness of this 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:02.460
 question but this checks see which one 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:03.590
 then I believe that exile of consort 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.750
 mega drive 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.970
 no our master system guys ok 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.950
 okay i can still recovered it 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.680
 particularly small will now happen to him 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.870
 super mario type this game he has 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.260
 made the videogaming series I only know 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.600
 one thing could be called different 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.970
 knowing you I'm talking about is not 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.850
 for sure you because the different type 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.490
 clearly it is perhaps not a thing 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:38.070
 moment I am trying to arrange the 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.800
 I know for sure I know I know not 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.239
 we know it but it's already seen 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.010
 I don't remember the title but maybe I did 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.510
 already seen these notes the symbolic estimates 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.650
 absolute in the history of revisits 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.650
 politicians of course I'm talking about 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.719
 reefer to live what hour 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.620
 the ballet I don't know the pronunciation is right 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:09.620
 I often do in fantasy Us 1 1 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:13.359
 1 from gamers cm can be defined as such if 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.359
 he does not know that this game is the very famous 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:21.829
 you know or count the captains did 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.579
 law I want a sister is certain that 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.159
 I also knew I knew the question 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.959
 of the protagonists but see is one of the 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.849
 protagonists enter so famous that they are 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.299
 name should come up to in a loud voice 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.519
 solo coach knowledge church i 'm 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.980
 listing the title of this game is 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.659
 the other always what they then have 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.489
 fact is that it is the same different 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:55.909
 the ignorant I don't remember how 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:56.329
 call it has caused problems but it 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.669
 I know 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:02.139
 if you haven't played that touch you don't know 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.139

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.970
 the words father said lanza wanted 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:51.790

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:55.870
