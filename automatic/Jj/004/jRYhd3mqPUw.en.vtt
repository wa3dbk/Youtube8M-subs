00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.969
 invention of the emergence of the Internet genres 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.060
 and my escape was predictable players with 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.580
 of the whole world have gone and will want to play 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 online 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.720
 because before to play with someone 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.170
 had to either call a friend to yourself or 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 go to him yourself and what if you even 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.550
 no friends jpg itself all these problems 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.870
 disappear huge world in which always 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.870
 could find someone 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.250
 meet someone and maybe even 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.710
 perform a couple of tasks to find more allies 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.379
 against with them dungeon found 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.260
 with them community and nikite develop it 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.480
 and become the founder of 1 st buhim 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.899
 feathers obedience thousands of innocents 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 players or all end on stage 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.810
 completing the quest only depends on you 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.460
 the fate of your character because you can 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.450
 don't be afraid to see mine 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 they become in fact it is called 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.850
 play 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.140
 besides the developed pumping system 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.869
 couple characters then the history of the world deep 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.550
 personalization of battles of victory and pradesh 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.550
 and all this in one game 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.420
 so the genre of my package is quite 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.040
 justifies its existence besides 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.040
 a batch of new projects is on its way 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.590
 mrp gus awful what happened to 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.770
 video games yes at first everything is good 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.410
 open world common quests and opportunities 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.890
 you can go where you want but that's all 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.140
 deception 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.210
 wherever you go whatever you do 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.600
 everywhere experience awaits you 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.470
 level 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.500
 and in every dollar pg there is the maximum 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.500
 there is a dead end which if some time 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.280
 you will certainly achieve even create 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.960
 new character 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.230
 then it will only mean that you 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.570
 just deadlocked the same 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.360
 most now that is it like a circular 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.329
 prison which from the center you will 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.470
 walk and rest on a series also a dead end 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:24.300
 or may just wander around 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.800
 and even if you throw this fact out of your head 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.170
 fulfill that this is an online game and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.330
 try to find companions only 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.080
 in one case you can go all 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.770
 way to the end if both of you are hopeless 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.870
 because of the throne 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.760
 synchronize your time to a friend means 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.460
 someone will be 2 before you think that he 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.340
 have not played enough will raise a couple of levels 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.410
 people another location and you will have it 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.330
 catching up it means you need to 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.880
 spend some extra time 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.220
 who would not want to spend 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.220
 only allocate time Gleb 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.410
 time is another major problem if 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.570
 play for a couple of hours a day 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.320
 you wo n't catch priority sooner or later 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.450
 will take over 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.580
 that is, you either completely stop 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.740
 play or give the game all your 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.480
 free time but the game is not for 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.300
 This made to order 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.400
 entertain people they collect all yours 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.680
 free time and turn the game into 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.459
 routine 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:31.230
 so i refuse to accept we 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.230
 my so for game genres myself 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.280
 refused extreme
