community in Hillsborough County.

throughout the FishHawk Ranch community, it

owns the distinction of having the largest
network of paved nature trails for a community

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.110
in the country.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.940
Each of these trails was carefully planned
to minimize the impact to existing plants

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.070
and wildlife.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.810
FishHawk Ranch also designed the community
so there is a park or open space within one-quarter

mile of each home.

open space, FishHawk Ranch is the perfect

picnic.
