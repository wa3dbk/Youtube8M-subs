00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
to crack because because even though

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.410 
to crack because because even though
felt<00:00:08.460> like<00:00:08.580> they<00:00:08.670> were<00:00:08.790> they<00:00:09.059> were<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.240> bit

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
wounded sometimes that's that's the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.539 
wounded sometimes that's that's the
toughest<00:00:12.240> animal<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> overcome<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.460> we

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
toughest animal to overcome and so we

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.099 
toughest animal to overcome and so we
didn't<00:00:14.700> know<00:00:14.790> how<00:00:14.940> they<00:00:14.969> would<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.960> they

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
didn't know how they would how they

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.300 
didn't know how they would how they
would<00:00:16.199> approach<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> game<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.010> knew<00:00:17.130> they

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
would approach the game but we knew they

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.250 
would approach the game but we knew they
were<00:00:17.369> with<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> change<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.930> manager

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
were with it with a change of manager

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.920 
were with it with a change of manager
it's<00:00:19.470> usually<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> positive<00:00:20.189> response<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:21.779> I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it's usually a positive response and I

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.720 
it's usually a positive response and I
think<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.289> best<00:00:22.470> part<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.490> first

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
think the best part about that first

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.250 
think the best part about that first
half<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.119> getting<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.449> there<00:00:24.570> 00<00:00:25.019> because

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
half was getting out of there 00 because

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.380 
half was getting out of there 00 because
once<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.470> came<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.859> at<00:00:26.699> halftime<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.210> knew<00:00:27.300> we

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
once we came in at halftime we knew we

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.970 
once we came in at halftime we knew we
didn't<00:00:27.570> play<00:00:27.660> brilliantly<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.830> also

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
didn't play brilliantly but we also

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.500 
didn't play brilliantly but we also
realized<00:00:29.429> we<00:00:29.550> made<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> few<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.240> make<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> few

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
realized we made a few we can make a few

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.260 
realized we made a few we can make a few
adjustments<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.140> he'll<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.529> hit<00:00:31.710> him<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
adjustments and he'll really hit him and

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
adjustments and he'll really hit him and
second<00:00:33.270> half<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.540> were<00:00:33.570> fantastic<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.380> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
second half we were fantastic and I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.060 
second half we were fantastic and I
think<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.960> Eddie's<00:00:37.649> goal<00:00:37.829> going

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
think with with that Eddie's goal going

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.830 
think with with that Eddie's goal going
in<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.460> broke<00:00:38.640> broke<00:00:39.149> their<00:00:39.300> will<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> think<00:00:39.719> we

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
in we broke broke their will I think we

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
in we broke broke their will I think we
broke<00:00:39.930> their<00:00:40.170> spirit<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.399> kept

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
broke their spirit and then we just kept

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.639 
broke their spirit and then we just kept
pressing<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> cup<00:00:42.930> game<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.530> know

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
pressing it's like a cup game you know

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
pressing it's like a cup game you know
whenever<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.070> play<00:00:44.190> those<00:00:44.460> those<00:00:44.850> uh<00:00:44.879> those

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
whenever we play those those uh those

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080 
whenever we play those those uh those
guys<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.760> bragging<00:00:48.030> rights
