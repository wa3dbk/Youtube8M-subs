00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.740 

let's<00:00:02.919> take<00:00:03.160> a<00:00:03.190> closer<00:00:03.700> look<00:00:03.850> at<00:00:04.210> different

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:04.750 
let's take a closer look at different

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.710 
let's take a closer look at different
ways<00:00:04.990> in<00:00:05.319> which<00:00:06.039> crossing<00:00:06.609> over<00:00:06.789> or<00:00:07.149> genetic

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
ways in which crossing over or genetic

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.950 
ways in which crossing over or genetic
recombination<00:00:08.050> can<00:00:08.830> happen<00:00:09.340> so<00:00:10.150> here<00:00:10.600> we<00:00:10.720> have

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
recombination can happen so here we have

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.260 
recombination can happen so here we have
our<00:00:11.200> homologous<00:00:11.740> pair<00:00:12.130> of<00:00:12.220> chromosomes<00:00:13.030> again

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
our homologous pair of chromosomes again

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.080 
our homologous pair of chromosomes again
that<00:00:13.570> are<00:00:13.810> crossing<00:00:14.769> over<00:00:14.920> and<00:00:15.519> we<00:00:15.940> get

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
that are crossing over and we get

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.319 
that are crossing over and we get
something<00:00:16.330> that<00:00:16.449> looks<00:00:16.570> like<00:00:16.869> that<00:00:17.380> and<00:00:18.329> this

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:19.329 
something that looks like that and this

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:26.279 
something that looks like that and this
is<00:00:19.480> called<00:00:19.749> a<00:00:20.130> single<00:00:21.130> cross<00:00:21.429> over<00:00:25.079> for<00:00:26.079> the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
is called a single cross over for the

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.929 
is called a single cross over for the
simple<00:00:26.560> reason<00:00:26.619> that<00:00:27.039> they're<00:00:27.310> crossing<00:00:27.759> over

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
simple reason that they're crossing over

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.190 
simple reason that they're crossing over
once<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.560> sometimes<00:00:30.460> these<00:00:31.419> chromosomes<00:00:31.839> can

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
once but sometimes these chromosomes can

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.560 
once but sometimes these chromosomes can
get<00:00:32.470> again<00:00:33.250> close<00:00:33.580> kind<00:00:34.090> of<00:00:34.180> close<00:00:34.360> together

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
get again close kind of close together

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.590 
get again close kind of close together
and<00:00:35.020> they<00:00:35.440> might<00:00:35.770> cross<00:00:36.250> over<00:00:36.760> in<00:00:36.970> that<00:00:37.180> same

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
and they might cross over in that same

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.280 
and they might cross over in that same
exact<00:00:38.080> spot<00:00:38.560> a<00:00:38.860> second<00:00:39.580> time<00:00:39.790> and<00:00:40.140> then<00:00:41.140> we're

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
exact spot a second time and then we're

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.440 
exact spot a second time and then we're
actually<00:00:41.350> back<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.890> square<00:00:42.280> one<00:00:42.490> because<00:00:43.090> now

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
actually back to square one because now

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.630 
actually back to square one because now
the<00:00:43.510> chromosomes<00:00:44.110> revert<00:00:45.040> to<00:00:45.310> what<00:00:45.340> they

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
the chromosomes revert to what they

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.430 
the chromosomes revert to what they
originally<00:00:46.210> were<00:00:46.390> so<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:46.840> might<00:00:46.960> not<00:00:47.020> look

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
originally were so it might not look

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.200 
originally were so it might not look
like<00:00:47.500> crossing<00:00:48.100> over<00:00:48.190> ever<00:00:48.460> happened<00:00:48.940> but<00:00:49.090> it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
like crossing over ever happened but it

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.590 
like crossing over ever happened but it
actually<00:00:49.660> happened<00:00:50.170> twice<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.940> this<00:00:52.420> is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
actually happened twice so this is

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:03.380 
actually happened twice so this is
called<00:00:52.930> a<00:00:53.370> two<00:00:54.370> strand<00:00:56.190> double<00:00:57.190> cross<00:00:57.490> over

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690 

and<00:01:03.810> it's<00:01:04.620> called<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:04.920> two<00:01:05.070> strand<00:01:05.340> double

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and it's called a two strand double

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.120 
and it's called a two strand double
crossover<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.540> well<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.020> involves<00:01:07.530> two

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
crossover because well it involves two

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
crossover because well it involves two
strands<00:01:08.790> let's<00:01:09.240> actually<00:01:09.420> highlight<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.170> two

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
strands let's actually highlight the two

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.990 
strands let's actually highlight the two
strands<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> were<00:01:11.100> involved<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.880> was

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
strands that were involved so it was

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.600 
strands that were involved so it was
this<00:01:12.240> strand<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.260> strand<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.890> it's

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
this strand and that strand and it's

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
this strand and that strand and it's
called<00:01:14.820> double<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.240> crossing<00:01:15.960> over

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
called double because crossing over

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.610 
called double because crossing over
happened<00:01:16.890> twice<00:01:17.990> let's<00:01:18.990> look<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.320> another

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
happened twice let's look at another

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.670 
happened twice let's look at another
scenario<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> again<00:01:21.720> we're<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> cross

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
scenario so again we're going to cross

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.280 
scenario so again we're going to cross
over<00:01:22.830> our<00:01:23.070> chromosomes<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.660> we're<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.229> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
over our chromosomes so we're going to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.410 
over our chromosomes so we're going to
see<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.190> first<00:01:26.670> incident<00:01:27.330> of

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
see that that's the first incident of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
see that that's the first incident of
crossing<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:28.580> actually<00:01:29.580> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.760> label<00:01:30.030> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
crossing over actually going to label it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.430 
crossing over actually going to label it
one<00:01:30.330> I'll<00:01:30.510> actually<00:01:30.660> I'll<00:01:30.930> label<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.260> first

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
one I'll actually I'll label the first

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.840 
one I'll actually I'll label the first
tunnel<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.890> was<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> first<00:01:32.370> incident<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
tunnel so that was the first incident of

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.840 
tunnel so that was the first incident of
crossing<00:01:33.210> over<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.979> had<00:01:35.190> a<00:01:35.220> second

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
crossing over and then we had a second

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.510 
crossing over and then we had a second
incident<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.330> crossing<00:01:36.720> over<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.560> anyway<00:01:37.890> back

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
incident of crossing over so anyway back

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.140 
incident of crossing over so anyway back
to<00:01:38.580> our<00:01:38.910> second<00:01:39.420> scenario<00:01:40.100> let's<00:01:41.100> say<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
to our second scenario let's say that

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.780 
to our second scenario let's say that
these<00:01:43.080> two<00:01:43.650> chromatids<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.550> cross<00:01:45.000> over<00:01:45.560> so

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
these two chromatids now cross over so

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.040 
these two chromatids now cross over so
that<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.970> happen<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> few<00:01:48.660> different<00:01:48.930> ways

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
that can happen in a few different ways

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.570 
that can happen in a few different ways
let's<00:01:49.350> go<00:01:49.470> through<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:49.920> ways<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.310> which<00:01:50.369> that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
let's go through two ways in which that

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.080 
let's go through two ways in which that
can<00:01:50.640> happen

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
can happen

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.990 
can happen
maybe<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:52.080> cross<00:01:52.440> over<00:01:52.710> exactly<00:01:53.550> at<00:01:53.700> this

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
maybe they cross over exactly at this

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600 
maybe they cross over exactly at this
spot<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:54.720> here<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.160> case<00:01:56.369> we're

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
spot over here and in that case we're

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.100 
spot over here and in that case we're
going<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> get<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.940> set<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.509> chromosomes<00:01:57.840> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
going to get a set of chromosomes that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.580 
going to get a set of chromosomes that
looks<00:01:58.470> like<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:59.009> or<00:01:59.720> maybe<00:02:00.720> not<00:02:01.050> maybe

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
looks like that or maybe not maybe

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.700 
looks like that or maybe not maybe
they're<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> cross<00:02:02.970> over<00:02:03.509> at<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.110> spot

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
they're going to cross over at a spot

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.340 
they're going to cross over at a spot
like<00:02:04.979> somewhere<00:02:05.460> over<00:02:05.820> there<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
like somewhere over there and in that

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.710 
like somewhere over there and in that
case<00:02:07.650> we're<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:09.179> set<00:02:09.630> of

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
case we're going to get a set of

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960 
case we're going to get a set of
chromosomes<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.380> looks<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
chromosomes that looks like that and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.850 
chromosomes that looks like that and
again<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.360> was<00:02:12.450> our<00:02:12.630> second<00:02:13.290> crossing<00:02:13.530> over

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
again that was our second crossing over

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.150 
again that was our second crossing over
so<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:15.299> just<00:02:15.540> described<00:02:16.019> something<00:02:16.350> called<00:02:16.860> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
so we just described something called a

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.940 
so we just described something called a
three<00:02:17.850> strand<00:02:19.370> double<00:02:20.370> cross<00:02:20.670> over

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.610 

and<00:02:25.480> it's<00:02:26.480> cool<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.660> three-strand<00:02:27.349> double

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and it's cool to three-strand double

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.979 
and it's cool to three-strand double
crossover<00:02:28.130> because<00:02:28.250> while<00:02:28.640> in<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:28.849> case

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
crossover because while in this case

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.720 
crossover because while in this case
three<00:02:29.989> chromatids<00:02:30.739> were<00:02:30.890> involved<00:02:31.430> three

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
three chromatids were involved three

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.309 
three chromatids were involved three
strands<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.270> let's<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.690> highlight<00:02:32.959> them<00:02:33.260> I'm

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
strands so let's just highlight them I'm

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.510 
strands so let's just highlight them I'm
going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.530> highlight<00:02:33.709> them<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.130> beginning

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
going to highlight them in the beginning

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.970 
going to highlight them in the beginning
pair<00:02:35.000> just<00:02:35.270> because<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:35.599> easier<00:02:35.900> easier<00:02:36.290> so

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
pair just because it's easier easier so

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.110 
pair just because it's easier easier so
it<00:02:37.160> involved<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:38.890> strand<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.280> that<00:02:40.580> strand

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
it involved this strand and that strand

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.180 
it involved this strand and that strand
and<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.630> strand<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.319> again<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> double

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
and that strand and again a double

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.100 
and that strand and again a double
crossover<00:02:43.700> because<00:02:43.880> crossing<00:02:44.450> over<00:02:44.630> happened

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
crossover because crossing over happened

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.559 
crossover because crossing over happened
twice<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.130> hopefully<00:02:46.430> starting<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.060> get<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
twice so hopefully starting to get the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.840 
twice so hopefully starting to get the
idea<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:48.160> crossing<00:02:49.160> lower<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.489> happen<00:02:49.760> in

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
idea that crossing lower can happen in

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.960 
idea that crossing lower can happen in
many<00:02:50.060> different<00:02:50.450> ways<00:02:50.630> in<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.080> number<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.500> times

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
many different ways in a number of times

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.800 
many different ways in a number of times
let's<00:02:52.970> look<00:02:53.239> at<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.510> third<00:02:54.200> scenario<00:02:55.569> so<00:02:56.569> again

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
let's look at a third scenario so again

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
let's look at a third scenario so again
we're<00:02:56.930> going<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.080> have<00:02:57.230> crossing<00:02:57.680> over

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
we're going to have crossing over

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.610 
we're going to have crossing over
happening<00:02:58.430> one<00:02:58.670> time<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.330> then<00:03:00.260> we're<00:03:00.500> going

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
happening one time and then we're going

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.160 
happening one time and then we're going
to<00:03:00.680> have<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.220> happening<00:03:01.819> again<00:03:01.970> but<00:03:02.600> we're

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
to have it happening again but we're

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.410 
to have it happening again but we're
going<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.350> say<00:03:03.590> well<00:03:03.980> maybe<00:03:04.299> crossing<00:03:05.299> over

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
going to say well maybe crossing over

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.509 
going to say well maybe crossing over
now<00:03:05.660> happens<00:03:06.049> between<00:03:06.200> these<00:03:06.709> two<00:03:07.040> chromatids

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
now happens between these two chromatids

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.449 
now happens between these two chromatids
and<00:03:08.140> also<00:03:09.140> happens<00:03:09.410> between<00:03:09.769> these<00:03:10.160> two

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
and also happens between these two

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.059 
and also happens between these two
chromatids<00:03:11.500> you're<00:03:12.500> going<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.680> see<00:03:12.830> we're

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
chromatids you're going to see we're

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.949 
chromatids you're going to see we're
going<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.250> involve<00:03:13.430> all<00:03:13.700> four<00:03:14.150> strands<00:03:14.630> this

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
going to involve all four strands this

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.500 
going to involve all four strands this
time<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:16.160> first<00:03:16.310> now<00:03:16.580> our<00:03:16.700> scenario<00:03:17.299> we'll

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
time the first now our scenario we'll

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.390 
time the first now our scenario we'll
look<00:03:17.690> at<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:18.080> well<00:03:18.380> maybe<00:03:18.590> crossing<00:03:19.010> over<00:03:19.160> and

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
look at is well maybe crossing over and

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.000 
look at is well maybe crossing over and
both<00:03:19.610> of<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:19.819> happens<00:03:20.299> right<00:03:21.140> at<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.650> spot

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
both of that happens right at that spot

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.140 
both of that happens right at that spot
so<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.590> case<00:03:24.830> we're<00:03:25.040> going<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.280> get<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.640> set

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
so in that case we're going to get a set

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.500 
so in that case we're going to get a set
of<00:03:26.239> chromosomes<00:03:26.720> that<00:03:26.810> looks<00:03:27.140> like<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:28.510> but

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
of chromosomes that looks like that but

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.470 
of chromosomes that looks like that but
maybe<00:03:29.750> not<00:03:30.109> maybe<00:03:30.980> crossing<00:03:31.760> over<00:03:32.030> let's<00:03:32.329> say

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
maybe not maybe crossing over let's say

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.199 
maybe not maybe crossing over let's say
in<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.660> purple<00:03:33.079> chromosome<00:03:33.820> happen<00:03:34.820> over

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
in the purple chromosome happen over

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.860 
in the purple chromosome happen over
there<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.430> we<00:03:38.000> got<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.180> chromosome<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.660> look

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
there and we got a chromosome that look

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.319 
there and we got a chromosome that look
like<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:40.760> maybe<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.180> blue

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
like that and then maybe the blue

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.060 
like that and then maybe the blue
chromosome<00:03:41.870> also<00:03:42.320> may<00:03:42.440> be<00:03:42.470> crossing<00:03:42.950> over

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
chromosome also may be crossing over

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.660 
chromosome also may be crossing over
happened<00:03:43.700> over<00:03:44.090> there<00:03:44.769> then<00:03:45.769> we'd<00:03:46.010> get<00:03:46.220> a<00:03:46.280> set

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
happened over there then we'd get a set

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.490 
happened over there then we'd get a set
of<00:03:46.760> chromosomes<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.540> looks<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:49.070> and

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
of chromosomes that looks like that and

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.990 
of chromosomes that looks like that and
what<00:03:51.500> we<00:03:51.620> just<00:03:51.799> described<00:03:52.370> well<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:52.850> is

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
what we just described well this is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.490 
what we just described well this is
called<00:03:53.299> a<00:03:53.510> four<00:03:54.170> strand<00:03:56.140> double<00:03:57.140> crossover<00:03:59.500> so

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
called a four strand double crossover so

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.170 
called a four strand double crossover so
in<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:00.799> case<00:04:01.040> we<00:04:01.220> involved<00:04:01.489> all<00:04:01.850> four

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
in this case we involved all four

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.390 
in this case we involved all four
strands<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.950> strand<00:04:05.200> sorry<00:04:06.200> about<00:04:06.350> that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
strands this strand sorry about that

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.050 
strands this strand sorry about that
this<00:04:07.400> strand<00:04:07.910> and<00:04:08.269> this<00:04:08.959> strand<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.739> this<00:04:10.730> one

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
this strand and this strand and this one

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.809 
this strand and this strand and this one
and<00:04:11.359> this<00:04:12.230> one<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.739> again<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.400> was<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.519> double

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
and this one and again it was a double

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.550 
and this one and again it was a double
crossover<00:04:14.180> because<00:04:14.329> crossed<00:04:14.840> crossing<00:04:15.440> over

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
crossover because crossed crossing over

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.279 
crossover because crossed crossing over
happened<00:04:16.250> twice<00:04:16.760> so<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.690> point<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.049> showing

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
happened twice so the point of showing

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.560 
happened twice so the point of showing
you<00:04:18.500> all<00:04:18.650> this<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.579> help<00:04:19.820> us<00:04:19.940> understand

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
you all this is to help us understand

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.500 
you all this is to help us understand
that<00:04:21.400> crossing<00:04:22.400> over<00:04:22.520> can<00:04:22.700> happen<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.240> many

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
that crossing over can happen in many

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.850 
that crossing over can happen in many
many<00:04:23.720> different<00:04:23.810> ways<00:04:24.139> in<00:04:24.560> many<00:04:24.650> different

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
many different ways in many different

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.010 
many different ways in many different
places<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.880> number<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.300> times<00:04:26.660> and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
places and a number of times and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.469 
places and a number of times and
remember<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:28.070> not<00:04:28.220> just<00:04:28.280> happening<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.150> one

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
remember it's not just happening to one

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.940 
remember it's not just happening to one
pair<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.870> homologous<00:04:29.960> chromosomes<00:04:30.800> it's

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
pair of homologous chromosomes it's

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.490 
pair of homologous chromosomes it's
happening<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.580> all<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.210> peers<00:04:32.990> of<00:04:33.169> magas

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
happening to all the peers of magas

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.370 
happening to all the peers of magas
chromosomes<00:04:34.099> so<00:04:34.700> crossing<00:04:35.570> over<00:04:35.690> is<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.930> great

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
chromosomes so crossing over is a great

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.060 
chromosomes so crossing over is a great
way<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.650> shuffle<00:04:37.070> around<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.669> wheel

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
way to shuffle around the wheel

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.790 
way to shuffle around the wheel
and<00:04:38.220> come<00:04:39.000> up<00:04:39.060> with<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.240> whole<00:04:39.540> new<00:04:40.110> combination

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
and come up with a whole new combination

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.010 
and come up with a whole new combination
that<00:04:41.550> didn't<00:04:41.850> actually<00:04:41.970> exist<00:04:42.210> before<00:04:42.630> so

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
that didn't actually exist before so

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.300 
that didn't actually exist before so
it's<00:04:43.170> a<00:04:43.200> great<00:04:43.410> way<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.620> increase<00:04:43.980> genetic

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
it's a great way to increase genetic

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.770 
it's a great way to increase genetic
variability<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:47.270> question<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.420> may<00:04:48.540> have<00:04:48.660> been

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
variability a question you may have been

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.480 
variability a question you may have been
thinking<00:04:49.200> about<00:04:49.320> in<00:04:49.710> our<00:04:49.800> discussion<00:04:49.860> of

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
thinking about in our discussion of

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.930 
thinking about in our discussion of
recombination<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:52.040> does<00:04:53.040> recombination

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
recombination is does recombination

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.170 
recombination is does recombination
happen<00:04:54.360> between<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.810> sex<00:04:55.080> chromosomes<00:04:55.650> and

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
happen between the sex chromosomes and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.060 
happen between the sex chromosomes and
your<00:04:57.180> intuition<00:04:57.480> might<00:04:57.870> tell<00:04:58.140> you<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.320> that

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
your intuition might tell you that that

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.620 
your intuition might tell you that that
might<00:04:59.400> not<00:04:59.580> be<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.850> greatest<00:05:00.030> thing<00:05:00.330> let's

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
might not be the greatest thing let's

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.560 
might not be the greatest thing let's
see<00:05:00.840> why<00:05:01.100> so<00:05:02.100> here<00:05:02.340> we<00:05:02.490> have<00:05:02.640> our<00:05:02.790> X<00:05:03.000> chromosome

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
see why so here we have our X chromosome

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.990 
see why so here we have our X chromosome
and<00:05:03.780> our<00:05:03.900> smaller<00:05:04.350> Y<00:05:04.590> chromosome<00:05:05.190> in<00:05:05.430> blue<00:05:05.730> and

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
and our smaller Y chromosome in blue and

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.170 
and our smaller Y chromosome in blue and
I'm<00:05:06.870> just<00:05:07.200> going<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.500> stick<00:05:08.010> on<00:05:08.220> a<00:05:08.460> gene<00:05:08.730> onto

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
I'm just going to stick on a gene onto

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.600 
I'm just going to stick on a gene onto
the<00:05:09.270> Y<00:05:09.360> chromosome<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.250> remember<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.400> is<00:05:11.580> a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
the Y chromosome and remember this is a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.940 
the Y chromosome and remember this is a
Y<00:05:11.790> chromosome<00:05:12.180> that's<00:05:12.510> duplicated<00:05:12.950> because

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
Y chromosome that's duplicated because

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.800 
Y chromosome that's duplicated because
we're<00:05:14.370> looking<00:05:14.610> at<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.820> chromosomes<00:05:15.300> as<00:05:15.570> they

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
we're looking at the chromosomes as they

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.440 
we're looking at the chromosomes as they
appear<00:05:16.080> in<00:05:16.110> the<00:05:16.200> beginning<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.650> meiosis

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
appear in the beginning of meiosis

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:24.200 
appear in the beginning of meiosis
anyway<00:05:18.450> this<00:05:18.870> is<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.130> sry<00:05:20.130> gene<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:23.850> sry

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
anyway this is the sry gene and the sry

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.360 
anyway this is the sry gene and the sry
gene<00:05:24.360> is<00:05:24.660> basically<00:05:25.020> responsible<00:05:25.650> for<00:05:26.250> the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
gene is basically responsible for the

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.210 
gene is basically responsible for the
initiation<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.390> male<00:05:28.020> sex<00:05:28.380> determination<00:05:28.890> in

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
initiation of male sex determination in

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.750 
initiation of male sex determination in
humans<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.320> let's<00:05:31.320> say<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:34.460> above<00:05:35.460> this

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
humans and let's say that above this

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.130 
humans and let's say that above this
point<00:05:36.240> these<00:05:37.110> two<00:05:37.530> chromatids

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
point these two chromatids

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.950 
point these two chromatids
swap<00:05:40.140> material<00:05:40.740> and<00:05:41.010> recombine<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:42.450> that

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
swap material and recombine so that

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.000 
swap material and recombine so that
would<00:05:43.110> mean<00:05:43.320> that<00:05:43.350> we<00:05:44.120> suddenly<00:05:45.120> have<00:05:45.660> on<00:05:46.530> the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
would mean that we suddenly have on the

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.000 
would mean that we suddenly have on the
X<00:05:47.160> chromosome<00:05:47.550> some<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.090> the<00:05:48.150> Y<00:05:48.300> chromosome

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
X chromosome some of the Y chromosome

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.930 
X chromosome some of the Y chromosome
including<00:05:50.010> that<00:05:50.340> sry<00:05:50.880> gene<00:05:51.090> and<00:05:52.730> then<00:05:53.730> we're

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
including that sry gene and then we're

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.790 
including that sry gene and then we're
going<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.480> have<00:05:54.690> some<00:05:55.020> of<00:05:55.080> the<00:05:55.140> X<00:05:55.260> chromosome

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
going to have some of the X chromosome

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.240 
going to have some of the X chromosome
over<00:05:56.310> here<00:05:56.610> let's<00:05:56.820> say<00:05:56.940> this<00:05:57.270> happens<00:05:57.860> so<00:05:58.860> this

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
over here let's say this happens so this

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.010 
over here let's say this happens so this
is<00:05:59.430> going<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.640> be<00:05:59.760> pretty<00:06:00.060> problematic

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
is going to be pretty problematic

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.000 
is going to be pretty problematic
because<00:06:01.560> the<00:06:02.960> gamete<00:06:03.960> that<00:06:04.140> gets<00:06:04.560> this<00:06:04.740> Y

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
because the gamete that gets this Y

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.410 
because the gamete that gets this Y
chromosome<00:06:05.550> is<00:06:05.670> going<00:06:05.850> to<00:06:05.910> be<00:06:06.030> in<00:06:06.120> trouble

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
chromosome is going to be in trouble

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.920 
chromosome is going to be in trouble
because<00:06:07.200> when<00:06:07.560> that's<00:06:07.740> fertilized<00:06:08.450> its<00:06:09.450> well

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
because when that's fertilized its well

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.480 
because when that's fertilized its well
supposed<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.470> become<00:06:10.770> a<00:06:10.800> male<00:06:11.040> because<00:06:11.220> it<00:06:11.400> has

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
supposed to become a male because it has

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.160 
supposed to become a male because it has
a<00:06:11.520> Y<00:06:11.760> chromosome<00:06:12.120> but<00:06:12.420> it's<00:06:12.570> actually<00:06:12.960> missing

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
a Y chromosome but it's actually missing

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.650 
a Y chromosome but it's actually missing
a<00:06:13.590> very<00:06:14.220> important<00:06:14.640> gene<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.150> sry<00:06:15.510> gene

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
a very important gene the sry gene

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.960 
a very important gene the sry gene
that's<00:06:16.140> going<00:06:16.560> to<00:06:16.620> turn<00:06:16.770> it<00:06:16.920> into<00:06:17.040> a<00:06:17.160> male<00:06:17.400> so

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
that's going to turn it into a male so

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.100 
that's going to turn it into a male so
you<00:06:18.060> can<00:06:18.210> see<00:06:18.330> that<00:06:18.450> this<00:06:18.540> can<00:06:18.750> lead<00:06:18.960> to<00:06:18.990> a

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
you can see that this can lead to a

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.310 
you can see that this can lead to a
whole<00:06:19.410> host<00:06:19.710> of<00:06:19.920> problems<00:06:20.780> so<00:06:21.780> let's<00:06:22.080> see<00:06:22.170> what

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
whole host of problems so let's see what

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.500 
whole host of problems so let's see what
actually<00:06:22.530> happens<00:06:23.250> between<00:06:23.760> the<00:06:24.000> X<00:06:24.180> and<00:06:24.330> Y

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
actually happens between the X and Y

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.820 
actually happens between the X and Y
chromosome<00:06:26.240> we<00:06:27.240> have<00:06:27.480> at<00:06:27.720> the<00:06:27.870> tips<00:06:28.200> of<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.680> X

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
chromosome we have at the tips of the X

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.200 
chromosome we have at the tips of the X
and<00:06:28.980> Y<00:06:29.040> chromosome<00:06:29.400> I'm<00:06:29.580> going<00:06:29.730> to<00:06:29.790> shade<00:06:30.060> it

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
and Y chromosome I'm going to shade it

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:37.420 
and Y chromosome I'm going to shade it
in<00:06:30.360> this<00:06:31.070> magenta<00:06:33.350> we<00:06:34.350> have<00:06:34.650> these<00:06:34.950> regions

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
in this magenta we have these regions

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:44.109 
in this magenta we have these regions
called<00:06:38.430> the<00:06:38.880> pseudo<00:06:39.830> autosomal<00:06:40.830> regions

00:06:44.109 --> 00:06:44.119 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:49.189 

and<00:06:46.489> crossing<00:06:47.489> over<00:06:47.819> does<00:06:48.330> happen<00:06:48.959> between

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
and crossing over does happen between

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.439 
and crossing over does happen between
the<00:06:49.589> pseudo-code<00:06:49.979> Isola<00:06:50.489> region<00:06:50.879> so<00:06:51.119> it<00:06:51.239> could

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
the pseudo-code Isola region so it could

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.229 
the pseudo-code Isola region so it could
happen<00:06:51.629> between<00:06:51.929> these<00:06:52.199> spots<00:06:52.969> provided<00:06:53.969> that

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:54.239 
happen between these spots provided that

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:56.959 
happen between these spots provided that
is<00:06:54.449> within<00:06:54.689> the<00:06:55.219> magenta<00:06:56.219> shaded<00:06:56.580> area

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:56.969 
is within the magenta shaded area

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.839 
is within the magenta shaded area
however<00:06:57.649> crossing<00:06:58.649> over<00:06:58.769> generally<00:06:59.399> does<00:06:59.639> not

00:06:59.839 --> 00:06:59.849 
however crossing over generally does not

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.820 
however crossing over generally does not
happen<00:07:00.269> between<00:07:00.389> the<00:07:00.689> rest<00:07:00.929> of<00:07:01.110> the<00:07:01.199> X<00:07:01.409> and<00:07:01.679> Y

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
happen between the rest of the X and Y

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.329 
happen between the rest of the X and Y
chromosome<00:07:02.309> so<00:07:03.179> this<00:07:03.629> part<00:07:04.050> of<00:07:04.259> the<00:07:04.349> Y

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:05.339 
chromosome so this part of the Y

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:11.269 
chromosome so this part of the Y
chromosome<00:07:05.789> that<00:07:07.009> is<00:07:08.009> the<00:07:09.619> male<00:07:10.619> specific

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:11.279 
chromosome that is the male specific

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:18.619 
chromosome that is the male specific
region<00:07:16.249> so<00:07:17.249> crossing<00:07:17.789> over<00:07:17.909> generally<00:07:18.419> does

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:18.629 
region so crossing over generally does

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:20.479 
region so crossing over generally does
not<00:07:18.659> happen<00:07:19.199> between<00:07:19.589> the<00:07:19.739> male<00:07:19.919> specific

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:20.489 
not happen between the male specific

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:22.279 
not happen between the male specific
region<00:07:20.759> and<00:07:20.909> the<00:07:20.999> rest<00:07:21.300> of<00:07:21.479> the<00:07:21.599> X<00:07:21.779> chromosome

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:22.289 
region and the rest of the X chromosome

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.759 
region and the rest of the X chromosome
it<00:07:22.679> usually<00:07:23.429> only<00:07:23.699> happens<00:07:24.209> in<00:07:24.689> the<00:07:25.289> pseudo

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:25.769 
it usually only happens in the pseudo

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:28.939 
it usually only happens in the pseudo
autosomal<00:07:26.519> regions
