that did add some more languages to Siri

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.720 
that did add some more languages to Siri
and<00:03:03.550> also<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.360> now<00:03:04.720> are<00:03:04.960> able<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.470> simply<00:03:06.370> call

and also you now are able to simply call
a<00:03:06.760> person<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.570> speakerphone<00:03:08.020> by<00:03:08.920> simply

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
a person on speakerphone by simply

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.360 
a person on speakerphone by simply
saying<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.670> command<00:03:10.030> call<00:03:10.720> whoever<00:03:11.590> on

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
saying the command call whoever on

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.520 
saying the command call whoever on
speakerphone<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.360> then<00:03:13.780> Siri<00:03:14.050> will<00:03:14.290> dial

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
speakerphone and then Siri will dial

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.440 
speakerphone and then Siri will dial
that<00:03:14.740> number<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.310> then<00:03:15.580> automatically<00:03:16.240> put

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
that number and then automatically put

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.420 
that number and then automatically put
on<00:03:16.570> speakerphone<00:03:17.260> now<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.920> think<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.280> will<00:03:18.400> be

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
on speakerphone now I think that will be

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.949 
on speakerphone now I think that will be
a<00:03:18.520> useful<00:03:18.910> feature<00:03:19.060> especially<00:03:19.660> when<00:03:19.810> you're

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
a useful feature especially when you're

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.840
