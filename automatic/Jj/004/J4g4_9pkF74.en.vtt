hey<00:00:00.659> guys<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.410> week<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:02.100> our<00:00:02.310> educational

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hey guys this week in our educational

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.390 
hey guys this week in our educational
video<00:00:03.360> we're<00:00:04.350> can<00:00:04.470> be<00:00:04.529> talking<00:00:04.859> about<00:00:04.980> branch

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
video we're can be talking about branch

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.169 
video we're can be talking about branch
chain<00:00:05.819> amino<00:00:05.850> acids<00:00:06.660> or<00:00:06.960> BCA<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.189> so<00:00:08.519> someone

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
chain amino acids or BCA a so someone

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.030 
chain amino acids or BCA a so someone
asked<00:00:09.480> on<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> Facebook<00:00:10.080> group<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.559> always<00:00:10.889> see

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
asked on the Facebook group I always see

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.440 
asked on the Facebook group I always see
you<00:00:11.130> guys<00:00:11.280> talking<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.670> branch<00:00:12.090> chains

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
you guys talking about branch chains

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.980 
you guys talking about branch chains
what<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.889> all<00:00:14.099> about<00:00:14.250> how<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.059> use<00:00:15.660> them

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
what is it all about how do I use them

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750 
what is it all about how do I use them
and<00:00:16.260> how<00:00:16.410> does<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.680> work<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.310> lifestyle

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and how does it work in this lifestyle

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.790 
and how does it work in this lifestyle
so<00:00:18.029> branch<00:00:18.600> chain<00:00:18.930> amino<00:00:18.960> acids<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
so branch chain amino acids are a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.890 
so branch chain amino acids are a
supplement<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.789> basically<00:00:21.449> what<00:00:21.720> they<00:00:21.869> are

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
supplement and basically what they are

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.410 
supplement and basically what they are
is<00:00:22.260> protein<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.550> broken<00:00:23.939> down<00:00:23.970> into

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
is protein but just broken down into

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.779 
is protein but just broken down into
smaller<00:00:24.660> pieces<00:00:24.900> or<00:00:25.350> amino<00:00:25.590> acids<00:00:26.010> made<00:00:26.519> up<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
smaller pieces or amino acids made up of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.089 
smaller pieces or amino acids made up of
three<00:00:27.180> amino<00:00:27.480> acids<00:00:28.019> leucine<00:00:28.470> isoleucine

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
three amino acids leucine isoleucine

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.600 
three amino acids leucine isoleucine
valine<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.449> together<00:00:31.230> they<00:00:31.710> make<00:00:32.099> branched

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
valine and together they make branched

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
valine and together they make branched
chain<00:00:32.790> amino<00:00:32.820> acids<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.630> thing<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.079> makes

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
chain amino acids and thing that makes

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.959 
chain amino acids and thing that makes
them<00:00:34.649> different<00:00:34.680> from<00:00:35.160> other<00:00:35.430> types<00:00:35.790> of

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
them different from other types of

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.090 
them different from other types of
protein<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.660> other<00:00:36.840> amino<00:00:37.440> acids<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
protein and other amino acids is that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.060 
protein and other amino acids is that
they<00:00:38.250> are<00:00:38.570> metabolized<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> muscle<00:00:40.469> which

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
they are metabolized in the muscle which

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.030 
they are metabolized in the muscle which
makes<00:00:41.399> them<00:00:41.640> uniquely<00:00:42.180> fit<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.559> used<00:00:43.860> for

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
makes them uniquely fit to be used for

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.580 
makes them uniquely fit to be used for
energy<00:00:44.629> especially<00:00:45.629> during<00:00:45.780> exercise<00:00:46.289> but

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
energy especially during exercise but

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.160 
energy especially during exercise but
also<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.489> during<00:00:47.730> down<00:00:48.030> times<00:00:48.390> instead

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
also you know during down times instead

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
also you know during down times instead
of<00:00:49.250> carbohydrates<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:50.940> act<00:00:51.120> very

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
of carbohydrates so they act very

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420 
of carbohydrates so they act very
similar<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> carbohydrates<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:52.980> without<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
similar to carbohydrates but without the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.979 
similar to carbohydrates but without the
fat<00:00:53.640> storage<00:00:54.090> effects<00:00:54.480> which<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> kind<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
fat storage effects which is kind of

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.260 
fat storage effects which is kind of
really<00:00:55.230> cool<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.160> especially<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.969> you're<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
really cool so especially if you're on a

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660 
really cool so especially if you're on a
low<00:00:57.600> carbohydrate<00:00:57.960> diet<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.160> should<00:00:59.190> be

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
low carbohydrate diet you should be

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
low carbohydrate diet you should be
supplementing<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.480> branched<00:01:00.870> chain<00:01:01.109> amino

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
supplementing with branched chain amino

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.889 
supplementing with branched chain amino
acids<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.190> someone<00:01:02.489> who's<00:01:02.609> doing

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
acids or if you're someone who's doing

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
acids or if you're someone who's doing
intermittent<00:01:03.899> fasting<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.559> longer<00:01:05.100> periods

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
intermittent fasting or longer periods

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.510 
intermittent fasting or longer periods
without<00:01:05.640> food<00:01:06.439> definitely<00:01:07.439> recommend<00:01:07.950> doing

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
without food definitely recommend doing

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.210 
without food definitely recommend doing
branch<00:01:08.880> chains<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.450> what<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.439> there's<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
branch chains so what are they there's a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.380 
branch chains so what are they there's a
couple<00:01:11.490> different<00:01:11.610> ways<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> take

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
couple different ways you can take

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
couple different ways you can take
branch<00:01:12.689> chains<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.200> first<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.070> powder

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
branch chains the first is a powder

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.700 
branch chains the first is a powder
the<00:01:14.970> second<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.390> capsules<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> amount

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the second is capsules and in the amount

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.130 
the second is capsules and in the amount
and<00:01:16.950> dosage<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.909> recommend<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.630> Jill<00:01:18.900> fit

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
and dosage that we recommend on Jill fit

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.660 
and dosage that we recommend on Jill fit
you<00:01:19.770> definitely<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> powder

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you definitely want to get the powder

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.859 
you definitely want to get the powder
because<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.180> much<00:01:21.330> easier<00:01:21.750> than

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
because it's just much easier than

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.630 
because it's just much easier than
taking<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> whole<00:01:22.500> bunch<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> pills<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
taking a whole bunch of pills so the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.999 
taking a whole bunch of pills so the
powdered<00:01:24.000> version<00:01:24.180> usually<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.350> scoop<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
powdered version usually a scoop is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.910 
powdered version usually a scoop is
about<00:01:26.430> 5<00:01:26.729> grams<00:01:27.060> which<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.479> also<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.930> serving<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
about 5 grams which is also a serving so

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.469 
about 5 grams which is also a serving so
make<00:01:29.070> sure<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.250> look<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> label<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.060> if

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
make sure you look at the label and if

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.140 
make sure you look at the label and if
it's<00:01:30.630> -<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.140> could<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.320> 2.5<00:01:32.009> grams<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.670> what

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's - it could be 2.5 grams and what

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's - it could be 2.5 grams and what
you<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.420> need<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> take<00:01:33.869> 2<00:01:34.049> scoops<00:01:34.350> every<00:01:34.710> time

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you get need to take 2 scoops every time

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.340 
you get need to take 2 scoops every time
you<00:01:34.979> take<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> take<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.720> first<00:01:37.170> of

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you take it when do you take it first of

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.630 
you take it when do you take it first of
all<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.619> want<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.860> take<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> before<00:01:38.250> your

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
all you want to take it before your

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.830 
all you want to take it before your
workout<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.479> does<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.750> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
workout because what it does is it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
workout because what it does is it
provides<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.409> energy<00:01:40.860> during<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
provides you with energy during the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.149 
provides you with energy during the
workout<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.899> not<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> way<00:01:43.829> that

then I would just recommend getting an
unflavored<00:03:24.419> kind<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.840> plain<00:03:25.199> kind<00:03:25.859> you<00:03:26.430> know

water and then just kind of chug back

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.640 
water and then just kind of chug back
but<00:03:30.329> if<00:03:30.569> you're<00:03:30.689> someone<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:30.989> me<00:03:31.169> who<00:03:31.319> need<00:03:31.620> a

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
but if you're someone like me who need a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.289 
but if you're someone like me who need a
little<00:03:31.709> bit<00:03:31.919> of<00:03:32.010> flavor<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.729> brand<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.180> we

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
little bit of flavor the brand that we

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.170 
little bit of flavor the brand that we
like<00:03:33.569> is<00:03:33.870> called<00:03:34.169> mrm<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.909> think<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
like is called mrm and I think the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.990 
like is called mrm and I think the
product<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.629> mrm<00:03:37.349> dash<00:03:37.829> G<00:03:38.519> because<00:03:38.819> they<00:03:38.879> have

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
product is mrm dash G because they have

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.270 
product is mrm dash G because they have
food<00:03:39.479> amine<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:39.989> as<00:03:40.139> well<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:41.129> in

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
food amine in it as well and it's in

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.249 
food amine in it as well and it's in
watermelon<00:03:41.729> flavor<00:03:42.449> and<00:03:42.750> that's<00:03:42.810> actually

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:43.259 
watermelon flavor and that's actually

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.710 
watermelon flavor and that's actually
naturally<00:03:43.949> sweetened<00:03:44.579> with<00:03:44.909> I<00:03:44.939> think<00:03:45.150> stevia

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
naturally sweetened with I think stevia

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.649 
naturally sweetened with I think stevia
so<00:03:46.319> it's<00:03:46.650> not<00:03:46.829> sweetened<00:03:47.459> with<00:03:47.699> sucralose<00:03:48.299> and

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
so it's not sweetened with sucralose and

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:49.969 
so it's not sweetened with sucralose and
a<00:03:48.689> lot<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.870> these<00:03:48.959> other<00:03:49.109> kind<00:03:49.379> of<00:03:49.439> artificial
