00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.900
 this action so spectacular that sure 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.560
 that will be the winner of the season 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:11.040
 Well the reason was the opportunity that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.299
 I had it because I really only live the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 basket and if these two boats and jump from 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.380
 it's true that I've surprised myself 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.160
 but well I think that's what I 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.100
 I have the energy that what 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.030
 you need a team that like that 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.850
 it's us 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.010
 good to wake up a little people and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.830
 true that they were very very 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.760
 awakened in the game and that we 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.760
 they supported a lot 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.430
 well it's just something is something that 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.890
 I also believe before and it came out 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.880
 well fine 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.880
 against barcelona 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.950
 If you really know me for doing 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.160
 those things but it really is some 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.080
 gift of god or something like that they know me 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:21.340
 like a physical athletic guy and with a lot 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.940
 energy and that was some goal of mine 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.850
 in the game he throws me is to transfer to 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.210
 this energy from my colleagues and 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.400
 to the staff and everyone to win that team 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.590
 what we did another day that's a 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:43.259
 excellent team 23 teams in europe and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.259
 Well, it has turned out well 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.690
 Well really, if we know what is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.050
 also so it has a character 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.280
 and very alive, very different from what is very 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.680
 difficult to find and well I think that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 that only helps us and 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.050
 thank God we still have it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.370
 room for improvement 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.110
 I think we are very clear 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.680
 palazuelos 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.420
 we have done we have done some things 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.700
 very good that many people did not expect 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.430
 maybe us ourselves but from 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.520
 true that we have done well and we did 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.800
 good things and now now we are already 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.190
 we are busy with the next game 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.190
 with him and with valence and we are already 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.030
 we are fixed in his game and all the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.940
 things that are part of preparation for 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.680
 a game of great victories because 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 the rivals like the valence 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.850
 they will be warned of the same capable and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.580
 well really that little one that 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.770
 He is also well known for very good 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.310
 support and with the people here that encourages us 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.370
 and all that, so everyone always 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.580
 always comes here with those things in the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.230
 head but also the things that 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.410
 we did in this first 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:24.340
 first 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:27.760
 the first round of truth that also 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.840
 put more and more things in the heads of 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.810
 rivals so 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.940
 I think it is not 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.940
 and it's not so easy to come and play here 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.459
 Well really I did not say that I like it 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.930
 when they tell me it's a promise and 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:58.410
 all that but the things I said the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.990
 things of the young but really what 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.230
 little by little this I'm trying and 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.870
 doing things so they see that from 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.320
 I'm not so young and good with the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.200
 years that I have'm very very young but 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.790
 I'm trying to teach what I can do 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.370
 of some things that seniors do 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.949
 also with the classification for 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.990
 cup with weight over 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.560
 really really do not we do not 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.560
 we 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.920
 I think we've done a lot 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.080
 surprises 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.069
 it's that part of season 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.639
 well really that is a pride and is 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:46.759
 very cool to play the cup and all that but 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:50.810
 I think I think we have some more things 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:52.909
 important of what we have done up to 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.279
 now we want we want to look towards 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.930
 up more and we want to progress and 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:00.810
 improve with a team so 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.680
 let's work to see if we get 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.680
 that person 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.360
 really, really, I like it 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:30.249
 very much have some responsibility 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.809
 and that I'm just one person who 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.929
 who wants to have some responsibility 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:38.740
 and all that but really also yes that 

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:42.470
 I still do not have that level 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:46.100
 I can not have things good really 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.470
 also that he had some responsibilities 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.590
 during the last matches but 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.960
 also the responsibilities that it takes 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.930
 the whole team I think they are 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.310
 much more important than the 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.310
 responsibilities that I had
