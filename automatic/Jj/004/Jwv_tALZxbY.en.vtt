00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.790
 today in the kitchen with the bible we are going to 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.910
 prepare cauliflower and bacon tortillas 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.260
 ingredients 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.210
 a cauliflower break with an onion 56 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.210
 Salt and oil eggs 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.790
 we started by removing the center and the leaves 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.430
 green to cauliflower 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.930
 we separate them into bouquets and the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.930
 we wash under cold water 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.219
 in a pan with oil we can adjust 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.879
 onion finely chopped on fire 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.879
 medium low 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.650
 in plenty of boiling water add salt 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.409
 and we put to cook the quickies of 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.630
 cauliflower 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.010
 the type of cooking will depend on the size 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.320
 of the cauliflower 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.750
 we know her until she is soft 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.880
 then a lot onion and without 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.880
 your collection we publish 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.540
 removing the first one from the skin 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.040
 lives 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.040
 and against but eventually 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.490
 when the onion is poached 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.490
 we reserve and sautÃ© over fire 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.549
 when we see that the collection is 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.549
 soft we drain and reserve 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.039
 when the bacon is golden, what 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.039
 We reserve next to the poached onion 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.190
 in a bowl we measure the flower muni well 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.550
 drained and crushed lightly with 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.550
 a fork 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.100
 then we add the onion mixture 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.900
 pochada and bacon that we had reserved 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.040
 very well so that all the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.219
 flavors 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.319
 in autogol beating the games the 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:22.159
 amount of egg will also depend on the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.159
 collision size 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.810
 to bigger more garrafal 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.600
 we beat them with a little salt 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.640
 once they are beaten no one then the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.130
 cauliflower basic brick with onion 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.920
 as a mixture very well 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.220
 and we put the point of salt by testing if 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.220
 it takes 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.730
 in a pan feel the box 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.160
 the possibility will depend on the taste of 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.990
 each one more time more curd will come out 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.020
 when we see that we give him the 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.090
 turn and turn off the heat the heat 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.090
 residual is finished combining 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.520
 and we have our tortilla ready 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.040
 it is very rich 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.040
