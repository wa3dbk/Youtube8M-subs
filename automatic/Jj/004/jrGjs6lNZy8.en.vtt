hello YouTube versus me running
minecraft<00:00:15.879> and<00:00:16.119> today<00:00:16.390> I'm<00:00:16.480> just<00:00:16.720> showing<00:00:16.990> you

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
minecraft and today I'm just showing you

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.179 
minecraft and today I'm just showing you
around<00:00:17.320> and<00:00:18.060> explaining<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.660> concept<00:00:20.380> of<00:00:20.890> my

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
around and explaining the concept of my

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.790 
around and explaining the concept of my
multifunctional<00:00:22.029> factory<00:00:22.660> in<00:00:23.140> industrial

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
multifunctional factory in industrial

crafton<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:29.380> Meuse<00:00:29.619> quit<00:00:29.800> flying

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.970 

so<00:00:36.470> this<00:00:36.830> factory<00:00:37.400> it<00:00:38.360> can<00:00:38.780> gather<00:00:38.990> nuclear

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
so this factory it can gather nuclear

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.670 
so this factory it can gather nuclear
power<00:00:40.220> wave<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.360> turbine<00:00:41.810> power<00:00:42.080> and<00:00:42.410> solar

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
forms of power all made in this one

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.050 
forms of power all made in this one
quite<00:00:56.210> compact<00:00:56.840> to<00:00:57.260> your<00:00:57.410> nest<00:00:59.740> factoring

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
quite compact to your nest factoring

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.970 
quite compact to your nest factoring
this<00:01:02.060> is<00:01:02.330> the<00:01:02.510> wave<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:02.900> turbine<00:01:03.320> power<00:01:03.590> in

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
this is the wave and turbine power in

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.960 
this is the wave and turbine power in
Ezra<00:01:04.309> newest<00:01:04.640> most<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.950> got<00:01:06.950> colored<00:01:07.490> guys<00:01:07.760> on

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
Ezra newest most of got colored guys on

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.400 
Ezra newest most of got colored guys on
them<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.050> clearly<00:01:09.979> put<00:01:10.280> water<00:01:10.630> green<00:01:11.630> which<00:01:12.200> is

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
them so clearly put water green which is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:20.440 
them so clearly put water green which is
the<00:01:12.650> nuclear<00:01:13.960> generators<00:01:14.960> is<00:01:15.200> green<00:01:16.390> color<00:01:19.450> so

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
the nuclear generators is green color so

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.260 
the nuclear generators is green color so
that<00:01:20.900> is<00:01:21.110> inside<00:01:21.619> line<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.820> see<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.060> water

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
that is inside line and see the water

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.719 
that is inside line and see the water
running<00:01:23.630> down<00:01:23.930> and<00:01:24.680> basically<00:01:25.100> have<00:01:25.340> placed

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
running down and basically have placed

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.770 
running down and basically have placed
water<00:01:26.060> source<00:01:26.510> blocks<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.229> Tavia<00:01:27.800> and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
water source blocks and Tavia and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.800 
water source blocks and Tavia and
basically<00:01:29.830> there's<00:01:30.830> about<00:01:31.250> eight<00:01:31.670> eight<00:01:32.270> walk

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
basically there's about eight eight walk

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.200 
basically there's about eight eight walk
water<00:01:33.320> generators<00:01:34.130> there<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> water

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
water generators there and the water

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.090 
water generators there and the water
flows<00:01:35.660> through<00:01:36.140> down<00:01:36.410> there<00:01:36.650> threw<00:01:36.950> down

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
flows through down there threw down

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.460 
flows through down there threw down
their<00:01:37.310> food<00:01:37.910> enough<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:38.630> without<00:01:39.020> makeup

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
their food enough that without makeup

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.380 
their food enough that without makeup
and<00:01:39.740> we<00:01:39.920> don't<00:01:40.040> like<00:01:41.350> getting<00:01:42.670> getting<00:01:43.670> which

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
and we don't like getting getting which

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.570 
and we don't like getting getting which
eventually<00:01:44.750> gets<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.230> energy<00:01:45.410> for<00:01:45.920> more<00:01:46.340> than

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
eventually gets the energy for more than

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.399 
eventually gets the energy for more than
a<00:01:46.700> connected<00:01:47.210> into<00:01:47.840> one<00:01:48.970> with<00:01:49.970> one<00:01:50.210> wire<00:01:50.450> into

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
a connected into one with one wire into

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.390 
a connected into one with one wire into
the<00:01:51.970> way<00:01:52.970> turbine<00:01:53.540> power<00:01:53.780> which<00:01:54.560> I've<00:01:55.040> had

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
the way turbine power which I've had

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.760 
the way turbine power which I've had
that<00:01:55.520> on<00:01:55.640> corner<00:01:56.450> having<00:01:56.480> collected<00:01:57.140> amex

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
that on corner having collected amex

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.940 
that on corner having collected amex
energy<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:59.090> i<00:01:59.390> probably<00:02:00.140> will<00:02:00.440> take<00:02:00.650> that<00:02:00.800> out

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
energy so i probably will take that out

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.970 
energy so i probably will take that out
and<00:02:00.980> put<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.370> more<00:02:01.700> efficient<00:02:02.630> means<00:02:03.409> of<00:02:03.560> energy

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
and put a more efficient means of energy

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.070 
and put a more efficient means of energy
might<00:02:04.729> add<00:02:04.880> another<00:02:05.210> nuclear<00:02:05.720> reactor

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
might add another nuclear reactor

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.580 
might add another nuclear reactor
chamber<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:07.070> version<00:02:07.820> 2<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:08.390> if<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:09.410> just

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
chamber in version 2 but if you just

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.800 
chamber in version 2 but if you just
look<00:02:09.739> at<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.120> compared<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.180> solar<00:02:11.510> power

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
look at that compared to solar power

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.590 
look at that compared to solar power
which<00:02:12.410> they<00:02:12.560> just<00:02:12.800> set<00:02:12.950> up<00:02:13.269> that's<00:02:14.269> going<00:02:14.540> up

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
which they just set up that's going up

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.370 
which they just set up that's going up
pretty<00:02:14.840> fast<00:02:15.050> under<00:02:15.590> guard<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:16.900> temp<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.140> the

sort<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:23.299> bizarre<00:02:23.450> I'm<00:02:24.049> still<00:02:24.680> testing

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
sort of the bizarre I'm still testing

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.860 
sort of the bizarre I'm still testing
and<00:02:25.430> preparing<00:02:27.310> our<00:02:28.310> next<00:02:29.239> show<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.540> Nuclear

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and preparing our next show the Nuclear

and preparing our next show the Nuclear
Power<00:02:30.019> Chamber<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.860> if<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.310> go<00:02:31.489> up<00:02:31.549> here<00:02:31.790> i'm

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
Power Chamber so if you go up here i'm

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.080 
Power Chamber so if you go up here i'm
using<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.930> flow<00:02:33.140> more<00:02:33.320> at<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.500> moment<00:02:33.799> cloud

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
using the flow more at the moment cloud

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.860 
using the flow more at the moment cloud
constructed<00:02:35.090> any<00:02:35.239> decent<00:02:35.750> stairs<00:02:36.080> or<00:02:36.410> step

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
constructed any decent stairs or step

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.170 
constructed any decent stairs or step
but<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.049> get<00:02:38.200> up<00:02:38.409> there<00:02:38.590> yet<00:02:38.829> but<00:02:39.180> basically

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
but to get up there yet but basically

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.839 
but to get up there yet but basically
what<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.510> concept<00:02:41.049> is<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:42.459> fit<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
what the concept is is you fit the

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.690 
what the concept is is you fit the
storage<00:02:43.590> piston<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.890> trucks<00:02:45.219> crack<00:02:45.519> the

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
storage piston the trucks crack the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.619 
storage piston the trucks crack the
block<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.269> see<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.959> new<00:02:46.989> gear<00:02:47.319> changes<00:02:48.629> with

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
block and see the new gear changes with

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.039 
block and see the new gear changes with
water<00:02:49.870> around<00:02:50.230> them<00:02:50.469> you<00:02:50.829> stand<00:02:51.129> in<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:52.049> like

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
water around them you stand in this like

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.020 
water around them you stand in this like
obsidian<00:02:55.140> plated<00:02:56.140> lot<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.220> then<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.909> just

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
obsidian plated lot and then you just

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.699 
obsidian plated lot and then you just
right-click<00:02:58.629> you<00:02:59.019> put<00:02:59.379> all<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.680> them<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:02.530> all

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
right-click you put all of them but all
