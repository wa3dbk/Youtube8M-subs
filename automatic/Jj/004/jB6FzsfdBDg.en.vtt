00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.770
 hello everyone with you spoon and today we 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.860
 We will consider the whole two fashion and 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.260
 let 's consider the first mod 1 mod 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.630
 This is a mod that adds groups of telescopes 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.270
 It is the telescope that he craft from six 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.190
 pieces of iron from single glass and from 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.920
 of course we have a little diamond 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.360
 a little expensive even i'm in los play so far 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.490
 I did not find it and let's consider 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.300
 now we click the right mouse button 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.330
 holding in hand 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.190
 telescope and we are approaching push 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.830
 again approaching push again 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.540
 approaching push again one hundred all 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.020
 cleaned of course you can just remove 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.030
 telescope out of hand and it will get out and let's 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.820
 consider if we have a mod 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.660
 optifine is this mod then it is already on 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.940
 your choice 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.370
 that is, if you want to zoom in either 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.230
 using the control button without crafting or 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.350
 do you want to zoom with crafting 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.570
 it is with the help of this mod and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.820
 let's all the same consider the following 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.030
 mod since it has already exhausted itself yes 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.350
 Exactly its next mod is exhausted. 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.000
 with which you can now 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.490
 to craft doors 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.740
 it is the door but not the simple door to door 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.959
 which are used to 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.920
 open them with the key or 

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:18.649
 combination lock 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.509
 for example we put this door and look 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.849
 now we can't just open it 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.080
 even with the help of redstone we take 1 com 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.780
 torch and nothing happens here 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.940
 set here nothing happens even 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.640
 here and still nothing will happen 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.200
 even with a lever and how would that 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.750
 must be done to open it 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 we need to craft the key and 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.860
 it is crafted from 4 pieces of iron and reapplied 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.619
 roadstone 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.640
 we get the key kei and now he 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.310
 I bought it 4656 we take it click 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.349
 right mouse button on the door and we have everything 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.550
 now with this particular key we 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.869
 we can open close 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.849
 open close and open and 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.160
 close and open close this 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.560
 the door and now we will try to craft 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.420
 another key, as it were, probably everyone will fall with 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.700
 using another key will also come out but 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.190
 look at these keys are different 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.050
 Haydee it and go with this 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:13.250
 key you can not open because 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.260
 idi 4656 is connected to this door 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.030
 and it is with this key that you 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.890
 you can 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.110
 open close opens fill 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.240
 open close but this problem 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.430
 You can basically decide if you want 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.010
 remove the key for this we need 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.130
 to chip remove the chip than it is crafted 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.600
 from 5 pieces of iron then from one 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.060
 pieces glad stone and 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.130
 from 1 lighter everything we do 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.000
 deleting chip next we press right 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.250
 click on 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.810
 No, first you need to open, that is, if 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.230
 we will try on samples now 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.600
 remove 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.340
 this chip door that we do not 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.290
 come out and write please update your 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.510
 first aid first you need to open the door we 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.239
 of course we open it as they write and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.360
 chip right mouse button and dad 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.140
 we retired everything works fine in 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.750
 meaning the door was gone and she is not to 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.400
 root door is not root 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.560
 there is still possible to remove it 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.569
 let's consider the following type 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.220
 doors or rather the last next type 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.959
 trust is our door which 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.080
 opens with a code lock 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.450
 it is done as follows and we look 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.239
 we put our offer here such 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.010
 at the door and where there is a combination lock sense 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.340
 buttons we press the right mouse button 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:31.299
 and what next we enter the password 1704 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.730
 like this then we click ok and now 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.450
 With this password we can 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.130
 already open the door from 1704 ok 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.860
 everything opened close we can 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.930
 simply without a password about and everything but 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.989
 we can open again only with the help 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.670
 password that is, everything works with a bang so 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.600
 this is all removed with a chip 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.000
 open door 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.820
 we can change the password that is, we 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.340
 click repair then you will see old 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.250
 password 1704 click ok 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.859
 new for example one two three four and ok 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.850
 all we can now with the help of 1234 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:07.269
 open this door 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.920
 everything works with a bang that is I do not know the mod 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.109
 deserves attention that we are now 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.570
 is it true chip and yes indeed everything 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.280
 works with a bang and today was here 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.019
