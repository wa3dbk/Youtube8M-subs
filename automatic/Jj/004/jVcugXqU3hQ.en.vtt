 Come back and see the video today. 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.250
 I came back to you 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.949

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.470
 first person in online gta and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.989
 very very very but very simple way 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.090
 much simpler than I imagined 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.760
 that would be in case someone discovered a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 glitch but it's very easy you'll have to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.780
 I do come here pro sink 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.700
 Look there at the location of the map to you. 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.770
 You know where it is right and we come to here 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.780
 Good Ferris wheel, you're going to be right now. 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.300
 there looking at the door of the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.000
 Ferris wheel, you're going to ask for a ticket. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.899
 tightens skipped purchase and then you move away 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.789
 will depart 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.030
 then you will go near it opened 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.170
 select go near it hit the y 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.670
 There he presses his suicide and one 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.440
 to get on the roller coaster type you 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.810
 and then it is done while the 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.850
 even if you have on the screen of the suicide 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.580
 now we are we should already be 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.869
 again and we're already loose can see 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.670
 I can not get the gun 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.100
 the weapon menu is available for 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.810
 the passive mode of a ticket to us 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.880
 ended up in the passive control somehow 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.180
 but this is what has to happen beauty 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.369
 Now we're going to go to the roller coaster. 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.750
 But she just took off when she is 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.860
 passing on then it will take a 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.850
 little to get 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.679
 so I think you could already 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.630
 understand where to only strengthen for you 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.729
 there while the roller coaster arrives 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.240
 basically the glitch is you come here in 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.819
 Ferris wheel and buy a ticket April 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.009
 select commit suicide portal are 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.899
 to enter there soon thereafter committed 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.789
 Suicide in its very fast way then 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.909
 that's just it right now you see it here 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.179
 wait for the roller coaster to arrive and people 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.009
 you can continue the next step of the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.830
 Italian government to the second round of 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.159
 It will be there soon, he faces the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.990
 ticket is very very crazy very beauty 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.369
 Fuck really I want you to see that 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.630
 your eyes or if I say anything 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.549
 thing and then guy was waiting fuck 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.660
 here 's just a ride in the 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.540
 roller coaster 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.010
 just buy now ride 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.829
 rollercoaster good going back and forth to 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.320
 there is a black roller coaster now 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.810
 the bugre gets the catar show on the screen 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.310
 of the Ferris wheel being that we are not 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.060
 we have and this is what has to happen 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.230
 beauty 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.420
 Nice folks when it does not get so good. 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.950
 goal to stay small I will go 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.329
 accelerate that part of the roller coaster 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.130
 beauty because you have nothing else 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.230
 nothing less, take a ride on the mountain 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.959
 so the turn around starts with the 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.060
 back actually begins and ends neither 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.750
 I'll speed up the way back, fucking gotten lost. 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.310
 general 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.410
 so I'm just going to accelerate the return of 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.769
 roller coaster spoke normally 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.769
 thanks 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.019
 beauty guys here we vote only now 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.730
 as you will have to do 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.530
 the roller coaster arrived when she 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.049
 get you press the switch to beque 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.829
 camera look there was already because the clear 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.590
 that she stopped 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.569
 Look at this strange case we are already in the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.370
 first person is very, very much 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.189
 difficult to control win at first 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:30.560
 person for very different from good 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:33.319
 family did not want the map to find my 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.010
 his bike does not evaluate 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.769
 let's take a motorcycle tour 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.810
 here in first person replay 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.319
 too difficult to control the camera and 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.239
 we climbed the bike we're already denied 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.699
 One tip I give you is that you 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.379
 do not move away from the pio, it's cool to know 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.269
 this click here for you to see how 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.699
 wants to play first-person loom 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.069
 but we are not far from the worst if not the bug 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.290
 means that it is close to the 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.400
 roller coaster and and the Ferris wheel more 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.439
 as close as you can 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.750
 We're here now, I'll get the 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.370
 car for you to see the car there. 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.349
 will have disappeared 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.720
 just disappeared no matter, let's go 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.189
 look for a kidnapping on the subway across the face 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.120
 it is very difficult to control the first 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.090
 person 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.169
 that's it 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.780
 i dee is too hard is very 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.460
 sensitive in terms of gdp to catch 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.780
 That little jeep I think will stay. 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.280
 very cool 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.949
 just to take a ride takes another 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.360
 They'll catch a boat, too, like I said. 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.580
 have to stay close to the worst because those 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.470
 then there's no mean shit happening 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.610
 you simply glitch ends because 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.919
 you are too far from the roller coaster 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.940
 You can see below the menus in 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.010
 roller coaster 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.080
 so we have to be 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.389
 basically it's a politician this happened 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.620
 roller coaster and the ferris wheel and the game 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.020
 recognizes that we are inside it 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.850
 you can still see that the steering wheel does not even 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.680
 when I turn differently that way 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.030
 that the guy created some time ago that 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.900
 showed the character's mother even if 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.889
 moving 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.540
 but it's good for us to have a 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.720
 reference to the iÃ³ playing the first 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.400

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.169

 left you face left the team a lot 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.490
 A very strong resemblance here is 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.350
 Japan 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.350
 I want to now take the jet ski there for a 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.450
