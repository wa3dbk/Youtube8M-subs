00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.830
 Hello everyone, I would like to say a few 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 words about the knife here's a spider to 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:17.640
 residence I experienced some unpleasant 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 moments with this knife about it i'm already 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.750
 I made a video like I would n't 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 repeat here I wanted to talk about 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.750
 friend was originally a knife in this 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:36.920
 the state is not very damn that is not 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.610
 the center of the liner went to the middle here 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.070
 we are special 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.510
 this is not a knife for no effect but it was somehow 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.510
 You know if there feeling some not blowing 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.079
 his jealousy wanted to press anyone 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.910
 seeks some ideal and in 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.190
 Naturally this is not very much 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.300
 like here, I examine this knife I 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.579
 complaining about another surprise 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.619
 plan that they were there 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.740
 some sort of stuffed them 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.710
 kicked tom titus do not roll incomprehensibly 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 where is that 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.619
 kineshsya me this was not all there 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.549
 ok let's say on the parameter this 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.560
 total turnover is beautifully neat here 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.740
 here are such unpleasant surprises 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.140
 didn't expect oh well that's when i 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.590
 disassembled here 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.240
 the puck knife itself was also terrible 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.320
 able to eat something 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.100
 there were some risks on them 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.950
 incomprehensible well I polished in 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.740
 Further, as if all when collected already 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:59.390
 everything turned out fine everything is fine here 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:02.810
 the blade stood exactly in the center of this 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.630
 problem when i decided not to let it 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.489
 straight arms but if managed 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:15.250
 the second problem was this liner which 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.250
 went to the middle I took advantage 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.820
 video from ruslan skmen where it is about 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.900
 this is a lot of dinner we told the video 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:32.050
 how it is treated but it helped me 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:35.480
 I'll tell you right now what was saying 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:40.150
 now I have the liner comes to the most 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.130
 the very beginning of any opening 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.630
 blade 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:51.440
 thanks to the polished step altogether 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:56.959
 just soft bears so surely the screws 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.760
 here it is necessary to change all one die I do not 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.840
 One was able to loosen the screws have 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.920
 scrolls and 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.850
 so I did not happen no 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:14.150
 In the future, I probably decided this question 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:17.390
 although in my brotha forums forum whether 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.910
 spider to on the official forum there are 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.340
 questions very very often arise by 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.720
 about the price of an hour resilin from all knives 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.650
 which pier having become made in china 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.660
 here that is and there really 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.780
 were originally produced under the hexagon 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.660
 and about this even at the mention of the truth in 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.260
 spider to directory in any directory there in 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.930
 late now they switched to turks 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.510
 as far as I know 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.880
 here and people addressed to them on a guarantee 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:54.100
 there let's change the screws here 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:57.770
 but that's what they answered that if you 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.540
 let's say you broke these here 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.470
 see throwing scroll the bath on 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.880
 clip you and change it without problems 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.489
 such a problem they say that 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.640
 heat of china and for life prepared in 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.400
 China and suppose they have such cogs 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.190
 no there is some kind of vicious circle here 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.430
 about these are the same overlays and also 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.640
 considered to be a knife disassembly and that is a knife 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.750
 The warranty is no longer guaranteed. 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:30.710
 will change although people are turning and don't know 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:37.480
 someone changed that was such a well 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.480
 look for exchange knife great so this 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:46.190
 Countryman I took off for quick opening 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:50.030
 hung here temporarily until lamb on 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:56.660
 frame only for forests 4 bedroom collar 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:58.490
 I will immediately tell a millimeter but of course 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.610
 it's awesome, all hurt 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.160
 but when will you cut bread there or 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:10.419
 Sausage this form is a homuk you will 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:13.550
 interfere so that 's how the knife itself is excellent 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:17.450
 I really like to perform some 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.000
 work in the kitchen to cut something very 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.590
 convenient 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.720
 generally normal leg 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.550
 Well, in general, so and so somehow quite 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.360
 say goodbye to everyone while subscribe to 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.360
