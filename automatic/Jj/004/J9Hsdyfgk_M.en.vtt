00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.710
 the cloud of 1931 is a picture painted by 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.379
 gerardo murillo the doctor atl 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.559
 this is a transition picture is a 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.360
 picture that reveals the formal study and 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.320
 technician who is doing the doctor to you 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.780
 It is painted on supported on materials 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.930
 that he himself invents and patents that are 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.300
 the colors that are dry resins to 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.239
 pigment and stay used to 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.649
 experiment with the textures that this 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.220
 is a stage in which the doctor is 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.090
 experimenting with volumes 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.060
 from the texture derive just reliefs 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.770
 of the landscape or edges of geometry 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.140
 curvilinear that he has been experiencing 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.060
 it's precisely a transition picture 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.210
 because it is located in this period in the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.610
 what is happening to you 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.520
 optical observations regarding the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.770
 geometry that supports the landscape over 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.940
 all seen from the air photo 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.190
 seen from above 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.920
 either on top of a hill either supported 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.140
 in some air through the instrument and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.720
 this curvilinear perspective technique 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.670
 he is just starting in this box 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.430
 from the cloud to show some elements 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.290
 dynamic geometry and they look 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.810
 just where the cloud appears where 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.150
 you can appreciate this experiment with 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.580
 the increasingly spherical volumes the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.119
 contrast is in the lower part of the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.369
 contrast is already noted in the relief of the 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.860
 land in the relief to land that is 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.300
 totally rectilinear and that has points 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.330
 of flight from the Albertian perspective 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.430
 as he pointed out to you is a picture of 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.399
 transition in which you notice 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.440
 still this point where he is not 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.880
 according to where you are studying in the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.610
 which is making optical observations 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.860
 and that he will get to consecrate in a 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.930
 sequence of landscapes that start 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.860
 precisely from this stage of 31 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.110
 up to 34 already with the consecration in their 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.230
 style in their landscapes of what is the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.470
 curvilinear perspective of this same 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.270
 way is also appreciated in this work 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.209
 the evocation that doctor atl makes of 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.739
 jose maria velasco is a rereading is 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.830
 a reinterpretation is a 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.770
 revaluation of the landscaping of joseph 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.350
 Maria Velasco as a telluric painter a 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.120
 active geometry painter who has to 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.940
 see with scientific observations about 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.290
 the geometry and geology is the doctor 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.760
 atul as a pioneer as one of the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.070
 founders of the Mexican school of 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.890
 painting is one of those that recovers all 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.040
 this tradition of the experiments of 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.459
 landscape open observations 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.330
 geometric geological science 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.430
 stratigraphics that José María does 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.989
 velasco not just with a name of 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.730
 art but with a man of science a 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.489
 knowledge man 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.530
 revalues ​​the doctor from this work 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.769
 I insist on transition that is called the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.769
 cloud
