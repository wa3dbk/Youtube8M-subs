 steadin always negatively affects 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.700
 on the team besides that hr and started 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.740
 take unusual characters for themselves and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 an experienced team like navi survived 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.540
 maximum of the current situation

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.750
 the only losers grid 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.700
 what the first game day can be called 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.770
 battle power ranger changing rush even 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.050
 replacements n p and showed excellent play and 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.090
 the same dome of the void with a board from m s he

 probably will be remembered by the audience at home 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.200
 but still doge the Swedes they never 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.000
 managed the second gaming day began with 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.050
 two matches bottom grid first 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.270
 hellraisers met 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.010
 and timfight hr and failed work on 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.820
 errors so the result was pretty 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.670
 is natural 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.200
 a clear victory for the americans few could 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.060
 suggest whether you leave the tournament 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.710

 The second played mvp and power ranger 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.290
 local steam moments look stronger 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.840
 but as soon as it came to the command 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.850
 action and the world were head and shoulders taller in 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.870
 as a result, the power ranger accounted for wizards and 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.940
 left the tournament 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.920
