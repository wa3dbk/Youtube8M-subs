00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 but it's like it's so good because the day of 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.080
 Today I'll show how to build 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.660
 wind stick ok this special cane 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.000
 this special good weapon is one of the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.469
 four different categories or types of 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.509
 special weapon that we have on this map 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.090
 ok well today we are going to do the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.279
 of wind and this is very simple that no 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.320
 they have more complexity it is simply 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.910
 how am I going to try it until it comes out 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.600
 all good not practically with the part 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.730
 of the robots 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.410
 but good interest explained the first 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.449
 what we have to do is build the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.669
 record player ok once we have 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.600
 our turntable is ready to play 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.480
 the song 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.430
 we need to find the disk that is going to 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.899
 play now so the piece to the piece 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.360
 musical so that we can 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.340
 access the letter and get this then 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.379
 the gemite that goes over the cane does not 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.510
 We have several locations for 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.370
 discs here are the following good 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.780
 the first one is here can 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 be right here where it's next 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.760
 of the road in this part can be a 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 of the disk locations ok the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 next can be in the part of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.280
 opposite that is where mine is here 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.989
 in this part it is a yellow disk 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.430
 I tell you all they are in this area it's very 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.659
 simple because everyone is like here 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.070
 close 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.140
 the next location is going to be 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.939
 just in front of these boxes ok 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.530
 here was where the location was 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.929
 passed right here opposite then 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.759
 to be here on top of this of these 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.350
 pieces of wood or if we get to 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.359
 where it says lightning here in the tunnel 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.520
 can be here in front here 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.829
 exactly on this table or 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 It can also be right up to 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:29.520
 down not where it's built it does not get 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.959
 this megaphone in the part here 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.420
 so those are the locations 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.039
 for this turntable for this record 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 practically not that we're going to stick in the 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.969
 turntable to activate our 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.129
 good portal the next step that 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.649
 we have to do is look for some 

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:45.360
 robot or we need to get inside 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.549
 of the three robots that are going to appear in 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.229
 this map as we are going to put them in 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.179
 these robots we need to look at the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.060
 legs of robots where they have a 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.950
 circle like yellow ok there like 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.629
 exactly like this one that is there that 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.950
 circle that we have to look for and for 

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:00.989
 put us simply we are going to put 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.520
 under the leg it has to be from the 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.500
 what we are looking for and 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.750
 shoot ok when we shoot 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.509
 let's do like a hole and we're going to 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.609
 put these robots at the robot's head 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.520
 they have names this is called odin and the 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:15.170
 pieces should count just below 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.820
 they have to grab and get out of the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.620
 tubes that are there and good that is what 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.420
 what will happen if you do not do it 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.400
 Well, well, if you grab and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.260
 let's say you are pointing at the wrong foot 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.610
 what they are going to do is that they are going to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.500
 end up killing since they are not going to 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.450
 destroy anything below the foot of that robot 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.250
 and it will end up crushing you 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.500
 then be careful where are you going to 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.420
 shoot where they are going to get because 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.130
 well, there's no way to escape ok 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.350
 then just pay attention first 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.850
 notice where you are going where the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.620
 foot of the robot this can take them a 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.270
 little bit since they have to do it 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.430
 with the three robots because each piece 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.110
 is therefore within the different 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.420
 robots does not then have to first 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.490
 check with each robot where to step where 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.350
 put on so that you can get 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.420
 inside these robots and already this 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.250
 so do not go like killing 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.710
 then well this step we are going to 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.360
 repeat with the three different robots and 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.880
 once we have everything ready we 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.130
 let's do the following good the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.200
 next step is to get the gem of 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.090
 this cane ok if we are where 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.100
 there is the jugger the rain generator 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.840
 we are going to come here as if coming 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.820
 to the right and we will find how 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.870
 is destroyed house ok here we go to 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.180
 grab and we're going to get in and what 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.099
 is where to even says wins that is 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.840
 where we want to go because then 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.090
 in this part is where is the 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.280
 portal that will take us through the gem 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.989
 that we want to get in this in 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.370
 this cane not to be able to complete this 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.739
 cane here we just grab 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.450
 we put our record player already obviously 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.650
 that we have the disc and well this what 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.209
 we can do at any time but 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.220
 well I 'm here right now because it's a 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.379
 little easier and as we all 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.819
 ready for now we can leave no and good 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.950
 once you are armed you are going to start 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.540
 like to learn yellow and good and 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.489
 come on this lix so we can get 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.349
 we just approached and we were alone 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.480
 we are going to have transport now we have 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.190
 to grab everything we have to go 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.810
 grab the gem not here are the four 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.220
 gems of all the maps but remember 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.290
 because they start to come out like zombies 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.970
 then just take the gem that 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.739
 is what they need in fact they can not 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.569
 grab any other more than the one 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.280
 they have like the one that they activated the 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.260
 portal ok and after they have it 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.180
 just do and go back to where 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.890
 they came out the pole more or through the button 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.269
 of action to return to the portal and 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.100
 is going to start building on the part of 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.780
 here as we come back it's going to start 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.940
 to build one here only that we are going 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.580
 to take back 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.110
 and we just wait and go to the 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.150
 beginning and once we have 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.040
 come back from there what we have to go to 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.570
 to do is to go to the part of him here 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.100
 punch and good and once we have 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.350
 we are all going to come to the part of the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.260
 excavation let's go down just to 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.490
 this part and we're going to put our 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.440
 turntables on this table or that here I do not 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.210
 lets put it because I already put it but 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.770
 you are going to put it on this table for 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.020
 that you open this secret passage 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.880
 these stairs are not going to be they are going to 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.590
 start to open as the song starts 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.510
 start playing you just go 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.300
 to grab will go down all this 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.560
 way here we're going to have it stg then yes 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.930
 we come here we will also have 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.150
 around here the music and good is just 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.340
 here opposite where is the new that 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.230
 is going to launch you're like statues and in 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.240
 these statues is where we are going to 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.310
 flick the different poles ok 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.530
 we go to the vast one that corresponds to us that 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.840
 is the yellow cane that is the 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.000
 of wind we approach and start it 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.490
 crafter once it is already created 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.680
 we just grab and take it 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.599
 in this way we could already do 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.580
 our wind stick that this is the 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.979
 way to build it I know it's a 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.470
 little bit tedious in the part of the 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.000
 giants that part can then take a 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.530
 little bit of time if they are doing it 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.330
 in cooperative this good because it is a 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.949
 little faster then if they 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.569
 friends say they are to help them to 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.880
 build it to get the pieces 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.560
 because good is a little tedious les 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.509
 I say be like chasing the 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.860
 giants and more if you are alone not 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.780
 because you have to be good 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.949
 making all parts instead if 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.020
 you're in good cooperative as you 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.759
 you can divide and well this cane has 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.889
 as a power let's say similar to the act 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.750
 underground this shoots like a wave 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.039
 of air that tears half practice 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.509
 all the zombies right now I'm going to 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.310
 teach more or less how you kill them 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.199
 just like throwing them and the 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.389
 destroy not then it's pretty good 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.759
 has enough bullets to hold 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.020
 a few rounds does not point you can not 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.840
 point just you can grab and 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.340
 shoot you can also kill this one 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.169
 to the zombie this seems ironman of 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.419
 pretty fast way is a weapon 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.639
 pretty good and good can serve you 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.900
 a lot if you are trying to reach the 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.490
 higher I think are weapons 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.620
 that they need to have since then you 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.360
 power if it's pretty good 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.040
 will help you very much ok then 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.470
 Well, this would be the tutorial 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.030
 how to get this wind stick me 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.960
 I say goodbye see you in the next 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.960
 goodbye video
