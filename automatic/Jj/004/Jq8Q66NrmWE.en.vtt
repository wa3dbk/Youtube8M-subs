00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
right choice I think he would have

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.120 
right choice I think he would have
benefited<00:00:23.410> from<00:00:23.500> another<00:00:23.769> year<00:00:23.949> in<00:00:23.980> school

underdeveloped you see the great

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.460 
underdeveloped you see the great
athletic<00:00:28.029> ability<00:00:28.060> on<00:00:28.449> tape<00:00:28.689> but<00:00:29.109> I<00:00:29.199> think<00:00:29.410> he

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
athletic ability on tape but I think he

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.570 
athletic ability on tape but I think he
truly<00:00:29.650> grades<00:00:30.009> out<00:00:30.160> as<00:00:30.310> more<00:00:30.490> of<00:00:30.550> a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
truly grades out as more of a

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.890 
truly grades out as more of a
third-round<00:00:31.000> pick<00:00:31.269> could<00:00:31.539> he<00:00:31.599> go<00:00:31.720> a<00:00:31.750> little

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
third-round pick could he go a little

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.870 
third-round pick could he go a little
bit<00:00:32.080> higher<00:00:32.259> because<00:00:32.470> of<00:00:32.710> his<00:00:32.800> upside<00:00:33.100> yes<00:00:33.400> but

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
bit higher because of his upside yes but

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.710 
bit higher because of his upside yes but
I<00:00:33.940> think<00:00:34.150> he<00:00:34.210> would<00:00:34.270> have<00:00:34.360> been<00:00:34.450> better<00:00:34.630> off

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
I think he would have been better off

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.030 
I think he would have been better off
staying<00:00:35.080> in<00:00:35.260> school<00:00:35.380> for<00:00:35.680> another<00:00:35.890> season

he come out he's played on a bad ankle
all<00:00:54.310> year<00:00:54.490> I<00:00:54.520> think<00:00:54.760> that's<00:00:54.880> definitely<00:00:55.060> hurt

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
all year I think that's definitely hurt

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.210 
all year I think that's definitely hurt
him<00:00:55.600> hasn't<00:00:56.080> gotten<00:00:56.350> along<00:00:56.620> very<00:00:56.680> well<00:00:56.950> with

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
him hasn't gotten along very well with

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.980 
him hasn't gotten along very well with
his<00:00:57.310> head<00:00:57.460> coach<00:00:57.640> brian<00:00:58.000> kelly<00:00:58.060> so<00:00:58.450> it's<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.660> one

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
his head coach brian kelly so it's a one

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.840 
his head coach brian kelly so it's a one
reason<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.530> come<00:00:59.770> out<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.130> I<00:01:00.160> think<00:01:00.340> he's<00:01:00.490> if

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
reason to come out and I think he's if

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.820 
reason to come out and I think he's if
there's<00:01:01.060> a<00:01:01.090> good<00:01:01.180> chance<00:01:01.420> he<00:01:01.600> will<00:01:01.780> you'd<00:01:02.710> look

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
there's a good chance he will you'd look

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.229 
there's a good chance he will you'd look
at<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.070> tape<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:03.490> think<00:01:03.670> he's<00:01:03.820> struggle<00:01:04.180> a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
at the tape and I think he's struggle a

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.460 
at the tape and I think he's struggle a
little<00:01:04.330> bit<00:01:04.479> this<00:01:04.659> year<00:01:04.720> in<00:01:04.930> allen<00:01:05.170> because<00:01:05.379> of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
little bit this year in allen because of

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.230 
little bit this year in allen because of
the<00:01:05.530> ankle<00:01:05.680> but<00:01:05.920> he<00:01:05.979> just<00:01:06.070> doesn't<00:01:06.189> play<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.789> big

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
the ankle but he just doesn't play a big

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.149 
the ankle but he just doesn't play a big
man's<00:01:07.479> game<00:01:07.750> for<00:01:08.049> as<00:01:08.140> big<00:01:08.289> as<00:01:08.409> he<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.530> doesn't

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
man's game for as big as he is doesn't

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.099 
man's game for as big as he is doesn't
come<00:01:09.399> downhill<00:01:09.609> isn't<00:01:10.000> filled<00:01:10.299> with<00:01:10.359> a<00:01:10.719> lot<00:01:11.079> of

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:11.109 
come downhill isn't filled with a lot of

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.200 
come downhill isn't filled with a lot of
aggression<00:01:11.469> and<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.829> think<00:01:12.039> you<00:01:12.700> know<00:01:12.789> that<00:01:12.909> he

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
aggression and I think you know that he

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.789 
aggression and I think you know that he
could<00:01:13.329> still<00:01:13.539> go<00:01:13.719> somewhere<00:01:14.320> late<00:01:14.619> in<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
could still go somewhere late in the

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.499 
could still go somewhere late in the
first<00:01:14.979> but<00:01:15.369> I<00:01:15.399> think<00:01:15.609> he's<00:01:15.700> more<00:01:15.850> of<00:01:15.939> a<00:01:16.000> true

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
first but I think he's more of a true

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.120 
first but I think he's more of a true
second<00:01:16.899> round<00:01:17.049> talent<00:01:17.289> it's<00:01:17.799> always<00:01:17.950> tough

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
second round talent it's always tough

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.469 
second round talent it's always tough
when<00:01:18.189> you're<00:01:18.490> big<00:01:18.700> recruit<00:01:18.999> for<00:01:19.149> one<00:01:19.299> coach
