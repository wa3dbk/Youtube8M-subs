00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.019
 hello to all my friends from the channel 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.410
 youtube let's work a word a 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:13.490
 score here at the end of 2014 and what 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:19.609
 let's do in this score we're going to 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:24.470
 add a trombone let's change a 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:27.329
 the tenor saxophone alto saxophone in 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.999
 our score within our 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.430
 score so some of you to what 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.740
 better they need to do this and we're going to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.790
 do it together the way we're going it 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.390
 to do is simply I have my 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.060
 music sheet 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.490
 I have it here we are going to open it 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.450
 came from 2012 there will be no 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.210
 problem is going to open without problems 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.570
 here we have it we are going to be a little bit 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.540
 larger 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.490
 perfect 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.860
 well we have tenor and trumpet remember 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.680
 that we want to add several things to 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.470
 add instruments the best way that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.650
 found doing it is within the score 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.090
 older we go to the windows with the series 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.240
 the list of instruments we go here to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:26.690
 look for the instrument that is to add 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.400
 instrument and let's go over here 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:34.240
 in the brass I'm going to give the trombone and he 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.300
 already added the trombone automatically 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.060
 let's now add wins and let's look 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.659
 the tall 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:48.869
 here he is and we will give him once and he 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:53.259
 is going to add the high ok in the score in the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.789
 order of the score I want to do it as the 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.580
 jazz band so that the two do not appear 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:02.409
 saxophones the trumpet the trombone piano 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.920
 low and drops 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:09.429
 we are going to close here and here we have 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.319
 our with our score is with 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.709
 score in Spanish 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.760
 bartz would be the scores in Spanish at 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.819
 Sometimes I will exchange those terms 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.749
 ok ok very easy 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.749
 very easy 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.300
 let's put this in concep made 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.100
 and I'm almost sure 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.240
 in many of the things are in unison 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.110
 and I was 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:56.610
 and well to move from tenor to high 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.520
 we are going to select all the tenor and a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.130
 trick to select all the tenor is 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:09.290
 selecting here out of the score one 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.290
 time and select all the measures in 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.390
 the score as you can see and now we have 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.290
 several ways of doing it one of the 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.490
 ways in the most common in mac or I started 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.819
 what is copy and paste on mac would be 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.269
 c command 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.290
 and then select here on the high and 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.110
 v command to paste 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.870
 I'm going to make a duet of that I'm going to go back to 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.629
 select here and I will teach from another 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.769
 way that is click on drive we are going to 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.769
 select here 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.210
 and you just look like when we put it 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.430
 up here it gets better a sign of 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:58.030
 more and we're going to put it there and it's ready 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:02.640
 copied equal now in the high 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.640
 how we want it to appear on the top 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.240
 okay 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.290
 very well 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.930
 and now we're just going to do what 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.150
 same trumpet trombone we are going to 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:28.360
 select everything in this case I'm going to 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.360
 make copy and now you see space 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.169
 and you see how I now have everything 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.210
 copied to the trombone there is a small 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.960
 trick that we are going to use that is 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:47.069
 using one of our numbers in 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.470
 this case the 8 to lower the octave of 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:54.139
 trombone I do not know if you saw when I did it 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:56.800
 with the 9 we raise an octave with the 8 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:02.330
 we go down an octave 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.789
 ok and in this case I'm going to lower the octave 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.460
 so that we are comfortable for the 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.069
 trombonist can touch and just 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.409
 we are doing are many things that 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:18.580
 are going to do unison to this rule ok well 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:20.770
 that this is the way to make a copy 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.909
 so in new instruments the same 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.430
 part that we already had 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:29.199
 if you need to do this inside your 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.960
 final is in this case the end is 2014 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.939
 well, you know what you're communicating
