00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
I was running low on ammo if I had

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
I was running low on ammo if I had
what's<00:01:19.710> called<00:01:19.770> dual<00:01:20.130> mags<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.700> probably<00:01:21.090> would

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
what's called dual mags I probably would

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.359 
what's called dual mags I probably would
have<00:01:21.390> ran<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> wave<00:01:22.170> at<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> situation<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.280> I

have ran a wave at the situation but I

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
have ran a wave at the situation but I
noticed<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.790> had<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> couple<00:01:24.270> bullets<00:01:24.509> left<00:01:24.840> I
