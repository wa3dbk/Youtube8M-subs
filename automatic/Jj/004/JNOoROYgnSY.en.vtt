00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to get rid of the notes when I built

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.070 
to get rid of the notes when I built
this<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.119> almost<00:01:27.240> tell<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.780> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
this thing I can almost tell you that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.230 
this thing I can almost tell you that
the<00:01:28.290> frame<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.799> already<00:01:29.220> prepared<00:01:30.000> for

the frame is already prepared for

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
the frame is already prepared for
metallic<00:01:30.689> coating<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> gold<00:01:31.710> frame<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.250> not

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
metallic coating so a gold frame is not

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.230 
metallic coating so a gold frame is not
a<00:01:32.579> matter<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.180> it's<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.450> matter<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.689> when
