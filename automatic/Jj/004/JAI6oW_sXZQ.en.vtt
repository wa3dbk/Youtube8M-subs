there<00:01:53.070> are<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.340> my<00:01:53.520> applications<00:01:55.430> now<00:01:56.430> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
there are all my applications now you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.080 
there are all my applications now you
can<00:01:57.540> leave<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.530> see<00:01:58.740> that

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
can leave it as is you see that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
can leave it as is you see that
alphabetically<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> first<00:02:00.479> application<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
alphabetically the first application is

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.399 
alphabetically the first application is
the<00:02:02.490> address<00:02:02.939> book<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.509> that's<00:02:03.810> why<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.079> get

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the address book so that's why you get

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.190 
the address book so that's why you get
this<00:02:04.619> address<00:02:05.219> book<00:02:05.729> icon<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.360> don't<00:02:07.049> really

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
this address book icon I don't really

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.850 
this address book icon I don't really
like<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.550> because<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.989> me<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.349> doesn't

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
like that because to me it doesn't

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.380 
like that because to me it doesn't
you<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.280> irrelevant<00:02:11.610> which<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you know it's irrelevant which is the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.820 
you know it's irrelevant which is the
first<00:02:12.690> one<00:02:12.930> alphabetically

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
first one alphabetically
