then tell the spectator that you made a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.670 
then tell the spectator that you made a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
that they randomly stopped at earlier on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.690 
that they randomly stopped at earlier on
and<00:01:57.270> that's<00:01:57.780> knock<00:01:58.079> them<00:01:58.229> dead

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.640 

okay<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:01.760> here's<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.150> exposure<00:02:02.659> on<00:02:03.110> my

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
okay so here's the exposure on my

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.130 
okay so here's the exposure on my
variation<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.610> knock<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.000> dead<00:02:05.180> one<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.050> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
variation of knock and dead one of the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.980 
variation of knock and dead one of the
things<00:02:06.320> about<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:08.270> it's<00:02:08.479> one<00:02:08.959> of

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
things about this is that it's one of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.660 
things about this is that it's one of
those<00:02:09.229> tricks<00:02:09.649> where<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:09.950> have<00:02:10.220> more<00:02:10.520> than

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
those tricks where you have more than

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.830 
those tricks where you have more than
one<00:02:10.970> outcome<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:13.130> thing<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:14.030> three

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
one outcome and the thing is is three

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.140 
one outcome and the thing is is three
different<00:02:15.410> cards<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.400> can<00:02:16.580> force<00:02:16.820> onto<00:02:17.060> a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
different cards you can force onto a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.800 
different cards you can force onto a
spectator<00:02:17.720> now<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.770> saw<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.400> one<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.390> did

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
spectator now you saw the one that I did

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.380 
spectator now you saw the one that I did
in<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.050> routine<00:02:21.590> was<00:02:22.340> where<00:02:22.580> they<00:02:22.760> stopped<00:02:23.150> at

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
in the routine was where they stopped at

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.930 
in the routine was where they stopped at
the<00:02:23.540> ten<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.170> clubs<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.709> there<00:02:25.430> was<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> red

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
the ten of clubs and there was a red

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.630 
the ten of clubs and there was a red
card<00:02:26.300> near<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.720> bottom<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.800> pack<00:02:28.040> which

happened<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.120> be<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.810> same<00:02:30.110> one<00:02:31.060> now

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
happened to be the same one now

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.600 
happened to be the same one now
let<00:02:33.680> me<00:02:33.770> show<00:02:33.980> you<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.190> pack<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:36.770> pack<00:02:36.980> itself

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
let me show you the pack the pack itself

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.220 
let me show you the pack the pack itself
is<00:02:38.030> stacked<00:02:38.950> what<00:02:39.950> happens<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.810> deal<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
is stacked what happens is if I deal the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.870 
is stacked what happens is if I deal the
cards<00:02:42.620> down<00:02:42.910> these<00:02:43.910> are<00:02:43.970> just<00:02:44.450> regular<00:02:44.810> cards

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
cards down these are just regular cards

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.009 
cards down these are just regular cards
now<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:46.940> way<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.360> I've<00:02:47.450> got<00:02:47.690> them<00:02:47.870> I've<00:02:47.989> got

now the way that I've got them I've got
about<00:02:48.200> ten<00:02:48.680> playing<00:02:49.100> cards<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.670> are<00:02:49.760> just

a four of diamonds now if I said stop at

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.910 
a four of diamonds now if I said stop at
that<00:03:16.549> point<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.720> tricks<00:03:18.019> over<00:03:18.500> you've

that point the tricks over you've

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
that point the tricks over you've
guessed<00:03:19.220> right

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
guessed right

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.259 
guessed right
if<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:21.230> spectator<00:03:21.799> deals<00:03:22.220> another<00:03:22.910> card

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
if the spectator deals another card

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.400 
if the spectator deals another card
that's<00:03:23.570> just<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.989> random<00:03:24.530> card<00:03:25.810> if<00:03:26.810> they<00:03:27.140> said

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
that's just a random card if they said

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.880 
that's just a random card if they said
stop<00:03:27.860> there<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:29.180> take<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.570> next<00:03:30.230> card<00:03:30.680> that

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
stop there you take the next card that

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.100 
stop there you take the next card that
they<00:03:31.010> haven't<00:03:31.220> seen<00:03:31.670> because<00:03:32.269> that's<00:03:32.840> my

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
they haven't seen because that's my

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.770 
they haven't seen because that's my
second<00:03:33.709> force<00:03:34.070> card<00:03:34.430> which<00:03:34.970> is<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.180> seven<00:03:35.660> of

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
second force card which is a seven of

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:43.479 
second force card which is a seven of
Hearts<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:40.370> next<00:03:40.760> card<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:42.500> random<00:03:43.160> card

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
Hearts the next card is a random card

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.509 
Hearts the next card is a random card
and<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.510> next<00:03:44.959> card<00:03:45.260> as<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.829> saw<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.430> the

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
and the next card as you saw in the

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.110 
and the next card as you saw in the
routine<00:03:47.440> was<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:49.640> ten<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.209> clubs<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.940> way

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
routine was the ten of clubs and the way

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.620 
routine was the ten of clubs and the way
this<00:03:53.299> works<00:03:53.690> is<00:03:54.049> that<00:03:54.110> you<00:03:54.260> alternate<00:03:55.630> the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
this works is that you alternate the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.509 
this works is that you alternate the
cards<00:03:57.019> because<00:03:57.170> if<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.620> deal<00:03:57.890> with<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.160> mixed

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
cards because if I deal with the mixed

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.509 
cards because if I deal with the mixed
car<00:03:58.730> that's<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.150> random<00:03:59.630> card<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.739> next<00:04:01.220> card

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
car that's a random card the next card

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.030 
car that's a random card the next card
is<00:04:01.760> another<00:04:02.420> four<00:04:02.870> of<00:04:03.079> diamonds<00:04:03.320> remember

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
is another four of diamonds remember

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.930 
is another four of diamonds remember
we've<00:04:04.190> already<00:04:04.489> had<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.060> four<00:04:05.359> diamonds<00:04:05.720> here

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
we've already had the four diamonds here

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.930 
we've already had the four diamonds here
it's<00:04:07.940> now<00:04:08.209> appeared<00:04:08.720> again<00:04:09.430> then<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.640> have

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
it's now appeared again then you have

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.220 
it's now appeared again then you have
any<00:04:11.269> card

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
any card

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.800 
any card
then<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.159> second<00:04:13.700> false<00:04:13.970> card<00:04:14.360> again

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
then the second false card again

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.930 
then the second false card again
seven-of-hearts<00:04:15.560> you've<00:04:16.130> already<00:04:16.310> seen<00:04:16.669> that

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
seven-of-hearts you've already seen that

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.960 
seven-of-hearts you've already seen that
then<00:04:17.870> an<00:04:18.079> ordinary<00:04:18.680> card<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.370> then<00:04:19.549> another

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
then an ordinary card and then another

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.840 
then an ordinary card and then another
ten<00:04:20.329> now<00:04:21.049> I<00:04:21.079> tend<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.590> do<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.829> just<00:04:22.100> twice

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
ten now I tend to do it just twice

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.629 
ten now I tend to do it just twice
repeated<00:04:23.690> those<00:04:24.410> cards<00:04:24.860> but<00:04:25.040> you<00:04:25.160> can<00:04:25.400> have

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
repeated those cards but you can have

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.530 
repeated those cards but you can have
another<00:04:26.060> set<00:04:26.419> as<00:04:26.540> well<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.910> let's<00:04:29.090> see<00:04:29.330> what

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
another set as well so let's see what

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.620 
another set as well so let's see what
would<00:04:29.630> have<00:04:29.810> happened<00:04:30.380> if<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:31.370> spectator<00:04:31.880> had

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
would have happened if the spectator had

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.879 
would have happened if the spectator had
chosen<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.620> four<00:04:33.979> of<00:04:34.250> diamonds<00:04:35.500> then<00:04:36.500> the

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
chosen the four of diamonds then the

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.780 
chosen the four of diamonds then the
prediction<00:04:37.610> is<00:04:37.820> not<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.660> red-backed<00:04:39.320> card<00:04:39.790> so

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
prediction is not the red-backed card so

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.300 
prediction is not the red-backed card so
you<00:04:40.850> don't<00:04:41.479> mention<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.410> at<00:04:42.530> all<00:04:42.740> what<00:04:43.130> you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
you don't mention that at all what you

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.719 
you don't mention that at all what you
say<00:04:43.610> is<00:04:43.850> on<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.330> table<00:04:44.960> has<00:04:45.350> been<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.650> joker<00:04:45.979> if

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
say is on the table has been of joker if

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.670 
say is on the table has been of joker if
you<00:04:47.539> pick<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.960> joker<00:04:48.410> up<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:49.160> turn<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.270> over

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
you pick the joker up and turn it over

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.070 
you pick the joker up and turn it over
you'll<00:04:51.680> see<00:04:52.100> that<00:04:52.729> there's<00:04:53.090> my<00:04:53.389> prediction

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
you'll see that there's my prediction

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.860 
you'll see that there's my prediction
that<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:54.740> would<00:04:55.220> choose<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:56.180> four<00:04:56.600> of

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
that you would choose the four of

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:04.240 
that you would choose the four of
diamonds<00:04:58.210> okay<00:05:01.360> so<00:05:02.360> what<00:05:02.570> happens<00:05:03.110> when<00:05:04.039> they

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
diamonds okay so what happens when they

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.810 
diamonds okay so what happens when they
carry<00:05:04.610> on<00:05:04.789> dealing<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.510> they<00:05:05.960> stopped<00:05:06.500> on<00:05:06.820> the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
carry on dealing and they stopped on the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.560 
carry on dealing and they stopped on the
seven<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.419> Hearts<00:05:09.380> if<00:05:10.310> they<00:05:10.580> chose<00:05:10.850> a<00:05:10.910> set<00:05:11.360> of

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
seven of Hearts if they chose a set of

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.090 
seven of Hearts if they chose a set of
hearts<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:12.050> say<00:05:12.289> do<00:05:12.530> you<00:05:12.560> know<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.830> funny

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
hearts you say do you know the funny

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.969 
hearts you say do you know the funny
thing<00:05:13.220> is<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:13.820> that<00:05:14.630> I<00:05:14.780> made<00:05:15.110> a<00:05:15.139> prediction<00:05:15.380> of

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
thing is is that I made a prediction of

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.200 
thing is is that I made a prediction of
your<00:05:16.729> card<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.389> it's<00:05:17.780> in<00:05:17.960> the<00:05:18.080> box<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.970> when

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
your card and it's in the box and when

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.760 
your card and it's in the box and when
you<00:05:20.330> open<00:05:20.720> up<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:21.050> say<00:05:21.289> in<00:05:21.590> here<00:05:21.919> is<00:05:21.950> your<00:05:22.400> card

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.430 

when<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:27.919> turn<00:05:28.160> it<00:05:28.310> over<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.820> is<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.990> seven<00:05:30.320> of

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
when you turn it over it is the seven of

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.260 
when you turn it over it is the seven of
Hearts<00:05:30.770> now<00:05:30.950> because<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.370> didn't<00:05:31.729> have<00:05:31.880> a<00:05:31.910> seven

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
Hearts now because I didn't have a seven

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.570 
Hearts now because I didn't have a seven
of<00:05:32.389> hearts<00:05:32.750> available<00:05:32.960> I've<00:05:33.620> used<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.310> seven

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
of hearts available I've used the seven

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.600 
of hearts available I've used the seven
diamonds<00:05:34.820> but<00:05:35.090> you<00:05:35.180> get<00:05:35.330> the<00:05:35.450> idea<00:05:36.550> there<00:05:37.550> are

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
diamonds but you get the idea there are

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.650 
diamonds but you get the idea there are
your<00:05:37.849> three<00:05:37.960> guesses<00:05:38.960> pi<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.430> seven<00:05:40.880> the

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
your three guesses pi the the seven the

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.250 
your three guesses pi the the seven the
four<00:05:42.010> or<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.700> read-back<00:05:44.060> card<00:05:44.419> is<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.960> ten

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
four or the read-back card is the ten

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.580 
four or the read-back card is the ten
and<00:05:45.500> it's<00:05:46.070> as<00:05:46.160> simple<00:05:46.190> as<00:05:46.639> that<00:05:46.700> the<00:05:47.590> stacking

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
and it's as simple as that the stacking

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.980 
and it's as simple as that the stacking
system<00:05:49.190> that<00:05:49.550> knock'em<00:05:50.000> dead<00:05:50.030> uses<00:05:50.810> the

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
system that knock'em dead uses the

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.930 
system that knock'em dead uses the
commercial<00:05:51.530> routine<00:05:51.919> is<00:05:52.160> not<00:05:52.460> new<00:05:52.669> it's<00:05:52.880> been

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
commercial routine is not new it's been

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.790 
commercial routine is not new it's been
around<00:05:53.090> years<00:05:53.810> I've<00:05:54.020> got<00:05:54.200> it<00:05:54.289> a<00:05:54.380> couple<00:05:54.680> of

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
around years I've got it a couple of

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
nothing special but it's a great way of

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.680 
nothing special but it's a great way of
forcing<00:06:00.080> a<00:06:00.380> card
