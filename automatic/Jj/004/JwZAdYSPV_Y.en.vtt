 Hi, friends, noa dotcom 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.599
 Welcome to cooking minutes with max 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.519
 we are from the higher institute 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.080
 Mariano Moreno and today we are going to 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.269
 prepare a pan de muerto in a way 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.990
 very easy and fast so that they can 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.990
 do from home 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.769
 i 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.080
 well let's start with the bread of 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.520
 dead what we are going to do is a 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.859
 source 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.530
 let's pour the flour on a table 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.440
 clean 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.710
 and as its name says it with the help of a 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.710
 bowl 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.869
 let's make a hole in the middle to 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.360
 put our ingredients and that is not 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.250
 come out 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.180
 ready now when we have what we 're going with 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.540
 to start is adding the yeast in the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.540
 center 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.690
 and some milk to dissolve it 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.700
 well for this helps us to the source 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.830
 so that the ingredients are maintained 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.220
 in the middle in all the outside 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.220
 let's put the sugar evenly 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.159
 and the salt 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.450
 what we are going to do is start 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.180
 to dilute the yeast with milk all 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.920
 with the hand that does not give them something to put 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.909
 hands to clear food the winner 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.280
 the very well 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.009
 but let's do this let's dissolve 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.460
 the yeast in the milk to be able 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.250
 add the games 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.840
 once we already live the yeast we go 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.840
 to add the eggs to the center too 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.290
 and the butter we have to draw 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.980
 to put it out is also going to be 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.980
 in pieces 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.340
 we're all going to put in pieces for 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.100
 outside remember that we are going to go 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.480
 mixing from the inside out by 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.260
 these reasons we want the fat 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.260
 be to the end 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.730
 to avoid heating the others and that 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.730
 Resist us in the preparation completely 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.150
 and ready we have our butter 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.020
 outside and now what we are going to do 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.780
 It is to carefully nipping 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.170
 of the banks to incorporate the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.050
 ingredients 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.050
 this is done to avoid lumps 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.740
 and so that our mass is a little more 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.740
 uniform 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.770
 ok once the mass already got a 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.230
 consistency a little more homogeneous it 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.510
 can put both hands and we are going to 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.450
 start kneading to incorporate well 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.100
 all the ingredients until leaving one 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.770
 very smooth dough 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.050
 ok once we knead for 8 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.880
 minutes and our mass has this 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.670
 firm consistency let's put it in 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.380
 a previously greased container and 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.790
 we have to let it rest 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.710
 let's let it sit until it's double 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.710
 its volume and we are going to cover it 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.959
 well once our beyond 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.209
 rest and it already inflates what we're going to do 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.209
 now they are individual portions 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.400
 let's start this mass 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.519
 I want six servings 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.519
 then let's divide it 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.800
 and we are going to split it 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.540
 the same size or the closest 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.370
 possible 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.740
 and each of these is going to form our 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.950
 bread of the dead 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.690
 with each of them 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.280
 let's go to those who have not stayed more 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.910
 we are going to cut a piece for you 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.740
 match in the end this will serve us 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.650
 to make our bones and the way 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.080
 of the calaverita let's take one and 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.140
 Let's make a roll with your hand like this 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.470
 we're just going to see the way 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.210
 round 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.740
 the hand has to go in this position not 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.660
 move it and only play the mass 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.000
 play until they get a bun 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.569
 with the way we all know bread 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.970
 of dead ready come you are already and with this 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:16.940
 mass that we cut we're going to cut a 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.940
 half piece let's lengthen 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.889
 and with the help of these three fingers 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.889
 let's make the shape of the bones 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.260
 and ready 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.320
 once it is like this it gets in this 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.630
 shape 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.770
 and we do the other 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:47.969
 and for our marble it did not reach us 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.889
 we saved another little ball 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.309
 and we are going to work it to make it look 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.309
 round 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.689
 once we are finished 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:02.480
 bread of the dead we have to move to a 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:04.220
 tray and we started to bake 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.990
 well once we repeat the 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.730
 procedure by the number of loaves of 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.090
 dead we want and the size that the 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.230
 let's do it's time to bake 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.880
 Grease the pan and put some 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.830
 flour and we're going to put it in the oven 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.270
 for more or less 15-20 minutes at a 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.270
 180 degree temperature 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.370
 ok the time has passed we are going to 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.370
 take out our bread of the dead 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.090
 we have to put it in a grid for 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.090
 put it to cool 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.800
 because there is a time when we already cooled a 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.750
 little bread let's put it on the plate 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.950
 where are we going to ride only us 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.310
 it needs to be varnished with a little 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.310
 Butter 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.839
 remember to always use brushes 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:02.729
 special for food to avoid 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:02.729
 strange flavors in our dishes 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.190
 and since it is well varnished with the 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.840
 Butter 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.840
 that will also give you a lot of flavor 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.450
 let's wait for it with a little sugar 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.270
 in this 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.150
 we have our bread of death 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:39.499
 this and other recipes you can more
