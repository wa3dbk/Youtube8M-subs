we need drink to Jack it up jack up the
car<00:00:20.160> right<00:00:20.789> here<00:00:21.800> good<00:00:22.800> idea<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> put<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.570> jack

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
car right here good idea to put a jack

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.630 
car right here good idea to put a jack
stand<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.380> case<00:00:25.590> put<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.920> 4<00:00:26.130> by<00:00:26.250> 4<00:00:26.460> block

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
stand or in this case put a 4 by 4 block

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.509 
stand or in this case put a 4 by 4 block
under<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.500> doing<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.890> passenger<00:00:29.310> side

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
under it doing it on the passenger side

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.450 
under it doing it on the passenger side
also<00:00:29.789> allows<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.359> oil<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.779> drain<00:00:30.810> better<00:00:31.460> out

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
also allows the oil to drain better out

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.420 
also allows the oil to drain better out
of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> drain<00:00:32.940> hole<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
of the drain hole so you can get the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.510 
of the drain hole so you can get the
maximum<00:00:35.610> amount<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.120> oil<00:00:36.239> out<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:37.520> down

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
maximum amount of oil out of it down

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
maximum amount of oil out of it down
here<00:00:39.320> we've<00:00:40.320> got<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.420> drain<00:00:42.420> plug<00:00:42.600> clip<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
here we've got the drain plug clip a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.549 
here we've got the drain plug clip a
little<00:00:43.590> white<00:00:43.890> sticker<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:45.180> there

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
in it when you remove the drain plug

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.090 
in it when you remove the drain plug
you'll<00:01:08.520> notice<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> inside<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.299> its<00:01:09.420> hollow<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
you'll notice the inside of its hollow I

you'll notice the inside of its hollow I
put<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> rare<00:01:11.369> earth<00:01:11.520> magnet<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.060> mine<00:01:12.290> so<00:01:13.290> it'll

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
put a rare earth magnet in mine so it'll

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.420 
put a rare earth magnet in mine so it'll
help<00:01:13.650> attract<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> iron<00:01:14.880> shavings<00:01:16.340> after<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
help attract the iron shavings after it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.340 
help attract the iron shavings after it
gets<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.970> normally<00:01:18.299> let<00:01:18.479> mine<00:01:18.689> drip<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.110> about

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
gets I normally let mine drip for about

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.310 
gets I normally let mine drip for about
an<00:01:20.220> hour<00:01:21.860> let's<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> maximum<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:24.320> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
an hour let's get the maximum on out and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.760 
an hour let's get the maximum on out and
then<00:01:25.560> up<00:01:25.680> top<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> take<00:01:28.259> loose

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this line here and this hose clamp right

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.580 
this line here and this hose clamp right
here<00:01:34.340> which<00:01:35.340> comes<00:01:35.520> off<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:36.290> this<00:01:37.290> hose

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
here which comes off of there this hose

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.359 
here which comes off of there this hose
here<00:01:37.619> pops<00:01:38.159> off<00:01:38.369> there<00:01:39.710> this<00:01:40.710> comes<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
here pops off there this comes up and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
bolts that hold the bottom of the air

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.249 
bolts that hold the bottom of the air
box<00:01:53.820> ten<00:01:54.390> millimeter<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.990> size<00:01:55.020> remove<00:01:55.799> those

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
box ten millimeter in size remove those

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.250 
box ten millimeter in size remove those
and<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.530> will<00:01:58.740> come<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.399> out

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.999 

enough<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.530> see<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.190> fill<00:02:05.910> plug<00:02:06.590> which<00:02:07.590> is

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
enough to see the fill plug which is

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.580 
enough to see the fill plug which is
right<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:12.450> will<00:02:12.750> take<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.990> 24

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
right here that will take a 24

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.500 
right here that will take a 24
millimeter<00:02:13.800> or<00:02:14.370> fifteen<00:02:14.970> sixteenths<00:02:15.920> socket

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
millimeter or fifteen sixteenths socket

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.470 
millimeter or fifteen sixteenths socket
take<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:21.680> there's<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.950> hole<00:02:23.270> just<00:02:24.270> use

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
take it out there's the hole just use

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.450 
take it out there's the hole just use
like<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.690> regular<00:02:24.900> ATL<00:02:25.500> funnel<00:02:25.860> threads<00:02:26.310> in

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
like a regular ATL funnel threads in

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.220 
like a regular ATL funnel threads in
there<00:02:26.580> real<00:02:26.760> nice<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.890> fill<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> up<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.840> this

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
there real nice to fill it up and this

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.990 
there real nice to fill it up and this
is<00:02:31.380> probably<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:32.600> indentation<00:02:34.670> ball<00:02:35.670> bearing

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
is probably the indentation ball bearing

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.690 
is probably the indentation ball bearing
for<00:02:37.580> hold<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:39.240> gear<00:02:39.570> oh<00:02:39.630> yes<00:02:40.520> that's<00:02:41.520> where

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
for hold it in gear oh yes that's where

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.310 
for hold it in gear oh yes that's where
you<00:02:41.760> fill<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> up<00:02:42.180> from<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:44.959> then<00:02:45.959> just

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
you fill it up from and then just
