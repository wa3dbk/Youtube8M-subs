00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.200
 good morning to all the friends of the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.509
 hyundai club italy 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.429
 today we make a video a short video 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.349
 presentation of this new accessory 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.990
 mounted on the machine 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.640
 it is a tablet a normalissimo 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 samsung galaxy tab 7 inch combined with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 this cover this shell that is found 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.060
 between on ebay at a cost of 50 60 euros per 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.410
 which a fairly modest cost in mine 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.529
 case was facilitated by having 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.559
 already at home the tablet I was not using 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.890
 so actually really console 50 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.320
 60 55 euros in my case I created this 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.640
 this apparatus that I consider extremely 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 functional the tablet was connected 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.010
 internally the connector of the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.010
 charging and output and audio output with 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.210
 the 3.5 inch jack that comes that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.699
 they enter inside the dashboard 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.800
 they pass from here to this point and go 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.219
 enter the auxiliary socket of the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.170
 car radio battery and from the socket 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.049
 cigarette lighter for charging in this 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.000
 so there are no children but the is seen 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.100
 connection quite enough 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.490
 simple for those like me not capable 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 of who knows what operations the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.100
 electric and in this way precisely the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.040
 tablet looks neat in order 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.420
 without cables in the middle 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.740
 in detail the tablet was 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.330
 programmed with a program that is 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.810
 call tasker that allows you to set 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.310
 some some actions in my case have it 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.299
 set up to behave like a 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.650
 other audio 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.430
 in a few words I give you an example 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.180
 when we give power to the car e 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.729
 so we are set in motion 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.470
 automatically he turns on display ago 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.770
 start the song from where 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.689
 we had arrived also activates me 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.640
 bluetooth wifi connections for 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.409
 connect to other devices 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.150
 while the moment I go to 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.370
 turn off the machine 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.540
 you see that after a few moments the tablet 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.060
 We put the song in standby mode 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.520
 and behave like a real one 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.720
 car radio and all having android 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.759
 we have all possible applications 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.470
 then I for example above here have 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.480
 set a home screen with a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.650
 in fact nice logs that I say 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.780
 hyundai logo programs more than 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.060
 faster than faster use on the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.209
 reader navigator sidebar 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.989
 music that is going in the background 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.510
 then interesting application on 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.480
 done that in wifi mode with a 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.160
 phone set in router mode 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.310
 you can easily have internet 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.590
 also on the tablet in this case 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.660
 from here you can now set the speed here 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.970
 maybe it will not be excessive because I am one 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.110
 area where it does not take but for example 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.000
 see we have internet 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.010
 we naturally have internet and therefore 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 we have all the applications 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.620
 we support the internet we can have 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.519
 google maps use as google navigator 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.220
 maps 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:05.030
 if we find ourselves well we have 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.030
 good coverage on Internet speech 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.319
 you have seen it you can connect all the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.239
 download applications and anything else 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.340
 I'm obviously being an android and 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.500
 video 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.140
 and music photos and everything there 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.450
 another interesting thing is this 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.099
 application that is called talk I have to 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.819
 say quite useless though can be 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.459
 interesting to have on the display of 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.379
 machine a whole series of data that the 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.230
 machine that the android device 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.879
 valle zero directly through 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.299
 bluetooth connection with this 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.980
 device connected to the port each of 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.690
 car diagnosis interface e 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.390
 here you can go and get some 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.390
 information there are a whole range of 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.959
 sensors that can be evaluated here 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.400
 there was an infinite music player 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.860
 standard however being connected to 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.690
 internet just that of the core router 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.510
 cell phone you can also use 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.190
 for example play music that allows you 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.810
 in the home computer to upload all 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.299
 the songs you want to listen to then in 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.019
 cloud wherever you are with the various 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.019
 associated devices 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.560
 evaluations and then 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.910
 my opinion to this the object in 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.610
 plastic and made in plastic 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.440
 certainly cheaper than the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.240
 shell to the shell to the lid there 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.490
 was before but I must say that you notice 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.950
 holding it in your hand and put them fumbling 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.940
 side by side to the view yes 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:41.090
 the position is very similar to me for me 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.010
 excellent not cluttered does not clutter the 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.960
 in my case, visual aids in this case 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.140
 paltry cost because put one 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.820
 car radio with navigator to have a 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.740
 good product and you had to leave at least 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.000
 from 400 to 500 euros 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.620
 in this case with 50 55 euros 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.590
 I raised my problem again but because already in 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.670
 possession of the tablet anyway 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.290
 it costs 200 euros 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.150
 this tablet in detail for which 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.150
 let's say it would have been the 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.280
 250 euro pressure that allows 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.320
 keep the original car radio for 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.080
 me is a great product is equipped with a 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.290
 great bluetooth an excellent system 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.740
 handsfree that parrot that I was sorry 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.099
 a little lose in 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.840
 the favor of a Chinese car radio that 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.280
 you can take maybe well but also but 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.270
 also bad you have no and not ai 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.750
 guarantees in this case I have been 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.860
 quiet because I kept 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.970
 the car radio I'm happy with 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.400
 allowing me to take advantage of this too 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.069
 space that the readers of the forum that I 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.780
 have a little following will have seen was a 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.020
 problem that bothered me the fact 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.500
 it was this bad this advantage 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.229
 environment 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.319
 so much so that it was actually designed 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.180
 aftermarket this cover a 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:00.000
 demonstration of the fact that there was one 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:03.539
 project gap in this area of ​​the 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.639
 machine so I exploited exploited it 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.349
 empty space implemented functions 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.440
 plus he didn't take anything away from what he did 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.050
 there was already aesthetics I like very much like 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.880
 you will have understood as I have already said 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.919
 whoever prefers is clearly subjective 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.740
 maybe a clean line for in favor of 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.120
 a car radio with display 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.069
 I allow myself a joke in this case 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.990
 you could even do the double 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.060
 operation to have a double display for 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.990
 technology lovers like me who 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.930
 they want to exaggerate boldly 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.159
 for now I salute you this is all there 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.080
 we will see when updates on 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:39.500
 some apps that I'm going to 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.500
 Pine tree
