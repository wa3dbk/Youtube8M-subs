kilometer and a half of working from

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.480 
kilometer and a half of working from
kiowa<00:05:50.180> we<00:05:50.479> arrived<00:05:50.900> at<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.289> equator<00:05:51.620> one<00:05:52.370> of

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
kiowa we arrived at the equator one of

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.460 
kiowa we arrived at the equator one of
the<00:05:52.610> places<00:05:52.880> Levison<00:05:53.539> could<00:05:53.750> not<00:05:53.930> wait<00:05:54.260> to<00:05:54.289> see

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
the places Levison could not wait to see

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.040 
the places Levison could not wait to see
using<00:05:56.470> his<00:05:56.680> GPS<00:05:57.190> machine<00:05:57.699> however<00:05:58.050> Levison

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
using his GPS machine however Levison

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.990 
using his GPS machine however Levison
detected<00:05:59.590> that<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.949> line<00:06:00.130> where<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.580> equator

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
detected that the line where the equator

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.589 
detected that the line where the equator
point<00:06:01.270> was<00:06:01.479> built<00:06:01.870> is<00:06:02.380> not<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:03.009> actual<00:06:03.520> one

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
point was built is not the actual one

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.540 
point was built is not the actual one
okay<00:06:04.599> so<00:06:04.630> my<00:06:04.900> GPS<00:06:05.349> says<00:06:05.380> that<00:06:05.889> the<00:06:06.009> equator<00:06:06.340> is

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
okay so my GPS says that the equator is

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.150 
okay so my GPS says that the equator is
actually<00:06:06.910> right<00:06:07.240> here<00:06:07.479> where<00:06:07.630> I'm<00:06:07.750> standing

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 
actually right here where I'm standing

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.770 
actually right here where I'm standing
but<00:06:09.160> the<00:06:09.220> line<00:06:09.490> is<00:06:09.520> a<00:06:09.819> few<00:06:10.120> meters<00:06:10.419> over<00:06:10.660> there

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
but the line is a few meters over there

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.870 
but the line is a few meters over there
it's<00:06:10.990> like<00:06:11.050> maybe<00:06:11.410> eight<00:06:12.130> or<00:06:12.370> nine<00:06:12.520> meters

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
it's like maybe eight or nine meters
