oil<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.290> vitamin<00:01:58.440> E<00:01:58.890> oil<00:01:59.100> definitely<00:01:59.820> helped

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
oil and vitamin E oil definitely helped

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.960 
oil and vitamin E oil definitely helped
with<00:02:00.360> my<00:02:00.600> lashes<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.740> next<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.280> would<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.520> my

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
with my lashes the next up would be my

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.450 
with my lashes the next up would be my
nails<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:04.230> had<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.620> cut<00:02:04.800> my<00:02:04.950> nails<00:02:04.980> quite<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
nails I have had to cut my nails quite a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.090 
nails I have had to cut my nails quite a
bit<00:02:05.760> because<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.690> noticed<00:02:07.650> that<00:02:07.770> my<00:02:07.920> nails

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
bit because I noticed that my nails

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.130 
bit because I noticed that my nails
started<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> grow<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:09.030> lot<00:02:09.270> longer<00:02:09.510> and<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.930> lot

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
started to grow a lot longer and a lot

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.890 
started to grow a lot longer and a lot
quicker<00:02:10.410> than<00:02:11.100> they<00:02:11.280> used<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.760> before<00:02:12.000> my

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
quicker than they used to before my

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.380 
quicker than they used to before my
major<00:02:13.260> problem<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.670> sides<00:02:15.030> were

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
major problem was that the sides were

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.810 
major problem was that the sides were
always<00:02:15.600> really<00:02:16.080> really<00:02:16.380> weak<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:17.790> I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
always really really weak and what I

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.910 
always really really weak and what I
noticed<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:18.930> probably<00:02:19.140> my<00:02:19.680> own

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
noticed is that it's probably my own

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.670 
noticed is that it's probably my own
fault<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.490> because<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.240> my<00:02:21.540> nails<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.500> it's

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
fault not because of my nails but it's

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.160 
fault not because of my nails but it's
probably<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.580> how<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.090> used<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.570> file

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
probably because of how I used to file

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.250 
probably because of how I used to file
my<00:02:25.440> nails<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.460> used<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.060> use<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.510> metal<00:02:27.960> file

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
my nails now I used to use a metal file

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.960 
my nails now I used to use a metal file
you<00:02:28.770> know<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.010> ones<00:02:29.190> which<00:02:29.340> had<00:02:29.550> sort<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.820> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
you know the ones which had sort of the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.270 
you know the ones which had sort of the
metal<00:02:30.330> bit<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.230> file<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> rubber

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
metal bit on the file and like a rubber

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.030 
metal bit on the file and like a rubber
bit<00:02:32.490> at<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.030> ends<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:34.320> way<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.530> used<00:02:34.860> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
bit at the ends and the way I used to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.710 
bit at the ends and the way I used to
file<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.430> nails<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.940> would<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.240> go<00:02:36.390> back

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
file my nails is I would just go back

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.260 
file my nails is I would just go back
and<00:02:36.840> forth<00:02:37.110> with<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.950> filing<00:02:38.370> which<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.940> wrong

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
and forth with the filing which is wrong

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.390 
and forth with the filing which is wrong
you're<00:02:39.960> supposed<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.500> only<00:02:40.710> go<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.100> one

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
you're supposed to only go in one

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.340 
you're supposed to only go in one
direction<00:02:41.580> when<00:02:42.270> you're<00:02:42.450> filing<00:02:42.750> your<00:02:42.960> nails

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
direction when you're filing your nails

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.010 
direction when you're filing your nails
so<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.650> was<00:02:43.920> doing<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.340> incorrectly<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.330> so

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
so I was doing that incorrectly and so

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.810 
so I was doing that incorrectly and so
the<00:02:46.170> size<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.709> my<00:02:46.860> nails<00:02:47.070> became<00:02:47.490> really

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
the size of my nails became really

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.300 
the size of my nails became really
really<00:02:47.940> weak<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:48.780> they<00:02:49.410> would<00:02:49.560> split<00:02:50.010> almost

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
really weak and they would split almost

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.760 
really weak and they would split almost
like<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.850> would<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.120> layers<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.900> my<00:02:52.200> nails<00:02:52.410> so

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
like I would have layers on my nails so

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.229 
like I would have layers on my nails so
what<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.790> decided<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.670> bought<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.940> new

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
what I decided to do is I bought a new

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.550 
what I decided to do is I bought a new
file<00:02:59.000> looks<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.239> this

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.800 

and<00:03:04.080> it's<00:03:05.080> called<00:03:05.490> cream<00:03:06.490> ooh<00:03:06.670> yes

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
and it's called cream ooh yes

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.050 
and it's called cream ooh yes
and<00:03:08.100> it's<00:03:09.100> made<00:03:09.340> out<00:03:09.520> of<00:03:09.550> glass<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.760> really

love this file now for me I think the
metal<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:16.030> wasn't<00:03:16.360> working<00:03:16.720> for<00:03:16.750> me<00:03:16.930> before

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
metal just wasn't working for me before

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.710 
metal just wasn't working for me before
as<00:03:17.680> well<00:03:17.920> as<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.430> fact<00:03:18.670> of<00:03:18.820> how<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.060> was<00:03:19.360> filing

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
as well as the fact of how I was filing

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.199 
as well as the fact of how I was filing
my<00:03:20.020> nails<00:03:20.050> wasn't<00:03:20.650> helping<00:03:20.980> so<00:03:21.670> what<00:03:22.090> I've

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
my nails wasn't helping so what I've

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.970 
my nails wasn't helping so what I've
done<00:03:22.420> it's<00:03:22.600> like<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.870> said<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.140> bought<00:03:23.410> this<00:03:23.680> and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
done it's like I said I bought this and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.370 
done it's like I said I bought this and
I<00:03:24.130> started<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.730> farm<00:03:24.940> my<00:03:25.120> nails<00:03:25.330> just<00:03:25.630> in<00:03:26.170> one

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
I started to farm my nails just in one

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.750 
I started to farm my nails just in one
direction<00:03:26.560> which<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.340> what<00:03:27.490> you're<00:03:27.610> supposed

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
direction which is what you're supposed

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.000 
direction which is what you're supposed
to<00:03:28.090> do<00:03:28.300> and<00:03:28.510> that<00:03:28.780> has<00:03:28.990> really<00:03:29.290> helped<00:03:29.770> as<00:03:29.950> well

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
to do and that has really helped as well

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.880 
to do and that has really helped as well
so<00:03:30.580> along<00:03:31.030> with<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.750> coconut<00:03:32.410> oil<00:03:32.560> and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
so along with the coconut oil and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.370 
so along with the coconut oil and
vitamin<00:03:32.980> E<00:03:33.400> oil<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.390> correct<00:03:34.720> file<00:03:35.080> I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
vitamin E oil and the correct file I

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.470 
vitamin E oil and the correct file I
have<00:03:35.800> seen<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.070> big<00:03:36.340> difference<00:03:36.520> in<00:03:37.000> my<00:03:37.239> nails

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
have seen a big difference in my nails

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.010 
have seen a big difference in my nails
now<00:03:37.900> if<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.320> do<00:03:38.500> suffer<00:03:38.800> from<00:03:38.980> brittle<00:03:39.640> nails

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
now if you do suffer from brittle nails

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.110 
now if you do suffer from brittle nails
I<00:03:41.020> will<00:03:41.560> say<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:42.100> it's<00:03:42.310> not<00:03:42.520> going<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:43.000> be

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
I will say that it's not going to be

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.180 
I will say that it's not going to be
only<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.630> coconut<00:03:44.110> oil<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.440> will<00:03:44.650> help<00:03:44.890> it's

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
only the coconut oil that will help it's

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.460 
only the coconut oil that will help it's
probably<00:03:45.880> your<00:03:46.060> diet<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.810> need<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.320> look

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
probably your diet so you need to look

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.890 
probably your diet so you need to look
at<00:03:47.650> what<00:03:47.890> you're<00:03:48.100> eating<00:03:48.310> because<00:03:49.180> what

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
at what you're eating because what

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
then all of that sort of contribute

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.910 
then all of that sort of contribute
towards<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.540> health<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.930> your<00:04:02.080> nails<00:04:02.140> but<00:04:02.890> I

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
towards the health of your nails but I

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.370 
towards the health of your nails but I
can<00:04:03.220> say<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.700> coconut<00:04:04.060> oil<00:04:04.300> definitely<00:04:05.170> did

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
can say that coconut oil definitely did

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.520 
can say that coconut oil definitely did
help<00:04:05.620> me<00:04:05.950> grow<00:04:06.370> longer<00:04:07.120> nails<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.810> then<00:04:08.320> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
help me grow longer nails and then the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.340 
help me grow longer nails and then the
last<00:04:08.739> was<00:04:09.070> from<00:04:09.340> my<00:04:09.459> brows<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.269> my<00:04:11.049> brows<00:04:11.320> and

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
last was from my brows and my brows and

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.280 
last was from my brows and my brows and
I<00:04:11.980> have<00:04:12.250> this<00:04:12.489> love-hate<00:04:13.090> relationship<00:04:13.989> I

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
I have this love-hate relationship I

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.820 
I have this love-hate relationship I
have<00:04:15.040> naturally<00:04:15.280> quite<00:04:15.970> thin<00:04:16.359> brows<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:17.560> I

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
have naturally quite thin brows and I

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.949 
have naturally quite thin brows and I
used<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.160> go<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.430> get<00:04:18.549> them<00:04:18.760> threaded<00:04:19.330> quite<00:04:19.930> a

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
used to go and get them threaded quite a

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.620 
used to go and get them threaded quite a
bit<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.799> think<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.310> because<00:04:21.729> of<00:04:22.000> all<00:04:22.450> the

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
bit and I think that because of all the

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.570 
bit and I think that because of all the
threading<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.290> then<00:04:23.470> when<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:23.770> was<00:04:24.010> home<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.430> of

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
threading and then when I was home I of

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.310 
threading and then when I was home I of
course<00:04:24.790> would<00:04:25.000> use<00:04:25.210> my<00:04:25.390> tweezers<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:26.050> pluck

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
course would use my tweezers and pluck

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.650 
course would use my tweezers and pluck
sort<00:04:26.950> of<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.190> random<00:04:27.669> things<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.419> were

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
sort of the random things that were

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.719 
sort of the random things that were
growing<00:04:29.110> all<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.650> that<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.830> think<00:04:29.950> contributed

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
growing all of that I think contributed

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.340 
growing all of that I think contributed
to<00:04:30.820> having<00:04:31.120> even<00:04:31.450> thinner<00:04:31.720> brows<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.260> I

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
to having even thinner brows and I

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.010 
to having even thinner brows and I
normally<00:04:32.860> would<00:04:33.010> have<00:04:33.310> so<00:04:33.790> I<00:04:34.060> decided<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.630> use

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
normally would have so I decided to use

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.260 
normally would have so I decided to use
coconut<00:04:35.440> oil<00:04:35.770> for<00:04:35.979> my<00:04:36.250> brows<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.520> hopefully

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
coconut oil for my brows to hopefully

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.909 
coconut oil for my brows to hopefully
just<00:04:37.479> get<00:04:37.630> them<00:04:37.870> to<00:04:37.990> be<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.140> little<00:04:38.380> bit<00:04:38.620> thicker

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
just get them to be a little bit thicker

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.030 
just get them to be a little bit thicker
and<00:04:39.280> what<00:04:40.090> I'm<00:04:40.210> doing<00:04:40.630> at<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.930> moment<00:04:41.110> is<00:04:41.500> I'm

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
and what I'm doing at the moment is I'm

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.250 
and what I'm doing at the moment is I'm
letting<00:04:42.490> my<00:04:42.610> eyebrows<00:04:43.030> grow<00:04:43.300> out<00:04:43.479> now<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:44.200> is

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
letting my eyebrows grow out now it is

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.380 
letting my eyebrows grow out now it is
not<00:04:44.470> exactly<00:04:44.890> fun<00:04:45.250> walking<00:04:45.550> around<00:04:46.060> with

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
not exactly fun walking around with

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.310 
not exactly fun walking around with
eyebrows<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:47.860> are<00:04:48.130> growing<00:04:48.700> sporadic<00:04:49.419> like

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
eyebrows that are growing sporadic like

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.070 
eyebrows that are growing sporadic like
random<00:04:50.979> bits<00:04:51.250> of<00:04:51.520> eyebrow<00:04:51.910> hairs<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.479> don't<00:04:52.780> my

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
random bits of eyebrow hairs I don't my

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.080 
random bits of eyebrow hairs I don't my
eyebrows<00:04:53.440> are<00:04:53.590> weird<00:04:53.890> I'll<00:04:54.010> get<00:04:54.310> brow<00:04:54.760> hairs

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
eyebrows are weird I'll get brow hairs

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.120 
eyebrows are weird I'll get brow hairs
that<00:04:55.210> are<00:04:55.270> sort<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.570> growing<00:04:56.320> over<00:04:56.590> here<00:04:56.919> and

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
that are sort of growing over here and

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.050 
that are sort of growing over here and
like<00:04:58.000> random<00:04:58.360> bits<00:04:58.750> up<00:04:59.260> top<00:04:59.710> so<00:04:59.740> I<00:05:00.490> try<00:05:01.030> and

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
like random bits up top so I try and

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.090 
like random bits up top so I try and
clean<00:05:01.600> off<00:05:01.810> you<00:05:02.020> know<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.380> really<00:05:02.620> really

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
clean off you know the really really

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.980 
clean off you know the really really
random<00:05:03.340> bits

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
random bits

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.170 
random bits
but<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.410> coconut<00:05:04.920> oil<00:05:05.220> really<00:05:05.430> did<00:05:05.670> help<00:05:05.850> for

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
but the coconut oil really did help for

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.150 
but the coconut oil really did help for
me<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:06.450> get<00:05:06.690> them<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.870> little<00:05:07.200> bit<00:05:07.350> thicker<00:05:07.680> I'm

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
me to get them a little bit thicker I'm

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.910 
me to get them a little bit thicker I'm
still<00:05:08.610> going<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:09.120> try<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:09.930> grow<00:05:10.110> them<00:05:10.350> out<00:05:10.620> and

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
still going to try and grow them out and

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.830 
still going to try and grow them out and
then<00:05:11.070> hopefully<00:05:11.310> have<00:05:11.640> a<00:05:12.030> little<00:05:12.390> bit<00:05:12.540> thicker

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
then hopefully have a little bit thicker

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.290 
then hopefully have a little bit thicker
brows<00:05:13.260> at<00:05:13.560> least<00:05:13.800> but<00:05:14.370> um<00:05:14.550> yes<00:05:14.760> this<00:05:14.940> is<00:05:15.120> what

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
brows at least but um yes this is what

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.700 
brows at least but um yes this is what
they<00:05:15.420> look<00:05:15.630> like<00:05:19.880> they<00:05:20.880> look<00:05:21.060> funky<00:05:21.470> okay<00:05:22.470> and

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
they look like they look funky okay and

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.420 
they look like they look funky okay and
my<00:05:22.950> pencil<00:05:23.550> skills<00:05:24.300> are<00:05:24.630> not<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.020> best<00:05:25.230> so<00:05:25.680> do

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
my pencil skills are not the best so do

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.610 
my pencil skills are not the best so do
not<00:05:26.610> follow<00:05:26.940> sort<00:05:27.420> of<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:27.840> know<00:05:27.870> how<00:05:28.200> my<00:05:28.350> brows

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
not follow sort of you know how my brows

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.860 
not follow sort of you know how my brows
look<00:05:28.950> because<00:05:29.700> I'm<00:05:30.060> not<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.450> best<00:05:30.660> example

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
look because I'm not the best example

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.290 
look because I'm not the best example
for<00:05:31.650> eyebrows<00:05:32.100> but<00:05:32.340> if<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:32.730> are<00:05:32.910> looking<00:05:33.180> to

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
for eyebrows but if you are looking to

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.120 
for eyebrows but if you are looking to
try<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:33.630> thicken<00:05:33.960> up<00:05:34.050> your<00:05:34.320> brows<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:34.860> would

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
try and thicken up your brows I would

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.520 
try and thicken up your brows I would
recommend<00:05:35.640> using<00:05:35.790> coconut<00:05:36.180> oil<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:36.870> possibly

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
recommend using coconut oil and possibly

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.860 
recommend using coconut oil and possibly
with<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:38.040> little<00:05:38.340> bit<00:05:38.460> of<00:05:38.550> vitamin<00:05:38.700> E<00:05:39.180> oil<00:05:39.420> for

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
with a little bit of vitamin E oil for
