00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.710 
so definitely a big difference in
quality<00:02:25.870> there's<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.560> lot<00:02:26.710> more<00:02:26.920> bass<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.720> of

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
quality there's a lot more bass and of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.060 
quality there's a lot more bass and of
course<00:02:28.960> we<00:02:29.110> can<00:02:29.260> turn<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.620> much<00:02:29.860> much

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
course we can turn it up much much

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.750 
course we can turn it up much much
louder<00:02:30.340> than<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.610> iPad<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.960> get<00:02:32.140> now<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:33.670> we

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
louder than the iPad can get now if we

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.160 
louder than the iPad can get now if we
want<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:33.970> connect<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.390> another<00:02:34.600> device<00:02:34.870> say

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
want to connect it to another device say

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.990 
want to connect it to another device say
my<00:02:35.320> phone<00:02:35.560> here<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.280> best<00:02:36.490> course<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.880> action

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000
