so<00:00:10.010> before<00:00:10.400> we<00:00:10.519> start<00:00:10.760> anything<00:00:11.090> on<00:00:11.330> the

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
so before we start anything on the

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.000 
so before we start anything on the
bleeding<00:00:11.780> procedure<00:00:12.139> we<00:00:12.410> need<00:00:12.590> to<00:00:12.680> make<00:00:12.830> sure

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
bleeding procedure we need to make sure

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.369 
bleeding procedure we need to make sure
the<00:00:13.160> master<00:00:13.490> cylinder<00:00:13.670> is<00:00:14.000> level<00:00:14.359> making<00:00:15.230> sure

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
the master cylinder is level making sure

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.349 
the master cylinder is level making sure
that<00:00:15.559> we<00:00:15.650> know<00:00:15.799> you<00:00:16.129> lose<00:00:16.309> more<00:00:16.640> fluid<00:00:17.150> from

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
that we know you lose more fluid from

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.790 
that we know you lose more fluid from
the<00:00:17.510> master<00:00:17.539> cylinder<00:00:17.869> once<00:00:18.380> we<00:00:18.529> remove<00:00:18.769> the

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
the master cylinder once we remove the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
the master cylinder once we remove the
lid<00:00:19.300> then<00:00:20.300> we<00:00:20.450> take<00:00:20.810> out<00:00:21.050> the<00:00:21.230> first<00:00:21.520> t10<00:00:22.520> Torx

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
lid then we take out the first t10 Torx

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.410 
lid then we take out the first t10 Torx
screw<00:00:23.270> and<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:24.440> second<00:00:24.890> one<00:00:25.119> make<00:00:26.119> sure<00:00:26.300> you

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
screw and the second one make sure you

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.779 
screw and the second one make sure you
realize<00:00:26.600> this<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.110> a<00:00:27.140> t10<00:00:27.770> Torx<00:00:28.220> screw<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.699> not

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
realize this is a t10 Torx screw and not

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.359 
realize this is a t10 Torx screw and not
now<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:29.210> here<00:00:29.510> some<00:00:29.810> people<00:00:29.990> have<00:00:30.260> done<00:00:30.500> then

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
now and here some people have done then

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.939 
now and here some people have done then
once<00:00:31.609> we<00:00:31.789> remove<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.419> lid<00:00:32.599> just<00:00:32.840> be<00:00:33.559> careful

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
once we remove the lid just be careful

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.590 
once we remove the lid just be careful
because<00:00:34.070> sometimes<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:34.850> diaphragm<00:00:35.270> sticks

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
because sometimes the diaphragm sticks

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.239 
because sometimes the diaphragm sticks
in<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.840> cap<00:00:36.079> sometimes<00:00:36.649> it<00:00:36.829> sticks<00:00:37.069> to<00:00:37.219> the

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:37.249 
in the cap sometimes it sticks to the

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.610 
in the cap sometimes it sticks to the
master<00:00:37.670> cylinder<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.809> just<00:00:39.019> be<00:00:39.140> careful<00:00:39.530> as

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
master cylinder but just be careful as

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.529 
master cylinder but just be careful as
you<00:00:39.649> take<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.100> away<00:00:40.309> with<00:00:40.699> the<00:00:40.819> excess<00:00:41.149> fluid

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
you take it away with the excess fluid

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.479 
you take it away with the excess fluid
that<00:00:41.659> can<00:00:41.839> stick<00:00:42.109> to<00:00:42.229> the<00:00:42.319> diaphragm<00:00:42.620> then

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
that can stick to the diaphragm then

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.119 
that can stick to the diaphragm then
just<00:00:43.699> wipe<00:00:43.850> away<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.359> excess<00:00:44.389> oil<00:00:45.129> sometimes

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
just wipe away the excess oil sometimes

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.009 
just wipe away the excess oil sometimes
dirt<00:00:46.460> that<00:00:46.699> can<00:00:46.909> just<00:00:47.120> sit<00:00:47.300> there<00:00:47.510> on<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:47.809> lid

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
dirt that can just sit there on the lid

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.229 
dirt that can just sit there on the lid
making<00:00:48.799> sure<00:00:48.949> that<00:00:49.159> when<00:00:49.280> we<00:00:49.429> fill<00:00:49.639> the<00:00:49.760> muscle

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
making sure that when we fill the muscle

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.939 
making sure that when we fill the muscle
in<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.420> back<00:00:50.539> up<00:00:50.749> but<00:00:50.960> it's<00:00:51.109> washes<00:00:51.499> no<00:00:51.679> dirt

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
in the back up but it's washes no dirt

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.149 
in the back up but it's washes no dirt
inside<00:00:53.289> then<00:00:54.289> we<00:00:54.319> remove<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.769> rubber

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
inside then we remove the rubber

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.789 
inside then we remove the rubber
diaphragm<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.909> rubber<00:00:56.449> cap<00:00:56.749> sorry<00:00:57.019> from<00:00:57.739> the

blade nipple to fit our spanner and then
our<00:01:00.859> bleed<00:01:01.100> holes<00:01:01.929> and<00:01:02.929> you<00:01:03.049> always<00:01:03.170> just<00:01:03.530> wrap

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
our bleed holes and you always just wrap

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.500 
our bleed holes and you always just wrap
a<00:01:03.769> little<00:01:04.070> bit<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.339> tissue<00:01:04.519> around<00:01:04.940> that<00:01:05.269> just

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
a little bit of tissue around that just

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.310 
a little bit of tissue around that just
in<00:01:05.990> case<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.650> bleed<00:01:07.430> cap<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.270> lead<00:01:08.690> pipe<00:01:08.990> pops

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
in case the bleed cap the lead pipe pops

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.810 
in case the bleed cap the lead pipe pops
off<00:01:09.530> or<00:01:09.710> anything<00:01:09.920> just<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.340> make<00:01:10.490> sure<00:01:10.520> that

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
off or anything just to make sure that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.450 
off or anything just to make sure that
we<00:01:10.940> don't<00:01:11.120> contaminate<00:01:11.480> anything<00:01:12.280> just<00:01:13.280> as<00:01:13.430> a

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
we don't contaminate anything just as a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.490 
we don't contaminate anything just as a
double<00:01:13.850> security<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.870> make<00:01:15.050> sure<00:01:15.080> that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
double security just to make sure that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.310 
double security just to make sure that
nothing<00:01:15.830> gets<00:01:16.400> built<00:01:16.780> then<00:01:17.780> we<00:01:17.960> fill<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
nothing gets built then we fill the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.160 
nothing gets built then we fill the
master<00:01:18.680> cylinder<00:01:18.830> up<00:01:19.130> with<00:01:19.310> oil<00:01:20.050> just<00:01:21.050> be

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
master cylinder up with oil just be

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.080 
master cylinder up with oil just be
careful<00:01:21.650> because<00:01:21.770> sometimes<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.430> can<00:01:22.670> tend

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
careful because sometimes you can tend

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.420 
careful because sometimes you can tend
to<00:01:23.240> overfill<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.890> and<00:01:24.890> then<00:01:25.010> we<00:01:25.100> start<00:01:25.370> the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
to overfill it and then we start the

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.990 
to overfill it and then we start the
bleeding<00:01:25.820> procedure<00:01:26.860> if<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.070> unscrew<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
bleeding procedure if you unscrew the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.050 
bleeding procedure if you unscrew the
bleed<00:01:29.210> nipple<00:01:29.890> maybe<00:01:30.890> quarter<00:01:31.670> of<00:01:31.730> a<00:01:31.790> turn

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
bleed nipple maybe quarter of a turn

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.660 
bleed nipple maybe quarter of a turn
eighth<00:01:32.420> of<00:01:32.660> a<00:01:32.750> turn<00:01:32.960> then<00:01:33.890> pull<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.430> master

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
eighth of a turn then pull the master

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.840 
eighth of a turn then pull the master
cylinder<00:01:34.970> level<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.720> levering<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:37.490> lock

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
cylinder level and levering then lock

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.850 
cylinder level and levering then lock
your<00:01:38.060> bleed<00:01:38.270> nipple<00:01:38.480> off<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.440> if<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.650> keep

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
your bleed nipple off and if you keep

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.530 
your bleed nipple off and if you keep
repeating<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:42.430> quite<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.460> few<00:01:43.610> times<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.360> as

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
repeating that quite a few times so as

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.270 
repeating that quite a few times so as
making<00:01:44.810> sure<00:01:45.140> there's<00:01:45.380> no<00:01:45.530> bubbles<00:01:45.950> coming

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
making sure there's no bubbles coming

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.030 
making sure there's no bubbles coming
out<00:01:46.600> then<00:01:47.600> also<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.170> can<00:01:48.350> also<00:01:48.530> try

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
out then also you can also try

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.270 
out then also you can also try
unscrewing<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.270> bleed<00:01:50.480> nipple<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:51.650> pushing

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
unscrewing the bleed nipple and pushing

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.370 
unscrewing the bleed nipple and pushing
each<00:01:52.430> individual<00:01:53.120> piston<00:01:53.570> back<00:01:53.780> because<00:01:54.230> this

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
each individual piston back because this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.680 
each individual piston back because this
will<00:01:54.590> move<00:01:55.040> any<00:01:55.400> potties<00:01:55.880> of<00:01:56.030> air<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.420> can<00:01:56.570> be

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
will move any potties of air that can be

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.149 
will move any potties of air that can be
sat<00:01:56.900> at<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.170> back<00:01:57.290> of<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.560> piston<00:01:58.010> which

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
sat at the back of the piston which

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.880 
sat at the back of the piston which
sometimes<00:01:58.640> happens

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
sometimes happens

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.230 
sometimes happens
also<00:02:00.890> double<00:02:01.220> check<00:02:01.250> in<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:01.940> bleed

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
also double check in that you bleed

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.570 
also double check in that you bleed
nipples<00:02:02.630> pointing<00:02:02.900> or<00:02:03.200> bill<00:02:03.409> sometimes<00:02:03.830> more

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
nipples pointing or bill sometimes more

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.640 
nipples pointing or bill sometimes more
so<00:02:04.760> on<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.000> frames<00:02:05.270> at<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.570> back<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:06.409> bleed

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
so on the frames at the back the bleed

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.620 
so on the frames at the back the bleed
nipple<00:02:06.800> can<00:02:07.190> be<00:02:07.280> pointing<00:02:07.700> down<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.509> it

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
nipple can be pointing down and it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.419 
nipple can be pointing down and it
pockets<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.170> air<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> back<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.950> piston

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
pockets the air in the back of a piston

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.960 
pockets the air in the back of a piston
so<00:02:10.700> I'm<00:02:10.789> just<00:02:10.910> keeping<00:02:11.270> it<00:02:11.360> out<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.720> this<00:02:12.970> then

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
so I'm just keeping it out on this then

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.390 
so I'm just keeping it out on this then
remove<00:02:14.480> your<00:02:14.510> diaphragm<00:02:15.140> from<00:02:15.260> your<00:02:15.500> cap<00:02:15.740> just

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
remove your diaphragm from your cap just

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.190 
remove your diaphragm from your cap just
making<00:02:16.790> sure<00:02:16.940> all<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.390> breather<00:02:17.660> holes<00:02:17.990> are

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
making sure all the breather holes are

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.620 
making sure all the breather holes are
clear<00:02:18.440> where<00:02:19.340> where<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.730> actual<00:02:19.970> diaphragm

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
clear where where the actual diaphragm

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.940 
clear where where the actual diaphragm
sees<00:02:20.959> is<00:02:21.770> clear<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.580> wipe<00:02:22.850> any<00:02:23.090> excess<00:02:23.180> away

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
sees is clear just wipe any excess away

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.470 
sees is clear just wipe any excess away
any<00:02:24.950> dirt<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.190> may<00:02:25.610> be<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:25.910> there<00:02:26.060> just<00:02:26.360> have

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
any dirt that may be in there just have

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.560 
any dirt that may be in there just have
a<00:02:26.510> good<00:02:26.690> inspection<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.910> then<00:02:28.910> once<00:02:29.360> the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
a good inspection of it then once the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.020 
a good inspection of it then once the
master<00:02:29.870> cylinders<00:02:30.440> partly<00:02:30.950> full<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.730> roll

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
master cylinders partly full just roll

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.620 
master cylinders partly full just roll
the<00:02:32.209> diaphragm<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:33.010> ever<00:02:34.010> so<00:02:34.250> slowly<00:02:34.550> now<00:02:35.000> we

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
the diaphragm in ever so slowly now we

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.720 
the diaphragm in ever so slowly now we
will<00:02:36.260> be<00:02:36.410> taking<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:36.890> back<00:02:37.130> off<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.550> don't

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
will be taking this back off so don't

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.580 
will be taking this back off so don't
panic<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.239> isn't<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.660> full<00:02:39.020> finishing

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
panic this isn't the full finishing

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.760 
panic this isn't the full finishing
procedure<00:02:40.010> then<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.239> pop<00:02:41.450> your<00:02:41.600> t10<00:02:42.080> Torx

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
procedure then just pop your t10 Torx

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.210 
procedure then just pop your t10 Torx
screws<00:02:43.190> back<00:02:43.459> in<00:02:43.730> there<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.070> the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
screws back in there this this is the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.750 
screws back in there this this is the
important<00:02:46.790> bit<00:02:46.820> really<00:02:47.420> it's<00:02:48.340> we've<00:02:49.340> bled<00:02:49.580> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
important bit really it's we've bled the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.729 
important bit really it's we've bled the
brake<00:02:50.000> but<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.900> just<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.230> make<00:02:51.380> sure<00:02:51.590> we

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
brake but this is just to make sure we

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.100 
brake but this is just to make sure we
get<00:02:51.890> rid<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:52.280> excess<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.940> sometimes<00:02:53.870> can

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
get rid of the excess and sometimes can

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.910 
get rid of the excess and sometimes can
be<00:02:54.200> trapped<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.709> piston<00:02:55.580> chamber<00:02:56.920> and

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
be trapped in the piston chamber and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.620 
be trapped in the piston chamber and
some<00:02:58.550> because<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.000> where<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.420> holes

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
some because of where the holes

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.050 
some because of where the holes
positioned<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.440> need<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.769> now<00:03:00.920> tip<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.700> master

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
positioned we need to now tip the master

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.030 
positioned we need to now tip the master
cylinder<00:03:02.269> down<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:03.350> make<00:03:03.470> sure<00:03:03.650> we<00:03:03.739> can<00:03:03.920> get

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
cylinder down to make sure we can get

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.979 
cylinder down to make sure we can get
rid<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.280> all<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.580> excess<00:03:04.910> air<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:08.480> then<00:03:08.750> if<00:03:08.870> we

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
rid of all the excess air so then if we

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.800 
rid of all the excess air so then if we
just<00:03:09.200> film<00:03:09.380> do<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.680> Formula<00:03:10.160> One<00:03:10.340> Keys<00:03:10.810> just

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
just film do the Formula One Keys just

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.509 
just film do the Formula One Keys just
move<00:03:12.140> your<00:03:12.320> lever<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:12.860> it's<00:03:12.980> directly

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
move your lever so it's directly

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.509 
move your lever so it's directly
pointing<00:03:14.030> now<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:15.530> will<00:03:15.709> help<00:03:15.860> us<00:03:16.040> then<00:03:16.250> get

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
pointing now this will help us then get

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.670 
pointing now this will help us then get
rid<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.970> air<00:03:17.090> by<00:03:17.299> pumping<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.989> lever<00:03:18.200> if

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
rid of the air by pumping the lever if

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.800 
rid of the air by pumping the lever if
you<00:03:18.890> just<00:03:19.040> keep<00:03:19.280> pumping<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.850> obviously

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
you just keep pumping it obviously

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.300 
you just keep pumping it obviously
making<00:03:21.049> sure<00:03:21.320> you've<00:03:21.500> got<00:03:21.680> your<00:03:21.709> pads<00:03:22.040> into

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
making sure you've got your pads into

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.210 
making sure you've got your pads into
your<00:03:22.549> caliper<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:24.650> end<00:03:24.799> up<00:03:24.980> popping

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
your caliper so you can end up popping

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.039 
your caliper so you can end up popping
all<00:03:25.459> your<00:03:25.640> Pistons<00:03:26.030> back<00:03:26.269> out<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.600> will<00:03:26.870> be<00:03:27.019> a

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
all your Pistons back out I will be a

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:27.819 
all your Pistons back out I will be a
bit<00:03:27.290> of<00:03:27.380> trouble

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
bit of trouble

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.740 
bit of trouble
so<00:03:28.190> once<00:03:28.400> you've<00:03:28.519> repeatedly<00:03:29.090> pressed<00:03:29.510> it

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
so once you've repeatedly pressed it

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.500 
so once you've repeatedly pressed it
this<00:03:30.530> will<00:03:30.769> then<00:03:31.010> allow<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.820> air<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.299> may

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
this will then allow the air that may

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.240 
this will then allow the air that may
have<00:03:32.660> been<00:03:32.840> trapped<00:03:33.200> in<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.470> piston<00:03:33.860> piston

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
have been trapped in the piston piston

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.729 
have been trapped in the piston piston
chamber<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:35.209> rise<00:03:35.480> back<00:03:35.810> up<00:03:35.870> into<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.380> master

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
chamber to rise back up into the master

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.979 
chamber to rise back up into the master
cylinder<00:03:37.209> sometimes<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.360> can<00:03:38.540> find<00:03:38.840> that

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
cylinder sometimes you can find that

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.840 
cylinder sometimes you can find that
your<00:03:39.170> oil<00:03:39.320> levels<00:03:39.680> gone<00:03:39.860> down<00:03:40.100> slightly<00:03:40.370> so

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
your oil levels gone down slightly so

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.060 
your oil levels gone down slightly so
what<00:03:41.060> we're<00:03:41.209> doing<00:03:41.420> now<00:03:41.600> is<00:03:41.870> removing<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:42.829> cap

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
what we're doing now is removing the cap

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.699 
what we're doing now is removing the cap
so<00:03:43.640> we<00:03:43.670> can<00:03:43.760> do<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:44.810> final<00:03:45.290> finishing

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
so we can do the final finishing

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.770 
so we can do the final finishing
procedure<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.459> filling<00:03:46.820> the<00:03:46.940> cap<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.420> rolling

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
procedure of filling the cap and rolling

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.890 
procedure of filling the cap and rolling
the<00:03:47.870> diaphragm<00:03:48.350> in<00:03:48.530> properly<00:03:49.420> just<00:03:50.420> make<00:03:50.630> sure

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
the diaphragm in properly just make sure

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.000 
the diaphragm in properly just make sure
that<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:52.190> don't<00:03:52.310> drip<00:03:52.640> any<00:03:52.760> oil<00:03:53.090> anywhere<00:03:54.010> be

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
that you don't drip any oil anywhere be

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.640 
that you don't drip any oil anywhere be
careful<00:03:55.459> with<00:03:55.549> that<00:03:55.670> oil<00:03:55.790> because<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.360> can

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
careful with that oil because it can

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.060 
careful with that oil because it can
ruin<00:03:57.650> they<00:03:58.070> were

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
ruin they were

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.010 
ruin they were
so<00:04:00.070> if<00:04:00.190> we<00:04:00.340> push<00:04:00.550> all<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.880> pistons<00:04:01.330> back<00:04:01.600> just

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
so if we push all the pistons back just

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.870 
so if we push all the pistons back just
using<00:04:02.350> a<00:04:02.440> screwdriver<00:04:02.740> pressing<00:04:03.640> on<00:04:03.760> the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
using a screwdriver pressing on the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.910 
using a screwdriver pressing on the
between<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.390> piston<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.230> back<00:04:05.410> plate<00:04:05.590> of

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
between the piston and the back plate of

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.190 
between the piston and the back plate of
the<00:04:06.040> pad<00:04:06.310> don't<00:04:07.240> use<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.450> screwdriver<00:04:07.780> in

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
the pad don't use a screwdriver in

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.810 
the pad don't use a screwdriver in
between<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.650> pads<00:04:08.890> because<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.430> can<00:04:09.640> damage

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
between the pads because it can damage

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.390 
between the pads because it can damage
the<00:04:10.030> surface<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:11.380> be<00:04:11.530> very<00:04:11.650> careful<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.250> you

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
the surface and be very careful that you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.920 
the surface and be very careful that you
get<00:04:12.580> a<00:04:12.610> good<00:04:12.820> purchase<00:04:13.060> on<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.540> back<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
get a good purchase on the back of the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.480 
get a good purchase on the back of the
piston<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:14.680> don't<00:04:14.890> chip<00:04:15.220> the<00:04:15.250> edge

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
piston so you don't chip the edge

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.610 
piston so you don't chip the edge
because<00:04:15.730> they<00:04:15.910> are<00:04:16.060> only<00:04:16.209> phenolic<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.380> can

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
because they are only phenolic and can

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.400 
because they are only phenolic and can
be<00:04:17.769> quite<00:04:17.980> soft<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.760> if<00:04:19.329> you're<00:04:19.750> using<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:20.109> sharp

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
be quite soft so if you're using a sharp

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.380 
be quite soft so if you're using a sharp
screwdriver<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.190> can<00:04:21.280> easily<00:04:21.670> damage<00:04:22.030> them

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
screwdriver you can easily damage them

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.520 
screwdriver you can easily damage them
so<00:04:22.600> just<00:04:22.720> be<00:04:22.870> careful

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
so just be careful

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.920 
so just be careful
and<00:04:24.250> then<00:04:24.400> just<00:04:24.580> take<00:04:24.790> a<00:04:24.820> tissue<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.540> sock<00:04:25.900> away

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
and then just take a tissue to sock away

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.050 
and then just take a tissue to sock away
the<00:04:26.320> excess<00:04:26.620> oil<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:27.100> may<00:04:27.310> be<00:04:27.340> in<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.670> bleed

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
the excess oil that may be in the bleed

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.940 
the excess oil that may be in the bleed
nipple<00:04:28.240> itself<00:04:28.780> because<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.170> can<00:04:29.350> also<00:04:29.500> find

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
nipple itself because you can also find

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.830 
nipple itself because you can also find
that<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.670> can<00:04:30.910> dribble<00:04:31.090> out<00:04:31.300> at<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.600> later

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
that that can dribble out at a later

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.170 
that that can dribble out at a later
stage<00:04:31.960> then<00:04:32.919> you<00:04:33.040> can<00:04:33.190> also<00:04:33.340> come<00:04:33.760> tell<00:04:33.940> me<00:04:34.060> at

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
stage then you can also come tell me at

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.110 
stage then you can also come tell me at
your<00:04:34.360> pads<00:04:34.570> when<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.870> runs<00:04:35.020> out<00:04:35.850> then<00:04:36.850> if<00:04:37.000> you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
your pads when it runs out then if you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.150 
your pads when it runs out then if you
take<00:04:37.330> some<00:04:37.600> little<00:04:38.110> bit<00:04:38.230> of<00:04:38.260> oil<00:04:38.470> then<00:04:38.740> just<00:04:39.010> to

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
take some little bit of oil then just to

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.250 
take some little bit of oil then just to
finely<00:04:39.669> chop<00:04:39.910> it<00:04:40.060> up<00:04:40.180> get<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.690> as<00:04:40.870> much<00:04:41.080> in

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
finely chop it up get it as much in

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.409 
finely chop it up get it as much in
there<00:04:41.470> as<00:04:41.500> you<00:04:41.650> can<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.640> then<00:04:42.850> sit<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.150> out

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
there as you can and then sit the out

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.600 
there as you can and then sit the out
diaphragm<00:04:43.990> in<00:04:44.140> at<00:04:44.260> one<00:04:44.440> end<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:44.919> just<00:04:45.070> roll<00:04:45.370> it

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
diaphragm in at one end and just roll it

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.659 
diaphragm in at one end and just roll it
in<00:04:45.640> this<00:04:46.360> intern<00:04:46.750> fills<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.350> rib<00:04:47.530> inside<00:04:47.980> if

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
in this intern fills the rib inside if

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.940 
in this intern fills the rib inside if
you<00:04:48.730> just<00:04:49.000> place<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.270> directly<00:04:49.660> in<00:04:50.260> it<00:04:50.740> will

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
you just place it directly in it will

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.070 
you just place it directly in it will
pocket<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.400> air<00:04:51.640> which<00:04:52.360> obviously<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:52.900> what

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
pocket the air which obviously is what

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.170 
pocket the air which obviously is what
we're<00:04:53.230> trying<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.440> get<00:04:53.560> rid<00:04:53.710> of<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.730> just<00:04:54.850> tap

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
we're trying to get rid of and just tap

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.760 
we're trying to get rid of and just tap
your<00:04:55.210> cap<00:04:55.600> on<00:04:55.810> nicely

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
your cap on nicely

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.710 
your cap on nicely
just<00:04:57.490> make<00:04:57.700> sure<00:04:58.000> it's<00:04:58.240> seated<00:04:58.480> properly

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
just make sure it's seated properly

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.630 
just make sure it's seated properly
because<00:04:59.290> sometimes<00:04:59.710> with<00:04:59.890> the<00:04:59.980> diaphragm<00:05:00.460> it

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
because sometimes with the diaphragm it

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.969 
because sometimes with the diaphragm it
can<00:05:00.820> be<00:05:00.910> just<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.300> off<00:05:01.480> on<00:05:01.960> one<00:05:02.200> side<00:05:02.500> so<00:05:02.800> just

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
can be just it off on one side so just

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.450 
can be just it off on one side so just
sometimes<00:05:03.970> give<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.300> little<00:05:04.840> gentle<00:05:05.200> tap<00:05:05.710> if

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
sometimes give it a little gentle tap if

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.250 
sometimes give it a little gentle tap if
it<00:05:06.610> doesn't<00:05:06.880> look<00:05:07.030> safety<00:05:07.479> generally<00:05:07.960> it

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
it doesn't look safety generally it

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.070 
it doesn't look safety generally it
isn't<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:09.010> I'll<00:05:09.100> just<00:05:09.250> make<00:05:09.460> sure<00:05:09.810> then<00:05:10.810> just

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
isn't so I'll just make sure then just

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.560 
isn't so I'll just make sure then just
knit<00:05:11.229> them<00:05:11.470> screws<00:05:11.860> up

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
knit them screws up

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.060 
knit them screws up
don't<00:05:13.570> go<00:05:13.720> super<00:05:14.200> tight<00:05:14.440> with<00:05:14.680> them<00:05:14.830> just

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
don't go super tight with them just

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.030 
don't go super tight with them just
nicely<00:05:15.460> nip<00:05:15.820> up<00:05:16.150> just<00:05:17.140> wipe<00:05:17.350> away<00:05:17.560> all<00:05:17.680> your

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
nicely nip up just wipe away all your

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.750 
nicely nip up just wipe away all your
excess<00:05:18.370> oil

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
excess oil

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.120 
excess oil
just<00:05:19.720> keep<00:05:19.930> your<00:05:20.050> tissue<00:05:20.290> on<00:05:20.560> there<00:05:20.770> just<00:05:20.950> so

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
just keep your tissue on there just so

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.500 
just keep your tissue on there just so
it's<00:05:21.280> all<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.729> the<00:05:21.820> way<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.030> little<00:05:22.210> bit

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
it's all to the way a little bit

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.930 
it's all to the way a little bit
sometimes<00:05:22.780> if<00:05:23.140> you<00:05:23.260> just<00:05:23.440> quickly<00:05:24.340> wipe<00:05:24.790> it

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
sometimes if you just quickly wipe it

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.450 
sometimes if you just quickly wipe it
down<00:05:25.090> and<00:05:25.150> get<00:05:25.390> rid<00:05:25.479> of<00:05:25.570> it<00:05:25.660> all<00:05:25.840> but<00:05:26.460> making

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.719 
down and get rid of it all but making
sure<00:05:27.490> it's<00:05:27.820> all<00:05:28.030> gone<00:05:29.400> then<00:05:30.400> if<00:05:30.580> you<00:05:30.700> just

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729
