00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.700
 today we are going to make a recipe 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.700
 certainly very very pretty because it is 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.920
 very colorful we light fire this is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:22.350
 simple peeled tomato we have 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 smoothie ignites I put it high 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.760
 at the beginning notice that it takes immediately 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 heat as you see I put nothing 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.520
 I did not put a bottom of garlic oil 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.649
 nothing is just tomato I'm going to put it there 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.020
 above the salt spreader but why 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.879
 naturally in a little while it will begin to 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.559
 mumble and the risk is that the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.910
 tomato ends in all parts 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.350
 of course this is not one 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.120
 flame spreader I call a flame spreader 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.829
 since I call his name 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.539
 flame spreader we are going to prepare the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.430
 vegetables from what we start 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.430
 let's start with this beautiful eggplant 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.150
 as you can see it only took me three 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.100
 eggplant slices 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.720
 but why why do I want to use 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.760
 all our vegetables 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.950
 that we have here we cut we look for 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.640
 slice as finely as possible into 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.390
 such a way then that cooking is also 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.390
 extremely fast 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.670
 we pass to the pepper green pepper ne 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.670
 let's take half 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.250
 It is important to always remove this part 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.860
 which is the part that makes the pepper not 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:54.790
 digestible even here we go to 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:57.340
 wait for it finely you decide if 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.520
 leave it like this or try to do 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.049
 of the Ladins I still prefer to cut 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.190
 have all the little bits much more 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.990
 little ones 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.840
 here is done and we put together with the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.310
 eggplant red pepper always goal 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:20.590
 I know of work we 've done before 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:24.959
 remove filaments and even peppino away 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.959
 red zucchini 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.860
 and lastly the black aubergine but 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.170
 the actual but only a slice 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:49.870
 because I'm not going to use the pulp 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.340
 but I will mainly use the peel now 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.380
 it is obvious that I am making a video 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.440
 recipe so we also try to go 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.849
 to look for some colors but these 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:10.720
 things are not thrown away here 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:13.120
 use everything we check the tomato 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.739
 it has already reached the beautiful density therefore 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.410
 we can push and let's add 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:26.470
 the basil we are going to chop 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:28.599
 so love the quantity naturally 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.410
 you decide I really like it a lot 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.920
 so I put so much we add a 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.920
 little bit of oil 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:44.860
 and in the end a bit of salt here is our in 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.750
 tomato sauce and ready we can 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.310
 put even directly behind so much 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.310
 we no longer have to use it 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:00.910
 take the nice pan we go down the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:07.350
 fire a nice bottom of oil we take a 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:15.790
 nice onion we remove the outside 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:22.060
 and we wait for him and we go in 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.980
 very high flame pan then 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.960
 contrary to how they are cooked 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.520
 admits vegetables tend to stew 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.920
 in this case here instead I want to have 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.720
 a rather quick result 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.770
 we have water that we can boil too 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.710
 go put the pasta save the water 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.430
 the pasta is a cooking pen 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.430
 about 10 minutes 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.300
 let's go to cover so come back on 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.300
 at this point, boil all the vegetables 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.290
 let's put in a few leaves immediately 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.290
 of basil 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.690
 the colors are absolutely extraordinary 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.690
 a little bit of salt 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.909
 push the vegetables that are ready 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.549
 but it's also time to go to 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.469
 drain the pasta and then drain 

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:19.519
 take a spoon a couple of 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:25.899
 spoons of cooking water and we put 

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:25.899
 in the vegetables another pan 

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:33.409
 light the fire immediately put it there 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:41.779
 immediately the pasta go and put the sauce 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:42.709
 of tomato once it is well seasoned 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.599
 the pasta 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:47.319
 let's add the venturi you see 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:54.639
 right at the last moment 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:54.639
 so here we do mix well 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.089
 beautiful rich 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.720
 this pasta makes me a throat that you do not 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.780
 you have no idea 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.259
 at this point the final touch or the 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.650
 salted ricotta is a nice dish is a 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.650
 appetite
