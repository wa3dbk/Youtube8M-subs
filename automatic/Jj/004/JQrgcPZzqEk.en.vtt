hello<00:00:01.350> everyone<00:00:02.010> we<00:00:02.580> are<00:00:02.610> here<00:00:03.290> with<00:00:04.290> another

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
hello everyone we are here with another

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.200 
hello everyone we are here with another
example<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.759> applet<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.919> example<00:00:08.790> we

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
example of applet in this example we

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.360 
example of applet in this example we
will<00:00:09.269> see<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:10.309> the<00:00:11.309> order<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.389> methods

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
will see that the order of the methods

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.599 
will see that the order of the methods
called<00:00:14.480> called<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.980> which<00:00:16.980> one<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.310> called

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
called called and which one is called

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.750 
called called and which one is called
first<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.420> which<00:00:18.990> one<00:00:19.170> comes<00:00:19.410> next<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.310> on

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
first and which one comes next and so on

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.679 
first and which one comes next and so on
in<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.720> example<00:00:22.619> we'll<00:00:23.130> show<00:00:23.490> only<00:00:23.910> need

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
in this example we'll show only need

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.500 
in this example we'll show only need
start<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.890> paint<00:00:26.220> method<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.029> next

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
start and paint method in the next

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.929 
start and paint method in the next
example<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.619> also<00:00:28.769> include<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.340> stop<00:00:29.699> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
example we also include the stop and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.479 
example we also include the stop and
destroy<00:00:30.300> method<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.969> see<00:00:33.620> inside<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
destroy method so see inside in it I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.119 
destroy method so see inside in it I
have<00:00:36.090> used<00:00:36.360> system<00:00:37.020> dot<00:00:37.230> out<00:00:37.410> dot<00:00:37.469> println

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
have used system dot out dot println

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.290 
have used system dot out dot println
this<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.149> usual<00:00:39.840> console<00:00:40.710> output

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
this is the as usual console output

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.950 
this is the as usual console output
method<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.780> used<00:00:43.250> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.610> bring<00:00:45.180> console

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
method we used in the bring console

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.540 
method we used in the bring console
application<00:00:46.530> there<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.010> nothing<00:00:47.340> special

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
application there is nothing special

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.760 
application there is nothing special
about<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:49.879> I<00:00:50.879> told<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> earlier<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
about that I told you earlier that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.360 
about that I told you earlier that
applets<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:54.390> applet<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.890> recommended

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
applets in applet it is not recommended

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.229 
applets in applet it is not recommended
to<00:00:56.730> use<00:00:56.910> console<00:00:57.570> IO<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:59.239> perform

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
to use console IO but you can perform

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.160 
to use console IO but you can perform
console<00:01:00.750> output<00:01:01.460> using<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.969> println<00:01:03.870> or

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
console output using this println or

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
console output using this println or
print<00:01:04.439> method<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.689> recommended<00:01:06.689> for

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
print method but it is recommended for

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.140 
print method but it is recommended for
only<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.260> debugging<00:01:07.740> purpose<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
only for debugging purpose so in this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.620 
only for debugging purpose so in this
example<00:01:09.330> I'm<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> show<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.909> order

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
example I'm going to show you the order

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.249 
example I'm going to show you the order
of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.350> calling<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> method<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:16.080> can

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
of the calling of the method so we can

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.289 
of the calling of the method so we can
use<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:17.490> method<00:01:17.939> over<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:20.119> one<00:01:21.119> more

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
use it this method over here so one more

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.219 
use it this method over here so one more
thing<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.720> cannot<00:01:22.290> use<00:01:22.710> any<00:01:23.220> kind<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.229> input

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
thing you cannot use any kind of input

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.070 
thing you cannot use any kind of input
console<00:01:25.890> input<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.369> applet<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.720> did

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
console input in applet just like we did

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.940 
console input in applet just like we did
in<00:01:29.000> using<00:01:30.000> character<00:01:30.630> byte<00:01:30.930> stream<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.560> cannot

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
in using character byte stream we cannot

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.700 
in using character byte stream we cannot
do<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.400> here<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:33.090> are<00:01:33.270> some<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:34.380> bit<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
do it here there are some little bit of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.510 
do it here there are some little bit of
here<00:01:35.700> input<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:36.930> handled<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:38.369> bit

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
here input or handled little bit

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.480 
here input or handled little bit
differently<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.720> show<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.799> move<00:01:41.250> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
differently we will show as we move on

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.149 
differently we will show as we move on
to<00:01:41.700> next<00:01:41.850> examples<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.259> let's<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.979> what

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
to next examples so let's see what

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.080 
to next examples so let's see what
happens<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.790> more<00:01:44.970> thing<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:46.189> have<00:01:47.189> stored

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
happens one more thing I have stored

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.950 
happens one more thing I have stored

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
previously taken screenshots so due to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.609 
previously taken screenshots so due to
there<00:01:52.320> are<00:01:52.439> some<00:01:52.680> inconvenience<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:55.259> I

this applet provides and one more thing
the<00:02:02.070> HTML<00:02:02.850> document<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.479> unchanged<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.380> as

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the HTML document is unchanged it is as

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.960 
the HTML document is unchanged it is as
same<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.189> previous<00:02:05.520> code<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.970> body

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
same as the previous code just the body

same as the previous code just the body
of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.509> unit<00:02:10.020> start<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> paint<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.459> have

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
of the unit start and paint I have

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.720 
of the unit start and paint I have
made<00:02:12.930> some<00:02:13.110> little<00:02:13.409> bit<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.650> change<00:02:13.890> there<00:02:14.189> so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
made some little bit of change there so

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.209 
made some little bit of change there so
let's<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.209> how<00:02:15.569> does<00:02:16.079> the<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.709> applet<00:02:17.040> do

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
let's see how does the the applet do

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:22.190 
let's see how does the the applet do
while<00:02:17.549> running<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:21.000> here<00:02:21.239> we<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.719> compiled

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
while running see here we have compiled

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.199 
while running see here we have compiled
the<00:02:22.730> source<00:02:23.730> code<00:02:24.030> using<00:02:24.980> Java<00:02:25.980> C<00:02:26.219> then<00:02:26.969> we

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the source code using Java C then we

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.630 
the source code using Java C then we
have<00:02:27.510> mentioned<00:02:28.469> the<00:02:28.530> path<00:02:28.829> that<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.370> Java

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
have mentioned the path that is Java

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.089 
have mentioned the path that is Java
files<00:02:29.939> and<00:02:30.180> then<00:02:30.329> J<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.750> file<00:02:31.079> name<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.920> more

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
files and then J a file name one more

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.000 
files and then J a file name one more
thing<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.670> didn't<00:02:33.090> use<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.689> browser<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.799> this

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
thing I didn't use the browser in this

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.149 
thing I didn't use the browser in this
application<00:02:35.700> because<00:02:36.569> in<00:02:37.109> browser<00:02:37.409> there

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
application because in browser there

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.580

doing console application for sorry
console<00:02:43.109> output<00:02:43.519> so<00:02:44.519> I<00:02:44.549> have<00:02:44.790> used<00:02:45.060> your

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
console output so I have used your

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.220 
console output so I have used your
applet<00:02:45.659> viewer<00:02:45.689> for<00:02:46.200> Windows<00:02:46.650> users<00:02:47.090> the

applet viewer for Windows users the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.770 
applet viewer for Windows users the
syntax<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.379> same<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.519> javis<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.629> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
syntax is same and that is javis is the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.559 
syntax is same and that is javis is the
same<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.200> both<00:02:52.230> linux<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.250> windows<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
same for both linux and windows and the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.800 
same for both linux and windows and the
applet<00:02:54.959> viewer<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.709> then<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:57.000> fully

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
applet viewer and then the fully

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.569 
applet viewer and then the fully
qualified<00:02:58.669> file<00:02:59.669> name<00:02:59.909> or<00:03:00.090> if<00:03:00.389> we<00:03:00.629> were<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
qualified file name or if we were in the

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.720 
qualified file name or if we were in the
same<00:03:02.579> path<00:03:02.909> where<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.689> HTML<00:03:04.230> file<00:03:04.730> resides

same path where the HTML file resides

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.569 
same path where the HTML file resides
then<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.480> don't<00:03:06.689> need<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.049> do<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:08.159> applet

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
then you don't need to do it so applet

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.830 
then you don't need to do it so applet
viewer<00:03:08.609> then<00:03:09.180> HTML<00:03:09.689> file<00:03:09.930> name<00:03:10.200> then<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:12.720> is

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
viewer then HTML file name then this is

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
is called after that I minimized this

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.369 
is called after that I minimized this
window<00:03:43.620> just<00:03:44.099> here<00:03:44.669> I<00:03:44.879> minimize<00:03:45.629> this<00:03:46.109> and

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
window just here I minimize this and

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.640 
window just here I minimize this and
then<00:03:47.190> restored<00:03:47.729> it<00:03:47.879> so<00:03:48.449> once<00:03:48.780> again<00:03:48.989> start<00:03:49.470> is

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
then restored it so once again start is

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.500 
then restored it so once again start is
called<00:03:49.979> that's<00:03:50.280> why<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.519> played<00:03:50.849> started<00:03:51.329> it's

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
called that's why I played started it's

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.839 
called that's why I played started it's
printed<00:03:51.870> here<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.229> then<00:03:52.500> print<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.250> Coe<00:03:53.549> paint

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849
