with optical zoom they're excellent line
of<00:00:31.050> point-and-shoot<00:00:31.529> camera<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.099> they're

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
of point-and-shoot camera so they're

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.290

addition this also is a ruggedized

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.760 
addition this also is a ruggedized
device<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.030> resistant<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.750> water<00:00:40.410> dust

vibration<00:00:41.430> things<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
vibration things like that just as the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.959 
vibration things like that just as the
g's<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.739> devices<00:00:44.340> were<00:00:46.070> has<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> fairly

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
g's one devices were has a fairly

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
g's one devices were has a fairly
conventional<00:00:48.420> form<00:00:49.020> factor<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.559> first

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
conventional form factor when you first

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
conventional form factor when you first
look<00:00:50.010> at<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.969> long

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
look at it you can see it's a long

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
look at it you can see it's a long
clamshell<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.500> um<00:00:52.649> there<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> twist<00:00:53.340> quite

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
clamshell but um there is a twist quite

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.020 
clamshell but um there is a twist quite
literally<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.680> display<00:00:55.680> flips<00:00:56.070> around<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
literally the display flips around so is

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
literally the display flips around so is
you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.140> hold<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> phone<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.100> very<00:00:59.550> typical

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you can hold the phone in a very typical

here<00:01:02.879> some<00:01:03.239> controls<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.710> course<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
here some controls and of course the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.590 
here some controls and of course the
lens<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> left<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
lens over here on the left with the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.850 
lens over here on the left with the
flash<00:01:08.600> at<00:01:09.600> first<00:01:09.840> let's<00:01:10.020> look<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.290> physical

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
flash at first let's look at a physical

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.210 
flash at first let's look at a physical
design<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> device<00:01:12.799> keypad<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> might<00:01:14.100> be

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
design of the device keypad it might be

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
design of the device keypad it might be
a<00:01:14.250> little<00:01:14.340> hard<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.659> keypad

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
a little hard to see but the the keypad

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.730 
a little hard to see but the the keypad
coloration<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.979> actually<00:01:17.549> different

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
coloration is actually different

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.570 
coloration is actually different
depending<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.830> where<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> look<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.369> looks

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
depending on where you look it looks

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.190 
depending on where you look it looks
like<00:01:20.670> maybe<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> paint<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> back<00:01:21.600> wasn't

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
like maybe the paint on the back wasn't

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
like maybe the paint on the back wasn't
applied<00:01:22.500> evenly<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.610> white<00:01:23.759> up

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
applied evenly it's kind of white up

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.020 
applied evenly it's kind of white up
here<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:25.820> golden<00:01:26.820> color

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
here it's kind of you know golden color

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.460 
here it's kind of you know golden color
down<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.689> harder<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
down here it's harder to see in the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
down here it's harder to see in the
bright<00:01:28.680> lights<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.430> any<00:01:30.119> event

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
bright lights like this but any event

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.819 
bright lights like this but any event
the<00:01:30.450> keypad<00:01:30.810> has<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.020> nice<00:01:31.290> feel<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the keypad has a nice feel to it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.310 
the keypad has a nice feel to it
individual<00:01:32.310> keys<00:01:32.840> they<00:01:33.840> all<00:01:33.900> seem<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.140> work

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
individual keys they all seem to work

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.100 
individual keys they all seem to work
pretty<00:01:34.560> well<00:01:35.150> it<00:01:36.150> does<00:01:36.329> seem<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> little<00:01:36.600> odd<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
pretty well it does seem a little odd to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
pretty well it does seem a little odd to
me<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.229> Sena<00:01:37.680> 10<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.250> located<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.329> not

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
me that Sena 10 are located here and not

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
me that Sena 10 are located here and not
near<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> d-pad<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.409> get<00:01:40.560> over<00:01:40.590> that

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
near the d-pad but you get over that

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.460 
near the d-pad but you get over that
eventually<00:01:41.390> because<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.290> here

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
eventually because what you get here

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.469 
eventually because what you get here
instead<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.040> buttons<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.670> turning<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.329> the

footage<00:04:59.520> with<00:04:59.820> right<00:05:00.000> now<00:05:00.030> I<00:05:01.130> find<00:05:02.130> the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
footage with right now I find the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.620 
footage with right now I find the
software<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.610> be<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.730> little<00:05:02.880> awkward<00:05:03.120> but<00:05:03.570> I

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
software to be a little awkward but I

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.270 
software to be a little awkward but I
guess<00:05:03.840> it<00:05:03.990> gets<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.290> job<00:05:04.320> done<00:05:04.500> does<00:05:05.070> allow

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
guess it gets the job done does allow

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.250 
guess it gets the job done does allow
you<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.640> make<00:05:06.600> some<00:05:06.780> changes

awkward in terms of user interface but I

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.520 
awkward in terms of user interface but I
guess<00:05:32.300> that's<00:05:32.390> not<00:05:32.600> uncommon<00:05:32.870> for<00:05:33.050> this<00:05:33.290> kind

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
guess that's not uncommon for this kind
