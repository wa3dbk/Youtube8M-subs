00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.110
 chapter 38 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.380
 God asks where he was when the earth was founded 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:14.429
 when the morning stars sang praises and all the sons of God 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.829
 rejoiced 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:22.710
 the phenomena of nature show the greatness of God and the weakness of the 

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:24.749
 man 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.869
 then young jehovah responded from a whirlwind and said 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.549
 who is that that obscures the advice with words without knowledge 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 now your loins are inhibited as a man 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.850
 I ask you about 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 iTunes will let you know 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.260
 where were you when I founded the earth 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.220
 Assume you know if you have understanding 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.020
 who ordered his measures 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.570
 If you do not know 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.570
 Or who stretched the line upon it 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.220
 On what are your bases founded 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.850
 or who laid his cornerstone 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.330
 when they praised all the stars of the dawn 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 and all the sons of God rejoiced 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.050
 who locked the sea doors 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.110
 when breaking in came out of the womb 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.580
 when I put clouds for your garments 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.290
 and his girdle as darkness 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.200
 and stable and for himself and rallies 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.520
 and I put doors and threw 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.050
 ishige 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.060
 until here comes after 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.280
 but not beyond 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
 and here you will have your proud alone 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 you have sent had the morning in your days 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.820
 he has shown his place at dawn 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.900
 to occupy the ends of the earth 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900
 and they have shaken set of it the wicked 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.120
 she changes like mud under the seal 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.490
 and well-being as with clothes 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 more light is taken away from the wicked 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 and he will see his exalted is broken 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.969
 has focused everything until the sources of the sea 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.479
 they have already been searching the abyss 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.279
 that the doors of death have been discovered 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.299
 and in turn through the doors of the shadow of death 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.499
 you have considered everything a former prisoner on earth 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.939
 declare if you know all this 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.199
 where the road to the abode of light goes 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.439
 and where is the place that the darkness 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:41.849
 so that the faithful to their limits 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.849
 and understand the paths of his house 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 I did not know why he had already been, or because the number of 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.129
 crosses days 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.309
 you have entered had in the snow deposits 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.979
 You've seen the hail deposits 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.489
 that I have reserved for the time of anguish 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.679
 for the day of the war and the battle 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.159
 by which way the light spreads and the east wind spreads on the earth 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:20.999
 who opened out to the storm and road to lightning and thunder 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.119
 making rain on uninhabited land 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.119
 over the desert where there is no man 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.649
 to satiate the desert and desolate land 

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:35.149
 and to make the left leg sprout 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.919
 who the father the rain 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.919
 Or who has begotten the drops of dew 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.719
 I saw that there was ice in between 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.089
 and the frost of the sky 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.349
 who the engineer 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.419
 the waters are hardened like stone 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.299
 and the phases of the abyss are frozen 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.299
 honduras had to tie the ties of the Pleiades 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.909
 ogesa tasks orion ligatures 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:08.909
 will make everything come out in time the constellations of the heavens 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.519
 do not want the big bear or their children 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.339
 with one held that the laws of the heavens 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.119
 will dispose stud your domain on earth 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.960
 roast astute the clouds tubes 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.960
 to cover you abundance of water 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.930
 send us your lightning bolts 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.599
 so that they go and they say 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.650
 here we are 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.780
 who pushed the wisdom inside of being 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.599
 or who saw understanding the spirit 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.199
 who counts the clouds with wisdom 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.199
 and the wineskins of heaven 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.289
 who dares to pour 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.289
 when the dust has turned into hardness 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.400
 and the clods have stuck with each other 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:01.770
 marry to study prey for the lion 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.779
 you will liarÃ¡s the hunger of the lions them 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.460
 when they are lying in the caves 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.460
 or are lurking in the thicket 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.309
 who prepares the raven for his food 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:17.610
 when their chicks cry out to God 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.030
 and they wander for lack of food
