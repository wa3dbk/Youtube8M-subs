 today on the youtube channel to do politics 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.380
 I know that it loses as I did not damage but at the same time 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.820
 time to the key a balance sheet and with all the little chains what I was doing 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.550

 more time to get followers 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.700
 and at the same time when I see that my kids tickets usually between 20 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.690
 and 25 minutes hahaha it's really too far in the physical game imposing these 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.110
 little bees like that I could send you back for longer clothes 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.280
 aac video in this room that I understand them 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.510

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.309
 from February 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.730

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.680
 romance 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.260
 I spent a very, very good time with these books it's true that I 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.440
 do not read it often 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.060
 unfolds in a guinea universe 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.360
 music in front of the famous experience I had it was

 been published by and goldcorp 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 and this will be more than dive into this varied universe that I did 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.900
 and here we have to say that 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.940
 % to discard and still 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.250
 very particular and yet very endearing 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.420
 thierry cerutti the heroine as I call them to an army before the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 character she indicates even if we know what she wants 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.799
 and at the same time real to its weaknesses but that we can not not 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.240
 love them and are just 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.220

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.479

 and in this key regional romance of relaxation Thursday and well khatir bag 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.530

 the talent of the 21st day the annual ranking 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.840
 in the collection I was just expecting a lot from this sequel 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.820
 she explains why because with the end of the first volume it's true that I 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.400
 stay a little bit on my hunger I did not have all the explanations that 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.130
 I wanted 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.329
 I thought I had a lot of questions in my head and I'm going to know what 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.570
 was going to happen the air of blood that serve nothing 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.100
 arrived late on earth 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.579
 and it's true that this second volume 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.919
 I seem to be the sensation thanks to a Basque I wizards in 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.599
 not stopping as long as it brings a question of luck to ghana little of 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.489
 answers after this second volume 1 through everything we hear 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.019
 almost on a trilogy that is to say that Africa expects a lot 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.479
 of advances in the main frame are full of small and big towers that 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.669
 comes grafted 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.029
 my tears robbed us during this time did not necessarily 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:37.569
 which made it difficult for me to get back on track 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.549
 volunteers 55 years old without knowing it 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.560
 it was at each end of chapter health although the earth 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.340
 he wanted to add chances to liverpool but he thinks about it 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.010
 that I do not necessarily want to know more but I still had 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.199
 a good time reading since I'm fine three out of five 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.619
 then I got a change of gold 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.889
 with a week from this country if lille 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.019
 milady romance again nothing like 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.300
 the music I was playing 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.110
 the score is 50% and in china and usa 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.990
 and well actually 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.560
 I like my father a little aubrac sex oral sex it's true that 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.950
 it is 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.750
 it's great as I said earlier you do not have often 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.549
 because I'm not particularly attracted by his mandates 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.049
 but the only harvest for the coup is that of Roman wheat from 1100 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.079
 luck that I depend 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.319
 interview of could overburden contemporary romances like that where we 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.989
 tears a little bit it's true that it's very nice 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.400
 and this one in fact does not break the rule it's a thing and aïcha and if 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.610
 that's if it does not mean that the ECB 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.170
 she was like that they both know that they are attracted to one by 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.999
 the other 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.139
 and for once it's the man kiki 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.719
 who is not afraid to go after the note often enough in relief by calming 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.129
 romances after boys 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.659
 but now that we know it's rather interesting to say but yes 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.149
 the institute just my buddy sex 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:57.249
 and so inevitably miyama laugh a lot and it saddens me enormously 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:01.529
 because I want they put huge slaps but so what makes 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:05.609
 the attraction and that's what made me have a good time with this novel 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.959
 after chanas to clarify that I did not read the first volume that is nothing 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.639
 that a song about his criticism so inevitably I got robbed in 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.530
 this arena after I had it 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.370
 not intend to read their talent in any case but I admit that I 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.659
 ask what is your meeting and I still kept experiencing a boom 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.039
 for this pleasant moment I read well the case on five 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.710
 and finally last reading when we talked together in this video heyer 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.159
 if your affection 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:31.330
 india comes from reindeer 7 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.419
 in the collection 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.169
 and me so if you follow the chain you know that recently I read the 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.939
 first volume I had queen 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.460
 relatively well liked even though one inhaled really annoyed by his side 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:43.720
 price kids points 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.520
 I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was finally metz parquet 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.370
 the mans clearly diminished in this second volume 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.770
 to the EU even though she is still very unsure of herself and so on she grows up 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.830
 a lot of time before it's really nice 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.949
 so how will be a completely different turn I will not venture to 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.949
 bring to the character actually badly gone 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.879
 in a bolatti drift that when we could suspect that she was coming 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:09.819
 I'm really getting more and more blue 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.199
 but I can not talk to you in a small step around the pot 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.659
 after it is a romance that is certainly nice 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.229
 the task still not especially character coming back very many 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.899
 worlds new protagonists do not count that these new 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:27.189
 protagonists wind to have a country of importance in the following volumes 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:31.559
 and I must admit that I did not understand the art flins of that year 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:36.169
 finally I did not understand why the author had needed to go so far judge 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.939
 I was really good before this physical fight 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:41.069
 quéribus to go so far 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:41.889
 at 1 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.520
 no after advancing necessarily 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.580
 events to know bring back 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.850
 but I was crazy 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.629
 rim really counts or again for this time 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.939
 I still put him in one case out of five 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.939
 and here are the friends that's how this video will end 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.269
 including all four of the first branded host nations 

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:02.949
 knew I had a course goal at 2 8 or 9 pounds 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.590
 so for this month of February in these cases not too bad left I hope that 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.720
 I will succeed in staying in my goals do not hesitate to put in 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.830
 comment is that you have not read recently I am still very 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.159
 curious to change again on reading 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:19.610
 on stage I'll leave you I make you klein pozzo and I tell you to very 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.180
