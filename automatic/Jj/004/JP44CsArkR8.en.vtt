came out with this and this unit is is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
came out with this and this unit is is
really<00:00:59.850> effective<00:01:00.329> you're<00:01:00.629> gonna<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:01.050> here

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
really effective you're gonna see here

is<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:06.979> scale<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.189> they<00:01:08.340> use<00:01:08.720> for<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is the scale that they use for the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
is the scale that they use for the
grinder<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.890> goes<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.159> way<00:01:11.280> from<00:01:11.520> 10

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
grinder so it goes all the way from 10

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.350 
grinder so it goes all the way from 10
or<00:01:12.210> sorry<00:01:12.510> zero<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.710> 40<00:01:14.070> 40<00:01:14.460> 40<00:01:14.760> being<00:01:15.270> the

or sorry zero to 40 40 40 being the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.899 
or sorry zero to 40 40 40 being the
coarsest<00:01:15.869> grind<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:17.759> on

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
coarsest grind that you can get which on

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.640 
coarsest grind that you can get which on
this<00:01:18.030> machine<00:01:18.210> happens<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.960> relatively

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this machine happens to be relatively

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.190 
this machine happens to be relatively
inconsistent<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:22.280> then<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.119> lower<00:01:24.570> end<00:01:24.810> 0

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
inconsistent and then on the lower end 0

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950 
inconsistent and then on the lower end 0
to<00:01:25.680> 10<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.549> probably<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.450> espresso

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to 10 which is probably your espresso

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.749 
to 10 which is probably your espresso
range<00:01:28.790> it's<00:01:29.790> consistent<00:01:30.570> surprisingly<00:01:31.259> and

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
range it's consistent surprisingly and

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
range it's consistent surprisingly and
it<00:01:32.759> does<00:01:33.060> get<00:01:33.240> very<00:01:33.509> fine<00:01:33.810> link<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> Gaggia

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it does get very fine link on the Gaggia

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.950 
it does get very fine link on the Gaggia
here<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.090> go<00:01:36.240> lower<00:01:36.540> than<00:01:36.659> 8<00:01:38.780> even<00:01:39.780> though

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
here if i go lower than 8 even though

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.179 
here if i go lower than 8 even though
it's<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.170> marked<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.680> but<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.009> just

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
it's not marked here but if you just

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.130 
it's not marked here but if you just
count<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.640> clicks<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.360> will<00:01:42.750> make<00:01:42.899> some

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
count the clicks this will make some

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.569 
count the clicks this will make some
noise<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.670> move<00:01:45.240> up<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.479> range<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:47.399> will

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
noise as you move up the range it will

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.920 
noise as you move up the range it will
choke<00:01:47.909> out<00:01:48.149> from<00:01:48.920> aton<00:01:49.920> below<00:01:50.659> which<00:01:51.659> means

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
choke out from aton below which means

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.200 
choke out from aton below which means
that<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> gets<00:01:52.320> pretty<00:01:52.680> fine<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
that it gets pretty fine and it's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
that it gets pretty fine and it's
surprisingly<00:01:54.869> consistent<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.810> top<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
surprisingly consistent so on top is the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.359 
surprisingly consistent so on top is the
hopper<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.500> where<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.680> fill<00:02:01.920> your<00:02:02.100> beans

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
hopper this is where you fill your beans

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
hopper this is where you fill your beans
comes<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.299> lid<00:02:03.540> cause<00:02:03.899> some<00:02:04.110> things<00:02:04.140> don't

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
comes the lid cause some things don't

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.359 
comes the lid cause some things don't
get<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.920> there<00:02:06.140> things<00:02:07.140> don't<00:02:07.320> fall<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.680> beans

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
get in there things don't fall in beans

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.010 
get in there things don't fall in beans
don't<00:02:08.580> come<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.330> even<00:02:09.599> though<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.869> not

Encore after you have your setting
chosen<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.959> can<00:02:40.730> hold<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.240> it's<00:02:42.420> pretty

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
chosen you can hold this so it's pretty

but like I don't know if that's really

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.720
