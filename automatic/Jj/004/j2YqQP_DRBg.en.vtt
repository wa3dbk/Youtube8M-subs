00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.920
 Asus will launch the iphone 2 on the 20th 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.480
 but we have already received a model 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.620
 to play here on the tech channel take 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 some conclusions 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.260
 It's a zs 551 ml model with 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.810
 2.3 ghz intel processor and nothing 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.340
 less than 4 gb of ram can 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.240
 to leave much notebook dying of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.279
 envy 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.930
 What we think of it so far is good. 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.539
 slightly higher than we expected since 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.219
 brings a 5.5-inch screen and borders 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.350
 a bit thick as it is with 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.610
 the iphone 5 and 6 and the control buttons 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.260
 do not light 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.790
 we are a few days ago with him then 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 may be a configuration that has not yet 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.100
 we found but it goes fast 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.140
 we had a good experience almost on 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 wiki is very light and responsive but 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.270
 brutality of processing of act 11 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.100
 3581 help clear enough that still 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.719
 we could not fill the 4 gb of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.430
 ram memory which is great news 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.870
 for the world's richest task 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.750
 closing apps is a thing of the past 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.559
 by the way and the screen we do not have what 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.390
 complain 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.430
 she looked as good as the screen. 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.470
 iphone 6 plus that brings same size and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.540
 resolution is further evidence that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.560
 increasing resolution does not mean there 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.210
 Big Deal 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.770
 we have no idea of the price he will be 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.330
 released in Brazil so far is 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.189
 complicated start comparing with others 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.750
 models, but everything indicates that it should not 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.729
 disappoint at this point 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.530
 already the camera divided opinions here in the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.390
 office and how much she is able to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.650
 excellent photos day and night she 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.610
 behaved contrary to what 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.140
 we expected 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.759
 we did this because the photos go to the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.380
 that in the automatic mode but they look good 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.939
 strange in low light mode 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.710
 the front has a good amount of 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.409
 resources that we are going to explore more 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.030
 including one that leaves the giant eyes 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.740
 in general it seemed to us a device 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.420
 very good so far we believe that the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.130
 your success will depend more on 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.079
 price positioning than the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.700
 device itself since the asus has already 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.380
 famous for offering a good cost 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.210
 benefit with symphony 5 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 we would like to know your opinion 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.659
 price you think fair on the phone two 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.579
 here in Brazil I think he's going to be a 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.170
 Success count for us and also 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.969
 take the comments to ask 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.649
 anything you want to know about the device 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.729
 and you know we did not take advantage of some of them 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.229
 not official review 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.149
 if you liked or like it down here and so 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.899
 our youtube channel every day has 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.899
 new video for you
