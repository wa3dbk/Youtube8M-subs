00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
knees go over your toes and then you

00:01:48.160 --> 00:02:07.100 
knees go over your toes and then you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.090 

next<00:02:08.110> up<00:02:08.289> this<00:02:08.500> one<00:02:08.739> is<00:02:08.769> pretty

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
next up this one is pretty

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.370 
next up this one is pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:09.729> we're<00:02:10.600> just<00:02:10.810> going<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.140> do

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
self-explanatory we're just going to do

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.460 
self-explanatory we're just going to do
step<00:02:11.800> ups<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:12.519> if<00:02:12.880> you<00:02:13.090> are<00:02:13.330> using<00:02:13.600> stairs<00:02:14.140> or

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
step ups so if you are using stairs or

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.800 
step ups so if you are using stairs or
any<00:02:14.800> kind<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.220> platform<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.390> make<00:02:16.600> it

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
any kind of platform to make it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.020 
any kind of platform to make it
obviously<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:17.560> challenging<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.610> want<00:02:18.880> to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
obviously more challenging you want to

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.449 
obviously more challenging you want to
step<00:02:19.300> up<00:02:19.510> higher<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.200> if<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.890> are<00:02:21.040> using<00:02:21.250> the

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
step up higher so if you are using the

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.250 
step up higher so if you are using the
stairs<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.239> could<00:02:22.420> always<00:02:22.600> do<00:02:22.930> what<00:02:23.080> I'm

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
stairs you could always do what I'm

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.380 
stairs you could always do what I'm
doing<00:02:23.290> here<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.070> then<00:02:24.220> just<00:02:24.459> step<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.970> to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
doing here and then just step up to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.240 
doing here and then just step up to
stairs

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.850 

for<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.340> final<00:02:30.760> exercise<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.720> SEP<00:02:32.050> one<00:02:32.350> you're
