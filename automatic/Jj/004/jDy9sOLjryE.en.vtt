00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.600
[upbeat MIDI music]

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.100
[typing]

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.760
It's not uncommon to see computer games
based on all sorts of non-computer gamey things.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.340
Movies, TV shows,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.180
steaming piles of feces.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.380
But how many games can you
think of that are based on a magazine?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.640
Well, look no further than Car and Driver,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.200
published by Electronic Arts in 1992

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.800
for MS-DOS PCs.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.120
Of course, a more well-known game with magazine ties

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.540
is Road &amp; Track Presents The Need for Speed,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.220
also published by EA, but that game was developed

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.540
by several ex-Test Drive team members

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.540
who used to be at Distinctive Software

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.560
and Car and Driver was developed at Lerner Research.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.680
If that name doesn't sound familiar,
you might know Lerner better

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.300
from when they merged with Blue Sky Productions

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.100
and started going by Looking Glass Studios.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.140
If that still doesn't ring a bell,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.920
then go play Thief and
System Shock and thank me later.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.480
So yes, Car and Driver not only attempts
to emulate the style of the magazine itself,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.320
as evidenced by the cover art that closely mimicks

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.600
the contemporary style and layout of said periodical,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.720
but it also provides you with the opportunity

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.400
to participate in the one of the
magazine's famous Ten Best tests.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.480
Albeit with far more sporty rides
than the usual parade of Honda Accord

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.480
and BMW 3 Series cars.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.180
MDMA On Wheels!

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.540
"You've read the reviews. Now it's time to test
drive ten of the best sports cars in the world,"

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.280
"as rated by Car and Driver."

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.200
Oh, yeah! Everything from an Eagle Talon
to the Ferrari F40 and beyond!

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.100
Intriguingly, it also says to keep
an eye out for upcoming data disks

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.760
featuring more cars and tracks, just like
Test Drive did with its own expansion disks.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.520
But I can't seem to find any
evidence of these ever existing,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.900
so if anyone knows if anything ever came of this,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.960
please let me know, because I'm a geek like that.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.140
Car and Driver starts off with a menu that,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.600
like the box art, imitates Car and Driver magazine.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.040
In this case, the table of contents and article layouts.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.520
Selecting a car and track will not only
make you feel like your choices actually matter,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.380
but it will provide you with a detailed
review on the selection in question.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.440
The downside of these menus is that,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.380
while they duplicate the feel of the magazine quite well,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.640
they aren't exactly the most awesome-looking menus

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.020
and user-friendly game
interface things that I've ever used.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.620
It feels a little bit more like navigating
one of those old CD-ROM encyclopedias.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.220
I feel like I should be back in school,
taking notes for homework or something.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.560
You do get a nice options menu, though,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.680
full of stuff to adjust, like visual tweaks,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.060
car color, handling and strength options,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.420
the ability to play against AI or human
opponents over a modem or network,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.920
individual sound effect toggling,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.840
and which radio station you want playing while you race.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200
You can even adjust the aspect ratio,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.120
which is a fantastic touch,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.620
and surprisingly prescient,
considering more modern displays.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.120
One thing that isn't in this options menu

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.080
is the ability to change your
maximum graphical detail levels,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.680
which is done in an external setup program.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.760
Now what this does is examines your CPU,
hard drive speed and expanded memory

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.020
and then automatically chooses whatever settings

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.040
it determines that you can run smoothly.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.560
I'm running this on a 100 MHz Pentium

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.480
with 32 MB of RAM here,
so it's more than fast enough.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.780
Although it'll run on something as low as a 386/16,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.600
just will minimal graphics
and some pretty hefty choppiness.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.700
Once everything is in order,
it's time to don your driving gloves,

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.240
eat some mahi-mahi,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.920
and start the race, and not necessarily in that order,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.680
depending on how much you like seafood.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.340
If you've played Vette!, Stunts,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.620
or the early Test Drive or Need for Speed games,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.040
then you know almost exactly what to expect here.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.140
You are a driver. Of cars.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.400
And it's your job to drive. Your car.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.620
Over the road and track, with a
trending motor, during Auto Week,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.380
or some such magazine reference.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.100
The graphics are quite nice compared to its peers,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.520
seeing as it was one of, if not the very first,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.040
PC racing games with high-resolution graphics

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.580
and the occasional texture-mapped 3D object.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.200
Most other racers were still using 2D sprites,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.120
or filled polygonal 3D graphics at lower resolutions,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.980
but nope! Not C&amp;D.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.700
Well, at least if your PC was powerful enough,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.780
as you'd be stuck without
texture-mapped scenery objects,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.640
and higher resolution if your PC was too slow.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.960
Something else that's lacking,
no matter what computer you have,

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.100
is the sound.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.560
The radio stations are cool in theory,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.200
but unlike similar games, such as Test Drive III,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.560
you can't change radio stations during the race.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.000
And like Test Drive III,
there is only one song per station,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.260
and it gets old fast.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.120
Not to mention the sound effects are pretty bad.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.700
Every car engine sounds exactly the same,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.840
and I find the sounds used to be really underwhelming.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.280
And AdLib was capable of
making some pretty decent noises,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.560
just compare it to Stunts, for instance.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.980
[high-pitched engine revving]

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.020
[low engine revving]

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.380
[tires screeching]

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.640
Otherwise, it's a pretty impressive game for the time.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.720
The way the cars feel as you wind them around corners

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.400
and smash them into obstacles

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.720
is quite satisfying.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.760
And it's technically an open world.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.480
You can actually drive off-road
without much hassle at all.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.140
Although it's not as open a world as
something like Vette! or even Test Drive III.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.700
And you don't have any animals or nuns to run over,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.900
or any overreactive cops chasing you.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.960
As far as controls, well,
you can control it with a keyboard,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.940
but I'd highly recommend playing with a joystick,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.680
racing wheel or even a mouse,
which is what I'm using here.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.660
To make up for it being digital,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.920
the keyboard controls are
meant to mimic a steering wheel,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.520
so you have different separate keys to press

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.680
in order for different degrees of turning.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.860
And when flying through a
mountainside roadway at 200 MPH,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.760
more precise analog controls are a godsend.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.840
But what's the actual point of the game, you may ask?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.520
Well, not much.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.780
More often than not,
opponents are nowhere to be found,

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.880
so the typical situation is you against
the cold, calculated reality of the timer.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.780
Just race through the
checkpoints to the end of the track

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.780
and try not to crash spectacularly.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.180
Unless that's your goal, then go ahead.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.100
Because crashing is quite fun,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.240
especially when viewed from
the myriad camera angles

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.700
either in the instant replay
mode or during the race itself.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.000
Though really, cameras other than
the dashboard and bumper cam

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.320
are freaking useless while racing seriously.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.460
There are some other things
that also seem quite unusual,

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.200
like the parking lot track.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.800
Yes, it's just a parking lot. That's it.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.640
While I must admit, it's a cool idea,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.840
and I have had some fun with it,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.980
it doesn't really serve much purpose here,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.620
unlike in games like Driver where a
parking lot served as a training mission.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.360
Still, I suppose it's fun to smash
up random people's parked cars

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.100
because I like property damage.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.760
Another interesting thing is the drag strip,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.440
which has nothing to do with dudes taking
off the women's clothing they're wearing,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.900
and everything to do with driving in a straight line.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.740
You also get an auto cross track,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.540
which is great to see how
many cones you can crash into,

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.880
although I don't think that was its intended purpose.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.400
Speaking of crashing, one major
downer is the physics model itself.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.780
Sometimes it feels pretty realistic,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.440
for 1992, at least.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.980
Other times, the physics model just gives up,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.260
has a seizure, punches a baby
and takes a whiz on your sofa

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.160
while singing "Yankee Doodle Dandy."

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.720
So, taking the simulation too seriously

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.340
is likely to end up in heartache and confusion,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.600
like watching the recent remake of Total Recall.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.580
And that's really about it for Car and Driver.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.540
This is yet another one of those classic racing games

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.640
where you have to make your own fun.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.560
There aren't really any goals,
nothing I found to unlock,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.000
not really any AI cars to race
against unless you make ghosts...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.620
You know, really, calling it a racing
game at all seems like a misnomer.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.660
It's a driving simulation, with cars...

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.720
Car...and Driver... Yes, it all makes sense now.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.220
It's a relaxing simulation more than anything

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.420
where you can simply chill out
with some legendary vehicles,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:54.220
and roam around trying to break the
physics and maybe set some lap times.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.280
I like it,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.800
although I wouldn't consider it a
favorite from the time period or anything.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.220
Games like Stunts are far better in the fun department,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.160
but I think this has its place, too.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.740
You just have to do some looking
for that place until you find it.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.060
