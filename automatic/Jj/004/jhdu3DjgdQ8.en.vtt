00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you mister yeah okay thanks

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.430 
you mister yeah okay thanks
yep<00:02:11.790> thank<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:14.540> so<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.840> go<00:02:15.990> around<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.350> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
yep thank you so just go around to the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.940 
yep thank you so just go around to the
front

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.460 

you<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.190> see<00:02:27.430> they've<00:02:27.610> each<00:02:27.730> got<00:02:28.470> hydraulic

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
you can see they've each got hydraulic

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.110 
you can see they've each got hydraulic
ram

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
ram

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.120 
ram
so<00:02:31.569> each<00:02:31.870> pinwheel<00:02:32.440> has<00:02:32.620> got<00:02:32.830> its<00:02:32.950> own

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
so each pinwheel has got its own

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.089 
so each pinwheel has got its own
individual<00:02:33.790> lift<00:02:34.590> they're<00:02:35.590> only<00:02:35.739> on<00:02:35.830> one

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
individual lift they're only on one

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.940 
individual lift they're only on one
circuit<00:02:36.580> though<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.360> they<00:02:37.480> come<00:02:37.690> up

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
circuit though so they come up

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.699 
circuit though so they come up
reasonably<00:02:38.950> together<00:02:39.420> depends<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.709> if

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
reasonably together depends on if

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.080 
reasonably together depends on if
there's<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.099> stump<00:02:42.400> or<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.730> rock<00:02:42.880> or<00:02:42.910> something

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
there's a stump or a rock or something

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.610 
there's a stump or a rock or something
caught<00:02:43.569> in<00:02:43.599> one<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:43.989> pins<00:02:44.260> it'll<00:02:44.560> be

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
caught in one of the pins it'll be

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.180 
caught in one of the pins it'll be
heavier<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.160> it'll<00:02:45.310> come<00:02:45.459> up<00:02:45.610> later<00:02:47.069> so<00:02:48.069> that's

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
heavier so it'll come up later so that's

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.430 
heavier so it'll come up later so that's
it<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.330> twenty<00:02:49.690> four<00:02:49.900> wheeler<00:02:50.140> and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
it that's the twenty four wheeler and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.890 
it that's the twenty four wheeler and
we've<00:02:51.160> also<00:02:51.370> made<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:51.910> so<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.660> take

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
we've also made it so that you can take

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.780 
we've also made it so that you can take
out<00:02:53.140> five<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.800> middle<00:02:54.069> and<00:02:54.280> make<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.700> a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
out five in the middle and make it a

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.959 
out five in the middle and make it a
nineteen<00:02:55.239> wheeler<00:02:55.510> as<00:02:55.720> well
