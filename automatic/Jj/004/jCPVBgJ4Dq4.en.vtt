00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
I thought about this

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.410 
I thought about this
in<00:04:37.600> passing<00:04:38.640> because<00:04:39.640> I'll<00:04:39.910> go<00:04:40.030> knocks<00:04:40.240> a

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.850 

although<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:50.160> some<00:04:50.370> people<00:04:50.730> it<00:04:50.850> sounds

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.409 

totally<00:04:54.550> ridiculous<00:04:54.940> but<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:56.770> me<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:58.360> is

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
totally ridiculous but to me this is

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.920 
totally ridiculous but to me this is
behind<00:04:58.979> now<00:04:59.979> I<00:05:00.220> feel<00:05:00.550> really<00:05:00.729> at<00:05:00.940> home<00:05:01.090> here<00:05:01.300> at

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
behind now I feel really at home here at

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.870 
behind now I feel really at home here at
Cass<00:05:02.759> and

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.600 

it's<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.480> chance<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.990> play<00:05:08.340> international<00:05:09.340> 40

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
it's a chance to play international 40

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.290 
it's a chance to play international 40
which<00:05:10.510> I've<00:05:10.720> never<00:05:10.930> done<00:05:11.080> before<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.970> if<00:05:13.150> I

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
which I've never done before and if I

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.530 
which I've never done before and if I
ever<00:05:13.480> got<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.720> chance<00:05:13.840> I'll<00:05:14.500> take<00:05:14.530> any<00:05:14.920> chance

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
ever got the chance I'll take any chance

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.490 
ever got the chance I'll take any chance
so<00:05:17.490> yes
