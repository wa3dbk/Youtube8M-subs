00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.729 
again the olive tree is Israel and Paul
says<00:04:09.209> some<00:04:09.480> branches<00:04:09.930> have<00:04:10.079> been<00:04:10.200> broken<00:04:10.440> off

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
says some branches have been broken off

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.530 
says some branches have been broken off
because<00:04:11.549> of<00:04:11.910> their<00:04:12.000> unbelief

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
because of their unbelief

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.629 
because of their unbelief
so<00:04:12.840> some<00:04:13.109> Jewish<00:04:13.500> people<00:04:13.889> who<00:04:14.069> were<00:04:14.250> part<00:04:14.519> of

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
so some Jewish people who were part of

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.789 
so some Jewish people who were part of
Israel<00:04:15.030> are<00:04:15.209> no<00:04:15.810> longer<00:04:16.200> part<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.500> Israel

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
Israel are no longer part of Israel

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.800 
Israel are no longer part of Israel
they're<00:04:16.889> not<00:04:17.010> part<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.280> tree<00:04:17.549> anymore

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
they're not part of that tree anymore

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.330 
they're not part of that tree anymore
because<00:04:18.810> they<00:04:19.019> don't<00:04:19.200> believe<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.500> Christ<00:04:19.680> but

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
because they don't believe in Christ but

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.029 
because they don't believe in Christ but
then<00:04:20.489> Paul<00:04:20.729> said<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.989> Gentiles<00:04:22.770> who<00:04:22.950> have

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.890 
then Paul said and you Gentiles who have
believed<00:04:23.370> in<00:04:23.550> Christ<00:04:23.789> have<00:04:24.030> been<00:04:24.060> grafted<00:04:24.720> in
