00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:11.490
 water on earth on earth there are 1400 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.040
 millions of cubic meters of water this is 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.119
 of the same water since the creation of the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.970
 land alone 3% of this water is sweet 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.930
 this very small part but she is 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.410
 essential for drinking and washing the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.960
 97 % remaining is salt water 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.130
 that we find in the oceans the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.739
 mayors and bankers salt water 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.770
 covers two thirds of the surface of the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.770
 Earth 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.120
 groundwater waters 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.760
 underground waters come from the waters of 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.550
 rain that seep into the ground by 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.610
 the cracks of the earth or the rock 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.219
 they form tablecloths 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.280
 phreatic are the closest to the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.370
 soil surface is the one that we 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.000
 found at the bottom as soon as there is also 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.760
 deeper furniture better protected 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.970
 pollution and also rivers 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.310
 underground digging dung 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.299
 this cave are explored by the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.240
 speleologists the distribution of water 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.600
 sweet fresh water would have gone from 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.490
 different ways on earth the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.070
 glaciers accounts for 67% of freshwater 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.780
 the north and south poles are the most 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.430
 large freshwater reservoir of the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.829
 planet 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.770
 there are also mountain glaciers 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:46.399
 formed by the accumulation of snow that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:51.689
 turns to ice bones underground 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:54.479
 represents in 2 5 % of fresh water 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.729
 these are groundwater and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.189
 underground rivers the freshwater that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.670
 the surface is found in 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.759
 the lakes the ponds and start it 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:16.060
 represents a saying that 46% 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.650
 freshwater on earth the 0.4 for 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.340
 remaining hundred are in the air 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.340
 in the form of clouds or vapor 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.280
 water journey in incessant journeys the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.700
 heaven and earth for billions 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.570
 years 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.980
 this trip is called the water cycle 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.920
 the course of the water goes through 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.830
 different reservoirs the oceans the 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.140
 clouds the glaciers the streams and 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.420
 underground aquifers 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.420
 during this trip the water is present 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.050
 in different solid liquid forms 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:15.840
 or gaseous the engine of this cycle and 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:18.510
 the energy of the sun the heat of the sun 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.660
 evaporated ocean water is 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.090
 evaporation the water from the earth's 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.090
 streams and plants evaporates 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.090
 also we speak then 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.450
 of evapotranspiration the water is transformed 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.090
 in tiny droplets called steam 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.910
 of water it is this water in gaseous form 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.830
 that rises into the atmosphere after 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.450
 evaporation the expensive aid helps 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.560
 gather to form mists 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.090
 and the clouds 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.700
 this is called the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.590
 condensation when the conditions 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.050
 climate change these droplets 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.930
 gets heavier and falls in the form of 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.840
 rain of snow or hail these are 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.940
 precipitation according to 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.100
 temperature changes it can 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.560
 snowing or raining 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.130
 if it is more than 0 degrees Celsius 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.400
 rain 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.470
 but if it is zero degrees or less 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.590
 will snow as you can see on the 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.140
 diagram it is colder at altitude 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.600
 so the rains will translate 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.240
 by snow on top of the mountain 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.360
 and rain in the valley 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.820
 you should know that only 21% of 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.140
 rain falls on the continent 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:37.440
 the rest 79% falls directly into 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.320
 oceans the water fell on the continent 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.990
 can follow two paths she can 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.570
 reach the ocean by flow or 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.979
 infiltrate the soil 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.800
 when water seeps into the ground 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.710
 it forms water reserves that we 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.380
 appointed 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.300
 underground these layers are 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.380
 significant water reserves for the 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.180
 culture and life this water is the one 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.010
 that we find in the sources the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.600
 well and in our faucets to be able 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.490
 to reach our homes 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.400
 the water has yet to go a long 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.730
 small way 1 lÃ© to draw in the tablecloths 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.830
 underground and small streams 2 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:21.850
 it is routed to stations of 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.200
 pumping little king to be drunk she 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.580
 is treated in a factory of 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.800
 potabilization and is made drinkable 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.270
 little 4 it then flows into 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.250
 water towers that serve as 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.410
 small reserves 5 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.000
 Finally she was led up to 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.330
 communities and businesses 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.930
 that is to say at home at work and 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.760
 in public places 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.230
 wen must take advantage to believe no matter 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.720
 what contract pro does not include too much to my 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.130
 taste 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.360
 so I will give everything their share 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.850
 proposed per day sometimes see 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.660
 take a taste why take for abu 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:04.960
 at least your pensions have another 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.720
 job and especially when you have your arms for 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.990
 caen at olhain park go go go go go go 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.990
 go 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.900
 yet the whole is otherwise 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.860
 look at me sometimes it's worth next 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.410
 against 1 2 3 or public or large who 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.550
 have the great common iii and as one 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.550
 will also have premises 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.920
 so what do you rely on our 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.920
 guards 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:35.200
 first I would already be able 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.340
 find others like every three months and 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.700
 be liquid produced or udc won 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.310
 today 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.550
 he discovered to find at all 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.550
 Why 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.810
 we finally saw how to create the 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:54.610
 change of year what our computer did you 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.440
 more than running at fasting gaulle at the small 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.330
 finally water is precious 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:04.310
 there are some solutions to protect 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:06.650
 -you say you're good no comment 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.830
 first offers you to copy 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:14.570
 why besides the video call find me 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.980
 with two teams have been known or 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.220
 not talk about the schlucht his 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.610
 new name of our territory from 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:26.560
 click on started and then the 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.560
 jewelry tattoos and to evacuate them
