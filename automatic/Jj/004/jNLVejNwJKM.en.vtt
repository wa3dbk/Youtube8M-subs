00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.380 
of the pond bang now we're going to
leave<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.289> kill<00:02:07.500> hole<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.859> middle<00:02:08.269> so<00:02:09.269> I'm

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
leave the kill hole in the middle so I'm

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.430 
leave the kill hole in the middle so I'm
gonna<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.630> over<00:02:09.690> here<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.929> we'll<00:02:10.079> fix<00:02:10.259> this

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
gonna go over here and we'll fix this

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.990 
gonna go over here and we'll fix this
out<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> little<00:02:10.799> bit<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.459> we'll<00:02:11.730> kind<00:02:11.940> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
out a little bit and then we'll kind of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:30.760 
out a little bit and then we'll kind of
show<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.390> afterthought

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.080 

all<00:02:31.770> right<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.280> kind<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.520> see<00:02:32.700> here<00:02:32.910> we've

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
all right you can kind of see here we've

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.970 
all right you can kind of see here we've
got<00:02:33.240> decoys<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.050> both<00:02:34.260> sides<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.800> bank

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
got decoys on both sides of the bank

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.060 
got decoys on both sides of the bank
we're<00:02:35.160> kind<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.370> blocking<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:35.880> Bank<00:02:37.070> now

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
we're kind of blocking this Bank now

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.760 
we're kind of blocking this Bank now
typically<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.550> would<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> bigger<00:02:39.030> pond<00:02:39.300> but

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
typically it would be a bigger pond but

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.050 
typically it would be a bigger pond but
you<00:02:40.770> kind<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.040> want<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.280> put<00:02:41.550> your<00:02:41.670> decoys

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
you kind of want to put your decoys

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.760 
you kind of want to put your decoys
where<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:42.930> want<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.140> birds<00:02:43.350> at<00:02:43.590> and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
where you don't want the birds at and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.200 
where you don't want the birds at and
you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:43.980> see<00:02:44.190> how<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.430> left<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.820> middle<00:02:45.090> kind

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
you can see how we left the middle kind

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.330 
you can see how we left the middle kind
of<00:02:45.360> wide<00:02:45.540> open<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.770> we<00:02:46.920> could<00:02:47.100> have<00:02:47.130> put

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
of wide open you know we could have put

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.880 
of wide open you know we could have put
more<00:02:47.520> decoys<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.360> filled<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> banks<00:02:49.620> up<00:02:49.770> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
more decoys and filled the banks up a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.980 
more decoys and filled the banks up a
little<00:02:50.070> bit<00:02:50.190> more<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:51.330> small<00:02:51.630> as<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.780> pond

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
little bit more but as small as the pond

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.050 
little bit more but as small as the pond
is<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.500> plenty<00:02:52.890> plenty<00:02:53.250> big<00:02:53.490> enough<00:02:53.700> spread

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
is be plenty plenty big enough spread

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.780 
is be plenty plenty big enough spread
kill<00:02:54.810> holes<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.230> middle<00:02:55.610> typically<00:02:56.610> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
kill holes in the middle typically you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.600 
kill holes in the middle typically you
can<00:02:56.940> shoot<00:02:57.090> all<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.330> way<00:02:57.390> across<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.840> pond

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
can shoot all the way across this pond

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.540 
can shoot all the way across this pond
but<00:03:00.530> this<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.800> what<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.130> would<00:03:02.250> look<00:03:02.400> like

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
but this is this what it would look like

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.220 
but this is this what it would look like
