00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.100
 because insufficient wear of the incisors can this 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.770
 disproportionately long and keep the rows of teeth apart 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:17.210
 The molars touch only incompletely or not at all 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.159
 Thus, the Kauleiste he had the affected 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.220
 and the formation of sharp edges is enhanced 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.180
 Just imagine with a spoon between them 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.699
 To buy the incisors a bun 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.270
 and for years 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.990
 The masticatory muscles are among the most powerful muscle groups on the whole 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.930
 body 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.600
 GM has to try to get the molars back in contact with them 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600
 Bring it by increasingly violent to travel 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.570
 in the course of this and natural hardly I yes nods when the temporomandibular joints strong 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 over- or fairly charged 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.430
 This leads to sensitivity and pain in this area 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.650
 the opposite points of support the incisors 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.450
 gradually due to the applied pressure in a flat position 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.840
 dodge 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.780
 because the process of non-erosion of the incisors progresses 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.000
 the increasing muscle power used causes bending of the upper 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.610
 and lower jaw 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.530
 Depending on the headscarves and predisposition outweighs the one and sometimes the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.800
 another variant 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.350
 with different consequences such as ramps or hook formation 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.390
 in the course of progress the position of the incisors laughs more and more 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 which can be observed in almost every older driving 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480
 the consequences are dramatic 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.600
 the rights to numbers firmly yes especially the upper jaw incisors 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
 can not withstand the pressure on the long run 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.000
 in the initial stage there are existing redness and swelling of the gums 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.980
 Harbingers of health issues such as calculus broken tooth compartments 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.980
 loose teeth and early tooth loss 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.380
 so that it does not come so far 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.240
 because the incisors shortened to their intended length
