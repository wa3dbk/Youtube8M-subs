00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 attention this video is reserved for 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:12.420
 people having a fact without a year 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:15.750
 and a month a second you already need 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.880
 a piece of 1 euro of 0 20 euro 50 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.160
 euros you can even take the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 dynamite for maximum lint in 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.590
 a minimum of time 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:30.449
 if if the family you even know it 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.350
 then choose your favorite machine 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.829
 among the 62 claw machine the 666 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.260
 plush 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.420
 yes I counted the number of stuffed animals and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.579
 so then you pay the salary of the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 brake by inserting your small piece into 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.989
 the little hole and then you put your 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 grapple over your little one too much 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.800
 cabbage pine pin is once over you 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.840
 give very little hits 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.840
 logistics for more details 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.530
 geraghty but do not worry I'm going to 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.850
 catch up so you can put a 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.850
 blue or green thumb to the video 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.660
 if you want to have a better chance of 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.620
 to win you have to catch the stuffed animals 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.050
 are oval shaped 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.530
 good I stop talking otherwise I'll 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.530
 still lose 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:52.450
 you must always catch the stuffed animals 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.159
 which is near the hole by cons 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.790
 Never catch who paulus 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.790
 are too far 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.030
 the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.920
 you must never catch the paulus 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.130
 by the head but all the time through the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.130
 body 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.970
 finally if you're out of luck you can 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.540
 pick up polystyrene worth 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.770
 0 point 0 0 0 0 0 2 euro cent for 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.770
 fiddling with him for hours
