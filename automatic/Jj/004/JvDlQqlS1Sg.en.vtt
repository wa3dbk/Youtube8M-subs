me die ends up disappearing for a bit
and<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.190> thought<00:04:41.370> you<00:04:41.790> know<00:04:41.820> I<00:04:41.910> thought<00:04:42.060> that

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
and I thought you know I thought that

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.610 
and I thought you know I thought that
would<00:04:42.420> have<00:04:42.510> been<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.630> really<00:04:42.900> bad<00:04:43.140> way<00:04:43.380> for<00:04:43.560> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
would have been a really bad way for the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.810 
would have been a really bad way for the
show<00:04:43.800> to<00:04:43.860> end<00:04:44.100> but<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:44.370> thought<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.640> would<00:04:44.730> have

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
show to end but I thought it would have

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.790 
show to end but I thought it would have
been<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:44.940> really<00:04:45.120> good<00:04:45.420> motivation<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.500> set<00:04:46.680> up

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
been a really good motivation to set up

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.290 
been a really good motivation to set up
