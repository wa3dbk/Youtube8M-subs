00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
six thousand milliamp your our moonstone

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.170 
six thousand milliamp your our moonstone
external<00:00:05.009> battery<00:00:05.310> pack<00:00:05.490> which<00:00:05.910> we<00:00:06.089> have

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
external battery pack which we have

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.000 
external battery pack which we have
right<00:00:06.359> here<00:00:06.390> now<00:00:07.230> one<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.589> things<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.890> like

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
right here now one of the things we like

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.379 
right here now one of the things we like
about<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.760> comes<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.150> nice

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
about it is that it comes in this nice

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.759 
about it is that it comes in this nice
felt<00:00:10.519> carrying<00:00:11.519> case<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.150> open<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.509> up

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
felt carrying case so you can open it up

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.090 
felt carrying case so you can open it up
and<00:00:13.769> there's<00:00:13.950> your<00:00:14.509> moonstone<00:00:15.509> baile<00:00:16.049> pal<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
and there's your moonstone baile pal and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.040 
and there's your moonstone baile pal and
you<00:00:17.190> also<00:00:17.340> have<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> non<00:00:17.910> tangled<00:00:18.660> charging

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
you also have a non tangled charging

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.890 
you also have a non tangled charging
cord<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.859> how<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.130> works<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:21.510> charge<00:00:21.720> it

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
cord so how this works is to charge it

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.580 
cord so how this works is to charge it
you<00:00:22.560> put<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.859> right<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:24.380> right<00:00:25.380> here

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you put in right here right here

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.370 
you put in right here right here
and<00:00:25.920> then<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> plug<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.760> into<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.380> charging

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and then you plug this into a charging

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.599 
and then you plug this into a charging
source<00:00:28.560> now<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> haven't<00:00:29.039> used<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.250> cable

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
source now I haven't used this cable

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.939 
source now I haven't used this cable

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
to go now this is six thousand milliamp

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
to go now this is six thousand milliamp
your<00:00:42.360> hour<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.660> let<00:00:42.780> me<00:00:42.840> give<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.050> about<00:00:43.649> two

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
your hour so let me give you about two

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.979 
your hour so let me give you about two
and<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> half<00:00:44.040> charges<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:44.760> iPhone<00:00:45.180> it's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and a half charges on your iPhone it's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.080 
and a half charges on your iPhone it's
got<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> standard<00:00:47.160> output<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.910> high<00:00:48.059> output

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
got a standard output and a high output

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.850 
got a standard output and a high output
and<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:49.649> because

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and you know which is which because

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
and you know which is which because
there's<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.579> lightning<00:00:50.789> bolt<00:00:51.090> over<00:00:51.270> standard

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
there's one lightning bolt over standard

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.630 
there's one lightning bolt over standard
and<00:00:51.960> then<00:00:52.469> two<00:00:52.710> lightning<00:00:52.920> bolt<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> high

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and then two lightning bolt or a high

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.330 
and then two lightning bolt or a high
output<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> low<00:00:55.199> output<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.949> or

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
output so low output would be or

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
output so low output would be or
standard<00:00:56.730> would<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.180> amp<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
standard would be one amp and then that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.950 
standard would be one amp and then that
one<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.770> amps<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.960> pretty

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
one would be two amps so pretty

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.180 
one would be two amps so pretty
straightforward<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.559> does<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.890> light

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
