gangplank rework knows but yeah when
it's<00:00:30.929> released<00:00:31.199> its<00:00:31.439> gonna<00:00:31.590> replace<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it's released its gonna replace the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.010 
it's released its gonna replace the
howling<00:00:32.550> abyss<00:00:32.790> map<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.239> then<00:00:33.360> after<00:00:33.870> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
howling abyss map but then after that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
howling abyss map but then after that
right<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.130> clear<00:00:35.309> about<00:00:35.520> what

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
right it's not so clear about what

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.920 
right it's not so clear about what
they're<00:00:35.790> gonna<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.660> were<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> make<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
they're gonna do if I were to make a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.600 
they're gonna do if I were to make a
guess<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.440> would<00:00:37.469> say<00:00:37.590> they'd<00:00:37.860> leave<00:00:38.070> both<00:00:38.309> maps

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
guess I would say they'd leave both maps

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.340 
guess I would say they'd leave both maps
in<00:00:38.910> because<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.270> would<00:00:39.390> wouldn't<00:00:39.960> make<00:00:40.170> sense

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
in because it would wouldn't make sense

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.990 
in because it would wouldn't make sense
to<00:00:40.530> put<00:00:40.649> all<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.800> effort<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.340> art<00:00:41.489> assets<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
to put all this effort and art assets to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.029 
to put all this effort and art assets to
just<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.329> played<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.710> map<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.890> get

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
just have played in one map it's get

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.529 
just have played in one map it's get
away<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.219> he<00:00:47.579> talks<00:00:47.789> too<00:00:47.969> much<00:00:48.860> um<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.700> yeah<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
away from he talks too much um so yeah I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.910 
away from he talks too much um so yeah I

of work into the art assets you can like

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.820 
of work into the art assets you can like
zoom<00:02:09.500> way<00:02:09.890> out<00:02:10.310> here<00:02:10.990> there's<00:02:11.990> like<00:02:12.140> sharks<00:02:12.620> in

zoom way out here there's like sharks in
the<00:02:12.920> water<00:02:13.330> which<00:02:14.330> makes<00:02:14.660> me<00:02:14.870> wonder<00:02:15.110> what

the water which makes me wonder what

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.780 
the water which makes me wonder what
exactly<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.100> going<00:02:16.160> see<00:02:16.459> there's<00:02:16.640> a

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
exactly is going see there's a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.670 
exactly is going see there's a
hammerhead<00:02:17.150> what<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.990> deal<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.200> with<00:02:18.410> those

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
hammerhead what the deal is with those

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.710 
hammerhead what the deal is with those
sharks<00:02:19.160> what's<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:19.850> Vulcan<00:02:20.300> Mexican

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
sharks what's that Vulcan Mexican

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.510 
sharks what's that Vulcan Mexican
actually<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.560> gate<00:02:21.860> gonna<00:02:22.070> open<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.310> be

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
actually is a gate gonna open that be

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.310 
actually is a gate gonna open that be
cool<00:02:22.700> oh<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:24.770> gate<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.070> open<00:02:26.080> closed<00:02:27.080> in<00:02:27.260> a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
cool oh the gate is open closed in a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.090 
cool oh the gate is open closed in a
minute<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.110> guess<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.440> sharks<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.860> are<00:02:31.010> on

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
minute so I guess the sharks that are on

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.520 
minute so I guess the sharks that are on
that<00:02:31.370> side<00:02:32.380> travels<00:02:33.380> through<00:02:33.620> here<00:02:35.530> now

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
that side travels through here now

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.020 
that side travels through here now
there's<00:02:37.100> something<00:02:37.280> weird<00:02:37.520> going<00:02:37.610> on<00:02:37.970> here

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
there's something weird going on here

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.180 
there's something weird going on here
because<00:02:38.600> there's<00:02:38.959> like<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.110> waterfall<00:02:39.530> over<00:02:40.040> on

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
because there's like a waterfall over on

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.690 
because there's like a waterfall over on
that<00:02:40.430> side<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:41.769> like<00:02:42.769> there's<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.310> bridge

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
that side and like there's this bridge

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.810 
that side and like there's this bridge
gate<00:02:44.269> thing<00:02:44.660> here<00:02:45.280> shark<00:02:46.280> barely<00:02:46.610> gonna<00:02:46.730> make

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
gate thing here shark barely gonna make

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.080 
gate thing here shark barely gonna make
it<00:02:46.970> through<00:02:48.430> yeah<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.550> that's<00:02:49.700> how<00:02:49.820> they<00:02:49.940> get

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it through yeah so that's how they get

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.620 
it through yeah so that's how they get
through<00:02:50.300> there<00:02:50.510> apparently<00:02:52.450> there's<00:02:53.450> even<00:02:53.600> a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
through there apparently there's even a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.699 
through there apparently there's even a
little<00:02:53.750> sound<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.170> queue<00:02:54.320> patch<00:02:54.500> that's

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
little sound of a queue patch that's

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.680 
little sound of a queue patch that's
pretty<00:02:54.920> cool<00:02:55.100> anyway<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.180> yeah<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.510> said

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
pretty cool anyway so yeah like I said

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.030 
pretty cool anyway so yeah like I said
there's<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:56.989> waterfall<00:02:57.530> thing<00:02:57.830> here

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
there's like this waterfall thing here

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.350 
there's like this waterfall thing here
so<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.250> sharks<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.550> come<00:02:58.850> from<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.060> way

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
so the sharks that come from that way

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.360 
so the sharks that come from that way
which<00:03:00.019> would<00:03:00.200> lead<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.620> believe<00:03:00.739> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
which would lead you to believe the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.569 
which would lead you to believe the
ocean<00:03:01.730> is<00:03:01.850> supposed<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.330> be<00:03:02.420> down<00:03:02.570> there<00:03:03.579> but

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
ocean is supposed to be down there but

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.150 
ocean is supposed to be down there but
maybe<00:03:04.880> there's<00:03:05.150> like<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.329> higher<00:03:05.660> tier<00:03:06.380> of<00:03:06.709> c<00:03:07.010> or

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
maybe there's like a higher tier of c or

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.590 
maybe there's like a higher tier of c or
some<00:03:07.310> do<00:03:07.430> something<00:03:07.670> very<00:03:07.850> strange<00:03:08.090> going<00:03:08.299> on

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
some do something very strange going on

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.020 
some do something very strange going on
in<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.810> geography<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.440> place<00:03:09.680> or<00:03:10.340> these

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
in the geography of this place or these

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.220 
in the geography of this place or these
hammerheads<00:03:11.390> happen<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.900> be<00:03:11.959> freshwater

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
hammerheads happen to be freshwater

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.039 
hammerheads happen to be freshwater
sharks<00:03:12.860> but<00:03:13.660> anyway<00:03:14.660> that's<00:03:14.810> that's<00:03:15.019> really
