00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
the back side in order to do that use

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.500 
the back side in order to do that use
the<00:03:53.380> needle<00:03:53.890> that's<00:03:54.100> slightly<00:03:54.970> smaller<00:03:55.390> than

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
the needle that's slightly smaller than

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:05.610 
the needle that's slightly smaller than
the<00:03:55.920> needle<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.070> you<00:03:57.130> used<00:03:57.520> to<00:03:57.730> knit<00:04:04.620> take

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
the needle that you used to knit take

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.570

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
through and pull it back out this is why

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.789 
through and pull it back out this is why
you<00:04:13.450> don't<00:04:13.720> want<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:14.019> pull<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.260> too<00:04:14.410> tight<00:04:14.440> in

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
you don't want to pull it too tight in

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:20.909 
you don't want to pull it too tight in
the<00:04:14.830> beginning<00:04:19.080> start<00:04:20.080> to<00:04:20.229> unravel<00:04:20.410> your

knitting

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:38.379

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:49.990 
slip it in your first stitch pull the
yarn<00:04:45.370> so<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.520> chain<00:04:46.819> comes<00:04:47.090> out<00:04:48.639> go<00:04:49.639> under

I'm it back the tail on this so that's

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.600
