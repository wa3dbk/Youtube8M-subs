can see what happens if you don't season

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
can see what happens if you don't season
it<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.730> stained<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> wood<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.640> crack

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it it can get stained the wood can crack

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.750 
it it can get stained the wood can crack
apart<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.200> starting<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.070> open<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.520> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
apart this is starting to open up in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.260 
apart this is starting to open up in
places<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.200> grow<00:00:43.350> mold<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.270> generally

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
places it can grow mold and generally

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.840 
places it can grow mold and generally
bacteria<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.350> sorts<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.829> nasty<00:00:47.039> things<00:00:47.280> can

bacteria all sorts of nasty things can

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
bacteria all sorts of nasty things can
grow<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.530> season<00:00:50.010> your

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
grow in there so if you season your

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.369 
grow in there so if you season your
board<00:00:50.370> you're<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.300> help<00:00:51.480> avoid<00:00:51.809> all<00:00:52.110> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
these things start by warming up your

microwave for about 45 seconds to melt

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
microwave for about 45 seconds to melt
it<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:02.730> soaked<00:01:02.940> into<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> water

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it so that it was soaked into the water

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
it so that it was soaked into the water
you<00:01:03.870> shouldn't<00:01:04.680> use<00:01:04.890> any<00:01:05.100> edible<00:01:05.670> oil

rancid<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> season<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:14.939> board<00:01:15.180> did<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
rancid so to season your board did the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.830 
rancid so to season your board did the
cloth<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> oil<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.890> quite<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> bit<00:01:17.840> I'm

isn't it and let it stand for about six
hours<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:45.310> harden<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.909> soak<00:01:46.630> in<00:01:46.840> completely

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
hours to harden and soak in completely

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.730 
hours to harden and soak in completely
and<00:01:47.679> then<00:01:48.250> with<00:01:48.640> another<00:01:48.670> cloth<00:01:49.509> wipe<00:01:50.319> off<00:01:50.530> any
