stone<00:07:22.560> and<00:07:23.560> I<00:07:23.979> think<00:07:24.250> the<00:07:24.430> route<00:07:24.700> south<00:07:25.120> of<00:07:25.540> our

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
stone and I think the route south of our

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.280 
stone and I think the route south of our
home<00:07:26.650> there's<00:07:26.889> actually<00:07:27.400> a<00:07:27.460> lot<00:07:27.760> core<00:07:28.290> because

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.290 
home there's actually a lot core because

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.740 
home there's actually a lot core because
you<00:07:29.440> get<00:07:29.650> to<00:07:29.770> go<00:07:29.919> by<00:07:30.160> this<00:07:30.220> marshy<00:07:31.090> area<00:07:31.540> and

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
you get to go by this marshy area and

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.240 
you get to go by this marshy area and
it's<00:07:31.870> really<00:07:32.410> cool<00:07:34.229> plus<00:07:35.229> after<00:07:35.830> you<00:07:35.950> beat<00:07:36.220> the

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250 
it's really cool plus after you beat the

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.969 
it's really cool plus after you beat the
fourth<00:07:37.030> Jim<00:07:37.450> you<00:07:38.440> can<00:07:38.850> go<00:07:39.850> east<00:07:40.750> up<00:07:41.139> a<00:07:41.380> story<00:07:41.889> Oh

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:41.979 
fourth Jim you can go east up a story Oh

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:46.080 
fourth Jim you can go east up a story Oh
which<00:07:42.220> is<00:07:42.370> kind<00:07:42.700> of<00:07:42.880> going<00:07:43.210> backwards<00:07:45.090> this

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090 
which is kind of going backwards this

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.159 
which is kind of going backwards this
seems<00:07:46.450> like<00:07:46.630> the<00:07:46.900> better<00:07:47.169> route<00:07:47.440> to<00:07:47.620> go<00:07:49.110> so<00:07:50.110> you

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:50.169 
seems like the better route to go so you

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:56.970 
seems like the better route to go so you
can<00:07:50.350> head<00:07:50.590> south<00:07:50.950> of<00:07:51.310> here

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:56.980 

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:03.670 

it's<00:07:57.980> Team<00:07:58.580> Galactic<00:07:59.410> again<00:08:02.500> look<00:08:03.500> at<00:08:03.620> that

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680
