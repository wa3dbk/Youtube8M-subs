separating<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> white<00:01:47.250> house<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.939> can

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
separating the white house but you can

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.399 
separating the white house but you can
chuck<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> you're<00:01:48.600> quick<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> only<00:01:49.290> need

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
chuck the you're quick so you only need

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.039 
chuck the you're quick so you only need
one<00:01:49.829> yolk<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.430> recipe<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.899> most

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
one yolk for this recipe the most

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.660 
one yolk for this recipe the most
important<00:01:52.530> thing<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.740> souffle<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.280> whisking

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
important thing of souffle is whisking

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.520 
important thing of souffle is whisking
the<00:01:53.790> eggs<00:01:53.970> properly<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.290> here

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the eggs properly as you can see here

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
the eggs properly as you can see here
it's<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.070> hard<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.549> long<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it's not that hard as long as you have a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.609 
it's not that hard as long as you have a
bit<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.299> arm<00:01:57.509> power<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.200> keep<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
bit of arm power and you just keep at it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.359 
bit of arm power and you just keep at it
until<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.159> falls<00:01:59.399> what<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> looks<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.060> now

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
until it falls what it looks like now

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.010 
until it falls what it looks like now
okay<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.909> keep<00:02:03.149> whisking<00:02:03.360> until<00:02:03.750> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
okay so you just keep whisking until it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
okay so you just keep whisking until it
starts<00:02:04.320> getting<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.619> glossy<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.549> little

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
starts getting all glossy and a little

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.089 
starts getting all glossy and a little
bit<00:02:06.119> thick<00:02:06.360> then<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.439> start<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.740> put<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
bit thick then you start to put in the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.199 
bit thick then you start to put in the
sugar<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.489> you've<00:02:08.610> already<00:02:08.759> weighed<00:02:09.000> out

sugar that you've already weighed out

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.180 
sugar that you've already weighed out
and<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:10.020> put<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:10.770> at<00:02:10.890> once<00:02:10.920> but

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and you put that in not all at once but

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.970 
and you put that in not all at once but
bit<00:02:11.459> by<00:02:11.489> bit

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
bit by bit

bit by bit
while<00:02:12.099> continually<00:02:12.519> whisking<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.510> can

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
while continually whisking as you can

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.149 
while continually whisking as you can
see<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.840> gets<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> point<00:02:14.379> where<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:14.950> so

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
see it gets to the point where it's so

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.470 
see it gets to the point where it's so
thick<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.459> glossy<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:16.000> when<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.209> lift<00:02:16.390> the

can happen let's think about it you put

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.119 
can happen let's think about it you put
in<00:02:29.709> chocolate<00:02:30.190> eggs<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.510> sugar<00:02:32.379> together<00:02:32.650> and

in chocolate eggs and sugar together and

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.420 
in chocolate eggs and sugar together and
then<00:02:33.670> melting<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.840> put<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.049> in<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.349> oven

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
then melting it and put it in the oven

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.910 
then melting it and put it in the oven
okay<00:02:36.430> now<00:02:36.910> for<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.450> chocolate<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.530> best<00:02:38.739> way

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
okay now for the chocolate the best way

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.650 
okay now for the chocolate the best way
to<00:02:38.980> melt<00:02:39.220> chocolate<00:02:39.430> without<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:40.180> possibly

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
to melt chocolate without it possibly

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.229 
to melt chocolate without it possibly
burning<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.769> put<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.220> saucepan<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:43.000> another

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
burning is to put a saucepan in another

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.729 
burning is to put a saucepan in another
saucepan<00:02:43.480> with<00:02:43.690> loads<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.049> boiling<00:02:44.349> water<00:02:44.379> in

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
saucepan with loads of boiling water in

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.100 
saucepan with loads of boiling water in
that<00:02:45.099> way<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.430> doesn't<00:02:45.579> burn<00:02:45.849> but<00:02:46.629> seeing<00:02:47.019> as

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
that way it doesn't burn but seeing as

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.750 
that way it doesn't burn but seeing as
I'm<00:02:47.260> doing<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.590> really<00:02:47.829> really<00:02:48.040> simple<00:02:48.280> version

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
I'm doing a really really simple version

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.699 
I'm doing a really really simple version
I<00:02:48.879> thought<00:02:49.120> I'd<00:02:49.239> better<00:02:49.420> just<00:02:49.480> do<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.049> pant<00:02:50.349> as

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
I thought I'd better just do a pant as

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.680 
I thought I'd better just do a pant as
you<00:02:50.799> can<00:02:50.920> see<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.370> put<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.030> butter<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.359> the<00:02:52.540> pan

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
you can see I put the butter in the pan

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.240 
you can see I put the butter in the pan
this<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.049> just<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.349> make<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:54.099> little

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
this is just to make it a little

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.619 
this is just to make it a little
lubricant<00:02:54.760> as<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.940> chocolate<00:02:55.269> doesn't<00:02:55.390> burn

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
lubricant as the chocolate doesn't burn

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.800 
lubricant as the chocolate doesn't burn
as<00:02:55.840> easily<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.950> make<00:02:57.340> sure<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:58.209> keep<00:02:58.540> on

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
as easily and make sure that you keep on

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.569 
as easily and make sure that you keep on
staring<00:02:59.170> otherwise<00:02:59.709> it<00:02:59.980> will<00:03:00.069> make<00:03:00.430> the

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
staring otherwise it will make the

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.949 
staring otherwise it will make the
chocolate<00:03:00.730> but<00:03:01.120> even<00:03:01.480> with<00:03:01.629> all<00:03:01.660> one

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
chocolate but even with all one

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.050 
chocolate but even with all one
continuous<00:03:02.079> stirring<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:03.010> wasn't<00:03:03.640> perfect

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
continuous stirring it wasn't perfect

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.940 
continuous stirring it wasn't perfect
once<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.840> chocolates<00:03:05.260> melted<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.739> pan

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
once the chocolates melted in the pan

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.160 
once the chocolates melted in the pan
you<00:03:06.069> then<00:03:06.250> add<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.609> yolks<00:03:06.819> just<00:03:07.599> mix<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.930> round

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
you then add the yolks just mix it round

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.650 
you then add the yolks just mix it round
until<00:03:08.500> it's<00:03:08.680> 41<00:03:09.160> mixture<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.819> then<00:03:09.879> take<00:03:10.540> it
