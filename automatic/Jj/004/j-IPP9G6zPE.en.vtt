00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
which comes in this box these would be

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.700 
which comes in this box these would be
in<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.549> bag<00:00:14.759> but<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.230> see<00:00:16.289> I've<00:00:16.560> already

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
in a bag but as you can see I've already

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.359 
in a bag but as you can see I've already
installed<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.400> these<00:00:17.789> are<00:00:17.910> just<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.180> bunch<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
installed it these are just a bunch of

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.070 
installed it these are just a bunch of
reducers<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.150> have<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> smaller<00:00:21.600> raagh<00:00:21.900> you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
reducers if you have a smaller raagh you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.660 
reducers if you have a smaller raagh you
know<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> number<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
know and they have the number on the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.439 
know and they have the number on the
inside<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.600> match<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.350> two<00:00:25.560> and

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
inside so you can match up the two and

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
inside so you can match up the two and
kind<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.510> fit<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.109> your<00:00:28.140> rod<00:00:28.470> if<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.880> line

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
kind of fit it to your rod if the line

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.900 
kind of fit it to your rod if the line
counter<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.480> too<00:00:30.689> thick<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:30.990> your<00:00:31.320> rod<00:00:31.910> so

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
counter is too thick for your rod so

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.280 
counter is too thick for your rod so
I've<00:00:33.030> put<00:00:33.329> my<00:00:33.360> inserts<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.170> are

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
I've put my inserts here that are

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.049 
I've put my inserts here that are
matching<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.950> numbers<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:38.850> ready

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059

to drop so what you want to do is you
want<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> start<00:00:42.540> off<00:00:42.690> by<00:00:42.719> putting<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> line

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
want to start off by putting the line

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
want to start off by putting the line
under<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.250> loop<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.180> gonna

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
under the the loop here and you're gonna

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.319 
under the the loop here and you're gonna
work<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> around<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.170> top<00:00:49.940> and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.120> through

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the bottom I'm gonna pull the line tight

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.920 
the bottom I'm gonna pull the line tight
over<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:56.180> alright<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.420> another<00:00:57.510> thing<00:00:57.840> you

just<00:01:01.829> gonna<00:01:01.980> spin<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.370> until<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> numbers

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
just gonna spin it until all the numbers

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.340 
just gonna spin it until all the numbers
line<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.790> zero<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.420> you're<00:01:06.930> nice<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
line up to zero and you're nice and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.530 
line up to zero and you're nice and
aligned<00:01:07.700> now<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> good<00:01:09.000> thing<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.210> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
aligned now the good thing about this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.899 
aligned now the good thing about this
line<00:01:09.750> counter<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.650> use<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
line counter is that you can use it to

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.789 
line counter is that you can use it to
drop<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.720> retrieve<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.229> line<00:01:13.439> however

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
drop and to retrieve your line however

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.249 
drop and to retrieve your line however
if<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> big<00:01:15.479> fish<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.110> want

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
if you do have a big fish and you want

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.719 
if you do have a big fish and you want
to<00:01:16.320> reduce<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.770> friction<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.220> your<00:01:17.280> line<00:01:17.549> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to reduce the friction on your line you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
to reduce the friction on your line you
can<00:01:17.909> easily<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.450> grab<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> line<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:20.040> loop<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
can easily just grab the line on loop it

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.109 
can easily just grab the line on loop it
and<00:01:20.820> when<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> line<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.110> tight<00:01:22.320> it'll<00:01:22.619> just

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
and when the line is tight it'll just

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.340 
and when the line is tight it'll just
glide<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.150> over<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.659> line<00:01:24.810> counter<00:01:25.200> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
glide right over the line counter so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.480 
glide right over the line counter so
let's<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:25.590> ahead<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.830> put<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> back<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
let's go ahead and put that back in

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.230 
let's go ahead and put that back in
there<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> put<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.520> back<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.210> can

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
there and put that back in here so I can

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.539 
there and put that back in here so I can
show<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.659> how<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.759> how<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.880> counts<00:01:34.549> alright

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
show you how to how it counts alright

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
show you how to how it counts alright
looped<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.540> when<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:36.869> raise<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.409> year

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
looped up when they raise your this year

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.730 
looped up when they raise your this year
it<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.950> got<00:01:38.100> messed<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:39.560> alright<00:01:40.560> we're

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
it kind of got messed up alright we're

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.710 
it kind of got messed up alright we're
here<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.400> zero<00:01:41.670> right<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> way

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
here all on zero right here now the way

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.510 
here all on zero right here now the way
this<00:01:42.869> works<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> red<00:01:43.770> numbers<00:01:44.220> would<00:01:44.490> be

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
this works is the red numbers would be

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.420 
this works is the red numbers would be
the<00:01:44.790> decimal<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.869> whole<00:01:46.020> yard<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> yards

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the decimal of a whole yard so the yards

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.160 
the decimal of a whole yard so the yards
are<00:01:47.549> being<00:01:47.700> counted<00:01:48.000> over<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> these

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
are being counted over here and these

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.560 
are being counted over here and these
are<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> fraction<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
are just you know the fraction of the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.469 
are just you know the fraction of the
arc<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.549> gonna<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.790> my<00:01:53.939> partner<00:01:54.210> here

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
arc so I'm gonna have my partner here

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.840 
arc so I'm gonna have my partner here
pull<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.899> some<00:01:55.110> line<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.549> watch<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
pull out some line and we can watch this

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.350 
pull out some line and we can watch this
thing<00:01:57.030> count<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.040> goes<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.670> two<00:01:59.939> point

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
thing count so there goes one two point

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.260 
thing count so there goes one two point
eight<00:02:00.770> yards

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.719 

right<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.509> we've<00:02:06.659> hit<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.229> yards<00:02:07.619> about<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
right there we've hit two yards about to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
right there we've hit two yards about to
hit<00:02:08.849> three<00:02:09.060> there's<00:02:09.239> three<00:02:09.300> yards<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.649> those

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
hit three there's three yards so those

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:22.640 
hit three there's three yards so those
are<00:02:10.950> your<00:02:11.069> full<00:02:11.340> yards<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.000> said<00:02:21.650> all

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
are your full yards like I said all

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.479 
are your full yards like I said all
right<00:02:22.769> so<00:02:22.890> we're<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.010> gonna<00:02:23.160> pull<00:02:23.370> out<00:02:23.430> a

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
right so we're just gonna pull out a

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.040 
right so we're just gonna pull out a
little<00:02:23.640> bit<00:02:23.849> more<00:02:23.970> line<00:02:24.180> once<00:02:24.390> we're<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:24.930> about

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
little bit more line once we're at about

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.320 
little bit more line once we're at about
five<00:02:25.319> yards<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:25.800> we're<00:02:25.950> fine<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.459> we<00:02:27.180> have

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.050 
five yards so we're fine here we have
five<00:02:27.599> point<00:02:28.019> 62<00:02:28.560> yards<00:02:28.800> out<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.310> that's<00:02:29.819> how

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
five point 62 yards out and that's how

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.610 
five point 62 yards out and that's how
much<00:02:30.239> that's<00:02:30.690> how<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.870> know<00:02:31.050> how<00:02:31.230> much<00:02:31.410> line

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
much that's how you know how much line

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.470 
much that's how you know how much line
you<00:02:31.739> have<00:02:31.890> out<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.310> know<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.700> know<00:02:32.880> how

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
you have out you know so you know how

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000 
you have out you know so you know how
long<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.810> took<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> bottom<00:02:34.890> or

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
long it took you to get to the bottom or

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.199 
long it took you to get to the bottom or
whatever<00:02:35.220> kind<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.550> fishing<00:02:35.730> you're<00:02:36.030> trying

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
whatever kind of fishing you're trying

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.120 
whatever kind of fishing you're trying
to<00:02:36.269> do<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.410> said<00:02:37.470> once<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.099> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
to do and like I said once you have a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.800 
to do and like I said once you have a
big<00:02:38.400> fish<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.910> if<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.150> want<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.390> reduce<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
big fish on if you want to reduce the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
big fish on if you want to reduce the
friction<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.560> your<00:02:40.680> line<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.640> can

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
friction you have on your line so it can

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
friction you have on your line so it can
run<00:02:41.940> through<00:02:42.120> there<00:02:42.239> guys<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> little<00:02:42.660> bit

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
run through there guys a little bit

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.610 
run through there guys a little bit
easier<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.739> grab<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.010> line<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.989> loop<00:02:46.440> it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
easier just grab your line on loop it

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.170 
easier just grab your line on loop it
from<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:46.920> line<00:02:47.099> counter<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.760> when<00:02:47.849> your<00:02:47.970> line

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
from the line counter and when your line

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.930 
from the line counter and when your line
comes<00:02:48.540> tight<00:02:48.840> it'll<00:02:49.739> glide<00:02:50.099> freely<00:02:50.580> over<00:02:50.849> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
comes tight it'll glide freely over the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.430 
comes tight it'll glide freely over the
line<00:02:51.120> counter<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.690> won't<00:02:51.840> be<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.049> your<00:02:52.080> way<00:02:52.200> or

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
line counter it won't be in your way or

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.320 
line counter it won't be in your way or
anything<00:02:52.530> like<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.940> retrieve

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
anything like that and you can retrieve

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.960 
anything like that and you can retrieve
it<00:02:54.410> with<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> line<00:02:55.680> counter<00:02:56.040> on<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.459> with<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
it with the line counter on but with a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.490 
it with the line counter on but with a
bigger<00:02:57.209> fish<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.690> recommend<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.170> take<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.380> off

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
bigger fish I recommend you take it off

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.979 
bigger fish I recommend you take it off
so<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.890> know<00:03:02.269> again<00:03:03.269> how<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.660> put<00:03:03.900> it

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
so that's you know again how to put it

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.890 
so that's you know again how to put it
on<00:03:04.220> from<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.400> bottom<00:03:05.730> you're<00:03:06.569> gonna<00:03:06.660> work

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
on from the bottom you're gonna work

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.660 
on from the bottom you're gonna work
your<00:03:07.079> way<00:03:07.170> from<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.890> top<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.459> then<00:03:08.549> it's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
your way from the top and then it's

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.849 
your way from the top and then it's
gonna<00:03:08.760> end<00:03:08.940> up<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.269> bottom<00:03:09.739> where<00:03:10.739> you're

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
gonna end up on the bottom where you're

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.550 
gonna end up on the bottom where you're
looping<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.310> only<00:03:11.489> once<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.989> easy<00:03:13.380> roll

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
looping it only once and to easy roll

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.110 
looping it only once and to easy roll
like<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.160> said<00:03:14.370> again<00:03:14.459> you're<00:03:14.700> gonna<00:03:14.760> start

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
like I said again you're gonna start

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.610 
like I said again you're gonna start
with<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.359> black<00:03:15.569> knob<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.200> side<00:03:16.440> and

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
with the black knob on this side and

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.610 
with the black knob on this side and
you're<00:03:16.739> just<00:03:16.799> gonna<00:03:16.980> twist<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:18.350> now<00:03:19.350> your

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you're just gonna twist it now your

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.680 
you're just gonna twist it now your
numbers<00:03:19.980> will<00:03:20.130> eventually<00:03:20.790> start<00:03:21.269> hitting

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
numbers will eventually start hitting

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.440 
numbers will eventually start hitting
zero<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.790> you're<00:03:24.030> ready<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.299> do<00:03:24.420> another

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
zero and you're ready to do another

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.160 
zero and you're ready to do another
