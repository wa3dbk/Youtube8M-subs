00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all the wall friends today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.020
 we're going to see how to improve it 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.240
 fifa 13 connection on both ps3 and su 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.280
 xbox 360 both on pc 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.110
 in particular I will show you how 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.230
 seeing episode 3 is one thing though 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.670
 similar is also done on up to three 60 in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.619
 practice go to the settings of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.760
 network as you saw on the list of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.130
 settings and status of 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.260
 connection and the law of your ip a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.590
 me for example this here you see 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.080
 written 95.2 35 etcetera 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.920
 after you saw lippi not on pc it is 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.649
 even easier to see it go here 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.030
 go out on your web browser and put 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.760
 192.168.1.1 in the address bar 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 then put admin admin as 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.420
 username and password if asked why 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.930
 the standard one if you have n't changed it 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.000
 and then click support mapping here 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 you see virtual servers configured that I have 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.079
 already the thirsty and virtual servers 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.609
 custom now I'll show you a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.949
 example of how he speaks then first 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.489
 what do you put the name of the door that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.830
 want 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.990
 you want to open that you remember anyway 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430
 for which device was opened e 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.860
 also next to a short example 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.710
 description if you want so if then 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 you have to cancel you know what to delete 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.560
 and here the address you saw before 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.130
 pid the ps3 on xbox and 5 if not 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.840
 you know you just need to turn off the device 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.570
 see which ip address goes away to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.670
 then turn it back on which reappears and it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.020
 set below 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.600
 however they are always devices 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 connected what is possible 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.540
 select target shots in with 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.229
 this scrollbar then set the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.710
 doors like how to do it so it's internal 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.259
 be external tcp ip depending on how 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.649
 will be written in the list below as 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.180
 I'll show you soon to do 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.270
 just an example this is not one 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.640
 reach activate put 99 I put 99 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.369
 99 after which click on next for 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.469
 set it you have to put one anyway 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.240
 which is clio in description 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.039
 if for example wrong, just click 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.030
 on modification and tick the box 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.530
 delete in correspondence 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.360
 of the door to be deleted, for example 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.500
 this water we put 99 99 e 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.510
 delete it 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.370
 this is the general example of how it is 7 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.950
 of how the door is cleared then yes 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.870
 does everything quietly and in 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.520
 particular you have to go and put both 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.860
 these here of ps3 and xbox 360 put 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.209
 what puts xbox 60's description 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.060
 goalkeeper of the pci put those for the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.170
 pc that I always put in description 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.170
 so pause if you have to 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.360
 sit to read them on the fly anyway 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.310
 also another video in which I open the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.950
 there are no doors to improve 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.650
 connectivity of ps3 if you are interested and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.330
 after this excursus published on 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.209
 tools after you've set them all 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.519
 the doors that are listed in 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.350
 description click tools then up 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.900
 hi restart in practice after having 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.370
 clicked on hello reboot will restart i 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.250
 router in a minute and a half two minutes 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.250
 everything will work normally again 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.050
 except that you have the doors open you can 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.110
 play fifa 13 in a decent way e 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.150
 finally now other videos are like 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.610
 see other videos are to set 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.070
 static lippi on ps3 what that 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.040
 recommended to do if you have opened doors 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.600
 of the router so that the ps3 has 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.620
 always the same ip and always has 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.660
 those doors open 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.790
 if you connect another device yes 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.560
 take those p the ps3 runs the risk 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.510
 to find more open doors then 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.670
 it is advisable to do this step 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.730
 further the other videos are have 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.010
 nature or otherwise and improve not landi 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.430
 to still sit here if even 89 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.620
 that greets you with love you sign up 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.510
 commented put a big I like it 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.700
 helps a lot I don't like under the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.090
 video and nothing else to tell you 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.090
 next
