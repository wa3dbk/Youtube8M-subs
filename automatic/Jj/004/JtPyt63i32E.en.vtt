00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 what are we going to be with these cartridges 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.000
 clip sachets already used and explains no 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.019
 they run out the glinda clean well the

 it must be very thick here I give a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.280
 show that my cartridges are are 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.110
 thin so we can make a better 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.980
 letter 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.900
