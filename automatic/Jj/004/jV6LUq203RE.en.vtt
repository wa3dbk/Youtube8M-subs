gives you shittier leverages it's a
vertical<00:03:42.419> press<00:03:42.840> immediately<00:03:43.470> because<00:03:43.919> it's

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
vertical press immediately because it's

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.140 
vertical press immediately because it's
a<00:03:44.099> vertical<00:03:44.250> press<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.700> will<00:03:44.819> not<00:03:44.940> look<00:03:45.060> as

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
a vertical press you will not look as

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.940 
a vertical press you will not look as
much<00:03:45.299> weight<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:46.200> because<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.590> musculature

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
much weight and because the musculature

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.860 
much weight and because the musculature
used<00:03:47.370> since<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.299> don't<00:03:48.599> have<00:03:48.690> as<00:03:48.780> many

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870

muscles being engaged in the movement

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.059

you're<00:03:51.359> gonna<00:03:51.450> lift<00:03:51.660> less<00:03:51.840> weight<00:03:52.019> as<00:03:52.079> well<00:03:52.230> so

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
you're gonna lift less weight as well so

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.670 
you're gonna lift less weight as well so
if<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.489> can<00:03:53.669> take<00:03:53.819> your<00:03:54.030> 135<00:03:54.750> overhead<00:03:55.230> press

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
if I can take your 135 overhead press

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.819 
if I can take your 135 overhead press
to<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.160> 225<00:03:57.060> overhead<00:03:57.599> press<00:03:57.810> then<00:03:58.410> in<00:03:58.530> theory

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
to a 225 overhead press then in theory

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.339 
to a 225 overhead press then in theory
one<00:03:59.700> would<00:03:59.849> assume<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.419> your<00:04:01.049> bench<00:04:01.230> press

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
one would assume that your bench press

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.229 
one would assume that your bench press
would<00:04:01.650> go<00:04:01.739> up<00:04:01.799> automatically<00:04:02.310> right<00:04:02.910> if<00:04:03.090> it

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
would go up automatically right if it

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.849 
would go up automatically right if it
doesn't<00:04:03.629> I<00:04:03.810> think<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.530> there<00:04:04.680> are<00:04:04.739> other

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
doesn't I think that there are other

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.440 
doesn't I think that there are other
issues<00:04:05.160> that<00:04:05.340> need<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.639> be<00:04:05.760> addressed<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.239> think

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
issues that need to be addressed I think

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.210 
issues that need to be addressed I think
probably<00:04:06.660> being<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.169> fact<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.980> do<00:04:08.129> not

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
probably being the fact that you do not

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.729 
probably being the fact that you do not
know<00:04:08.400> how<00:04:08.519> to<00:04:08.579> bench<00:04:08.819> press<00:04:08.910> period<00:04:09.739> you're

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
know how to bench press period you're

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.140 
know how to bench press period you're
probably<00:04:10.889> benching<00:04:11.370> with<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.519> completely<00:04:12.000> flat

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
probably benching with a completely flat

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.729 
probably benching with a completely flat
back<00:04:12.449> and<00:04:12.660> you're<00:04:12.780> flaring<00:04:13.169> elbows<00:04:13.410> out<00:04:13.560> like

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
back and you're flaring elbows out like

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.069 
back and you're flaring elbows out like
a<00:04:13.769> motherfucking<00:04:14.340> idiot<00:04:14.549> okay

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
a motherfucking idiot okay

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.099 
a motherfucking idiot okay
but<00:04:16.949> anybody<00:04:17.400> who<00:04:18.389> can<00:04:18.569> dramatically

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
but anybody who can dramatically

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.710 
but anybody who can dramatically
increase<00:04:19.379> the<00:04:19.889> overhead<00:04:20.280> press<00:04:20.489> will<00:04:21.150> yield

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
increase the overhead press will yield

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.839 
increase the overhead press will yield
significant<00:04:22.439> bench<00:04:22.620> press<00:04:22.830> games<00:04:23.069> that's

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
significant bench press games that's

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:24.529 
significant bench press games that's
just<00:04:24.000> how<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.210> is

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
just how it is

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.140 
just how it is
much<00:04:25.020> like<00:04:25.319> improving<00:04:25.919> ones<00:04:26.099> incline<00:04:26.580> bench

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
much like improving ones incline bench

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.939 
much like improving ones incline bench
press<00:04:27.300> would<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.900> course<00:04:28.139> increase<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.740> flat

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
press would of course increase the flat

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.860 
press would of course increase the flat
bench<00:04:29.189> I'm<00:04:30.060> not<00:04:30.270> sure<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:30.479> could<00:04:30.629> say<00:04:30.719> the<00:04:30.840> same

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
bench I'm not sure I could say the same

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.320 
bench I'm not sure I could say the same
thing<00:04:31.259> about<00:04:31.409> a<00:04:31.560> decline<00:04:31.949> press<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:32.969> terms<00:04:33.180> of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
thing about a decline press in terms of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.290 
thing about a decline press in terms of
significant<00:04:34.250> returns<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.939> I<00:04:36.000> think<00:04:36.240> I

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
significant returns but I think I

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.209 
significant returns but I think I
understand<00:04:36.659> the<00:04:36.719> point<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.740> must<00:04:37.979> train

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
understand the point you must train

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.040 
understand the point you must train
harder<00:04:38.520> variations<00:04:39.060> if<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.449> wish<00:04:39.599> to<00:04:39.750> improve

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
harder variations if you wish to improve

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.110 
harder variations if you wish to improve
the<00:04:40.620> conventional<00:04:41.370> way<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.550> doing<00:04:41.669> things

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
the conventional way of doing things

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.390 
the conventional way of doing things
much<00:04:42.780> like<00:04:43.080> doing<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.680> deficit<00:04:44.099> deadlift

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
much like doing a deficit deadlift

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.830 
much like doing a deficit deadlift
improve<00:04:44.969> the<00:04:45.090> conventional<00:04:45.599> deadlift

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
improve the conventional deadlift

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.980 
improve the conventional deadlift
perhaps<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.370> degree<00:04:47.759> to<00:04:48.090> which<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.750> gain

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
perhaps the degree to which you gain

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.709 
perhaps the degree to which you gain
will<00:04:49.800> vary<00:04:50.009> monks<00:04:50.580> among<00:04:51.060> pushing<00:04:51.509> the<00:04:51.569> person

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
will vary monks among pushing the person

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.589 
will vary monks among pushing the person
but<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.800> state<00:04:53.009> that<00:04:53.190> no<00:04:53.430> gains<00:04:53.879> will<00:04:54.300> be<00:04:54.330> made

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
but the state that no gains will be made

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.089 
but the state that no gains will be made
there's<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.080> a<00:04:55.139> simply<00:04:55.440> false<00:04:55.680> statement

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
there's just a simply false statement

there's just a simply false statement
and<00:04:56.280> I'm<00:04:56.610> always<00:04:56.879> disappointed<00:04:57.629> when<00:04:58.110> people

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
and I'm always disappointed when people

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.439 
and I'm always disappointed when people
disregard<00:04:58.830> overhead<00:04:59.550> pressing<00:04:59.909> just<00:05:00.150> because

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
disregard overhead pressing just because

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.659 
disregard overhead pressing just because
they<00:05:00.870> feel<00:05:01.139> that<00:05:01.259> it's<00:05:01.409> not<00:05:01.560> specific<00:05:02.129> to<00:05:02.370> the

they feel that it's not specific to the
