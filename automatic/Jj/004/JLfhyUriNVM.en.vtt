need to work on what's your assessment

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 
need to work on what's your assessment
of<00:00:21.720> their<00:00:21.900> overall<00:00:22.199> team<00:00:22.410> performance<00:00:22.859> it's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
of their overall team performance it's

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.080 
of their overall team performance it's
pretty<00:00:23.730> good

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
pretty good

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.800 
pretty good
I<00:00:24.119> think<00:00:24.980> mentally<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.070> pretty<00:00:26.279> solid<00:00:26.939> robell

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
I think mentally is pretty solid robell

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
I think mentally is pretty solid robell
lettuce<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> wall<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.590> kept<00:00:29.490> everyone<00:00:29.699> calm

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
lettuce the wall just kept everyone calm

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.080 
lettuce the wall just kept everyone calm
I<00:00:30.359> think<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.439> needed<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.189> helped

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
I think is what we needed and it helped

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.750 
I think is what we needed and it helped
us<00:00:33.180> because<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.690> came<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.610> obviously<00:00:35.610> put

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
us because we came out and obviously put

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.030 
us because we came out and obviously put
a<00:00:35.790> lot<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.969> pressure<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.270> Australia<00:00:37.040> which

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a lot of pressure on Australia which

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.580 
a lot of pressure on Australia which
helped<00:00:38.820> us<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> win<00:00:39.390> set<00:00:40.290> at<00:00:40.410> halftime

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
helped us get the win set at halftime

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.900 
helped us get the win set at halftime
being<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.190> were<00:00:41.250> noticeably<00:00:41.670> more<00:00:41.760> in

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
being there were noticeably more in

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.209 
being there were noticeably more in
tension<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.540> second<00:00:42.899> half<00:00:42.930> he<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.100> just

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
tension in that second half he was just

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.080 
tension in that second half he was just
more<00:00:44.969> accuracy<00:00:46.160> with<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.460> intent<00:00:47.969> was

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
more accuracy with the intent was

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
more accuracy with the intent was
definitely<00:00:48.600> there<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.770> just<00:00:49.950> needed

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
definitely there I think we just needed

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.029 
definitely there I think we just needed
to<00:00:50.370> control<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> little<00:00:51.329> bit<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.890> put<00:00:52.890> more

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
to control it a little bit and put more

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.880 
to control it a little bit and put more
pressure<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.370> them<00:00:53.640> rather<00:00:53.789> than<00:00:54.000> ourselves

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
pressure on them rather than ourselves

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.260 
pressure on them rather than ourselves
that's<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.100> did<00:00:56.309> will<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.910> please<00:00:57.090> your

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that's what we did will you please your

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.760 
that's what we did will you please your
own<00:00:57.360> ball<00:00:57.570> carrying<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.079> think<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> cushy

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
own ball carrying I think it was a cushy

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.049 
own ball carrying I think it was a cushy
moment<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> first<00:00:59.340> half<00:00:59.579> wasn't<00:00:59.850> there<00:00:59.969> were

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
moment the first half wasn't there were

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.580 
moment the first half wasn't there were
you<00:01:00.210> bust<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.750> few<00:01:00.870> tackles<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> field

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you bust for a few tackles get the field

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.399 
you bust for a few tackles get the field
position<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> our<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:02.760> penalties

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
position for one of our into penalties

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.740 
position for one of our into penalties
yeah<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.129> try<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.760> force<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> too

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
yeah I think I try to not force it too

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.600 
yeah I think I try to not force it too
much<00:01:06.900> when<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> feel<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.189> go<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.400> just

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
much when you feel you can go you just

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.359 
much when you feel you can go you just
go<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.350> did<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.619> much<00:01:10.860> better<00:01:11.130> today

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
go I think I did that much better today

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.670 
go I think I did that much better today
rather<00:01:11.640> than<00:01:11.930> putting<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> onus<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.350> myself

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
rather than putting the onus on myself

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
rather than putting the onus on myself
to<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.250> Harry<00:01:14.490> you've<00:01:14.909> got<00:01:14.939> great

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299

here<00:01:34.680> he<00:01:34.979> carries<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.549> your<00:01:35.909> hidden<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
here he carries in your hidden the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.730 
here he carries in your hidden the
breakdowns<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.439> pressure<00:01:37.530> on

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
breakdowns to really put the pressure on

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.100 
breakdowns to really put the pressure on
Australia<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:39.150> worked<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> quite<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
Australia I think worked on it quite a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.859 
Australia I think worked on it quite a
lot<00:01:40.170> by<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> Audion<00:01:41.700> during<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> week<00:01:42.659> that

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
lot by the Audion during the week that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.210 
lot by the Audion during the week that
that's<00:01:43.380> an<00:01:43.530> area<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:43.920> were<00:01:44.040> going<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
that's an area that we were going to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.210 
that's an area that we were going to
attack<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.909> did<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.210> today<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.829> think

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
attack and we did that today but I think

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.999 
attack and we did that today but I think
it's<00:01:47.460> easier<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> pay<00:01:48.290> beside<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
it's easier when you pay beside to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
it's easier when you pay beside to
players<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.490> fit<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.820> those<00:01:51.299> three<00:01:51.509> boys<00:01:51.659> gives

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
players as fit as those three boys gives

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.780 
players as fit as those three boys gives
you<00:01:52.530> opportunities<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.070> pick<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.640> choose

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
you opportunities to pick and choose

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.370 
you opportunities to pick and choose
when<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.240> go<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.659> really<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.170> hard

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
when you can go in and really go hard

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
when you can go in and really go hard
off<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.530> ball<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.969> complement

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
off the ball and I think the complement

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.950 
off the ball and I think the complement
is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
is

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.160 
is
very<00:01:58.229> well<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:59.299> they<00:02:00.299> played<00:02:00.540> well<00:02:00.690> today<00:02:00.900> but

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
very well and they played well today but

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.600 
very well and they played well today but
like<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.440> said<00:02:01.650> can't<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.130> too<00:02:02.280> carried<00:02:02.430> away

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
like I said can't get too carried away

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.390 
like I said can't get too carried away
with<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.530> run<00:02:04.530> next<00:02:04.740> weekend<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.250> week

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
with it run next weekend and the week

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.749 
with it run next weekend and the week
after<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.220> focus<00:02:08.580> now

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
after and I think that's the focus now

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.190 
after and I think that's the focus now

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420

I think that definitely added to it and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.580 
I think that definitely added to it and
him<00:02:45.390> standing<00:02:45.690> next<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.959> me<00:02:46.140> in<00:02:46.200> national

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590
