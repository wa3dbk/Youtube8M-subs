00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
let's start with the ports we got a AC

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.580 
let's start with the ports we got a AC
adapter<00:02:23.840> here<00:02:25.600> put<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.690> camera<00:02:27.080> right<00:02:27.170> here

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
ports and the jack in for the combined

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.890 
ports and the jack in for the combined

in<00:02:42.050> front<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:45.790> menthol<00:02:46.790> for<00:02:47.000> there<00:02:47.150> as<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
in front and menthol for there as the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.330 
in front and menthol for there as the
memory<00:02:48.110> card<00:02:48.440> another<00:02:49.250> USB<00:02:49.640> port<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.920> an<00:02:51.920> HDMI

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
memory card another USB port and an HDMI

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.750 
memory card another USB port and an HDMI
out<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:56.420> thing<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.990> there's<00:02:57.290> no<00:02:57.380> an

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
out and the thing is that there's no an

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.630 
out and the thing is that there's no an
Ethernet<00:02:58.760> port<00:02:59.470> in<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.590> version<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.340> you

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
Ethernet port in this version so you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.780 
Ethernet port in this version so you
might<00:03:01.970> require<00:03:04.840> an<00:03:05.840> adapter<00:03:06.530> for<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:07.040> so

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
might require an adapter for that so

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.360 
might require an adapter for that so
this<00:03:08.480> blue<00:03:08.690> guy<00:03:08.870> looks<00:03:09.200> let's<00:03:10.040> see<00:03:10.160> how<00:03:10.220> it

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
say before the screen is really high in

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.199 
say before the screen is really high in
performances<00:03:17.680> struck<00:03:18.680> but<00:03:18.890> feels<00:03:19.100> nice<00:03:19.400> to

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
the touch the keyboard is as narrow

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.220 
the touch the keyboard is as narrow
looks<00:03:25.489> narrow<00:03:25.790> bar<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.480> similar<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.140> the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
looks narrow bar is similar to the

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.640

the<00:03:30.739> numbers<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.250> here<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.239> looks<00:03:32.269> nicer

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
the numbers in here so it looks nicer
