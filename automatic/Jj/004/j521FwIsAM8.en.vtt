 - [Orange 潺潺] 

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:05.473
 Hello, my world. 

00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:07.423
 Wow! look at me! 

00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:10.028
 I am a real fool! 

00:00:10.028 --> 00:00:11.463
 Hey, hey! who are you? 

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:13.061
 - Hey, I am Steve. 

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:14.368
 - Don't take the wrong way, Steve, 

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:16.971
 But you look like a square. 

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.200
 -what. Ok. I have not heard of it before. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.682
 - So, I am new here. 

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:24.520
 Can you tell me the "block"? 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.080
 - Wow cool. Complete a square and two blocky jokes in less than ten seconds. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.600
 What are you, some kind of plaid? 

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:31.888
 - Is she alright? I don't even know her. [laugh] 

00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:34.724
 - [Mocking] I am not here. 

00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:37.830
 -and many more. I will "roll" with you. [laugh] 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.922
 [嘣-嘣-嘣-嘣] 

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:41.247
 - Why are you following me? -I do not know. 

00:00:41.247 --> 00:00:43.819
 Why are you playing the tree? - I am mining wood. 

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.408
 You are very welcome to stop useless and help me. 

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:48.685
 - Ok, I am willing, but I don't have any hands. 

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:51.650
 Still a weapon. Still legs. [laugh] 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.942
 - Are you a kind of rookie or something? 

00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:57.050
 - I am not a rookie. I am a cube. [laugh] 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.139
 - You can't mine anything, are you? 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:00.075
 - Who, who cares? 

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:03.136
 In any case, these are not "my". [laugh] 

00:01:03.136 --> 00:01:05.886
 - Look, I don't think you know what kind of danger you are doing. 

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:07.484
 This is my world, buddy. 

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.332
 Before the sun goes down, you need to get the wood and make the sticks. 

00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:13.523
 Making wooden boards, making handmade tables, making tools, ore, 

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:17.329
 And build a house. Otherwise, the creeper will eat you alive. 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.640
 - [Singing]: Cheyou climbing plants 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.650
 Where are you getting those voyeurs? 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.275
 Cheyou climbing plant 

00:01:24.275 --> 00:01:26.564
 Where are you getting those eyes [laughs] 

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:28.145
 - Who are you talking to? 

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:29.313
 - This is a square sheep. 

00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:31.887
 He has strange eyes. 

00:01:31.887 --> 00:01:35.425
 [Demon Musical] Weird... square... eyes. 

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:37.005
 - Dude, wow. 

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.278
 you are annoying. 

00:01:39.278 --> 00:01:40.682
 Good luck, sadness. 

00:01:40.682 --> 00:01:42.710
 - Poor Steve has an angry management problem. 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.346
 He should "block" him for a while with his therapist. 

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:50.355
 Hey, the house was completed just before sunset. 

00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:52.976
 I don't like the guy who doesn't help the orange. 

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:55.971
 Oh, he will be born again and learn. 

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.153
 I will make some snacks in the kitchen before I play the sacks - 

00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:00.073
 Wow! 

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:01.827
 - Hey. Hey, hey, Steve! 

00:02:01.827 --> 00:02:03.651
 - Dude, what are you doing at my house? 

00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:05.752
 - Hey, hey, Steve, hey! -what? ! 

00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:09.044
 - "Orange" Are you glad that you built a Minecraft kitchen for us? [laugh] 

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:10.260
 -"we"? Yes, 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.431
 However, I am not actually a green block. I am a- 

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:13.412
 - Fang Pear! 

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:14.815
 - I hope you don't mind if we brought our friends. 

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:16.516
 Yeah, thanks to a bunch, Stevereno! 

00:02:16.516 --> 00:02:18.013
 -great! I like to be a block 

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:20.666
 A sticky, sticky marshmallow with love! great! 

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.338
 - We really appreciate you saving us from the mobs there. 

00:02:23.338 --> 00:02:26.032
 - Where are the mobs? (loud) How is it here? 

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:28.580
 -Hey! Hey, Steve! Hey! Hey, Steve! 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.886
 - Don't want to hear, Glover. You and your friends must leave. 

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:35.240
 - Hey, hey! - I said I don't want to hear it! 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:46.120
 I built every part of the house myself. Every stone, every piece of wood is laid. Every stone, every piece of wood is laid. Let every door be the second. If you don't have a hand, how did you get in? - The back door is open. 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.040
 - Hey, Steve! -what? 

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:48.860
 Cannibals! 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.623
 [Crawler roar, Steve screams] 

00:02:50.623 --> 00:02:55.470
 Wow! It seems that Steve put it on the chin "square"! [laugh] 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.232
 - [呻吟] Can we ask you to build some cool stuff? 

00:02:58.232 --> 00:02:59.698
 - You ruined it, Fang Pear. 

00:02:59.698 --> 00:03:03.571
