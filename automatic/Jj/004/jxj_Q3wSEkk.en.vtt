00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
you can safety the oil filter the oil

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.210 
you can safety the oil filter the oil
screen<00:01:07.340> which<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.850> way<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:08.660> there<00:01:08.869> as<00:01:09.020> well<00:01:09.890> as

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
and then I've been letting the filter

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.240 
and then I've been letting the filter
hang<00:01:31.310> upside<00:01:31.759> down<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:32.840> drain<00:01:33.110> from<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.130> as

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
hang upside down to drain from it as

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.139 
hang upside down to drain from it as
much<00:01:34.429> as<00:01:34.610> we<00:01:34.640> can't<00:01:35.530> put<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.619> back<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.280> box

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
much as we can't put it back in the box

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.570 
much as we can't put it back in the box
that<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.599> new<00:01:38.720> filter<00:01:38.990> came<00:01:39.289> in<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.709> then

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
for any ferrous materials okay so here

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.990 
for any ferrous materials okay so here
we<00:01:51.229> are<00:01:51.410> underneath<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> airplane<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.489> this

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
we are underneath the airplane and this

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.980 
we are underneath the airplane and this
is<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.300> nose<00:01:53.509> gear<00:01:53.780> section

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
is the nose gear section

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.710 
is the nose gear section
there's<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.560> more<00:01:56.180> access<00:01:57.180> panel<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.659> we

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
there's one more access panel that we

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.780 
there's one more access panel that we
need<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> take<00:01:58.140> off

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
need to take off

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.740 
need to take off
looks<00:02:00.750> like

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.740 

most<00:02:04.260> direct<00:02:04.740> trader<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.700> behind<00:02:06.090> our<00:02:06.330> panel

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
most direct trader is behind our panel

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.910 
most direct trader is behind our panel
and<00:02:07.350> there<00:02:07.890> are<00:02:08.040> two<00:02:08.369> little<00:02:09.200> hoses<00:02:10.200> those<00:02:10.740> are

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
and there are two little hoses those are

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
and there are two little hoses those are
the<00:02:11.009> only<00:02:11.100> hoses<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.910> whole<00:02:12.090> hydraulic

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the only hoses of the whole hydraulic

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.700 
the only hoses of the whole hydraulic
system<00:02:14.300> like<00:02:15.300> those<00:02:15.510> affected<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.350> time<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
system like those affected it's time to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.110 
system like those affected it's time to
change<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.070> should<00:02:17.340> change<00:02:17.520> him<00:02:17.700> every<00:02:17.910> 10

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
change it should change him every 10

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.770 
change it should change him every 10
years<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:19.760> there's<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.820> nose<00:02:21.030> gear<00:02:21.240> actuator

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
years and there's a nose gear actuator

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.940 
years and there's a nose gear actuator
and<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:23.490> two<00:02:23.670> hoses<00:02:23.880> there's<00:02:24.240> one<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:24.950> and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and the two hoses there's one here and

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.380 
and the two hoses there's one here and
the<00:02:26.160> other<00:02:26.280> one<00:02:26.460> here<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.640> think<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the other one here I think this is the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.730 
the other one here I think this is the
down<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.530> look

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
down and this is the up so they look

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.000 
down and this is the up so they look
pretty<00:02:34.980> dry<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.550> outside<00:02:35.580> that's<00:02:36.390> good

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
pretty dry on the outside that's good

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
pretty dry on the outside that's good
but<00:02:38.010> as<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.030> said<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.690> should<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:39.930> replaced

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
but as I said it should be replaced

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.140 
but as I said it should be replaced
every<00:02:40.500> 10<00:02:40.830> years<00:02:43.459> okay<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.520> we're<00:02:44.760> gonna<00:02:44.880> take

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
every 10 years okay so we're gonna take

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.630 
every 10 years okay so we're gonna take
the<00:02:45.360> spinner<00:02:45.990> off<00:02:46.200> spin<00:02:46.950> eyes<00:02:47.130> held<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.459> place

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the spinner off spin eyes held in place

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.580 
the spinner off spin eyes held in place
