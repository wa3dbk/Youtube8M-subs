partnered<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:43.979> harmonics<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.810> problem<00:01:46.170> is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
partnered with harmonics the problem is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.289

you're<00:01:46.619> not<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:46.890> dancing<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.790> about<00:01:48.060> as

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
you're not really dancing it's about as

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.960 
you're not really dancing it's about as
much<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> dancing<00:01:49.200> game<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.590> DDR<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.490> all

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
much as a dancing game as DDR in all

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.639 
much as a dancing game as DDR in all
honesty<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.600> really<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.409> bit<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
honesty it really is a little bit of a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.399 
honesty it really is a little bit of a
step<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.040> above<00:01:53.340> DDR<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.960> tracking

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
step up above DDR because it's tracking

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.440 
step up above DDR because it's tracking
movement<00:01:55.770> besides<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.340> your<00:01:56.490> feet<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
movement besides just your feet but you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.850 
movement besides just your feet but you

other room plug it into an amplifier and
just<00:02:33.330> start<00:02:33.510> jamming<00:02:33.810> out<00:02:33.930> they<00:02:34.530> also<00:02:34.650> showed

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just start jamming out they also showed

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.610 
just start jamming out they also showed
the<00:02:35.040> keyboard<00:02:35.370> peripheral<00:02:35.850> which<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:37.470> was<00:02:37.590> a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the keyboard peripheral which it was a

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.810 
the keyboard peripheral which it was a
little<00:02:37.800> bit<00:02:37.920> more<00:02:38.070> narrow<00:02:38.370> than<00:02:38.460> I<00:02:38.610> was

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
little bit more narrow than I was

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.300 
little bit more narrow than I was
expecting<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.740> thought<00:02:40.740> that<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.040> was<00:02:41.130> going<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
expecting I thought that it was going to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.120 
expecting I thought that it was going to
be<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.760> full-sized<00:02:42.300> keyboard<00:02:42.540> which<00:02:43.230> it's

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
be a full-sized keyboard which it's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.830 
be a full-sized keyboard which it's
going<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.340> work<00:02:44.520> either<00:02:44.640> way<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.690> it's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
going to work either way and it's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.360 
going to work either way and it's
probably<00:02:46.140> better<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.530> first-time

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
probably better for first-time

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.270 
probably better for first-time
keyboardists<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.600> was<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.170> expecting<00:02:49.530> bigger

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
keyboardists I was just expecting bigger

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.670 
keyboardists I was just expecting bigger

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
of love tekmoto he showed off a game

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.180 
of love tekmoto he showed off a game
called<00:03:00.090> quantum<00:03:00.600> theory<00:03:00.930> at<00:03:01.440> first<00:03:01.650> glance<00:03:01.770> it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
called quantum theory at first glance it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.890 
called quantum theory at first glance it
really<00:03:02.610> bears<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:03.000> striking<00:03:03.180> resemblance<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
really bears a striking resemblance to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.380 
really bears a striking resemblance to
Gears<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.230> War<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.760> reason<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.239> does

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
Gears of War and the reason that it does

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.240 
Gears of War and the reason that it does
this<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.810> you're<00:03:07.260> running<00:03:07.860> around<00:03:07.950> shooting

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
this is you're running around shooting

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.880 
this is you're running around shooting
things<00:03:08.580> hiding<00:03:08.820> behind<00:03:09.060> cover<00:03:09.390> but<00:03:10.140> things

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
things hiding behind cover but things

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.830 
things hiding behind cover but things
change<00:03:11.250> right<00:03:11.489> around<00:03:11.730> there<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.510> reason

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
change right around there the reason

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.060 
change right around there the reason
they<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.350> because<00:03:13.620> your<00:03:13.890> main

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
they do that is because your main

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.880 
they do that is because your main
character<00:03:14.550> is<00:03:15.170> basically<00:03:16.170> crawling<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:16.680> into

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
character is basically crawling up into

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.060 
character is basically crawling up into
a<00:03:16.950> tower<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:18.180> organic<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.500> towers<00:03:19.830> alive

history<00:04:07.390> from<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.599> Iliad<00:04:08.020> but<00:04:08.470> they<00:04:08.530> also

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
history from the Iliad but they also

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.020 
history from the Iliad but they also
have<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.069> create<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.370> little<00:04:09.550> bit<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.760> their<00:04:09.879> own

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
have to create a little bit of their own

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.610 
have to create a little bit of their own
because<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.420> Iliad<00:04:10.690> only<00:04:10.870> expands<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:11.440> much

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620
