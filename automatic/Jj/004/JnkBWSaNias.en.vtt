00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.440
 hello that such friends as are I hope 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.150
 that are quite well in the 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.080
 today's video we're going to explain how 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.930
 we can revive or flash or restore 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.510
 our alcatel box-seven since for 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.759
 some reason we have problems with him or 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.880
 simply for this reason that we see in 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.880
 screen that when trying to turn it on it 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.199
 remains in the alcatel one touch logo or 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.540
 stays in the company logo 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.090
 let's say when it 's clear it stays 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.820
 then in the logo and it does not turn on its 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.910
 normal functions stays there as if 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.310
 was blocked and does not turn on nor 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.010
 nothing happens then, as you can see 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.250
 on the screen the cell phone that you see in that 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.910
 image is not the alcatel pop it 7 but what 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.470
 what did I do 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.690
 I wanted to use that image for how 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.690
 reference to the problem that more or less 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.180
 we have in the alcatel pop it is 7 more or 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.060
 less so is the problem but then the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.400
 tutorial today we're going to do it based 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.979
 in the alcatel or bce 7 so that 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.689
 We learn how to revive it without 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.789
 need to take it to service 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.470
 technical then first of all we 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.150
 we are going to download two programs 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.310
 I will leave in the information or in the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.800
 description of the video some are the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.740
 cell phone drivers and the other is the 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.010
 program that will be responsible for returning to 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.130
 install the rom again from factory in 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.920
 the cell phone and so the solar 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.760
 look like new again then let's go 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.110
 to extract the program as I tell you 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.570
 I'll leave them in the description in the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.280
 video information the links so that 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.510
 you download them then once 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.510
 already downloaded we are going to decompress the 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.270
 programs one are the drivers first 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.690
 that everything in this step we are going to connect 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.510
 the cell completely turned off 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.180
 obviously to our computer we are going to 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.580
 connect and when the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.920
 computer what good re listen more 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.170
 well the sound like that is me 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.259
 recognizing the cell then 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.570
 we execute this program we are going here to 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.100
 the folder called smartphone 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:19.520
 driver we choose as it is usually 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.580
 this that says x 80 x 86 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.950
 what is 32 bit windows and you 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.280
 they have 64-bit windows because it will be the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.780
 from above with usually always 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.650
 we have in our boxes is the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.580
 32 bit or 86 bit that is the same 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:41.069
 then we select this and we give here 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.690
 Right click where it says espn start 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.790
 and we run as administrator 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.070
 and we wait a moment for that 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.410
 screen alone install the drivers and 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.910
 come back and remove that screen again 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.790
 black 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.230
 once we have installed the drivers 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.030
 It makes an error to me because in 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.640
 I do not have a cell phone 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.290
 physically to do the procedure 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.570
 but I am explaining to you 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.040
 they do and it's common and I'm this 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.900
 procedure I have already done several 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.630
 times with the alcatel pop it feels 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.090
 when will it be in me to me and here at 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.370
 business a cell phone to revive this is 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.260
 the procedure that is done is good 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.410
 Once the drivers are installed, we will 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.780
 go back back and now let's install 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.920
 the bright mobile the one in its 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.420
 version 4.2 point 3 and we will execute 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.760
 the program that is the one that is going to 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.340
 reinstall the rumba again from 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.620
 new in our alcatel pop it 7 we go 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.750
 to install it common and current 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.510
 let's in next install the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.540
 procedure is quite easy it does not have 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.060
 no complicate until this point and 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.040
 We can withdraw to no forgiveness 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.680
 we leave the cell phone still connected 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.010
 off does not matter if it went on 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.230
 it does not matter if yes it appears some 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 we will leave it still and with and 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.430
 well here we have installed the program 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.799
 let's finish and now we're going to 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.319
 often to forgive at the beginning of our 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.780
 computer and we're going to run the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.420
 program that is called mobile 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.230
 let's see here is already installed 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.570
 mobile great that 4.2 point 3 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.690
 that's the program for the alcatel boxes 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.320
 7 and others that right now we will see what 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.260
 they are about which cell we can go back 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.480
 to relive it with this program 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.000
 then we run the program here 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.420
 we select the Spanish language we give in 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.820
 okay 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.050
 and finally as you can see it has already 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.210
 I'm sorry, I'm starting the program 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.510
 It's just a question, then, from looking for 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.510
 the 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.920
 the cell phone that we are going to relive 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.830
 let's say in this case it would be 70 40 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.710
 which is the alcatel possesses 7 then 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.700
 we select the cell phone or the reference 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:06.270
 because of the cell phone that we want to revive and 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:09.870
 as you can see 70 40 is 70 40 is 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:14.850
 a general version let's say you serve it 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:19.260
 what is the alca you own 7 70 40 x 70 40 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.480
 at 70 40 d and so on 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.850
 terminations this is a version 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.620
 general that will serve them to anyone 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.419
 of these that I just named as 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.969
 can see in the list there are several 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.610
 cell phones 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:34.759
 If your cell phone is not on this list of 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.249
 all forms this because I have another 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.549
 video that is made mostly for 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:42.949
 alcatel 60 30 and light delight 2 mini 

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:45.229
 and others more because I'll leave you here 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.209
 a link for you to go to that 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.159
 another video in case they do not find the 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.709
 cell phone list but like this video 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:54.079
 is focused on alcatel pop se 7 

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:57.949
 then this would be the steps of 

00:05:54.079 --> 00:06:00.289
 then select the version of from your 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.349
 cellular then in this case it would be the 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:06.100
 70 40 sorry the version not the reference 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.440
 and we start 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.570
 we read the warnings says that good 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.580
 happy and that the system speaks good not 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.990
 we have another thing that is very good 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.880
 important is that the cell phone is 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.569
 fully charged than the battery 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:23.050
 is full and we give in following 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.699
 at this time then the program we 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.979
 says to start please make sure 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:31.360
 that the battery of your mobile phone is 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:33.909
 Fully charged and good chairs yes 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.099
 to see if it is downloaded during the process 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:37.599
 It may happen that your equipment is no longer 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.759
 turn on again you want to continue 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:42.250
 So that's why I tell you that the 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:46.240
 cellular in this moment of being so 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:49.810
 minus 50% of the battery charge 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.699
 then we accept give on and in 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.879
 this moment the program is already 

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:57.039
 looking for the cell phone or that in this 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:59.889
 occasion at this time we should be 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:02.590
 connecting and our alcatel box-seven 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.479
 and the program will automatically do what 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.370
 yours as I tell you at this time no 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:09.009
 I have the alcatel box feels at hand 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.050
 so you can see how it is but 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.939
 Here I bring you the ones I bring to you 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.310
 and from then on just follow 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:18.069
 the steps of the program and remember in 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.229
 this time the cell phone is going to 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:24.009
 have to connect completely off 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:26.500
 to the computer and the computer now to 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:28.509
 your normal functions and you will go back to 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.169
 install the rom this process is pretty 

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:34.300
 delayed because the stock rom this one 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:37.900
 alcatel pop feels is quite heavy 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:41.139
 and sometimes it takes between 34 hours 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.400
 loading installing the rom and then 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.919
 Nothing better I hope you liked it 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.949
 the video and hopefully do as they can 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:50.770
 go back to reliving his alcatel pop 67 and so 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:53.050
 save a few pesos and take it to the 

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.490
 technical service that's all I hope that 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.270
 you liked it, we'll see you in a 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.270
 next occasion
