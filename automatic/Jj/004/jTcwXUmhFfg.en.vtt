00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
that whether you win or not you sort of

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
that whether you win or not you sort of
one<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> nomination

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
one when you get that nomination

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
one when you get that nomination

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
actually doing the voice back way back

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.360 
actually doing the voice back way back
when<00:02:19.780> do<00:02:20.780> they<00:02:20.930> encourage<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.800> do<00:02:21.950> extra

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
when do they encourage you to do extra

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.250 
when do they encourage you to do extra
stuff<00:02:22.400> for<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.760> DVD<00:02:23.090> when<00:02:23.690> you're<00:02:23.930> working

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
stuff for the DVD when you're working

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.880 
stuff for the DVD when you're working
like<00:02:24.650> how<00:02:24.740> does<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.980> all<00:02:25.040> work<00:02:25.190> no<00:02:26.890> they

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
like how does that all work no they

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.620 
like how does that all work no they
actually<00:02:28.130> they<00:02:28.580> videotape<00:02:29.060> us<00:02:29.270> while<00:02:29.450> we're

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
actually they videotape us while we're

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.570 
actually they videotape us while we're
working<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.290> I<00:02:30.410> think<00:02:30.650> they<00:02:30.770> just<00:02:30.920> sort<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.220> co

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
working and I think they just sort of co

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.360 
working and I think they just sort of co
from<00:02:32.480> what<00:02:32.690> they<00:02:32.840> have<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.560> decide<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.220> this

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
from what they have and decide that this

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.220 
from what they have and decide that this
piece<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.910> piece<00:02:35.150> would<00:02:35.390> be<00:02:35.570> really<00:02:35.990> good

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
piece of that piece would be really good

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.930 
piece of that piece would be really good
for<00:02:36.730> for<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.790> blu-ray<00:02:38.320> packaging<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.700> then

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
for for the blu-ray packaging and then

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.580 
for for the blu-ray packaging and then
sometimes<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.600> extra<00:02:41.930> interviews<00:02:42.380> or

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
sometimes you do extra interviews or

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.960 
sometimes you do extra interviews or
something<00:02:42.890> like<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.070> but<00:02:43.370> they'll<00:02:43.550> add<00:02:43.760> on

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
something like that but they'll add on

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.300 
something like that but they'll add on
but<00:02:44.330> generally<00:02:44.840> unless<00:02:45.710> they've<00:02:46.130> done

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
but generally unless they've done

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.830 
but generally unless they've done
something<00:02:46.520> specific<00:02:47.090> it's<00:02:47.210> just<00:02:47.690> what

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
something specific it's just what

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.120 
something specific it's just what
they've<00:02:47.990> taken<00:02:48.200> from<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.650> work<00:02:48.830> that<00:02:49.010> you're
