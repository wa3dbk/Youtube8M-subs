phone<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.540> test<00:01:45.810> inside<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.380> case<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.799> see<00:01:46.950> how

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
phone a test inside this case of see how

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
phone a test inside this case of see how
easy<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> goes<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.869> goes<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.290> pretty

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
easy it goes in so it goes in pretty

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
easy it goes in so it goes in pretty
damn<00:01:49.799> easy<00:01:49.829> by<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> left<00:01:50.670> side<00:01:50.880> first<00:01:51.210> where

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
damn easy by the left side first where

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.389 
damn easy by the left side first where
the<00:01:51.570> controls<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> will<00:01:53.220> just

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the controls are and then it will just

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.660 
the controls are and then it will just
snap<00:01:53.700> into<00:01:54.000> place<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.439> now<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> phone<00:01:56.640> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
snap into place so now that the phone is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.050 
snap into place so now that the phone is
in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.149> case<00:01:57.619> it<00:01:58.619> does<00:01:59.159> feel<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.430> thin<00:01:59.909> I

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
in the case it does feel very thin I

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
in the case it does feel very thin I
must<00:02:00.390> admit<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.719> especially<00:02:01.290> down<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
must admit that especially down the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.429 
must admit that especially down the
sides<00:02:01.909> but<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.360> thing<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.049> point<00:02:04.259> out

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
sides but the one thing I can point out

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.980 
sides but the one thing I can point out
straight<00:02:04.890> away<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.460> I'm<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.600> sure<00:02:06.840> whether

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
straight away that I'm not sure whether

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.740 
straight away that I'm not sure whether
or<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.640> actual<00:02:09.060> sides<00:02:09.420> of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
or a like or not is the actual sides of

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.490 
or a like or not is the actual sides of
the<00:02:10.020> case<00:02:10.289> come<00:02:10.709> over<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> top

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
the case come over the top

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.440 
the case come over the top
the<00:02:11.620> phone<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.250> when<00:02:12.850> you're<00:02:13.000> rubbing<00:02:13.360> your

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the phone so when you're rubbing your

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.910 
the phone so when you're rubbing your
fingers<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.050> cider<00:02:14.260> then<00:02:14.410> if<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.770> can

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
fingers on the cider then if you can

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.430 
fingers on the cider then if you can
hear<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.280> via<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.700> camera<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.990> do<00:02:17.230> get<00:02:17.380> a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
hear that via the camera you do get a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.320 
hear that via the camera you do get a
bit<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.680> extrusion<00:02:18.220> which<00:02:18.760> obviously<00:02:19.030> means

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
bit of extrusion which obviously means

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.090 
bit of extrusion which obviously means
that<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.720> doesn't<00:02:20.050> feel<00:02:20.200> too<00:02:20.470> sleek<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:21.010> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
that it doesn't feel too sleek on the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.490 
that it doesn't feel too sleek on the
top<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:22.030> only<00:02:22.300> thing<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.570> does<00:02:22.780> do<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.050> it<00:02:23.260> will

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
top the only thing it does do is it will

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.080 
top the only thing it does do is it will
obviously<00:02:23.620> protect<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> sides<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.880> glass

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
obviously protect the sides of the glass

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.980 
obviously protect the sides of the glass
of<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.630> iphone<00:02:26.110> okay<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.070> can<00:02:27.430> actually

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
of the iphone okay so you can actually

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.510 
of the iphone okay so you can actually
obviously<00:02:28.990> drop<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.530> potentially<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.310> keep

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
obviously drop it potentially and keep

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.130 
obviously drop it potentially and keep
the<00:02:30.700> sides<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> glass<00:02:31.330> protected<00:02:31.930> which

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the sides of the glass protected which

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.400 
the sides of the glass protected which
could<00:02:32.470> pretend<00:02:32.860> prevent<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:34.060> from<00:02:34.410> damaging

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
could pretend prevent you from damaging

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.190 
could pretend prevent you from damaging
the<00:02:35.530> actual<00:02:35.830> glass<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.580> your<00:02:36.760> worst<00:02:37.030> screen<00:02:37.480> so

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.580 
it's a very nice case though I do like
the<00:02:40.240> actual<00:02:40.540> texture<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.080> it<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.290> it's<00:02:41.350> very

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
the actual texture of it and it's very

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.580 
the actual texture of it and it's very
shiny<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.160> high-gloss<00:02:42.700> finish<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.260> all<00:02:44.440> the
