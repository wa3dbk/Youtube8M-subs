could<00:03:51.239> be<00:03:51.389> a<00:03:51.419> great<00:03:51.810> type<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.620> technology

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
could be a great type of technology

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.339 
could be a great type of technology
however<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:53.939> still<00:03:54.329> feel<00:03:54.599> it<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.810> not<00:03:54.959> ready<00:03:55.169> for

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
however I still feel it is not ready for

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.709 
however I still feel it is not ready for
primetime<00:03:55.620> I'm<00:03:56.549> still<00:03:56.939> wondering<00:03:57.389> what<00:03:57.569> it

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
primetime I'm still wondering what it

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.420 
primetime I'm still wondering what it
will<00:03:57.840> be<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:57.989> when<00:03:58.769> this<00:03:58.949> software<00:03:59.280> is

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
will be like when this software is

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.640 
will be like when this software is
available<00:03:59.969> for<00:04:00.449> Windows<00:04:00.780> 8<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.229> other

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
available for Windows 8 and other

available for Windows 8 and other
touchscreen<00:04:02.310> based<00:04:02.549> operating<00:04:03.090> systems<00:04:03.629> it

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
touchscreen based operating systems it

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.039 
touchscreen based operating systems it
is<00:04:04.560> clear<00:04:04.859> now<00:04:05.189> to<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.759> that<00:04:06.209> Windows<00:04:06.629> 8<00:04:06.840> is

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
is clear now to see that Windows 8 is

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.069 
is clear now to see that Windows 8 is
being<00:04:07.319> developed<00:04:07.590> with<00:04:08.400> touchscreen<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.359> mind

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
being developed with touchscreen in mind

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.629 
being developed with touchscreen in mind
and<00:04:10.409> perhaps<00:04:10.979> solely<00:04:11.669> for<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.060> reason<00:04:13.639> the

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
and perhaps solely for that reason the

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.599

that<00:04:29.729> is<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:29.970> only<00:04:30.090> reason<00:04:30.569> for<00:04:30.599> its

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
that is the only reason for its

that is the only reason for its
development<00:04:31.500> this<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.949> something<00:04:32.370> that<00:04:32.400> we

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
development this is something that we

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.790 
development this is something that we
should<00:04:32.970> look<00:04:33.000> at<00:04:33.360> especially<00:04:33.990> with<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.620> ARM

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
should look at especially with the ARM

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.899 
should look at especially with the ARM
based<00:04:34.919> version<00:04:35.699> of<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.870> operating<00:04:37.259> system

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:21.230 
video and if someone wants me to do that
I<00:05:19.169> may<00:05:19.590> actually<00:05:19.830> create<00:05:20.219> another<00:05:20.699> video<00:05:20.909> and

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
I may actually create another video and

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.209 
I may actually create another video and
do<00:05:21.389> that<00:05:21.419> but<00:05:22.020> for<00:05:22.169> now<00:05:22.319> you<00:05:22.379> can<00:05:22.560> see<00:05:22.919> how<00:05:23.039> this

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
do that but for now you can see how this

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.339 
do that but for now you can see how this
works<00:05:23.490> and<00:05:23.879> it<00:05:23.969> is<00:05:24.090> quite<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.449> bit<00:05:24.780> of<00:05:25.020> a
