when it's coldest from mid-december to
mid<00:00:16.390> February<00:00:17.020> we<00:00:17.619> usually<00:00:18.010> don't<00:00:18.160> water<00:00:18.400> them

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
mid February we usually don't water them

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.480 
mid February we usually don't water them
at<00:00:18.789> all<00:00:19.470> during<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.650> winter<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.130> Sun<00:00:21.160> is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
at all during the winter the Sun is

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.070 
at all during the winter the Sun is
lower<00:00:21.699> in<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.000> sky<00:00:22.119> resulting<00:00:22.839> in<00:00:22.929> less

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
lower in the sky resulting in less

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.800 
lower in the sky resulting in less
evaporation<00:00:23.919> and<00:00:24.099> the<00:00:24.390> groundwater<00:00:25.390> tables

evaporation and the groundwater tables

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.249 
evaporation and the groundwater tables
are<00:00:25.929> higher<00:00:26.199> so<00:00:27.070> less<00:00:27.249> watering<00:00:27.669> is<00:00:27.820> needed

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
are higher so less watering is needed

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.929 
are higher so less watering is needed
but<00:00:29.259> more<00:00:29.470> importantly<00:00:30.009> during<00:00:30.369> the<00:00:30.460> coldest

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
but more importantly during the coldest

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.880 
but more importantly during the coldest
months<00:00:30.970> when<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.990> temperature<00:00:32.470> dips<00:00:32.619> below

months when the temperature dips below

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.150 
months when the temperature dips below
freezing<00:00:33.400> just<00:00:33.670> about<00:00:34.180> every<00:00:34.510> day<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.829> plants

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
freezing just about every day the plants

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.160 
freezing just about every day the plants
are<00:00:36.250> basically<00:00:36.640> dormant<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.390> they<00:00:37.989> don't

summer but here in mid-november there is
still<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.190> good<00:00:45.370> reason<00:00:45.789> to<00:00:45.910> water<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.420> winter

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
going to need some water in order to

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.150 
going to need some water in order to
thrive<00:00:54.429> in<00:00:55.500> addition<00:00:56.500> the<00:00:56.620> highs<00:00:56.829> this

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
thrive in addition the highs this

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.860 
thrive in addition the highs this
weekend<00:00:57.640> are<00:00:57.760> expected<00:00:58.210> to<00:00:58.300> be<00:00:58.420> in<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.629> 50s

and even low 60s and no freezing
temperatures<00:01:02.320> are<00:01:02.469> expected<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:04.059> watering<00:01:04.480> my

temperatures are expected so watering my
claytonia<00:01:04.989> seedlings<00:01:05.590> makes<00:01:05.860> a<00:01:05.950> lot<00:01:06.100> of<00:01:06.130> sense

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
claytonia seedlings makes a lot of sense

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.790 
claytonia seedlings makes a lot of sense
for<00:01:07.570> now<00:01:07.720> though<00:01:07.960> because<00:01:08.170> there<00:01:08.530> is<00:01:08.620> also

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
for now though because there is also

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.370 
for now though because there is also
rain<00:01:09.250> in<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.490> forecast<00:01:09.750> I'm<00:01:10.750> only<00:01:11.020> going<00:01:11.350> to

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
rain in the forecast I'm only going to

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.679 
rain in the forecast I'm only going to
water<00:01:11.650> my<00:01:11.890> seedlings<00:01:12.189> and<00:01:12.670> we<00:01:13.150> put<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.479> rain

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
water my seedlings and we put the rain

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.670 
water my seedlings and we put the rain
to<00:01:13.900> water<00:01:14.079> the<00:01:14.350> rest<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.799> garden<00:01:16.680> more

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
to water the rest of the garden more

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.440 
to water the rest of the garden more
specifically<00:01:18.340> when<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.640> water<00:01:18.909> my<00:01:19.030> winter

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
specifically when I water my winter

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.450 
specifically when I water my winter
garden<00:01:19.840> I<00:01:20.020> do<00:01:20.259> it<00:01:20.500> when<00:01:20.619> it's<00:01:20.799> sunny<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:21.340> the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
garden I do it when it's sunny and the

temperature in the cold frames and Polly
tunnels<00:01:23.320> is<00:01:23.619> well<00:01:23.890> above<00:01:24.130> freezing<00:01:24.189> in

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
tunnels is well above freezing in

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.780 
tunnels is well above freezing in
addition<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.560> water<00:01:26.799> early<00:01:27.220> enough<00:01:27.399> in<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.640> day

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
addition I water early enough in a day

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.460 
addition I water early enough in a day
to<00:01:27.850> ensure<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:28.299> water<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:28.960> leaves<00:01:29.170> of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
to ensure that water and the leaves of

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.740 
to ensure that water and the leaves of
the<00:01:29.560> plants<00:01:30.070> has<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.670> chance<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.210> evaporate

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
the plants has a chance to evaporate

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.039 
the plants has a chance to evaporate
before<00:01:31.899> freezing<00:01:32.530> temperatures<00:01:33.040> return<00:01:33.430> and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
before freezing temperatures return and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.289 
before freezing temperatures return and
as<00:01:35.049> much<00:01:35.200> as<00:01:35.259> possible<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:36.130> tried<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:36.850> water<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
as much as possible I tried to water the

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.520 
as much as possible I tried to water the
soil<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.869> not<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.350> plains<00:01:38.590> themselves<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
soil and not the plains themselves it

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.170 
soil and not the plains themselves it
also<00:01:41.740> makes<00:01:42.040> a<00:01:42.159> lot<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.340> sense<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.820> know<00:01:43.000> what

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
also makes a lot of sense to know what

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.080 
also makes a lot of sense to know what
the<00:01:43.299> forecast<00:01:43.780> is<00:01:44.020> before<00:01:44.439> watering<00:01:45.090> for

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
the forecast is before watering for

the forecast is before watering for

last winter I decided to water the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.080 
last winter I decided to water the
garden<00:01:50.770> without<00:01:51.250> first<00:01:51.520> checking<00:01:51.670> the

forecast I wasn't aware that the

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.249 
forecast I wasn't aware that the
temperature<00:01:55.240> was<00:01:55.390> expected<00:01:55.899> to<00:01:56.020> drop

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259
