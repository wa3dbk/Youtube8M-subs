00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
 go thread short 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.490
 hello to you on the mountain today i am 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520
 I want to do a little review of the new 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.610
 updates to Minecraft this update is not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.860
 so old and not so new 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.529
 Yes, some might know but still I 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.390
 I want to show you let's get it started 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.710
 update is added to the minicrapt a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.070
 particle I mean particles and people and mobs 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.020
 also new effects that have recently been 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.690
 allowed but today it is you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.000
 show you put mobs here and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.220
 let's begin by telling you about 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.809
 effects before effects could 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.699
 only people can add now 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.750
 effects and add no mop for on for 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.050
 we need to write this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.350
 The effect of such a dog is her neighbor and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.269
 brackets to write 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.340
 equal and may in this case with us 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.690
 will the zones run from the zombies and what 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.409
 effect effect let's say 2 and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.290
 slowness 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.670
 and we prescribed m2 and us for 30 seconds u 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.759
 they are prescribed by effect 2 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.020
 as you can see from them are bubbles and you can 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.770
 also make the effect was 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.770
 bubbles 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.909
 was without bubbles well, the effect will also be 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.810
 See registered tour here see here 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.359
 you need here let's say 22 and well i'm all 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.680
 retro spell and bubbles from them now 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:39.450
 must get out look bubbles okay 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.429
 okay, I'm here, this is such a team 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.159
 she here she here she here she 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.770
 look and here I am prescribing food commands 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.770
 they have bubbles removed if I write 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.899
 stripes then bubbles appear here 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.280
 such an effect is also possible with other 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.350
 there kinky example two let's say there 99 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.979
 from just look see they have an effect 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.119
 hunger is also necessary to prescribe them 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.429
 whatever you want them there will be god no 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:19.790
 spinning spinning is not clear that even 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:21.380
 Now you can register everything 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.200
 coexist rupite 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.660
 no zombies are dead or throw oh well 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.480
 all just missed here see the effect and 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.190
 power off if they don't kill okay 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.740
 let's proceed to the following commands 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.770
 also added commands particle 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.920
 and different commands effects are exactly the same 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.380
 for zombies and particle scattering effect 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.190
 How many let's press this button and 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.740
 and we have particles like you near bedrock here 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.230
 somewhere here just down there 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.960
 survival generally down below down here 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.160
 such particles can also be made 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:01.170
 look more closely with the bunch 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.270
 shorter more yes see let's say 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.550
 if we put on 11 i think us 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.920
 causes 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.710
 11 so we look dofiga should be 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.440
 particles well yes they are all over the world and 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.490
 scattered see particles out particles 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.620
 particle waves 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.530
 everywhere but there are still such 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.780
 particles such are such well shorter so on 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.580
 but let me get you each 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.670
 tell more in detail the teams will be in 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.690
 description you can also add here 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.030
 let 's say there is no purity in my opinion 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.720
 I have a lot of these particles prescribed that 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.000
 In ours let's hang from 11 to but strongly 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.950
 much is prescribed that it is very much 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.480
 scatters ok let's just be 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.030
 go through and talk about each 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.160
 team and open I think I will not just 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.370
 in the description, then look at the particles 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.430
 add Ender pearls here are the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.430
 a particle is added there is a fire lighter 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.410
 it is also so here it is some 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.140
 beautiful such bubbles are generally straight 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.260
 superski as you see next with us 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.570
 arrow as it shoots my it with us 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.600
 music is generally so cool but that 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.220
 you are super looking for straight leave as well 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.050
 can we all mobs can even 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.480
 connect so everyone can have it 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.549
 but the particles of the portal and let 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.070
 on clicks many times and as you see they 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.570
 fall down as super as this 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.060
 move on to the next about 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.680
 these are my all my favorite look like 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.130
 know in enchantment we set 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.010
 enchantment up 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.220
 where is enchanted I do not remember where she is 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.830
 us here is the enchantment and the enchantment a 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.960
 it needs book blocks and from book 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.360
 block we will have to go all sorts of different 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.580
 effects here i can't find that book a 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.040
 here's the bookshelf see we put 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.090
 bookshelf and we go to 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.790
 my effects but must up 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.120
 must be okay here are the effects and all zombies 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.170
 also when you kill zombies like that 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.260
 sect provide 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:03.190
 with we let us take zombie kadan 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.870
 Take the sword like this, and he'll be here but 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.660
 for some reason dying in my skeletons 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.700
 such fall out 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.850
 still here are some 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.720
 cultures are generally cool if this is not 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.430
 go and here are such generally not super 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.620
 as quickly as a taube can look like 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:27.820
 You can wear less I am not super in these 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:31.960
 I understand the teams and not like that 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:38.500
 as it is not logan mass of 10 is not enough at all ok 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:40.660

 I will explain how it can be understood not to you 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.590
 will look like this with us here somewhere 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.480
 here is water and when we pour water 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.550
 she's like when these effects are sorry 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.510
 for noise, see these effects 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.390
 here should my 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.910

 dripping drips just the same here she is 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.260
 dripping and where you see freezes 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.900
 droplet dig that's exactly the same there 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.780
 dripping just as well with the glory of the ladies 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:10.320
 I saw but it drips further further with us 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:15.200
 snowballs some bags some bags 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.550
 red things in the hands see damn 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.930
 op-op-op-op can it because of this 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.300
 no book effect 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.400
 Yes, that's because of this effect, it seems to be 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.570
 the land is still to lie Okay thawed 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.510
 let's go to the next one 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.310
 Ausle Zenith, this is also generally cool 

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.220
 so you can make a short 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.800
 call and the most awesome is 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.230
 hearts can be so much connect 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.880
 there will be many in general, all the teams will write 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.370
 the description itself for something not need not 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.750
 I will be thick likes who subscribed 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.970
