00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.730
 when 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150
 one 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.390
 we choose peru tricycle because it is a theme 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.090
 that we like a lot to begin with 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.700
 but basically the idea of ​​choosing the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.430
 pay tribute theme was not 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.550
 only one band but a moment of 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.620
 music and independent music 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.220

 we are fundamentals of music 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.070
 independent of lima and possibly in 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.989
 Peru is not and that's what that's what 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.290

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.830

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.010

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:28.390
 the glory of the resurrection to get 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:36.310
 do not 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.310
 part of my life to live 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.810

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.510
 just to love you 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.510
 my life to live or die 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:13.060
 all animals want to get better than 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:17.810
 the road will all reach the top 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:21.400

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.450
 record of 9 and glory immortal glory 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.430
 restoration 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:32.470
 I can not express so much we're going to 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.470
 talk now get there 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.340
 Clear 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.590
 what was initially going to be a band 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.170
 that crazy with nicolás and with 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.600
 santiago set out to make a stamp 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.460
 then that will house our bands 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.710
 and existing and form a kind of 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.750
 collective record label in which 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.520
 we can get together to play with a 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.220
 concept always in which animated the 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.460
 self-production in all aspects we 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.420
 we have sought to get together with bands that 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.260
 we admire for different reasons 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.020
 aesthetics shape the content and I think 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.529
 that generated a competition 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.439
 healthy 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.669
 recontra important between us I 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.799
 I think we have started to 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.439
 improve each one as a musician in each 

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:27.849
 band as an individual project and that 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.019
 It seems that it is something that has 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.019
 fed everyone very much
