 Hello friends we are welcome to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.649
 our nail decoration channel 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.050
 I hope you like the model that you 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.210
 we present below 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.530
 to see more designs you can enter 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.350
 our website www corner of peace and dotcom 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:22.850
 today we have chosen a design of points in 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.850
 white and green colors 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.650
 we begin by applying the enamel 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.250
 transparent that will protect our 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.250
 nail and avoid that yellow 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.250
 ah 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.640
 the next step will be to paint the base in 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.030
 this case we have chosen the white color 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.030
 mate 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:08.930
 we will give a couple of layers covering like this 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:11.960
 all the nail we will continue doing three 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.260
 thick lines on top of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.750
 the nail as you see we are using the 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.330
 same broach of the enamel and the color 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 that we have chosen is a green color 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.930
 three green stripes the will to 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.930
 different heights 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.180
 once we have both colors 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.970
 differentiated we are going to start doing 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.220
 points with a small doping first 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.100
 we start with the white zone 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.360
 we will make a line of the central point and 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.080
 we will continue filling in the sides 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.630
 the health colloquium is the green that we have 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.630
 painted on the front area of â€‹â€‹the nail 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.040
 ah 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.070

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.250
 ah 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.800
 once we have finished doing the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.650
 green points we will do the process 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.770
 opposite in the green part we are going to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.260
 make white spots the booty 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.710
 that we are using is the same the doping 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.710
 small 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.430
 I remembered that once we finished the design 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.700
 It is convenient to apply the layer of 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.260
 transparent enamel protector of this 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.260
 way will not force the design anymore 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.670
 I hope you liked this design 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.940
 where we have combined the white color and 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.150
 the green color 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.260
 if so, they want a like for 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.340
