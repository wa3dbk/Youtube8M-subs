things<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> James<00:00:39.270> did<00:00:39.540> mention<00:00:39.809> that

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
things like that James did mention that

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.840 
things like that James did mention that
in<00:00:40.860> spite<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> fact<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.550> he<00:00:41.670> was

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
in spite of the fact that he was

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
in spite of the fact that he was
restricted<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.510> some<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.780> those<00:00:42.899> movements<00:00:43.200> he

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
restricted in some of those movements he

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.410 
restricted in some of those movements he
did<00:00:43.920> give<00:00:44.070> us<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> few<00:00:44.460> those<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> try<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> he

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
did give us a few those a try and he

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.979 
did give us a few those a try and he
didn't<00:00:45.780> feel<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:45.960> he<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.320> pretty<00:00:46.940> supported

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
didn't feel like he was pretty supported

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
didn't feel like he was pretty supported
using<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> metcon<00:00:49.410> ones<00:00:49.770> doing<00:00:50.219> those

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
using the metcon ones doing those

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.490 
using the metcon ones doing those
exercises<00:00:50.690> it's<00:00:51.690> important<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> keep<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.320> mind

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
exercises it's important to keep in mind

exercises it's important to keep in mind
that<00:00:52.649> he<00:00:52.770> did<00:00:53.280> say<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.789> he<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:53.940> losing<00:00:54.030> out

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that he did say that he was losing out

on<00:00:54.360> some<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> ground<00:00:54.960> feeling<00:00:55.440> some<00:00:55.590> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
on some of the ground feeling some of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.020 
on some of the ground feeling some of
those<00:00:55.739> exercises<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> thickness

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
those exercises because of the thickness

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.549 
those exercises because of the thickness
the<00:00:57.270> natural<00:00:57.719> thickness<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> insole

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559

something you might want to think about
thickness<00:01:09.270> wise<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.689> support<00:01:09.990> wise<00:01:10.170> you're

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
thickness wise and support wise you're

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.100 
thickness wise and support wise you're
not<00:01:10.470> gonna<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.860> much<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.310> nanos<00:01:12.110> naturally

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
not gonna get as much in nanos naturally

that's<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.560> important<00:01:40.920> thing<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.100> we

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that's a really important thing that we

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.560 
that's a really important thing that we
really<00:01:41.550> wanted<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:41.820> check<00:01:41.940> out<00:01:42.120> before<00:01:42.300> we<00:01:42.540> did

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
really wanted to check out before we did

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.110 
really wanted to check out before we did
some<00:01:42.930> lateral<00:01:43.800> work<00:01:44.010> and<00:01:44.340> some<00:01:44.550> speed<00:01:44.760> work<00:01:44.940> as

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
some lateral work and some speed work as

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.400 
some lateral work and some speed work as
well<00:01:45.270> especially<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:45.990> run<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
well especially with the run in the

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.550 
well especially with the run in the
zigzag<00:01:46.800> sprint<00:01:50.870> now<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.110> thing<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
zigzag sprint now the one thing that I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.020 
zigzag sprint now the one thing that I
do<00:01:52.620> want<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.920> call<00:01:53.130> attention<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.550> that<00:01:53.760> we<00:01:53.880> did

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
do want to call attention to that we did

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.850 
do want to call attention to that we did
test<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.420> as<00:01:54.570> well<00:01:54.780> are<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> double<00:01:55.590> unders

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
test out as well are the double unders

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
test out as well are the double unders
one<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.280> most<00:01:56.460> iconic<00:01:56.690> exercises<00:01:57.690> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
one of the most iconic exercises in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.080 
one of the most iconic exercises in
CrossFit<00:01:58.230> we<00:01:58.830> both<00:01:59.280> were<00:01:59.550> looking<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
CrossFit we both were looking for a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.270 
CrossFit we both were looking for a
little<00:02:00.300> bit<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> bounce<00:02:00.660> back<00:02:00.870> and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
little bit of bounce back and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.770 
little bit of bounce back and
responsiveness<00:02:02.280> from<00:02:02.760> going<00:02:03.060> from<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.480> skip

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
responsiveness from going from one skip

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
responsiveness from going from one skip
to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> next<00:02:04.050> we're<00:02:04.560> sort<00:02:04.800> of<00:02:04.830> missing<00:02:05.130> out<00:02:05.190> on

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
to the next we're sort of missing out on

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
to the next we're sort of missing out on
that<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.550> mean<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:05.940> Nike<00:02:06.300> were<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.600> implement

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that I mean if Nike were to implement

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
that I mean if Nike were to implement
maybe<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.040> bit<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.310> forefoot<00:02:08.670> zoom<00:02:09.000> just

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
maybe a little bit of forefoot zoom just

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.609 
maybe a little bit of forefoot zoom just
to<00:02:09.390> give<00:02:09.480> us<00:02:09.510> a<00:02:09.660> little<00:02:09.780> more<00:02:09.990> energy<00:02:10.350> return

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to give us a little more energy return

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.590 
to give us a little more energy return
in<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.830> bounce<00:02:11.040> that<00:02:12.000> probably<00:02:12.360> would<00:02:12.510> have

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
in the bounce that probably would have

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
in the bounce that probably would have
been<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> little<00:02:12.870> bit<00:02:13.050> better<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.440> nonetheless

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
been a little bit better but nonetheless

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.340 
been a little bit better but nonetheless
he<00:02:13.980> was<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.310> regular<00:02:14.430> ride<00:02:15.240> as<00:02:16.020> for<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
he was just a regular ride as for the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380 
he was just a regular ride as for the
Nano<00:02:16.530> five-point<00:02:17.100> nose<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.580> felt<00:02:17.790> okay<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.210> mean

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
Nano five-point nose it felt okay I mean

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.390 
Nano five-point nose it felt okay I mean
I'm<00:02:18.600> pretty<00:02:18.840> sure<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.500> bust<00:02:19.740> out<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> little<00:02:20.220> bit

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
I'm pretty sure we bust out a little bit

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.390 
I'm pretty sure we bust out a little bit
of<00:02:20.520> energy<00:02:21.240> responsiveness<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.440> Technology

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
of energy responsiveness of Technology

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.680 
of energy responsiveness of Technology
out<00:02:23.430> there<00:02:23.580> especially<00:02:24.000> they<00:02:24.330> what<00:02:24.570> they

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
out there especially they what they

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.240 
out there especially they what they
incorporate<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.290> their<00:02:25.410> running<00:02:25.620> shoes<00:02:25.650> that

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
incorporate in their running shoes that

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.979 
incorporate in their running shoes that
they<00:02:26.340> could<00:02:26.459> have<00:02:26.550> put<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.790> there<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> think

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
they could have put in there but I think

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.020 
they could have put in there but I think
it's<00:02:28.110> an<00:02:28.200> all<00:02:28.320> right<00:02:28.500> shoe<00:02:28.709> overall<00:02:29.459> now

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
it's an all right shoe overall now

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.460 
it's an all right shoe overall now
something<00:02:30.390> very<00:02:30.600> important<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.110> James<00:02:31.350> and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
something very important that James and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.440 
something very important that James and
I<00:02:31.590> both<00:02:31.830> noticed<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.670> shoes<00:02:32.940> were<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
I both noticed with the shoes were the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.150 
I both noticed with the shoes were the
amount<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.750> support<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.320> traction<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.010> they

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
amount of support and traction that they

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.040 
amount of support and traction that they
had<00:02:35.370> once<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.239> had<00:02:36.480> something<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
had once you had something that the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.300 
had once you had something that the
other<00:02:37.170> shoe<00:02:37.380> didn't<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.890> vice<00:02:38.010> versa

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
other shoe didn't and vice versa

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.610 
other shoe didn't and vice versa
fraction<00:02:39.209> wise<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.720> Nano<00:02:39.900> five-point<00:02:40.470> knows

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
fraction wise the Nano five-point knows

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.620 
fraction wise the Nano five-point knows
are<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> lot<00:02:41.190> better<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:42.000> support<00:02:42.420> wise

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
are a lot better but support wise

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.560 
are a lot better but support wise
especially<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> lateral<00:02:43.860> medial<00:02:44.250> side

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
especially to the lateral medial side

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.199 
especially to the lateral medial side
the<00:02:45.570> metcon<00:02:45.930> ones<00:02:46.260> are<00:02:46.590> better<00:02:47.370> than<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.030> Nano

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
the metcon ones are better than the Nano

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.910 
the metcon ones are better than the Nano
five-point<00:02:48.690> nose<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.350> think<00:02:49.470> it's<00:02:49.739> just<00:02:49.770> a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
five-point nose so I think it's just a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.770 
five-point nose so I think it's just a
combination<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
combination of the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.930 
combination of the
probably<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> fly<00:02:52.830> wire<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.459> hyper<00:02:53.640> fuse

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
probably the fly wire and the hyper fuse

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.670 
probably the fly wire and the hyper fuse
in<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> upper<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.840> give<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.170> more

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
in the upper just to give that more

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.660 
in the upper just to give that more
secure<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.220> lockdown

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
secure and lockdown

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.820 
secure and lockdown
feel<00:02:56.970> especially<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.630> lateral<00:02:58.020> me<00:02:58.530> aside

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
feel especially to lateral me aside

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.290 
feel especially to lateral me aside
going<00:02:59.160> over<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> hurdles<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:00.120> little

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
going over the hurdles and that little

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.449 
going over the hurdles and that little
pause<00:03:00.480> at<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.750> end<00:03:00.830> personally<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.890> felt<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.430> had

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
pause at the end personally I felt I had

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.130 
pause at the end personally I felt I had
a<00:03:02.610> lot<00:03:02.819> more<00:03:02.850> traction<00:03:03.300> than<00:03:03.600> James<00:03:03.870> did

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
a lot more traction than James did

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.840 
a lot more traction than James did
however<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:04.740> was<00:03:04.920> losing<00:03:05.220> out<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> support

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
however I was losing out on the support

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.760 
however I was losing out on the support
James<00:03:06.480> felt<00:03:06.690> he<00:03:06.780> had<00:03:06.810> more<00:03:07.170> support<00:03:07.350> than<00:03:07.680> I

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
James felt he had more support than I

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.890 
James felt he had more support than I
did<00:03:08.010> but<00:03:08.489> he<00:03:08.610> was<00:03:08.819> losing<00:03:09.120> down<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.450> traction

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
did but he was losing down the traction

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.880 
did but he was losing down the traction
probably<00:03:10.260> because<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> hexagonal

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
probably because of the hexagonal

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.449 
probably because of the hexagonal
traction<00:03:11.489> pattern<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:12.000> not<00:03:12.209> as<00:03:12.420> deep<00:03:13.319> as<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
traction pattern it's not as deep as the

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.250 
traction pattern it's not as deep as the
traction<00:03:14.880> pattern<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.420> 905<00:03:15.840> point<00:03:16.110> nose

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
traction pattern on the 905 point nose

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.420 
traction pattern on the 905 point nose
but<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.860> know<00:03:16.950> what<00:03:17.040> there's<00:03:17.220> always<00:03:17.310> a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
but you know what there's always a

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.380 
but you know what there's always a
little<00:03:17.520> bit<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.819> trade-off<00:03:18.030> when<00:03:18.270> we're

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
little bit of a trade-off when we're

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.330 
little bit of a trade-off when we're
talking<00:03:18.480> about<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.900> kind<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.170> thing<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:20.190> as

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
talking about this kind of thing now as

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.699 
talking about this kind of thing now as
for<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.580> zig<00:03:20.760> zag<00:03:20.940> sprint<00:03:21.330> James<00:03:22.140> personally

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
for the zig zag sprint James personally

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.300 
for the zig zag sprint James personally
didn't<00:03:23.400> deal<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.360> too<00:03:24.810> much<00:03:25.100> loss<00:03:26.100> of

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
didn't deal with too much loss of

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.620 
didn't deal with too much loss of
traction<00:03:26.489> especially<00:03:26.880> from<00:03:27.300> the<00:03:27.360> beginning

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
traction especially from the beginning

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.120 
traction especially from the beginning
going<00:03:27.900> out<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.110> his<00:03:28.170> three-point<00:03:28.560> stance<00:03:28.800> into

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
going out of his three-point stance into

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.680 
going out of his three-point stance into
the<00:03:29.220> rest<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.519> race<00:03:29.670> however<00:03:30.510> going

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
the rest of the race however going

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.060 
the rest of the race however going
around<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.989> corners<00:03:31.350> he<00:03:31.470> did<00:03:31.590> have<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.830> break

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
around the corners he did have to break

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.560 
around the corners he did have to break
himself<00:03:32.459> down<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.640> little<00:03:32.820> bit<00:03:33.000> lower<00:03:33.239> center

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
himself down a little bit lower center

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.330 
himself down a little bit lower center
of<00:03:33.630> gravity<00:03:33.720> before<00:03:34.680> he<00:03:34.739> came<00:03:34.920> out<00:03:35.100> of<00:03:35.220> each

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
of gravity before he came out of each

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.460 
of gravity before he came out of each
turn<00:03:35.610> because<00:03:36.180> they<00:03:36.330> were<00:03:36.390> pretty<00:03:36.569> tight<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
turn because they were pretty tight the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.890 
turn because they were pretty tight the
one<00:03:37.739> thing<00:03:38.040> unique<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.489> his<00:03:38.730> run<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.630> could

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
one thing unique to his run that I could

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.070 
one thing unique to his run that I could
not<00:03:40.080> do<00:03:40.319> was<00:03:40.530> make<00:03:40.800> some<00:03:40.830> really<00:03:41.220> hard<00:03:41.550> plans

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
not do was make some really hard plans

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.210 
not do was make some really hard plans
again<00:03:43.080> it's<00:03:43.350> unique<00:03:43.800> could<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.010> say<00:03:44.190> that

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
again it's unique could I say that

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.890 
again it's unique could I say that
because<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:44.940> think<00:03:44.970> with<00:03:45.239> hard<00:03:45.450> plants<00:03:45.840> who

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
because you think with hard plants who

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.900 
because you think with hard plants who
need<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.170> traction<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.650> do<00:03:46.800> so<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.580> do<00:03:47.730> need

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
need the traction to do so you do need

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.940 
need the traction to do so you do need
traction<00:03:48.239> however<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.989> lateral<00:03:49.380> support<00:03:49.769> in

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
traction however the lateral support in

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:50.990 
traction however the lateral support in
the<00:03:50.069> shoe<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.459> what<00:03:50.610> gives<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
the shoe is what gives you the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.460 
the shoe is what gives you the
confidence<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.690> do<00:03:52.019> so

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
confidence to do so

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.110 
confidence to do so
me<00:03:52.769> personally<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.280> couldn't<00:03:53.730> really<00:03:53.850> make

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
me personally I couldn't really make

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.610 
me personally I couldn't really make
harder<00:03:54.540> plants<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.989> had<00:03:55.110> to<00:03:55.230> take<00:03:55.380> quicker

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
harder plants I had to take quicker

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.000 
harder plants I had to take quicker
steps<00:03:55.950> whereas<00:03:56.250> James<00:03:56.549> was<00:03:56.880> allowed<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:58.140> take

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
steps whereas James was allowed to take

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.520 
steps whereas James was allowed to take
some<00:03:59.190> really<00:03:59.430> hard<00:03:59.790> steps<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.510> then<00:04:01.049> initiate

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
some really hard steps and then initiate

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.530 
some really hard steps and then initiate
into<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.280> rest<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.549> his<00:04:02.670> breakaway<00:04:03.030> speed<00:04:03.360> to

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
into the rest of his breakaway speed to

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.180 
into the rest of his breakaway speed to
go<00:04:03.660> into<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> next<00:04:04.110> cone<00:04:04.380> into<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.769> next<00:04:05.040> one

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
go into the next cone into the next one

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.400 
go into the next cone into the next one
and<00:04:05.400> then<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.299> get<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.450> good<00:04:06.660> time<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.230> off<00:04:07.290> the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
and then to get a good time to off the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.940 
and then to get a good time to off the
finish

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
finish

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.400 
finish
during<00:04:08.670> my<00:04:08.880> segment<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.630> zigzag<00:04:10.019> sprint

during my segment of the zigzag sprint

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.199 
during my segment of the zigzag sprint
what<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> did<00:04:10.950> feel<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.400> though<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.610> had<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.910> really

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
what I did feel as though I had a really

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.569 
what I did feel as though I had a really
good<00:04:12.470> explosive<00:04:13.470> start<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.920> lot<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.250> traction

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
good explosive start a lot of traction

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.490 
good explosive start a lot of traction
the<00:04:14.790> beginning<00:04:15.090> even<00:04:15.329> corporated<00:04:15.930> toe<00:04:16.260> drag

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
the beginning even corporated toe drag

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.099 
the beginning even corporated toe drag
there<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:17.340> problems<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.120> did<00:04:18.419> find<00:04:18.810> were

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
there the problems that I did find were

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.229 
there the problems that I did find were
the<00:04:19.229> fact<00:04:19.470> that<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.280> goes<00:04:20.669> back<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
the fact that it just goes back to the

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.779 
the fact that it just goes back to the
lateral<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.720> medial<00:04:21.750> support<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:23.310> traction

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
lateral and medial support the traction

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.040 
lateral and medial support the traction
was<00:04:23.910> there<00:04:24.150> especially<00:04:24.450> going<00:04:24.750> around<00:04:24.930> those

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
was there especially going around those

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.020 
was there especially going around those
turns<00:04:25.440> except<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.039> kind<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.310> felt<00:04:26.550> like<00:04:26.580> my<00:04:26.789> foot

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
turns except I kind of felt like my foot

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.360 
turns except I kind of felt like my foot
wasn't<00:04:27.419> sliding<00:04:27.930> in<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.169> foot<00:04:28.380> bed<00:04:28.560> but<00:04:29.280> it

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
wasn't sliding in the foot bed but it

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.270 
wasn't sliding in the foot bed but it
was<00:04:29.400> really<00:04:29.789> mostly<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:31.470> was<00:04:31.620> secured<00:04:32.039> but<00:04:32.160> it

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
was really mostly it was secured but it

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.880 
was really mostly it was secured but it
was<00:04:32.370> actually<00:04:32.669> going<00:04:32.880> up<00:04:33.120> into<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:34.200> upper<00:04:34.530> and

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
was actually going up into the upper and

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.320 
was actually going up into the upper and
it<00:04:35.039> kind<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.280> felt<00:04:35.490> like<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.640> was<00:04:35.850> driving<00:04:36.210> my

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
it kind of felt like it was driving my

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.150 
it kind of felt like it was driving my
body<00:04:36.600> towards<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.229> right<00:04:37.440> side<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.740> little<00:04:37.950> bit

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
body towards the right side a little bit

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.190 
body towards the right side a little bit
and<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.610> left<00:04:38.820> side<00:04:39.030> as<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.419> made<00:04:39.630> both<00:04:39.840> turns

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
and the left side as I made both turns

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.340 
and the left side as I made both turns
so<00:04:40.919> ultimately<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:42.300> breakaway<00:04:42.750> speed<00:04:43.080> it

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
so ultimately the breakaway speed it

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.600 
so ultimately the breakaway speed it
could<00:04:43.530> have<00:04:43.620> been<00:04:43.950> greater

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
could have been greater

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.550 
could have been greater
except<00:04:45.390> I<00:04:45.570> kind<00:04:45.780> of<00:04:45.840> had<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:45.990> spend<00:04:46.380> more<00:04:46.500> time

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
except I kind of had to spend more time

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.070 
except I kind of had to spend more time
trying<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.580> rican<00:04:48.030> troll<00:04:48.240> my<00:04:48.360> body<00:04:48.600> coming<00:04:48.960> out

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
trying to rican troll my body coming out

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.390 
trying to rican troll my body coming out
of<00:04:49.140> those<00:04:49.260> turns<00:04:49.560> because<00:04:49.770> I<00:04:49.950> kind<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.190> felt

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
of those turns because I kind of felt

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.620 
of those turns because I kind of felt
like<00:04:50.430> my<00:04:50.640> feet<00:04:50.940> were<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.150> little<00:04:51.390> bit<00:04:51.479> out<00:04:51.600> of

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
like my feet were a little bit out of

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.440 
like my feet were a little bit out of
control<00:04:51.979> traction<00:04:52.979> was<00:04:53.160> there<00:04:53.340> again<00:04:53.640> but<00:04:54.210> the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
control traction was there again but the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.990 
control traction was there again but the
lateral<00:04:54.780> support<00:04:55.169> around<00:04:55.350> those<00:04:55.560> tight<00:04:55.800> turns

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
lateral support around those tight turns

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.520 
lateral support around those tight turns
that<00:04:57.000> was<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.270> hard<00:04:57.450> part<00:04:57.510> now<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.320> last

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
that was the hard part now the last

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.050 
that was the hard part now the last
thing<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.830> we<00:04:59.039> decided<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.520> do<00:04:59.640> for<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.909> day

you know all that stuff so we were kind
of<00:05:12.229> fatigued<00:05:12.529> but<00:05:12.739> it<00:05:12.830> was<00:05:12.919> actually<00:05:13.039> the<00:05:13.189> best

felt that the Nano five-point knows it

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.179

gave me the ground feel that I was

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.359 
gave me the ground feel that I was
looking<00:05:22.429> for<00:05:22.699> but<00:05:23.089> ultimately<00:05:23.509> support<00:05:24.019> wise

00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:24.369 
looking for but ultimately support wise

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:26.499 
looking for but ultimately support wise
if<00:05:25.369> you're<00:05:25.519> looking<00:05:25.819> for<00:05:25.969> something<00:05:26.149> to<00:05:26.269> run<00:05:26.479> a

metcon ones James personally felt that

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.899 
metcon ones James personally felt that

a thick insole he was looking for more
support<00:05:43.490> than<00:05:43.610> cushioning<00:05:44.089> throughout<00:05:44.389> the

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
and cushioning it was on average none

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.549 
and cushioning it was on average none
less<00:05:56.089> but<00:05:56.419> he<00:05:56.839> was<00:05:56.929> looking<00:05:57.139> for<00:05:57.289> a<00:05:57.319> little<00:05:57.439> bit

less but he was looking for a little bit
more<00:05:57.740> me<00:05:57.949> personally<00:05:58.429> I've<00:05:58.909> trained<00:05:59.300> myself

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
more me personally I've trained myself

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.739 
more me personally I've trained myself
and<00:06:00.079> so<00:06:00.229> is<00:06:00.379> James<00:06:00.769> to<00:06:01.219> be<00:06:01.300> predominantly<00:06:02.300> mid

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:02.749

honestly<00:06:06.139> the<00:06:06.709> metcon<00:06:07.129> ones<00:06:07.429> will<00:06:07.610> probably

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:07.879 
honestly the metcon ones will probably

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.519 
honestly the metcon ones will probably
be<00:06:07.969> better<00:06:08.119> for<00:06:08.389> you<00:06:08.509> because<00:06:08.719> they<00:06:09.050> consider

something<00:06:43.219> you<00:06:43.279> might<00:06:43.399> want<00:06:43.579> to<00:06:43.610> consider

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:50.959 
doing an 800 kora middle distance run so

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:51.909 
doing an 800 kora middle distance run so
if<00:06:51.050> you're<00:06:51.169> planning<00:06:51.379> on<00:06:51.439> doing<00:06:51.499> something

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
if you're planning on doing something

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.199 
if you're planning on doing something
like<00:06:51.949> that<00:06:52.069> you<00:06:52.399> might<00:06:52.519> as<00:06:52.639> well<00:06:52.759> switch<00:06:53.059> your

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:53.209 
like that you might as well switch your

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:55.419 
like that you might as well switch your
shoes<00:06:53.240> though<00:06:54.110> compared<00:06:54.709> to<00:06:54.829> the<00:06:54.919> four<00:06:55.159> point

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:55.429 
shoes though compared to the four point

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:57.369 
shoes though compared to the four point
knows<00:06:55.639> all<00:06:56.029> the<00:06:56.449> five<00:06:56.599> points<00:06:57.050> are<00:06:57.169> so<00:06:57.289> they

00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:57.379 
knows all the five points are so they

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:58.600 
knows all the five points are so they
fit<00:06:57.499> me<00:06:57.589> better<00:06:57.769> for<00:06:57.889> running<00:06:58.249> because<00:06:58.369> the

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
fit me better for running because the

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.899 
fit me better for running because the
flexibility<00:06:59.269> of<00:06:59.300> the<00:06:59.479> upper<00:06:59.779> though<00:07:00.550> it<00:07:01.550> is

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:01.909 
flexibility of the upper though it is

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:03.790 
flexibility of the upper though it is
good<00:07:02.119> flexibility<00:07:02.719> wise<00:07:02.959> what<00:07:03.469> I'm<00:07:03.559> talking

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
good flexibility wise what I'm talking

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.259 
good flexibility wise what I'm talking
about<00:07:03.829> is<00:07:04.129> the<00:07:04.279> met<00:07:04.429> cons<00:07:04.669> because<00:07:04.939> of<00:07:05.179> the

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:05.269 
about is the met cons because of the

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:06.500 
about is the met cons because of the
traction<00:07:05.659> pattern

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
traction pattern

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.240 
traction pattern
and<00:07:06.600> the<00:07:07.200> flex<00:07:07.470> grooves<00:07:07.620> at<00:07:07.830> the<00:07:07.920> bottom

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
and the flex grooves at the bottom

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.760 
and the flex grooves at the bottom
really<00:07:08.550> good<00:07:08.820> shoes<00:07:09.060> so<00:07:09.660> it<00:07:10.260> just<00:07:10.500> comes<00:07:10.620> down

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
really good shoes so it just comes down

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.410 
really good shoes so it just comes down
to<00:07:10.890> personal<00:07:11.040> preference<00:07:11.400> get<00:07:11.850> one<00:07:12.000> over<00:07:12.240> the
