bicarbonate<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.700> soda<00:00:47.879> that's<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
bicarbonate of soda that's going to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.520 
bicarbonate of soda that's going to
react<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> lactic<00:00:49.020> acid<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
react with the lactic acid in the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.139 
react with the lactic acid in the
buttermilk<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.190> that's<00:00:50.640> what's<00:00:50.850> gonna<00:00:50.940> give

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
buttermilk and that's what's gonna give
