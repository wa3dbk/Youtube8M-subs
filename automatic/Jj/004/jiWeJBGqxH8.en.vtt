00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
0.62 one-inch and I just finished

adjustment<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.490> now<00:00:20.670> mine's<00:00:21.510> running

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
adjustment on it so now mine's running

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.529 
adjustment on it so now mine's running
5/8<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.039> an<00:00:23.160> inch<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.490> 3/4<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> an<00:00:24.180> inch<00:00:24.300> because

change<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:25.500> stretch<00:00:26.039> evenly<00:00:26.970> you'll<00:00:27.539> have

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
change do not stretch evenly you'll have

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.359 
change do not stretch evenly you'll have
a<00:00:27.750> tighter<00:00:28.080> section<00:00:28.590> than<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> other<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
a tighter section than the other and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.400 
a tighter section than the other and
just<00:00:29.510> remember<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.779> adjust<00:00:31.019> your<00:00:31.140> chain

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
just remember when you adjust your chain

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.799 
just remember when you adjust your chain
always<00:00:31.740> adjust<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> tight<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.030> not<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
always adjust to the tight one not to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750 
always adjust to the tight one not to
the<00:00:33.899> loose<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.320> feel<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> loose<00:00:35.550> one

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the loose one feel just to the loose one

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.970 
the loose one feel just to the loose one
but<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.660> tighter<00:00:36.930> start<00:00:37.320> section<00:00:37.770> will

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
but the tighter start section will

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.639 
but the tighter start section will
become<00:00:38.280> too<00:00:38.460> tight<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.329> always<00:00:39.540> adjust<00:00:40.500> your

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
become too tight so always adjust your

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.680 
become too tight so always adjust your
chain<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> tight<00:00:41.309> section<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.270> let's<00:00:42.300> say

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
chain to the tight section so let's say

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
chain to the tight section so let's say
just<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.860> sake<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> argument<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
just for the sake of argument it's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
just for the sake of argument it's
running<00:00:45.360> between<00:00:45.570> 1/2<00:00:46.079> inch<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.530> one-inch

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
running between 1/2 inch and one-inch

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.580 
running between 1/2 inch and one-inch
adjust<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> 1/2<00:00:48.329> inch<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> 1<00:00:49.379> inch

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
adjust to the 1/2 inch not to the 1 inch

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.430 
adjust to the 1/2 inch not to the 1 inch
and<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> seems<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> go<00:00:51.120> against<00:00:51.390> logic<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and it seems to go against logic but you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
and it seems to go against logic but you
think<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.039> makes<00:00:53.190> sense<00:00:53.660> on<00:00:54.660> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
think about it it makes sense on this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.930 
think about it it makes sense on this
particular<00:00:55.140> bike<00:00:55.469> uses<00:00:55.860> eccentric<00:00:56.430> adjusters

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
this is an o-ring chain what that means

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.559 
this is an o-ring chain what that means
is<00:02:15.959> inside<00:02:16.950> each<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.400> these<00:02:17.520> barrels<00:02:17.819> is

is inside each one of these barrels is

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.290 
is inside each one of these barrels is

lubricant there's an o-ring on either
side<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.690> each<00:02:21.930> barrel<00:02:22.380> which<00:02:22.560> keeps<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
side of each barrel which keeps the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.350 
side of each barrel which keeps the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
lubricant inside which is a good thing

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.030 
lubricant inside which is a good thing
it<00:02:27.360> makes<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:28.140> less<00:02:28.290> maintenance<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
it makes it a little less maintenance it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.590 
it makes it a little less maintenance it
they<00:02:29.400> let<00:02:29.610> tend<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.970> last<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.360> little<00:02:30.450> bit

they let tend to last a little bit

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.800 
they let tend to last a little bit
longer<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:32.390> doesn't<00:02:33.390> mean<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.600> don't<00:02:33.690> have

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
longer and doesn't mean you don't have

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.559 
longer and doesn't mean you don't have
to<00:02:33.989> lube<00:02:34.140> them<00:02:34.290> though<00:02:34.440> what<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.459> do<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.790> use<00:02:36.540> a

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
to lube them though what you do is use a

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.699 
to lube them though what you do is use a
product<00:02:36.959> like<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.620> basically<00:02:40.620> a

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
product like this this is a basically a

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.670 
product like this this is a basically a
chain<00:02:40.980> wax<00:02:41.390> it's<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.900> lubricant<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:43.530> it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
chain wax it's a it's a lubricant but it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.670 
chain wax it's a it's a lubricant but it
goes<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.790> dries<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.989> film<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.620> it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
goes on and it dries to a film and it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.229 
goes on and it dries to a film and it
doesn't<00:02:46.980> fling<00:02:47.250> off<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.120> what<00:02:48.239> this<00:02:48.420> does<00:02:48.660> is

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
doesn't fling off and what this does is

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.210 
doesn't fling off and what this does is
it<00:02:51.239> cushions<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.110> impact<00:02:52.500> between<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
it cushions the impact between the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.630 
it cushions the impact between the
rollers<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.690> teeth<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.050> your<00:02:55.170> sprocket

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
rollers and the teeth and your sprocket

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.800 
rollers and the teeth and your sprocket
it's<00:02:56.640> hard<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.940> see<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.180> sprocket<00:02:57.570> on<00:02:57.630> this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it's hard to see the sprocket on this

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's hard to see the sprocket on this
one<00:02:57.959> here<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.200> go<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:59.160> lessens<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.880> impact

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
one here we go it lessens the impact

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.960 
one here we go it lessens the impact
there<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.140> reduces<00:03:02.130> friction<00:03:02.400> reduces

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
there and it reduces friction reduces

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.210 
there and it reduces friction reduces
heat<00:03:03.150> which<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.810> turn<00:03:03.989> reduces<00:03:04.230> chain<00:03:04.830> stretch

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
heat which in turn reduces chain stretch

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.729 
heat which in turn reduces chain stretch
so<00:03:05.940> see<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.239> all<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> chain<00:03:06.780> reaction<00:03:06.989> uh-huh

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
so see it's all a chain reaction uh-huh

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.660 
so see it's all a chain reaction uh-huh
no<00:03:08.040> pun<00:03:08.250> intended

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
no pun intended

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.120 
no pun intended
but<00:03:09.420> if<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.600> keep<00:03:09.720> track<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.290> keep<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:10.890> top

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
but if you keep track of it keep on top

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.250 
but if you keep track of it keep on top
of<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.370> keep<00:03:11.610> things<00:03:11.820> lubed<00:03:12.120> up<00:03:12.299> keep<00:03:13.019> things

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
of it keep things lubed up keep things

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.900 
of it keep things lubed up keep things
adjusted<00:03:13.769> properly<00:03:13.950> wear<00:03:14.310> your<00:03:14.430> chains<00:03:14.700> not

slapping<00:03:15.480> different<00:03:16.230> Michael<00:03:16.590> ride<00:03:16.799> smoother

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
slapping different Michael ride smoother

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.850 
slapping different Michael ride smoother
on<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.570> off<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.840> throttle<00:03:19.079> transitions

on and off the throttle transitions

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
on and off the throttle transitions
would<00:03:19.980> be<00:03:20.070> smoother<00:03:20.370> because<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.640> don't<00:03:20.790> have

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
would be smoother because you don't have

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.509 
would be smoother because you don't have
all<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.030> slop<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.450> slack<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.680> chain<00:03:22.709> you

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
all that slop and slack in the chain you

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.319 
all that slop and slack in the chain you
know<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.970> uh<00:03:24.799> reduces<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.829> driveline<00:03:26.340> snatch<00:03:26.970> if

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
know it uh reduces a driveline snatch if

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.400 
know it uh reduces a driveline snatch if
I<00:03:27.510> don't<00:03:27.720> you've<00:03:27.870> ever<00:03:27.989> heard<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.290> before

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
I don't you've ever heard that before

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.080 
I don't you've ever heard that before
it's<00:03:28.739> like<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.280> period<00:03:29.640> of<00:03:29.700> time<00:03:29.850> when<00:03:30.030> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
it's like the period of time when you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.120 
it's like the period of time when you
roll<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.510> gas<00:03:30.660> till<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.470> wheel<00:03:31.620> starts<00:03:32.040> to

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
roll on the gas till the wheel starts to

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.020 
roll on the gas till the wheel starts to
turn<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:34.549> just<00:03:35.549> keep<00:03:35.730> up<00:03:35.850> with<00:03:35.970> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
turn so just keep up with the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.190 
turn so just keep up with the
maintenance<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.480> this<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.810> your<00:03:36.900> parts

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
maintenance like this and your parts

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.900 
maintenance like this and your parts
will<00:03:37.350> last<00:03:37.530> longer<00:03:37.829> your<00:03:38.220> bike<00:03:38.430> will<00:03:38.610> be<00:03:38.730> more

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
will last longer your bike will be more
