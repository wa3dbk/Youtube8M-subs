00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.580
 television more open than ever 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.710
 Well now, yes, with the theme 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.300
 doctor and to get our favorite doctor 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.219
 because we're halfway through the year and it's 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.139
 time to detoxify our body 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.960
 I say that to start the second 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 half with more energy we always have 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.170
 natural alternatives for you and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.300
 that's why our doctor Gary Duarte 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.189
 will tell about what we can do 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.600
 to get what our body does not 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.600
 you need welcome for how are you 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.830
 hear the detox now we will be 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 that everyone is done every day 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.700
 325 days of the year 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 if there are like misconceptions in close 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.649
 of the 2 intoxicated one of them is that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.450
 when someone stays detoxifies 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.789
 what it usually does is take many 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.809
 juices and lots of salad a lot for all 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.809
 the meat of the diet 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.420
 and it's going to help you a lot because you're going to 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.149
 remove part of the damage from dairy 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.189
 or that is where they are giving us 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.810
 what works is to remove the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.960
 dairy products 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.090
 the juice the juice irritates you ferments 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.979
 bad and it helps you go to the bathroom a lot but 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.780
 as you still have the bad 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.180
 fermentation of the maxis will help you 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.729
 if you followed a few months ago already 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.729
 you start to feel normal with that too 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.710
 We are always doing what you put to 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.990
 times the most important thing also 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.970
 is removed clear exactly then 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.780
 with juices you will not detoxify 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.640
 because they are sugar they nourish very little not 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.220
 chew then do not mix with the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.880
 Saliva if you ate salad 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.100
 fruit the fruit is sugar and sugar 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.929
 basically what it does is ferment 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.569
 in your intestine then neither is 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.340
 contributing something really useful to the body 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.780
 and nothing else is spoiling 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.080
 there are people who are accustomed for example 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.080
 Senate is just fatal 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 for the liver the fruit is missing because with 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.810
 a little bit especially in a climate like 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.540
 Mexico and where we live and very much that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.330
 night then a good recipe for 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.810
 Detoxify is a soup that we have if 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.430
 they have notice the recipe bears asparagus 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.940
 He carries the chub faso hearts of 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.760
 artichokes onion a lot garlic you can 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.100
 note the turmeric that they call 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.769
 saffron root that is an excuse to 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.410
 the curry that's great for inmates 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.769
 like ginger an orange camotito 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.640
 when the ginger and not as it happens no 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:45.160
 it's quite neutral and flavor and it carries mushrooms 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.019
 and mushrooms and you can sound it to your 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.120
 There, the important thing is the 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.060
 asparagus the artichokes you can also 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.670
 comment myths what picas all the a 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.500
 zones like a sautÃ©ed and instead of 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.200
 water and we 're all weird and we're 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.200
 detoxifying is beef juice 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.920
 thank god that is salty because it is 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.780
 what will keep you minerals in the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.680
 body because it is what they did before 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:17.469
 to babies 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:19.870
 then a bath mary god is to remove the 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:22.030
 dairy and remove the flour is fine 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.799
 important just take this soup a 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.560
 or two weeks 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.910
 I do not know the dairy I already had a 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.040
 Question 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.040
 soy milk is milk 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.350
 The problem is that if it weighs heavily on 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.690
 kidney hippies in the 70s no 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.930
 they had the normal ones they were made 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.170
 these recipe books at 6 months had 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.780
 drop and kidney failure drop down 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.730
 when they have gone carnivores they had drop 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.070
 when they became vegetarians they gave drop 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.320
 for the amount of protein of these 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.120
 domino's because sometimes vegetarians 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:09.840
 to exaggerate doses of almonds and 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.840
 rice especially for babies of an animal 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.570
 and a lemon on an empty stomach for 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.299
 detoxify where they take the soup 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.400
 during the day this you can do 15 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.220
 days and if you can not eat other things 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.040
 like green meat and vegetables avoid it 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.650
 raw avoid the fruit avoid the dairy 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.840
 and at night you will mix like the 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.750
 old cocks but in the game 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.570
 30 milliliters of vinegar of modena 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.240
 quality with 30 milliliters of wine 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.820
 sherry or port the amount of honey 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.360
 that you know well and 12 sachets of 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.360
 regards 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.460
 exactly 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.080
 terrific for the liver was taken in the 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.560
 night the sopita this one can also 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.300
 put the consomme of chicken omitted miso is 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.419
 the soybean nation but it is soy 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.210
 fermented that's how you can touch 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.280
 I'm going a thousand times more meat juice 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.610
 because I have more and more help 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.250
 liver is one of the reasons today for the 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.860
 fatty liver apart from taking large 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.440
 amounts of water is to dine after 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.389
 seven and eight o'clock at night 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.030
 situation to star dance in situ areas 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.010
 92 eight thirty at night you will 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.790
 go making fatty liver because 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.010
 interrupt 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.370
 the liver cycle and that and also 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:45.160
 you sleep and you do not rest 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:50.850
 no matter and if it's like raw fruit or 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.850
 not some that is worse but a lot 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.010
 I started this lemon soup on an empty stomach 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:02.710
 they want to take apart from the vinegar 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:04.210
 with honey and olives all these 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.490
 products that already sell you suddenly 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.130
 also in pills and others that 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.370
 supposes also that it is to clean 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.950
 there is an extract of milk thistle is very 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.380
 well that's for the liver nothing more than 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.140
 they do not speak poet has to be a good 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.730
 extract not brought mixed 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.970
 amino acids because they do not use to lower 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.310
 weight the dandelion abstract extract 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.940
 and the milk thistle as extracts are 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.670
 fabulous or in microdoses also in 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.680
 microcosis of chapingo of others there 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.830
 people who do microdoses are very good 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.870
 Milk thistle and dandelion do not have 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.310
 drug interactions do not 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.770
 they cross with nothing 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.770
 I repeat many of the spirulina for 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:53.170
 get minerals you do it until 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:55.300
 part in the soup basically in the 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.220
 intestine is regulated but as the 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.810
 activism with our eating flours 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.810
 fruits do not drink raw 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:14.230
 we do not recommend negative things we wear 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.940
 much the intestinal flora stops more 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.070
 time to regenerate the intestinal flora 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.830
 and it is very easy to generate the flora 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:24.670
 intestinal with probiotics the best 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:33.030
 probiotics are public beer wines 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:33.030
