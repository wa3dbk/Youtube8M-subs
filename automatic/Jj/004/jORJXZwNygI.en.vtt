00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
anyway the hair feels like it's wet I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.740 
anyway the hair feels like it's wet I
don't<00:02:25.500> know<00:02:25.590> what's<00:02:25.830> up<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.540> that's

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
don't know what's up with that so that's

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:39.860 
don't know what's up with that so that's
the<00:02:27.840> 20<00:02:28.200> inch<00:02:30.440> now<00:02:31.440> we<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.010> 18<00:02:32.519> inch<00:02:38.870> I'm

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
the 20 inch now we have the 18 inch I'm

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.449 
the 20 inch now we have the 18 inch I'm
thinking<00:02:40.320> maybe<00:02:40.440> it's<00:02:40.739> because<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.280> is

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
thinking maybe it's because it is

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.170
