00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.730
 I'd say it 's very fast, it 's just for 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.189
 explain a particular presentation 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.139
 here is the network mask that makes the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.110
 much easier things 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.389
 Here is where I am from the presentation when speaking 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 this Thursday 24 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.340
 assuming that I have this by the 192 168 0 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.640
 1 as an example again 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.740
 Of course the ipê class c is this 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.279
 bar representation 24 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.189
 she told me very easily that the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.079
 network mask being used in this 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.390
 case is 255 255 255 0 which is also the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.660
 default network mask for class c 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.270
 but any relation between the number 24 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.460
 and this mask here because 24 is the number 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.670
 of bits that are worth 1 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.430
 from left to right does not 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.100
 I sense that first time here I know 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.910
 which is all complete of some to give 255 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.379
 so I have 8 bits in a second 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.110
 believe the same thing 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.670
 also as in the third and fourth 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.200
 quintet I have no beach that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.960
 worth one because the 0 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 so do not put 0 on the sole then eight 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 more 8 16 + 8 24 but there were 24 then 24 o 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.880
 number of bits of the mark 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 from left to right that are worth one 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.060
 beauty and if I had a 25 here then 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.040
 not 24 as that would be more expensive 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.170
 Good, we just figure it out here. 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.170
 will not change only in the last 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.540
 quintet is something like this is of that type 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.030
 here is a ticket reserved for 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.710
 Then your mask will have to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.159
 have this 1 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.790
 So I do not have 10 more bits 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:01.049
 I have a bit nation and 8 + 18 + 8 more 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:05.030
 one equals 25 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.030
 logo the netmask 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:14.240
 in this case here it would be 128 because this 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.050
 number converted here to simon 128 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.940
 and so it goes 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.700
 I have several representations if I 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.760
 I would have 26 here means that I would have 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.709
 one here in the last octet this all 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.050
 is already tabulated because ultimately the 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:33.450
 possibilities are endless 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.940
 and I can have up to 24 bits up to 30 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.320
 mbits being here when I'm 30 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.530
 mbits from left to right in the 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:47.760
 mask on the last one the quintet here I go 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:50.010
 have something of this type and disease that the 8 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.080
 bits of the last the quintet I'm going to have 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.180
 all these animals to represent 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.920
 subnet né 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.860
 and only those two bits for 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.370
 represent the terminals ie 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.060
 a very limited number of terminal 2 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.610
 specifically and here a large number 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.760
 of sub networks that I will have two taken 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.340
 six I study these possibilities to people 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.549
 You'll see in the next video that follows. 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.549
 now
