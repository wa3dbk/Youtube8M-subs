00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
when I first got this when I first

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.490 
when I first got this when I first
opened<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.830> parcel<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.369> got<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.730> box<00:00:24.029> I

opened the parcel and got this box I

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
opened the parcel and got this box I
thought<00:00:25.500> well<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.460> small<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> thought<00:00:27.119> it

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
thought well this is small I thought it

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.980 
thought well this is small I thought it
would<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.420> been<00:00:27.510> bigger

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
would have been bigger

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.769 
would have been bigger
I<00:00:28.340> may<00:00:29.340> even<00:00:29.460> check<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.849> scale<00:00:30.240> make<00:00:30.539> sure<00:00:30.720> it

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
I may even check the scale make sure it

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.450 
I may even check the scale make sure it
was<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.109> scale<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.160> Huggett

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
was the right scale one for Huggett

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
was the right scale one for Huggett
which<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> was<00:00:32.940> I'm<00:00:33.840> surprised<00:00:34.320> by<00:00:34.620> how<00:00:34.800> small

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
which it was I'm surprised by how small

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.770 
which it was I'm surprised by how small
it<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.610> thought<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.300> would<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.510> been<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> wee
