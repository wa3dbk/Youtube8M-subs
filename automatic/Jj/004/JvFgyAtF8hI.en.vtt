there<00:00:14.440> once<00:00:14.650> was<00:00:14.889> a<00:00:14.949> factory<00:00:15.549> with<00:00:15.730> a<00:00:15.789> small

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
there once was a factory with a small

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.050 
there once was a factory with a small
production<00:00:16.720> capacity<00:00:17.320> and<00:00:18.099> as<00:00:18.430> more<00:00:18.640> orders
