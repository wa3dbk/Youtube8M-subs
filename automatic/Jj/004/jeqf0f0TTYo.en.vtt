interesting here he going my weapons my
primary<00:02:59.460> weapon<00:02:59.760> throughout<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.150> two<00:03:00.480> weeks

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
primary weapon throughout this two weeks

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.990 
primary weapon throughout this two weeks
was<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.770> ballista<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.340> know<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.490> did<00:03:02.730> use<00:03:02.970> a

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
was the ballista you know I did use a

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.640 
was the ballista you know I did use a
little<00:03:03.420> bit<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.540> dsr<00:03:04.080> I<00:03:04.110> only<00:03:04.320> got<00:03:04.470> like<00:03:04.590> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
little bit of dsr I only got like a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.640 
little bit of dsr I only got like a
thousand<00:03:05.130> kills<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> dsr<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:06.560> most<00:03:07.560> of

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
thousand kills the dsr I think most of

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.990 
thousand kills the dsr I think most of
my<00:03:07.740> kills<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.220> see<00:03:08.400> war<00:03:08.640> with<00:03:08.880> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
my kills you can see war with the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.750 
my kills you can see war with the
ballista<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.950> was<00:03:11.130> like<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.280> fastest

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
ballista this was like the fastest

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.220 
ballista this was like the fastest
weapon<00:03:12.060> obviously<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.780> fastest

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
weapon obviously is like the fastest
