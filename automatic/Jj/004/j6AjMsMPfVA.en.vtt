00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.270 

Phillips<00:00:45.870> screw<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
Phillips screw and what that's going to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
Phillips screw and what that's going to
do<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.579> expose<00:00:48.000> our<00:00:48.270> wiring<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.200> our

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
do is expose our wiring here for our

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.430 
do is expose our wiring here for our
bake<00:00:49.440> element<00:00:50.329> so<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.199> slide

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
bake element so I'm just going to slide

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.430 
bake element so I'm just going to slide
those<00:00:52.739> off<00:00:56.750> just<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:58.410> our

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
those off just like that so now our

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.740 
those off just like that so now our
wiring<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.039> disconnected<00:00:59.699> then<00:01:00.270> go<00:01:00.420> around<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
wiring is disconnected then go around to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.450 
wiring is disconnected then go around to
the<00:01:00.840> front<00:01:00.989> take<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> screws<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.250> hold

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
the front take out the screws that hold
the<00:01:02.550> element<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.030> place<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.510> slide<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.870> out

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the element in place and slide it out

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.260 
the element in place and slide it out
and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.739> we'll<00:01:04.860> come<00:01:05.010> back<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.189> once<00:01:06.090> we

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
and then we'll come back here once we

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.969 
and then we'll come back here once we
mount<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> element<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.500> attach<00:01:07.770> our

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
mount the element and then attach our

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.590 
mount the element and then attach our
wires<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:08.909> I'm<00:01:08.970> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> unmount

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
wires all right so I'm going to unmount

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:20.289 
wires all right so I'm going to unmount
the<00:01:09.780> bake<00:01:10.229> element<00:01:10.490> two<00:01:11.490> Phillips<00:01:11.850> screws

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.200 

and<00:01:21.299> then<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:21.899> pull<00:01:22.079> it<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:23.210> we've

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and then we can pull it out we've

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.639 
and then we can pull it out we've
already<00:01:24.359> disconnected<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.140> wiring<00:01:25.469> of<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
already disconnected the wiring of the

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.190 
already disconnected the wiring of the
pull<00:01:25.829> straight<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.689> all<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.899> this<00:01:28.020> is

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
pull straight out all right and this is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.190 
pull straight out all right and this is
going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.679> the<00:01:28.799> exact<00:01:29.100> opposite<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> we

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
going to go in the exact opposite so we

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.840 
going to go in the exact opposite so we
took<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.649> so<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.340> going<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> slide

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
took it out so I'm just going to slide

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:55.839 
took it out so I'm just going to slide
it<00:01:33.030> into<00:01:33.149> position<00:01:35.240> put<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.360> our<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:36.689> screws

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.190 

all<00:01:56.849> right<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:57.179> that's<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.509> position<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.020> go

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
all right so that's in position I go

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.569 
all right so that's in position I go
ahead<00:01:58.319> and<00:01:58.409> put<00:01:58.530> my<00:01:58.560> racks<00:01:58.920> back<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.520> they

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
ahead and put my racks back in and they

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:10.070 
ahead and put my racks back in and they
took<00:01:59.729> out<00:01:59.909> earlier

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
and then we can go around to the back

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.590 
and then we can go around to the back
and<00:02:12.430> connect<00:02:12.670> our<00:02:12.790> wiring<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.360> way<00:02:13.480> it
