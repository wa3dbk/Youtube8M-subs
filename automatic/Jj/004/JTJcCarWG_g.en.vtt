00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.640 
it I always cook it like three cups of
rice<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.180> then<00:03:35.510> I<00:03:35.600> just<00:03:35.780> eyeball<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.320> what

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
rice and then I just eyeball it what

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.770 
rice and then I just eyeball it what
would<00:03:36.770> be<00:03:36.920> like<00:03:37.220> I<00:03:37.459> cut<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.150> into<00:03:38.270> like<00:03:38.450> thirds

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
would be like I cut it into like thirds

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.590 
would be like I cut it into like thirds
and<00:03:39.290> then<00:03:39.980> figure<00:03:40.459> out<00:03:40.520> that<00:03:40.910> like<00:03:41.120> oh<00:03:41.239> this<00:03:41.420> is

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
and then figure out that like oh this is

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.720 
and then figure out that like oh this is
less<00:03:41.810> than<00:03:41.959> a<00:03:42.020> third<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:42.470> it's<00:03:42.620> about<00:03:42.739> like<00:03:42.950> you

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
less than a third so it's about like you

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.940 
less than a third so it's about like you
know<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.150> many<00:03:44.330> calories<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:45.050> then<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.800> can

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
know this many calories and then you can

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.229 
know this many calories and then you can
see<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.220> little<00:03:46.459> bits<00:03:46.640> about<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.970> Cotter
