00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
surface and first you have to cut out a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.880 
surface and first you have to cut out a
piece<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.890> cardboard<00:00:23.869> put<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.199> your<00:00:25.680> sock

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
so that the fabric stretches out and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.650 
so that the fabric stretches out and
then<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.390> choose<00:00:31.140> your<00:00:31.320> first<00:00:31.470> color<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660
