techniques going on the market we wanted
to<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.210> sure<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.510> covered<00:00:21.810> every<00:00:22.050> base<00:00:22.260> from

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
to make sure we covered every base from

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.740 
to make sure we covered every base from
drop-shot<00:00:23.010> worm<00:00:23.220> jig<00:00:23.490> shaky<00:00:23.910> head<00:00:24.090> across<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
without the umbrella rig rod so we

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.169 
without the umbrella rig rod so we
wanted<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> make<00:00:29.250> sure<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.760> threw<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.150> in

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
wanted to make sure that we threw one in

ways you can rig the thing they come in

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
ways you can rig the thing they come in
different<00:00:40.710> weights<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> sizes<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.360> kind

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
different weights and sizes so we kind

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.900 
different weights and sizes so we kind
of<00:00:42.750> narrowed<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> down<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.320> one<00:00:44.190> specific<00:00:44.340> one

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

that's<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.360> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> get<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> job<00:00:46.020> done<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
that's just going to get the job done a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.889 
that's just going to get the job done a
couple<00:00:47.670> cool<00:00:47.789> things<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.390> blank<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it's the blank from cumulus which is the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's the blank from cumulus which is the
HM<00:00:51.600> one<00:00:51.750> carbon<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.649> you're<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
HM one carbon so you're going to get a

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.799

the new fuji guides

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.840 
the new fuji guides
it's<00:01:09.420> called<00:01:09.630> KR<00:01:10.080> concept<00:01:10.729> basically<00:01:11.729> what

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
it's called KR concept basically what

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
it's called KR concept basically what
this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> combination<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.290> micro

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
this is it's a combination of micro

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.240 
this is it's a combination of micro
guide<00:01:14.330> that<00:01:15.330> tapers<00:01:15.780> down<00:01:15.890> into<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> choke

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
guide that tapers down into a choke

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
guide that tapers down into a choke
guide<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:18.330> comes<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.049> normal

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
guide which comes in to your normal

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.590 
guide which comes in to your normal
stripper<00:01:19.799> guide<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.360> new

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
stripper guide so what this new

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.120 
stripper guide so what this new
construction<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.439> or<00:01:22.590> these<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.950> new

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
construction is or these this new

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.820 
construction is or these this new
concept<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> increases<00:01:25.619> your

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
concept is as one as it increases your

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.280 
concept is as one as it increases your
hooking<00:01:26.549> strength<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.270> your<00:01:27.330> hook<00:01:27.479> power<00:01:27.720> your

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
hooking strength or your hook power your

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.410 
hooking strength or your hook power your
lifting<00:01:28.619> power<00:01:28.909> also<00:01:29.909> increases<00:01:30.390> your

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
lifting power also increases your

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
lifting power also increases your
overall<00:01:30.540> sensitivity<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:32.040> you're<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
overall sensitivity so you're going to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130 
overall sensitivity so you're going to
have<00:01:32.520> those<00:01:32.759> strapped<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> new<00:01:33.570> kumara

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
have those strapped on the new kumara

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.580 
have those strapped on the new kumara
rods<00:01:35.180> another<00:01:36.180> thing<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.900> well<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.320> our<00:01:37.470> new
