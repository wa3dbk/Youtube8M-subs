00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.640

 maya names the loomed majaka linda 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:37.990
 deutsch who never said 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.990
 beauchemin that is not the case 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.510
 then the problem of arada is that he 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.790
 assumed that the calendar 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.580
 mayas know that 's not the end of the 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.349
 world in december 2012 which says good 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.660
 if he ever assumes that 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.069
 block if the world never ends 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.680
 not December 21, 2012 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.959
 is that the world wants a tekken street 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.549
 and so I will start tekken 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.220
 street on January 1, 2013 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.379

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.340

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.150

 if people do not buy from one 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.910
 resurrection core so the game is not 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.320
 a success ben there will never be there 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.590

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.780
 date of a potential next installment of the 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.130
 darkstalkers series so that's all this 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.720
