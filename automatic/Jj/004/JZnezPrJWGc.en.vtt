specs<00:00:22.409> so<00:00:22.890> let's<00:00:23.249> get<00:00:23.369> right<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.729> it<00:00:24.409> proper

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:25.409 
specs so let's get right to it proper

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.139 
specs so let's get right to it proper
mic<00:00:25.589> placement<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.099> essential<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.759> great

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:27.149 
mic placement is essential for a great

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.599 
mic placement is essential for a great
recording<00:00:27.720> different<00:00:28.679> mic<00:00:28.829> positions<00:00:29.399> will

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
recording different mic positions will

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.909 
recording different mic positions will
give<00:00:29.759> you<00:00:29.880> different<00:00:30.119> sounds<00:00:30.809> so<00:00:31.349> let's<00:00:31.649> just

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
give you different sounds so let's just

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.740 
give you different sounds so let's just
say<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.279> every<00:00:32.699> instrument<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.359> every<00:00:33.570> voice

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
say if every instrument and every voice

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.290 
say if every instrument and every voice
has<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.230> high<00:00:34.530> sound<00:00:34.859> and<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> low<00:00:35.429> sound<00:00:35.699> high

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
has this high sound and a low sound high

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.790 
has this high sound and a low sound high
would<00:00:36.539> be<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> treble<00:00:37.109> low<00:00:37.410> would<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.679> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
would be the treble low would be the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.279 
would be the treble low would be the
bass<00:00:37.980> okay<00:00:38.489> sounds<00:00:38.730> familiar<00:00:38.969> great<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.170> now

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:40.289 
bass okay sounds familiar great so now

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.689 
bass okay sounds familiar great so now
let's<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.589> and<00:00:40.859> find<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> front<00:00:41.429> of<00:00:41.609> a

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
let's get and find the front of a

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.610 
let's get and find the front of a
microphone<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.660> right<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.960> microphone<00:00:43.469> is

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
microphone all right a microphone is

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.110 
microphone all right a microphone is
front<00:00:43.949> is<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.489> loudest

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
front is the loudest

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.489 
front is the loudest
when<00:00:45.300> you're<00:00:45.449> in<00:00:45.570> front<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:46.499 
when you're in front of it so are you

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.049 
when you're in front of it so are you
talking<00:00:46.679> in<00:00:46.949> front<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.399> microphone<00:00:47.609> you'll

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
talking in front of a microphone you'll

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.579 
talking in front of a microphone you'll
notice<00:00:48.359> that<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.629> will<00:00:48.690> sound<00:00:48.870> louder<00:00:49.199> on<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
notice that it will sound louder on the

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.009 
notice that it will sound louder on the
speaker<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.699> this<00:00:50.820> situation<00:00:51.690> here's<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
speaker so at this situation here's the

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.869 
speaker so at this situation here's the
front<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.289> our<00:00:52.379> mic<00:00:52.620> imagine<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.609> mic<00:00:53.760> is

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
front of our mic imagine that the mic is

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.520 
front of our mic imagine that the mic is
a<00:00:53.909> spotlight<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.870> if<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> pointed<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
a spotlight so if you pointed the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
a spotlight so if you pointed the
spotlight<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> area<00:00:56.519> that's<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> treble

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
spotlight in the area that's the treble

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.669 
spotlight in the area that's the treble
you're<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.929> high<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.289> lot<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.589> high

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
you're going to get a high a lot of high

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.559 
you're going to get a high a lot of high
frequency<00:00:59.249> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> pointed<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> microphone

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
frequency if you pointed the microphone

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:02.299 
frequency if you pointed the microphone
in<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:00.780> area<00:01:01.050> that's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.350> bass<00:01:01.589> then<00:01:02.219> you're

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in an area that's a bass then you're

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.910 
in an area that's a bass then you're
going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> get<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:02.909> of<00:01:03.030> bass<00:01:03.269> down<00:01:03.929> here<00:01:04.259> but

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
going to get a lot of bass down here but

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
going to get a lot of bass down here but
if<00:01:05.009> I<00:01:05.100> were<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.250> take<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.880> actually<00:01:06.240> give

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
if I were to take it and actually give

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.910 
if I were to take it and actually give
you<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> mixture<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:07.649> for<00:01:07.860> example

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you a mixture of the two for example

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
you a mixture of the two for example
tilting<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.880> slightly<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.540> down<00:01:09.810> then

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
tilting it just slightly more down then

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.810 
tilting it just slightly more down then
I'm<00:01:10.409> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.860> high<00:01:11.009> frequency<00:01:11.670> as

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
I'm going to get some high frequency as

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.210 
I'm going to get some high frequency as
well<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.149> low<00:01:12.420> frequency<00:01:13.020> experiment<00:01:13.979> without

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
well as low frequency experiment without

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.359 
well as low frequency experiment without
getting<00:01:14.700> high<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.299> lows<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.649> your<00:01:16.890> mix<00:01:17.130> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
getting high and lows in your mix and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.260 
getting high and lows in your mix and
see<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.240> happens<00:01:19.549> it<00:01:20.549> doesn't<00:01:20.729> matter<00:01:20.969> what

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
see what happens it doesn't matter what

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.120 
see what happens it doesn't matter what
mic<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.869> or<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.259> brand<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
mic you have or what brand you have to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.219 
mic you have or what brand you have to
do<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.280> recording<00:01:23.850> some<00:01:24.600> mics<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
do a recording some mics are going to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.990 
do a recording some mics are going to
have<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> better<00:01:25.860> high<00:01:26.040> frequency<00:01:26.549> rating<00:01:26.850> than

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
have a better high frequency rating than

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.850 
have a better high frequency rating than
others<00:01:27.329> and<00:01:27.509> some<00:01:28.079> might<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.290> better<00:01:28.649> low

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
others and some might have better low

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310 
others and some might have better low
frequency<00:01:29.369> than<00:01:29.549> others<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> issue<00:01:30.899> is<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
frequency than others so the issue is is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.990 
frequency than others so the issue is is
not<00:01:31.560> about<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> mic<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.369> use<00:01:32.640> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
not about the mic that you use is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.399 
not about the mic that you use is
actually<00:01:33.329> about<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> position<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.259> you're

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
actually about the position that you're

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
actually about the position that you're
putting<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.829> microphone<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.520> when<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.390> first

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
putting the microphone in when I first

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.940 
putting the microphone in when I first
started<00:01:36.810> doing<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.079> recordings<00:01:37.530> AI<00:01:37.649> started

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
started doing my recordings AI started

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.529 
started doing my recordings AI started
doing<00:01:38.219> it<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.399> a<00:01:38.430> Radio<00:01:38.729> Shack<00:01:38.789> microphone

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
doing it with a Radio Shack microphone

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.539 
doing it with a Radio Shack microphone
and<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.110> figured<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.649> how<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.829> put<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> mic<00:01:41.399> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and I figured out how to put the mic in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.950 
and I figured out how to put the mic in
the<00:01:41.610> right<00:01:41.820> place<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.390> able<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.689> make<00:01:42.840> it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the right place to be able to make it

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
the right place to be able to make it
work<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.740> example<00:01:44.039> painter<00:01:44.700> has<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> lot<00:01:45.299> of

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
work as an example painter has a lot of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.910 
work as an example painter has a lot of
different<00:01:45.570> colors<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.020> every<00:01:46.439> microphone

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
different colors and every microphone

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.859 
different colors and every microphone
that<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.100> use<00:01:47.399> has<00:01:47.789> a<00:01:47.820> different<00:01:48.359> color<00:01:48.600> in

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that you use has a different color in

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.499 
that you use has a different color in
the<00:01:48.990> sense<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:50.100> frequency<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.909> actually

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the sense of what frequency is actually

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.599 
the sense of what frequency is actually
uses<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.350> next<00:01:52.710> time<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.070> actually<00:01:53.219> go<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
uses so next time you actually go and

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.999 
uses so next time you actually go and
pick<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.939> microphone<00:01:54.240> look<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.289> use<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
pick up a microphone look at it use it

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
pick up a microphone look at it use it
listen<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.549> how<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.729> sounds<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.359> figure<00:01:57.539> out

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
listen to how it sounds and figure out

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.149 
listen to how it sounds and figure out
what<00:01:57.780> best<00:01:58.049> application<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.859> that<00:01:59.039> you're

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
what best application it is that you're

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.279 
what best application it is that you're
going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> use<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.810> example<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
going to use it in so for example a

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.620 
going to use it in so for example a
voice<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.700> put<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> microphone<00:02:03.359> right

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
voice we would put the microphone right

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.929 
voice we would put the microphone right
here<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:04.590> get<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.859> best<00:02:05.310> signal<00:02:05.670> for<00:02:05.850> high

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
here to get the best signal for high

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.380 
here to get the best signal for high
frequency<00:02:06.539> and<00:02:06.689> more

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
frequency and more

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.139 
frequency and more
more<00:02:07.930> down<00:02:08.170> for<00:02:08.800> low-frequency<00:02:09.460> you<00:02:09.880> figure

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
more down for low-frequency you figure

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.820 
more down for low-frequency you figure
out<00:02:10.180> what<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> best<00:02:10.660> sound<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:11.110> between<00:02:11.680> the

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
out what the best sound is between the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.320 
out what the best sound is between the
two<00:02:12.010> alright<00:02:12.700> with<00:02:13.000> one<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.270> these

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
two alright with one of these

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.000 
two alright with one of these
microphones<00:02:13.720> same<00:02:14.050> concept<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.740> would

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
microphones same concept I would

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.860 
microphones same concept I would
actually<00:02:15.220> put<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> high<00:02:16.330> frequency

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
actually put this in the high frequency

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.350 
actually put this in the high frequency
area<00:02:17.140> here<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.560> I<00:02:18.250> would<00:02:18.400> point<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.730> down<00:02:18.910> more

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
area here and I would point it down more

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.910 
area here and I would point it down more
if<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:19.690> want<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.930> get<00:02:20.050> more<00:02:20.200> base<00:02:20.410> frequency

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
if I want to get more base frequency

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.520 
if I want to get more base frequency
inside<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.490> okay<00:02:21.820> so<00:02:22.080> that's<00:02:23.080> basically

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
inside of it okay so that's basically

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.380 
inside of it okay so that's basically
how<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:23.800> would<00:02:23.950> function<00:02:24.310> or<00:02:24.700> how<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.120> would

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
how you would function or how you would

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.490 
how you would function or how you would
use<00:02:25.570> this<00:02:25.750> application<00:02:27.810> what<00:02:28.810> we're<00:02:28.930> doing<00:02:29.260> is

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
use this application what we're doing is

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.960 
use this application what we're doing is
that<00:02:29.530> we're<00:02:29.740> actually<00:02:29.940> equalizing<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
that we're actually equalizing the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.480 
that we're actually equalizing the
instrument<00:02:31.810> by<00:02:32.320> using<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.830> microphone<00:02:33.160> so

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
instrument by using the microphone so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.940 
instrument by using the microphone so
we're<00:02:33.610> using<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.970> mic<00:02:34.209> placement<00:02:34.540> as<00:02:34.990> an<00:02:35.470> EQ

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
we're using the mic placement as an EQ

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.190 
we're using the mic placement as an EQ
without<00:02:36.400> having<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.940> use<00:02:37.120> an<00:02:37.270> EQ<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.050> for

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
without having to use an EQ so for

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.560 
without having to use an EQ so for
example<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.560> drum<00:02:38.860> has<00:02:39.340> frequencies<00:02:40.270> or<00:02:40.450> high

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
example a drum has frequencies or high

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.420 
example a drum has frequencies or high
frequencies<00:02:41.230> or<00:02:41.410> treble<00:02:41.650> towards<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.190> edge

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
frequencies or treble towards the edge

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.690 
frequencies or treble towards the edge
over<00:02:43.360> here<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:44.050> low<00:02:44.410> frequencies<00:02:45.040> towards

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
over here and low frequencies towards

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.940 
over here and low frequencies towards
the<00:02:45.850> middle<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.570> if<00:02:46.780> we<00:02:46.870> put<00:02:47.050> our<00:02:47.170> mic<00:02:47.410> towards

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
the middle so if we put our mic towards

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.590 
the middle so if we put our mic towards
the<00:02:48.160> edge<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.550> an<00:02:48.670> instrument<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.270> we<00:02:49.390> pick<00:02:49.510> up

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
the edge of an instrument if we pick up

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.479 
the edge of an instrument if we pick up
a<00:02:49.750> lot<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.080> highs<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.650> if<00:02:51.100> we<00:02:51.190> put<00:02:51.400> it

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
a lot of the highs and if we put it

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.280 
a lot of the highs and if we put it
towards<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.880> center<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.480> it'll<00:02:52.840> pick<00:02:53.080> up<00:02:53.110> a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
towards the center of it it'll pick up a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.290 
towards the center of it it'll pick up a
lot<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.620> lows<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.250> we've<00:02:54.760> kind<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.090> tilt

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
lot of the lows and we've kind of tilt

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.810 
lot of the lows and we've kind of tilt
it<00:02:55.510> slightly<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.980> instrument<00:02:57.520> it'll<00:02:57.670> pick

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
it slightly on the instrument it'll pick

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.780 
it slightly on the instrument it'll pick
up<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:58.180> little<00:02:58.690> bit<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.020> both<00:02:59.290> okay<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.610> same

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
up a little bit of both okay so the same

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.130 
up a little bit of both okay so the same
thing<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> vocal<00:03:01.510> if<00:03:01.600> we<00:03:01.660> were<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.870> pick<00:03:02.020> up

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
thing with a vocal if we were to pick up

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.660 
thing with a vocal if we were to pick up
the<00:03:02.260> high<00:03:02.380> frequencies<00:03:02.920> be<00:03:03.250> somewhere<00:03:03.580> around

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
the high frequencies be somewhere around
