00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
lately now that my hair has been a

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.400 
lately now that my hair has been a
little<00:02:24.230> bit<00:02:24.440> longer<00:02:24.680> what<00:02:25.670> I'll<00:02:25.819> do<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.410> go

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
little bit longer what I'll do is go

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.670 
little bit longer what I'll do is go
actually<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.890> little<00:02:28.100> bit<00:02:28.250> lower<00:02:28.459> with<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.680> so

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
actually a little bit lower with it so

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.910

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
bring it back a normal and this is what

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.320 
bring it back a normal and this is what
I<00:02:33.950> found<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.519> kind<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.120> beauty<00:02:35.780> with

I found is kind of the beauty with

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.270 
I found is kind of the beauty with
having<00:02:38.330> longer<00:02:38.570> hair<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.800> really

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
having longer hair is that you really

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.360 
having longer hair is that you really
get<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.850> lot<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.959> different<00:02:42.290> styles<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:43.070> lot<00:02:43.250> of

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
get a lot of different styles a lot of

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.509 
get a lot of different styles a lot of
different<00:02:43.640> ways<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:44.090> wear<00:02:44.239> your<00:02:44.300> hair<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.519> this

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.420 

so<00:03:04.940> I<00:03:05.030> don't<00:03:05.270> wear<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.480> down<00:03:06.190> toward<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.220> back

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
so I don't wear it down toward the back

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.160 
so I don't wear it down toward the back
of<00:03:07.460> my<00:03:07.700> head<00:03:07.910> as<00:03:08.120> much<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> these<00:03:10.910> are<00:03:11.170> those

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.600 
it probably 90% in time where I like to
throw<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.480> up<00:03:17.570> if<00:03:17.840> I<00:03:18.320> want<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.740> kind<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.040> show

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
also keep the crap out of my hair I'll

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.320 
also keep the crap out of my hair I'll
do<00:03:27.380> what<00:03:27.860> I<00:03:30.340> don't<00:03:31.340> know<00:03:31.430> who<00:03:31.610> mastered<00:03:32.180> this

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
do what I don't know who mastered this

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.660 
do what I don't know who mastered this
style<00:03:32.690> but<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:32.960> see<00:03:33.230> Ricky<00:03:33.530> Hall<00:03:33.740> wearing<00:03:34.520> this

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
style but I see Ricky Hall wearing this

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.400 
style but I see Ricky Hall wearing this
all<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.030> time<00:03:35.240> so<00:03:35.510> it's<00:03:35.780> basically<00:03:36.260> just

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
all the time so it's basically just

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.110 
all the time so it's basically just
grabbing<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> top<00:03:37.340> part<00:03:37.670> of<00:03:37.730> your<00:03:37.790> hair

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
grabbing the top part of your hair

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.280 
grabbing the top part of your hair
so<00:03:38.900> then<00:03:39.580> thinner<00:03:40.580> amount<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.270> the<00:03:41.390> knots<00:03:41.600> it's

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
so then thinner amount so the knots it's

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.840 
so then thinner amount so the knots it's
not<00:03:42.500> actually<00:03:42.830> going<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.040> be<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.220> knot<00:03:43.490> it's

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
not actually going to be a knot it's

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.520 
not actually going to be a knot it's
going<00:03:44.240> to<00:03:44.330> be<00:03:44.450> just<00:03:45.220> ponytail<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:47.330> we<00:03:47.570> loop<00:03:48.320> it

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
going to be just ponytail so we loop it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.460 
going to be just ponytail so we loop it
up<00:03:49.030> pull<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.150> all<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.450> way<00:03:51.140> through<00:03:53.080> and<00:03:54.080> then

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
up pull it all the way through and then

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.650 
up pull it all the way through and then
so<00:03:55.040> we<00:03:55.160> still<00:03:55.430> got<00:03:55.580> like<00:03:55.910> the<00:03:56.030> hair<00:03:56.270> flowing

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
so we still got like the hair flowing

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.170 
so we still got like the hair flowing
got<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.350> waving<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:58.490> not<00:03:58.670> getting<00:03:59.060> in

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
got it waving but it's not getting in

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.120 
got it waving but it's not getting in
our<00:03:59.270> face<00:03:59.450> at<00:03:59.840> all<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.260> this<00:04:00.470> is<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.740> cool<00:04:00.920> look

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
our face at all so this is the cool look

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.580

when<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.400> want<00:04:01.700> kind<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.120> not<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.020> totally

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590

when I want kind of not the totally
polished<00:04:03.830> look<00:04:04.190> but<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.580> just<00:04:04.850> want<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.240> out<00:04:05.390> of

there<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.460> know<00:04:57.610> like<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:59.260> I've<00:04:59.380> been

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
thinking about what is going to be my

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.240 
thinking about what is going to be my
next<00:05:01.090> haircut<00:05:01.720> where<00:05:01.990> am<00:05:02.170> I<00:05:02.260> going<00:05:02.530> from<00:05:02.830> here

maybe just shaving or cutting this side
really<00:05:14.050> short<00:05:14.350> and<00:05:14.560> then<00:05:14.830> keeping<00:05:15.160> everything

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
really short and then keeping everything
