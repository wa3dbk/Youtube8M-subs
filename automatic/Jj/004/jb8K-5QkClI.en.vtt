just pretty much overall call of duty so
basically<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.329> lot<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.989> people<00:00:40.260> decide<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
basically a lot of people decide that to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.170 
basically a lot of people decide that to
get<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> high<00:00:42.450> KD<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.520> half<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.789> camp

and<00:00:45.530> that's<00:00:46.530> stay<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:46.980> pretty<00:00:47.309> much<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> same

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and that's stay in pretty much the same

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.690 
and that's stay in pretty much the same
spot<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.300> game<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.289> make<00:00:49.739> sure<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.250> they

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
spot all game and make sure that they

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
spot all game and make sure that they
don't<00:00:51.239> rush<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.079> they<00:00:52.230> rush<00:00:52.440> out

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
don't rush out because if they rush out

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
don't rush out because if they rush out
there<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.039> gonna<00:00:53.190> die<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.910> they're<00:00:54.600> just

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
there just gonna die and they're just

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.900 
there just gonna die and they're just
gonna<00:00:54.840> sit<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.530> wait<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.670> how

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
gonna sit back and wait and that's how

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.369 
gonna sit back and wait and that's how
they<00:00:57.090> think<00:00:57.329> they're<00:00:57.510> gonna<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.109> lot<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
they think they're gonna get a lot of

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.670 
they think they're gonna get a lot of
kills<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.129> minimal<00:00:59.670> deaths<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:01.260> basically

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
kills and minimal deaths so basically

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.770 
kills and minimal deaths so basically
when<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.910> might<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.359> minimal

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
when you do that you might get minimal

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.170 
when you do that you might get minimal
deaths<00:01:04.110> that's<00:01:04.559> true<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.760> probably

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
deaths that's true but you're probably

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750 
deaths that's true but you're probably
not<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> get<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.990> many<00:01:07.229> kills<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.549> way

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
not going to get that many kills the way

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.270 
not going to get that many kills the way
you<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.010> pretty

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you want to do is you want so pretty

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.960 
you want to do is you want so pretty
much<00:01:11.659> you're<00:01:12.659> not<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> good<00:01:13.020> rusher<00:01:13.439> i<00:01:14.070> would

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
much you're not a good rusher i would

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
much you're not a good rusher i would
suggest<00:01:15.150> two<00:01:15.780> flanking<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.500> blinking<00:01:16.920> is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
suggest two flanking like blinking is

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
suggest two flanking like blinking is
one<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> best<00:01:17.670> techniques<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.659> game

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
one of the best techniques in this game

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.800 
one of the best techniques in this game
just<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.460> maps<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.570> people

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
just because the maps a lot of people

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.240 
just because the maps a lot of people
don't<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> outside<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> maps<00:01:23.040> if

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
don't go on the outside of the maps if

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.490 
don't go on the outside of the maps if
you<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> outside<00:01:24.320> travel<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you just go on the outside travel on the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.230 
you just go on the outside travel on the
outside<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:26.310> no<00:01:26.490> one<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:27.000> be

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
outside that way no one can really be

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450 
outside that way no one can really be
behind<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.840> or<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:29.009> only<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
behind you or like you you only have to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.490 
behind you or like you you only have to
look<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> couple<00:01:30.360> sides<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.020> way<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.200> can

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
look to a couple sides that way you can

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.249 
look to a couple sides that way you can
just<00:01:31.530> see<00:01:31.860> where<00:01:32.070> everyone<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.810> can

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
just see where everyone is and I you can

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.710 
just see where everyone is and I you can
get<00:01:34.470> behind<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.979> enemy<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:36.030> behind<00:01:36.450> their

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
get behind the enemy get behind their

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.800 
get behind the enemy get behind their
backs<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:39.060> expecting

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
backs and all of them are not expecting

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.050 
backs and all of them are not expecting
you<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.049> be<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.759> easily

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you to be there and I you can easily

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
you to be there and I you can easily
kill<00:01:42.450> them<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.049> once<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.680> are<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.070> their

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
kill them and once you are in their

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.060 
kill them and once you are in their
enemy<00:01:44.610> spawn<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.380> they<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.770> really

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
enemy spawn and they just get really

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520 
enemy spawn and they just get really
confused<00:01:47.700> once<00:01:48.180> they<00:01:48.540> once<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.380> into

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.770 
confused once they once you get into
their<00:01:49.770> spawn<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.909> keep<00:01:51.090> killing<00:01:51.450> them<00:01:51.509> as

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
their spawn and you keep killing them as

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
their spawn and you keep killing them as
they<00:01:51.960> spawned<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.740> don't<00:01:52.950> know<00:01:53.009> what

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
they spawned they just don't know what

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.190 
they spawned they just don't know what
to<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> keep<00:01:54.960> moving

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
to do and you just have to keep moving

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.350 
to do and you just have to keep moving
around<00:01:55.530> because<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.729> also<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.210> good

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
around because that's also a good

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.050 
around because that's also a good
strategy<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.140> do<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.829> just<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.399> keep<00:01:59.640> moving

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
strategy to do is just to keep moving

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.179 
strategy to do is just to keep moving
around<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.659> make<00:02:01.290> sure<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> enemies

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
around and make sure that the enemies

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.600 
around and make sure that the enemies
don't<00:02:02.490> know<00:02:02.700> where<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.439> that<00:02:04.439> way<00:02:04.649> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
don't know where you are that way you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.630 
don't know where you are that way you
really<00:02:06.390> don't<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.170> good<00:02:07.259> shot<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:08.039> dying

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
really don't have a good shot of dying

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.369 
really don't have a good shot of dying
just<00:02:09.330> because<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.840> enemies<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.259> know

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
just because the enemies don't know

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.390 
just because the enemies don't know
where<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.739> they<00:02:10.890> gonna<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.250> keep
