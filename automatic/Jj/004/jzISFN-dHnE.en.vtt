passionate I think he thinks about
performance<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.679> cycling<00:00:11.540> 24<00:00:12.540> hours<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.809> day

somebody that's that's it's their mind
and<00:00:23.250> their<00:00:24.289> creativity<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.560> should<00:00:25.920> say<00:00:26.099> it's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and their creativity I should say it's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.689 
and their creativity I should say it's
just<00:00:26.550> it's<00:00:26.730> constantly<00:00:27.539> emotional

thinking<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.570> performance<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:37.410> would

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
thinking about performance what would

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.160 
thinking about performance what would
work<00:00:37.739> wouldn't<00:00:38.309> work<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.910> know<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.050> be

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
honest some of its a little crazy and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.619 
honest some of its a little crazy and
something<00:00:41.760> you'll<00:00:41.910> roll<00:00:42.059> something<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.480> they

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
something you'll roll something out they

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.369 
something you'll roll something out they
know<00:00:42.780> there's<00:00:43.250> no<00:00:44.250> no<00:00:44.309> there's<00:00:44.969> no<00:00:45.120> way<00:00:45.379> I'm

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
know there's no no there's no way I'm

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.200 
know there's no no there's no way I'm
gonna<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.370> some<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> stuff<00:00:47.969> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
gonna do that but some of the stuff is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.090 
gonna do that but some of the stuff is
very<00:00:48.420> practical<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.770> applied<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
very practical and can be applied to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.790 
very practical and can be applied to
what<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.730> day<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.149> day<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.469> it<00:00:52.469> carries

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
what we do day in and day out it carries

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.650 
what we do day in and day out it carries
a<00:00:52.829> lot<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.250> gadgets<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.059> all<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> sudden<00:00:54.539> one

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
a lot of gadgets so all of a sudden one

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
a lot of gadgets so all of a sudden one
day<00:00:54.690> before<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> train<00:00:55.320> ride<00:00:55.590> he<00:00:56.010> comes<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
day before a train ride he comes out and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.020 
day before a train ride he comes out and
he's<00:00:56.579> got<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:57.140> just<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.430> big<00:00:59.430> roll<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
he's got this just this big roll of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.719 
he's got this just this big roll of
string<00:01:01.070> he<00:01:02.070> puts<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> string<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.840> uh

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
string he puts up with a string and uh

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.890 
string he puts up with a string and uh
yeah<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> test<00:01:06.689> some

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
yeah you know I want to test some

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.539 
yeah you know I want to test some
aerodynamics<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.040> next<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> know

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
aerodynamics so the next thing you know

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.969 
aerodynamics so the next thing you know
he<00:01:08.670> takes<00:01:08.909> my<00:01:09.060> skin<00:01:09.360> suit<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> helmet<00:01:09.979> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
he takes my skin suit and the helmet and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.210 
he takes my skin suit and the helmet and
he's<00:01:11.100> applied<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:12.950> probably<00:01:13.950> three

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
he's applied these little probably three

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
he's applied these little probably three
inch<00:01:14.430> sections<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.150> string<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:16.439> over<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
inch sections of string all over the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.210 
inch sections of string all over the
skin<00:01:17.159> suit<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.060> perfectly<00:01:18.830> structured<00:01:19.830> way

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
skin suit in a perfectly structured way

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.640 
skin suit in a perfectly structured way
and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.729> over<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.000> helmet<00:01:21.439> and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.560> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and then all over the helmet and then I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.170 
and then all over the helmet and then I
just<00:01:22.799> went<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.130> did<00:01:23.280> my<00:01:23.460> workout<00:01:23.820> which

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
just went out and did my workout which

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.350 
just went out and did my workout which
we<00:01:24.360> filmed<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.210> go

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
we filmed so you know you can really go

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.460 
we filmed so you know you can really go
back<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.600> look<00:01:28.020> at

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
back and look at

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.430 
back and look at
each<00:01:30.070> of<00:01:30.280> those<00:01:30.400> strings<00:01:30.760> are<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:32.050> groups<00:01:32.290> of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
each of those strings are the groups of

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.010 
each of those strings are the groups of
strings<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:33.730> find<00:01:34.030> out<00:01:34.210> where<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.630> air<00:01:34.810> gets

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
strings and find out where that air gets

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.430 
strings and find out where that air gets
dirty<00:01:35.350> when<00:01:36.250> we<00:01:36.370> talked<00:01:36.580> earlier<00:01:36.700> about<00:01:37.000> about

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
dirty when we talked earlier about about

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.710 
dirty when we talked earlier about about
how<00:01:38.440> people<00:01:38.830> just<00:01:39.040> on<00:01:39.850> their<00:01:40.060> own<00:01:40.090> can<00:01:40.570> get

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
how people just on their own can get

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.420 
how people just on their own can get
fast<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.260> that's<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.560> that's<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.920> it's<00:01:42.340> an

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
fast and that's it that's a it's an

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.130 
fast and that's it that's a it's an
amazingly<00:01:42.880> simple<00:01:43.300> then<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.690> experiment

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
amazingly simple then that experiment

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.880 
amazingly simple then that experiment
probably<00:01:44.410> cost<00:01:44.620> two<00:01:45.520> dollars<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:47.470> counting

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
probably cost two dollars not counting

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.760 
probably cost two dollars not counting
the<00:01:48.010> video<00:01:48.250> camera<00:01:48.640> but<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:50.140> it's<00:01:50.380> it's<00:01:50.620> not

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
the video camera but it's it's it's not

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.470 
the video camera but it's it's it's not
that<00:01:50.830> hard<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.580> do<00:01:51.760> little<00:01:52.000> things<00:01:52.090> like<00:01:52.360> that

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
that hard to do little things like that

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.740 
that hard to do little things like that
that<00:01:52.690> they<00:01:53.320> really<00:01:53.560> teach<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.800> where<00:01:54.750> where

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
that they really teach you where where

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.630 
that they really teach you where where
you're<00:01:55.930> going<00:01:56.650> unquote<00:01:56.830> slow<00:01:57.250> or<00:01:57.460> where

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
you're going unquote slow or where

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.880 
you're going unquote slow or where
you're<00:01:57.760> going<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.210> quote<00:01:58.330> fast<00:01:58.660> and<00:01:59.050> you<00:01:59.770> have

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
you're going to quote fast and you have
