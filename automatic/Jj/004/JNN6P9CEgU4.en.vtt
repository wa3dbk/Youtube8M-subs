00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.759 
beautician um so what happened when I
first<00:00:28.310> got<00:00:28.519> installed<00:00:29.029> I<00:00:29.560> originally<00:00:30.560> ordered

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
first got installed I originally ordered

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.710 
first got installed I originally ordered
three<00:00:31.189> bundles<00:00:31.540> 20<00:00:32.540> to<00:00:32.720> 26<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.830> a<00:00:34.190> 24<00:00:34.720> but

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
three bundles 20 to 26 and a 24 but

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.470 
three bundles 20 to 26 and a 24 but
since<00:00:36.290> my<00:00:36.410> head<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:36.860> small<00:00:37.280> I<00:00:37.640> could<00:00:37.850> only<00:00:37.969> fit

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
since my head so small I could only fit

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.750 
since my head so small I could only fit
two<00:00:39.350> bundles<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:39.980> hair<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.340> because<00:00:40.610> the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
two bundles of the hair and because the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.450 
two bundles of the hair and because the
bundles<00:00:41.149> are<00:00:41.270> really<00:00:41.750> full<00:00:41.989> on<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.410> hair<00:00:42.680> and

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
bundles are really full on that hair and

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.119 
bundles are really full on that hair and
I<00:00:44.090> mean<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:44.300> have<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.629> pretty<00:00:44.930> small<00:00:45.379> head<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.100> I

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
I mean I have a pretty small head so I

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.760 
I mean I have a pretty small head so I
guess<00:00:46.550> but<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.600> bundles<00:00:47.960> are<00:00:48.050> extremely<00:00:48.559> full

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
guess but the bundles are extremely full

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.500 
guess but the bundles are extremely full
for<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.219> links<00:00:49.520> that<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:49.730> get<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.329> it's

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
for the links that you get and it's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.660 
for the links that you get and it's
definitely<00:00:51.050> true<00:00:51.379> to<00:00:51.500> link<00:00:51.739> like<00:00:52.010> it's

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
definitely true to link like it's

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
I don't like about this hair is the

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.060 
I don't like about this hair is the
frizziness<00:01:11.270> like<00:01:12.080> when<00:01:12.439> I<00:01:12.500> first<00:01:12.680> got<00:01:12.890> it

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
frizziness like when I first got it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.920 
frizziness like when I first got it
installed<00:01:13.400> it<00:01:13.670> was<00:01:13.790> extremely<00:01:14.270> frizzy<00:01:14.780> I

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
installed it was extremely frizzy I

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.140 
installed it was extremely frizzy I
don't<00:01:15.200> like<00:01:15.409> my<00:01:15.740> hair<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.040> be<00:01:16.070> frizzy<00:01:16.580> but

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
don't like my hair to be frizzy but

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.330 
don't like my hair to be frizzy but
since<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:17.750> curled<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.320> did<00:01:18.530> pull<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.009> curls

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
since it's curled I did pull the curls

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.600 
since it's curled I did pull the curls
out<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.210> maybe<00:01:20.420> that's<00:01:20.689> why<00:01:20.990> it's<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:21.740> frizzy

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
out so maybe that's why it's so frizzy

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.679 
out so maybe that's why it's so frizzy
but<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.479> don't<00:01:23.780> really<00:01:24.079> mind<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:25.000> at<00:01:26.000> all<00:01:26.210> like

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
very dry to me so I'm probably gonna

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.940 
very dry to me so I'm probably gonna
deep<00:02:47.090> condition<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:47.720> because<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.680> don't<00:02:48.830> like

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950

now<00:02:55.720> just<00:02:56.720> because<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.260> ends<00:02:57.560> are<00:02:57.680> dry<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.400> it

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
now just because the ends are dry and it

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.400 
now just because the ends are dry and it
gets<00:02:58.700> really<00:02:58.910> frizzy<00:02:59.390> but<00:02:59.570> once<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.900> wash<00:03:00.140> it
