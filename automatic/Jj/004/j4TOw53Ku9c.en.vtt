 in civican 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.590
 in my life 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.479
 to me 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.200
 no desire 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.560
 without who comes 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.190
 she is friend 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.440
 in this scenario 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.360
 Let's go with the jury, Luis Colonel 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.580
 I really thought it was nice 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.560
 presentation you can give a lot 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.319
 very much more if truthfully I know 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.030
 I noticed it and I say it because I am 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.090
 fanatic of you the truth 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.960
 thank you or death 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.500
 I did not like anything 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.640
 nothing 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.700
 nothing I did not like how you danced this 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.400
 night for me they lived must be asleep 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.790
 and in the academy and then it's 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.260
 resting and I hope I can see the week 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.610
 that goes in because tonight 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.610
 viviane did not come 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.390
 alicia villarreal 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.940
 living 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.520
 I feel like you've had songs in 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.250
 those that you have been in only one 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:25.140
 position then this song was a 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.050
 challenge but terribly great dancing 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.780
 and singing at the same time is not easy 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.340
 difficult today I think we are a 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.660
 little surprised and we do not expect that one 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.590
 acting like today 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.590
 hears 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.950
 it was very little for us but now 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.129
 of the verdict what the parties 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.239

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.239
 ingrid mussi 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.739

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.210

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.250
 it's also going to be a red 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.680
 for viviana and this would be the first time 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.110
 in all the concerts that lived 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.180
 will be sentenced Luis Colonel lived 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.360
 that does not mean it 's the last of you 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.330
 as they all said you have a lot 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.320
 talent and you can give yourself the best but today 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.880
 today was not your day you have to improve 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.680
 tonight I think the big ones are 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.450
 singers have good night 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.450
