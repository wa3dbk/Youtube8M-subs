00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
one feature of Pam that I was working on

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
one feature of Pam that I was working on
in<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:52.579> weekend<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.300> actually<00:00:54.809> make<00:00:55.199> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
in this weekend is to actually make it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
in this weekend is to actually make it
sticky<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.820> more<00:00:57.210> like

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
sticky so that it will be more like

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
sticky so that it will be more like
adjusting<00:00:58.160> but<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.510> can<00:01:00.510> move<00:01:01.190> then<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> camera

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
adjusting but I can move then the camera

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.570 
adjusting but I can move then the camera
the<00:01:03.120> way<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.270> want<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:04.220> diljit<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.460> way<00:01:05.549> I

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the way I want it diljit the way I

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.600 
the way I want it diljit the way I
wanted<00:01:06.119> let<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:06.990> hands<00:01:07.229> go<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> camera

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
wanted let my hands go and to the camera

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
wanted let my hands go and to the camera
keeps<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.390> position<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:11.900> initially<00:01:12.900> thought

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
keeps the position I initially thought

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.060 
keeps the position I initially thought
that<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.619> will<00:01:13.950> need<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.580> modify<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.409> r9x

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that I will need to modify the r9x

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
that I will need to modify the r9x
firmware<00:01:17.670> which<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.630> open<00:01:18.930> source<00:01:19.170> which<00:01:19.530> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
firmware which is open source which is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.510 
firmware which is open source which is
great<00:01:20.450> but<00:01:21.450> after<00:01:22.380> looking<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> source

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
great but after looking at the source

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.550 
great but after looking at the source
code<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.600> some<00:01:24.810> time<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.229> figured<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
code for some time I figured out that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.499 
code for some time I figured out that
everything<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.680> needed<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.490> already<00:01:30.000> there

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.600 

just<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.720> take<00:01:33.990> some<00:01:34.409> very<00:01:35.310> specific

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
just just take some very specific

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.819 
just just take some very specific
settings<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.229> mixes<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.979> make<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> work

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
settings and the mixes to make this work

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.310 
settings and the mixes to make this work
and<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:44.040> speed<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:45.119> reach<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.020> bans

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and the speed we reach it bans

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
and the speed we reach it bans
adjustable<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.820> has<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.630> kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.960> expo<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.970> some

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
adjustable it has a kind of expo so some

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.710 
adjustable it has a kind of expo so some
movements<00:01:51.659> around<00:01:52.430> middle<00:01:53.430> point<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:54.240> slow

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
movements around middle point are slow

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.889 
movements around middle point are slow
and<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:57.740> movements<00:01:58.740> around

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.649 

the<00:02:02.899> edges<00:02:03.289> are<00:02:03.469> making<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.520> pan<00:02:04.850> work<00:02:05.270> fast

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
the edges are making the pan work fast

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.790 
the edges are making the pan work fast
and<00:02:06.039> there<00:02:07.039> is<00:02:07.159> also<00:02:07.399> i<00:02:07.969> can<00:02:08.660> always<00:02:08.810> also<00:02:09.379> set

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
and there is also i can always also set

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.460 
and there is also i can always also set
up<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.160> trainer<00:02:10.399> switch<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.989> Center<00:02:12.319> the
