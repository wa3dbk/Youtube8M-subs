00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.140 
this was really too narrow and rather
for<00:03:37.230> simple<00:03:37.650> dish<00:03:38.640> thing<00:03:39.150> like<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:41.150> seems

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
for simple dish thing like this seems

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.479 
for simple dish thing like this seems
like<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:42.750> lacking<00:03:43.050> better<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:50.190> looks

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
like it's lacking better it looks

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.150 
like it's lacking better it looks
already<00:03:50.880> pretty<00:03:51.300> hot
