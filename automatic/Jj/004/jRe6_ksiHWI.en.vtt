 Look, I got on the cruise with 14 years. 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.070
 eight years playing in mine my will 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.329
 it was until I left mine to breathe 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.630
 fresh air 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.710
 six years ago on the cruise was one year 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.049

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.700
 finally everything is very happy to have come 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.520
 Ah well. How do you say you need it? 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.619
 breathe new air and I'll give my 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.770
 maximum so that I will try to help the team 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.560
 and look for my space here train hard 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.770
 It's because I want to play in a big 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.790
 with great club like the avaí 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.590
 Anderson for the radio goes is the position 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.170
 first and second 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.570
 both in the Santa Catarina championship 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.880
 a turnover of athletes coming from 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.850
 participating in the titular team is you 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.080
 Do you think you're coming to remedy this difficulty? 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.270
 in the midfield to really 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.220
 effectively own and another you 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.290
 also played all this current of yours. 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.460
 career in soccer miner you think 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.980
 who may have some difficulty 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.800
 adaptation to Santa Catarina football 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.190
 No, I do not think I'm going to go slowly. 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.290
 adapting the I stayed until almost two 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.150
 months stopped only training separately than 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.710
 the contract with betim ended 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.470
 I went back to the cruise and I was training. 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:01.050
 apart is to continue training to 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.670
 not to lose the rhythm that I was seeing that 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.160
 was coming in the sequence of games and 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.410
 then I stayed two months 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.630
 good is on top of that anderson himself 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.930
 Remember when was your last match? 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.930
 of the last official game does not look two 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.360
 months ago against the bank by the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.760
 Brazil the little bird against the bangu in the river 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.530
 almost two months ago 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.480
 Leaving is also you coming to 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.459
 a function where the avaí has ​​a player 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.870
 experienced players such as 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.400
 eduardo costa who performs the function of 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.500
 first steering wheel has a fin also 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.959
 who is an experienced athlete but has a 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.610
 young man who is the house that is the 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.800
 rodrigo thiesen and has the confidence 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.890
 fan is you believe that this may 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.570
 make it difficult for you a little 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.250
 presence in the training 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.700
 these factors of those players who 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.820
 has 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.630
 so I guess not all the work, huh? 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.660
 face 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.510
 It's all coming now, of course. 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.970
 excellent players and Eduardo there but 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.150
 I'll try to get my space here. 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.160
 but then what the supporter can expect from 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.020
 you on the field you can contribute 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.340
 with this group of the Bahia wanted you to 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.140
 Talk about your first impressions 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 here in the city 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.090
 Look what the supporter will expect from me. 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.010
 a very warlike player the then priest 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.350
 I like to fight marking 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.150
 I like to vibrate what the fans will 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.030
 will expect from the show the city'm 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.520
 adapting is very cold here when 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.690
 I arrived I felt a little difficulty 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.060
 quite cold but 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.370
 I gradually adapting me little by 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.770
 How long have you been training there? 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.050
 You can talk about the current group and the 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.690
 players and you think that with this 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.040
 cast will be able to reach the 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.300
 main objective being the elite of the 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.260
 Brazilian football 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.840
 I think yes the excellent groups the 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.210
 players experienced kleber o edu ali 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.550
 the diego 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.220
 many good players I think so 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.540
 people have every chance to go back to the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.920
 elite of Brazilian football that is the 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.390
 series to 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.880
 when they only caught my attention yesterday 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.160
 We have interviewed Bruno Mayan and he 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.510
 is a player who just arrived has also 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.030
 the possibility of debuting in this game 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.210
 against him are caetano but he demonstrated 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.890
 since well integrated with the group and 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.990
 You know the situation where Avai will 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.280
 living in the league is you too 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.350
 understanding the situation in which I 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.320
 I was living despite having arrived so long ago. 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.290
 little time is also like bruno maya no 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.230
 Yes, yes, the others just said it a little. 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.590
 the pressure that was here 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.270
 Even talking to Bruno is winning. 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.430
 this game against the are caetano if not 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.100
 We're already there in the zone so the 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.140
 People already know what the pressure is like here and there. 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.110
 on Saturday there and win 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.610
 What does it matter to us to win? 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.130
 as the young man should mirror a 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.710
 the wheel of your position has a player is 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.960
 that you mirror in your position you 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.010
 similar characteristics speak for 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.400
 the fan of avaí 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.360
 Look, I really like gilberto silva's. 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.760
 great great player great person 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.490
 is that today in the athletic miner in the 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.010
 A lot of mirror in it is just to relax 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:15.330
 a little you have already been told to 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:18.470
 his resemblance to Luis Fabiano did not 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.470
 no never
