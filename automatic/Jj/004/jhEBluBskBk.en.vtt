00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
with the fake soap bar and everything

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.580 
with the fake soap bar and everything
else<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.659> learned<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:51.960> cupboard<00:01:52.320> he<00:01:52.409> was

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
else and learned what cupboard he was

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
else and learned what cupboard he was
and<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.340> started<00:01:53.640> working<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> model<00:01:54.329> fairly

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and I started working as a model fairly

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.380 
and I started working as a model fairly
successfully<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.790> then<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.240> was

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
successfully and then I think I was

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.030 
successfully and then I think I was
pretty<00:01:57.540> successful<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> model<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.680> was<00:01:58.799> very

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
pretty successful as a model I was very

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.490 
pretty successful as a model I was very
happy<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.060> did<00:02:00.479> obviously<00:02:00.869> keep<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.200> trying

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
happy but I did obviously keep on trying

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.010 
happy but I did obviously keep on trying
and<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:02.040> um<00:02:02.270> from<00:02:03.270> where<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> started<00:02:03.899> out

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and I think um from where I started out

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.499 
and I think um from where I started out
I<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.850> achieved<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:06.180> than<00:02:06.240> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
I think I have achieved more than I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.529 
I think I have achieved more than I
could<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.840> dreamed<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
could have dreamed of and that kind of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.809 
could have dreamed of and that kind of
brings<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.050> guess<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
brings you I guess to the to the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.130 
brings you I guess to the to the
question<00:02:12.239> which

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
question which

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.170 
question which
I<00:02:13.230> ask<00:02:13.530> myself<00:02:13.800> now<00:02:14.220> which<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.670> when<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.060> it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
I ask myself now which is when is it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.670 
I ask myself now which is when is it
enough<00:02:15.450> when<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.680> sit<00:02:16.980> back<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.459> say<00:02:18.680> I've

most industries I think is an extremely
cutthroat<00:02:32.250> competitive<00:02:32.790> industry<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.780> if

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
cutthroat competitive industry and if

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:34.850 
cutthroat competitive industry and if
