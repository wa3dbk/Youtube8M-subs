 but rather I wanted to say that on the 16th 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.020
 December now 2013 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.150
 we reached the mark of ten thousand 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.550
 subscribers on the channel and so I 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.409
 say thank you to you and how to 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.000
 of retribution wanted you to say 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.350
 this video to the end because it has a 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.909
 surprise for you there 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.159
 going back to the subject of the video, let 's 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:11.409
 first of a thing that many people 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.180
 They ask me how many cameras I used. 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.820
 to record the pilot episode of 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.950
 antidotes webserve and watch this sequence 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.510
 what a fast one and thinks about how many cameras 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.840
 were used to make this 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.840
 recording 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:55.180
 and then you know there were not three not too 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.520
 45 does not have also not been thus 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.630
 people used only one camera to 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.600
 make this scene 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.220
 even a camera use a 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.830
 camera only to make a recording of a 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.420
 scene by putting it in various angles gives 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.180
 a lot more work because you're going to have 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.770
 than repeat the scene several times but the 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.870
 result is very similar to 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.150
 those professional films in which 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.920
 guys use 56 cameras to make the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.110
 recording of the scenes the tip here is 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.970
 use what you have and got the 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.470
 best possible result and remember 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.870
 that there is no point in complaining that 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.030
 that or that equipment what you 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.610
 need is to be creative is what I will 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.180
 Talking to you now may sound silly but not 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.310
 is 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.230
 if you want to make an action video by 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.180
 example, the ideal is that you 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.770
 several videos related to this 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.050
 subject be films series novels no 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.420
 novels do not forget novel through 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.130
 observation and study of large 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.590
 productions you will realize how the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.330
 revelers do to be able to do the same in 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.520
 Your video may not have the same 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.750
 equipment is the same budget as those 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.550
 great productions 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.370
 so be aware of the first tip 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.230
 this video is like a gull 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.989
 besides you can follow here in the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.970
 the series the making cinema that brings 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.739
 Valuable tips exist but for you that 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.970
 wants to learn more about this 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.970
 world of film production 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.820
 If you watched the episode of the series 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.030
 doing cinema where I talk about 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.160
 framework 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.570
 you must remember the general plan 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.340
 It is generally used when we 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.680
 wants to show where our history 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.720
 happens now imagine that you will 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.880
 record a scene inside the forest 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.709
 and you have three characters in the woods that 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.209
 they seem really lost 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.010
 And then you stop to think that's where 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.290
 Do you live there is no jungle there? 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.519
 there is a forest for you to 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.230
 make these images 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.690
 the more you have a botanical garden 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.209
 And then think to me how you're going to make a 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.370
 plan of a jungle without having a 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.920
 jungle and if you want to make an outlet 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.670
 over the forest to show 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.900
 your viewer that this defendant 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.970
 What is happening inside the 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.650
 forest how you do it 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.510
 Look what I did in the pilot episode. 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.430
 of the websire antidote z 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.599
 before showing the pedro and gsk inside 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.730
 from their house 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.340
 I put in three cool videos of 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.860
 a website called tram five that shows a 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.600
 general plan the city of são paulo 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.880
 so the viewer is watching the 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.280
 video he will see the three videos of 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.220
 São Paulo and will understand that the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.120
 next thing happens in that 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.650
 environment 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.020
 in the case of the forest we could do 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.360
 the same thing taking the video from a 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.880
 forest and putting it before 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.460
 present the characters and this without 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.350
 hard work and low cost 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.660
 even because it would be practically unfeasible 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.970
 to capture these images alone and 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.680
 it would take a lot of time to do and that is 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.900
 an advantage of stock fruit 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.030
 you do not have to be in the place or else 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.590
 work to record this kind of scene 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.600
 and whenever I need that kind of 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.270
 material I go to site do point 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.660
 there is an immense library of videos 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.889
 photos and even After Effects projects and 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.479
 There's music too. 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.760
 including the one you're listening to 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.410
 now at that moment it was made from there looks 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.950
 just how much cool is on the site 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.950
 point does 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.550
 and if you tell me that you can sell 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.850
 your stuff over there putting the price 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.920
 you want 50% of the value is yours 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.600
 and to end the surprise I had 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.850
 promised to you at the beginning of the video 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.560
 if you were looking for that song 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.590
 or that image and video for your 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.810
 video gets cooler I've separated 50 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.690
 media there in five bread to site
