 In fact, the confusion was not 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:15.420
 All right until I open the side 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:20.250
 from his tent they heard of the whole 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.900

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.600

 We need to talk because it does not work. 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.420
 To live fighting, I do not want our 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.829
 families are fighting then I will 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:45.480
 offer one thing if you choose to go 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:51.560
 there I go here and know it was 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:55.889
 There was a big mountain here. 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.069
 Abraham looked at her. 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:02.590
 mountain and on the other side knows that 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:06.120
 a great valley 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.390
 and this valley had lots of fresh water 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.319
 But, open braga, it will not change. 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.910
 to have a fight he let his nephew 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.970
 chose first then he spoke 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.750
 so you will choose first 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:29.830
 oprah plain or to the mountains 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:32.229

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.510
 I'm going to the plain because there's water there. 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.340
 and I'm sure my 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.950
 sheep did not die of thirst 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.940

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.570
 flat land 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.960
 I will stop the mountain where life 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.290
 it would be a little harder but abraham 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.320
 did not think twice and he wanted peace 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:57.490
 went to the mountains together with 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:01.389
 your family as long as love went there to 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:05.590
 with their employees and all 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:07.660
 their sheep and all their wealth 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.460
 years ago a very 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.610
 important in this story 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.979
 we must always preserve peace 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.950
 even if you have the right to everything 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:20.590
 but do not forget to let the others 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:26.220
 choose the first one wait a little 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.220
 and always preserve to pass no quarrel
