00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
helps us more honestly try to

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.590 
helps us more honestly try to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
communicate that to other people so it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.370 
communicate that to other people so it
was<00:02:11.690> really<00:02:11.810> because<00:02:11.959> you're<00:02:12.140> playing

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380

interface in front of that you just use

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.880 
interface in front of that you just use
stumble<00:02:23.450> across<00:02:23.510> people<00:02:23.989> naturally

there's there's so much focus on on the
mechanics<00:02:45.519> and<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.730> game<00:02:46.030> itself<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.750> you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
mechanics and the game itself that you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.270 
mechanics and the game itself that you
don't<00:02:47.440> really<00:02:47.620> get<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.830> chance<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.129> pay

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
don't really get a chance to pay

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.160 
don't really get a chance to pay
attention<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.819> other<00:02:48.970> person<00:02:49.170> so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
attention to the other person so

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.780 
attention to the other person so
hopefully<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.620> journey<00:02:50.920> when<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.250> when<00:02:51.760> you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
hopefully a journey when you when you

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.729 
hopefully a journey when you when you
run<00:02:52.000> into<00:02:52.030> someone<00:02:52.420> else<00:02:52.660> you<00:02:52.870> can<00:02:53.019> really

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
run into someone else you can really

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.470 
run into someone else you can really
think<00:02:53.890> about<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.220> relationship<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.360> can

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
think about that relationship so you can

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.789 
think about that relationship so you can
think<00:02:55.569> about<00:02:55.660> do<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.230> want<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.470> stick<00:02:56.620> with<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
think about do I want to stick with the

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.710 
think about do I want to stick with the

out together or not it's really up to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.089 
out together or not it's really up to
the<00:03:03.400> user<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.810> choose<00:03:05.380> how<00:03:05.620> they<00:03:05.650> interact

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
with someone else and hopefully that'll

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.210 
with someone else and hopefully that'll
be<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.420> more<00:03:07.870> sincere<00:03:08.290> interaction<00:03:08.980> with<00:03:09.099> other

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220
