00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
not on the exchange so I went ahead and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.910 
not on the exchange so I went ahead and
made<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:26.070> myself<00:00:26.189> um<00:00:26.789> there<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> few<00:00:28.230> changes

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
made it myself um there is a few changes

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.940 
made it myself um there is a few changes
that<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.340> did<00:00:29.699> make<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:31.550> um<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.610> instance

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
that I did make to it um for instance

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.590 
that I did make to it um for instance
I'm<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.010> sure<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.700> tree<00:00:36.030> she<00:00:36.239> had<00:00:36.390> here<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
I'm not sure what tree she had here I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.510 
I'm not sure what tree she had here I
think<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.500> one<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:37.829> I'm<00:00:37.950> not<00:00:37.980> quite

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
think it was this one but I'm not quite

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.200 
think it was this one but I'm not quite
sure<00:00:39.410> um<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.770> mailbox<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> trashcan<00:00:42.059> are

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
sure um the mailbox and the trashcan are

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.459 
sure um the mailbox and the trashcan are
in<00:00:42.270> separate<00:00:42.660> places

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
in separate places

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.880 
in separate places
and<00:00:44.750> there<00:00:45.750> are<00:00:45.960> these<00:00:46.379> trees<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:48.890> like

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and there are these trees and like

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
and there are these trees and like
there's<00:00:50.129> two<00:00:50.370> extra<00:00:50.579> spaces<00:00:51.120> where<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
there's two extra spaces where the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.850 
there's two extra spaces where the
garage<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:52.110> normally<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> doors

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
garage is because normally the doors

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010 
garage is because normally the doors
were<00:00:53.070> over<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.640> other<00:00:54.210> words<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> far<00:00:54.809> end

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
were over here other words the far end

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.080 
were over here other words the far end
and<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.410> stopped<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.550> end<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.879> one

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and it's stopped at the end of this one

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.560 
and it's stopped at the end of this one
like<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> Walden<00:00:57.980> um<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:01.820> basically<00:01:02.820> why<00:01:03.539> I

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
like the Walden um so basically why I

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.219 
like the Walden um so basically why I
did<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.710> because<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:06.420> using<00:01:06.659> cheat

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
did that was because I was using cheat

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.080 
did that was because I was using cheat
codes<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.979> wasn't<00:01:08.310> quite<00:01:08.400> sure<00:01:08.670> how<00:01:08.909> they

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
codes so it wasn't quite sure how they

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
codes so it wasn't quite sure how they
did<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> was<00:01:10.950> using<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.490> know

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
did that so I was using you know

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.070 
did that so I was using you know
constraint<00:01:12.119> or<00:01:12.770> allegation<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:17.390> I<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.910 

things<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.560> hide<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.130> little<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.750> know

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
things here to hide the little you know

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.810 
things here to hide the little you know
this<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:26.220> thing<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:28.040> but<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> most

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
this little thing here but for the most

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.660 
this little thing here but for the most
part<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.420> mean<00:01:30.600> there's<00:01:30.869> not<00:01:31.110> much<00:01:31.670> different

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
part I mean there's not much different

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.350 
part I mean there's not much different
on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.689> back<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.409> she<00:01:35.400> never<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.030> shows

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
on the back here she never really shows

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.240 
on the back here she never really shows
the<00:01:36.990> back<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.780> pretty<00:01:40.079> much<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.680> would<00:01:40.890> do

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the back so I pretty much I would do

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.789 
the back so I pretty much I would do
like<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.390> her<00:01:42.509> videos<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:42.990> least<00:01:43.020> once<00:01:43.290> to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
like all of her videos at least once to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.539 
like all of her videos at least once to
figure<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> most<00:01:45.810> part<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
figure it out but for the most part I

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
figure it out but for the most part I
had<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.579> kind<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.060> guess<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:49.680> are<00:01:49.860> kind

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
had to kind of guess so these are kind

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.889 
had to kind of guess so these are kind
of<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.220> laid<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.880> way<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.270> laid<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.750> out

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
of just laid out the way I laid it out

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.950 
of just laid out the way I laid it out
this<00:01:52.590> here<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:53.970> she<00:01:54.210> put<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:56.960> now

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
this here is the way she put it now

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
this here is the way she put it now
these<00:01:58.110> two<00:01:58.320> stairs<00:01:58.619> are<00:01:58.860> actually<00:01:59.430> over<00:01:59.729> here

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
these two stairs are actually over here

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
these two stairs are actually over here
but<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:00.570> reason<00:02:01.049> they<00:02:01.229> wouldn't<00:02:01.530> go

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
but for some reason they wouldn't go

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.380 
but for some reason they wouldn't go
over<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.759> mean<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.450> erased<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.310> walls<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
over here I mean I erased the walls the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.119 
over here I mean I erased the walls the
windows<00:02:06.600> everything<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:07.829> still

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
windows everything and they still

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.330 
windows everything and they still
wouldn't<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.550> there<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.239> went<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
wouldn't go there so they went there and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.839 
wouldn't go there so they went there and
this<00:02:11.489> padding<00:02:12.269> here<00:02:12.540> was<00:02:12.690> actually<00:02:13.140> over<00:02:13.410> here

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
this padding here was actually over here

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.729 
this padding here was actually over here
but<00:02:14.849> because<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.420> stairs<00:02:15.720> wouldn't<00:02:16.140> go<00:02:16.260> here

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
but because the stairs wouldn't go here

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.410 
but because the stairs wouldn't go here
I<00:02:16.950> extended<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.640> out<00:02:17.879> here<00:02:18.950> that's<00:02:20.420> pretty

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
I extended it out here that's pretty

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.680 
I extended it out here that's pretty
much<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.870> now<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.590> inside<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.489> based<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.330> all

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
much it now the inside is based on all

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.930 
much it now the inside is based on all
of<00:02:25.170> her<00:02:26.720> videos<00:02:28.129> let's<00:02:29.129> take<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> sake<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.790> guess

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
of her videos let's take a sake I guess

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:43.839 
of her videos let's take a sake I guess
round

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.739 

I<00:02:43.879> even<00:02:44.569> added<00:02:44.900> her<00:02:45.170> little<00:02:45.499> Prius<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.420> yellow

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:47.749 
I even added her little Prius the yellow
