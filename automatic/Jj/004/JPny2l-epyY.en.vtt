this one looks kind of disco II
I'll<00:00:37.390> give<00:00:37.630> the<00:00:37.750> text<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.200> bit<00:00:38.230> of<00:00:38.470> color<00:00:38.680> and

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
I'll give the text a bit of color and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.390 
I'll give the text a bit of color and
apply<00:00:39.460> an<00:00:39.640> outline

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.740 

you

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.240 

you'll<00:00:53.750> need<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.079> pay<00:00:54.260> close<00:00:54.559> attention<00:00:54.739> to

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
you'll need to pay close attention to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.950 
you'll need to pay close attention to
this<00:00:55.340> next<00:00:55.579> part<00:00:55.879> as<00:00:56.120> this<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.629> where<00:00:56.809> it

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
this next part as this is where it

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.950 
this next part as this is where it
starts<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.410> get<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.590> bit<00:00:57.860> more<00:00:58.070> complicated

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
starts to get a bit more complicated

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.660 
starts to get a bit more complicated
from<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.050> layers<00:01:00.260> tab<00:01:00.649> you'll<00:01:01.129> notice<00:01:01.160> that

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
from the layers tab you'll notice that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.729 
from the layers tab you'll notice that
I've<00:01:01.790> been<00:01:02.000> working<00:01:02.449> on<00:01:02.570> layer<00:01:02.840> 2<00:01:02.960> which<00:01:03.559> is<00:01:03.710> a

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
I've been working on layer 2 which is a

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.620 
I've been working on layer 2 which is a
separate<00:01:04.250> layer<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.820> one<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.210> contains

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
separate layer to the one that contains

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.480 
separate layer to the one that contains
the<00:01:05.810> black<00:01:06.050> background<00:01:06.710> what<00:01:07.159> I'm<00:01:07.280> going<00:01:07.430> to

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
the black background what I'm going to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.730 
the black background what I'm going to
do<00:01:07.610> next<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.119> create<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.780> new<00:01:09.110> layer<00:01:09.409> by

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
do next is create a new layer by

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.310 
do next is create a new layer by
right-clicking<00:01:10.430> on<00:01:10.670> layer<00:01:10.909> 2<00:01:10.940> and<00:01:11.479> selecting

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
right-clicking on layer 2 and selecting

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.960 
right-clicking on layer 2 and selecting
add<00:01:12.500> new<00:01:12.920> layer<00:01:13.270> layer<00:01:14.270> 3<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.810> now<00:01:15.170> created

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
add new layer layer 3 is now created

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.300 
add new layer layer 3 is now created
drag<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.180> move<00:01:17.360> layer<00:01:17.659> 3<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:18.860> below

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
drag and move layer 3 so that it's below

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.180 
drag and move layer 3 so that it's below
layer<00:01:19.580> 2<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.810> reason<00:01:21.170> for<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.500> is<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:21.770> we

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
layer 2 the reason for this is that we

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.580 
layer 2 the reason for this is that we
want<00:01:22.369> layer<00:01:22.700> 2<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.300> be<00:01:23.420> on<00:01:23.509> top<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.990> 3<00:01:24.350> and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
want layer 2 to be on top of 3 and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.950 
want layer 2 to be on top of 3 and
consequently<00:01:25.580> always<00:01:26.210> visible<00:01:26.720> in<00:01:26.840> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
consequently always visible in the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.620 
consequently always visible in the
design<00:01:27.320> even<00:01:28.280> when<00:01:28.460> we<00:01:28.580> start<00:01:28.880> drawing<00:01:29.210> on

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
design even when we start drawing on

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.440 
design even when we start drawing on
layer<00:01:29.869> 3<00:01:30.070> you'll<00:01:31.070> see<00:01:31.310> why<00:01:31.490> this<00:01:31.550> is<00:01:31.729> important

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
layer 3 you'll see why this is important

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.130 
layer 3 you'll see why this is important
shortly<00:01:33.250> with<00:01:34.250> layer<00:01:34.490> 2<00:01:34.729> selected<00:01:35.390> copy<00:01:35.929> the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
shortly with layer 2 selected copy the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.679 
shortly with layer 2 selected copy the
text<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:36.710> paste<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:37.280> onto<00:01:37.460> layer<00:01:37.789> 3

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 

with<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> text<00:01:46.679> still<00:01:46.859> highlighted<00:01:47.490> change

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
with the text still highlighted change

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
with the text still highlighted change
the<00:01:48.240> color<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> outline<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.439> increase

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the color of the outline and increase

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:58.109 
the color of the outline and increase
its<00:01:50.219> thickness

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.789 

you<00:01:59.119> can<00:01:59.299> see<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.780> green<00:02:00.020> stroke<00:02:00.500> has

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
you can see that the green stroke has

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.310 
you can see that the green stroke has
now<00:02:01.009> emerged<00:02:01.310> from<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.729> back<00:02:02.200> repeat<00:02:03.200> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
now emerged from the back repeat the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.200 
now emerged from the back repeat the
previous<00:02:03.560> steps<00:02:04.070> as<00:02:04.310> many<00:02:04.520> times<00:02:04.850> as<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:05.180> like

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
previous steps as many times as you like

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.210 
previous steps as many times as you like
until<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.080> achieve<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.409> result<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:07.100> you're

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
until you achieve a result that you're

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.389 
until you achieve a result that you're
satisfied<00:02:07.460> with<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:09.020> once<00:02:09.229> again<00:02:09.410> add<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.069> new

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
satisfied with so once again add a new

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.960 
satisfied with so once again add a new
layer

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.850 

position<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.090> below<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> previous<00:02:16.989> one

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.220 

contents<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.670> previous<00:02:21.180> layer<00:02:21.450> across<00:02:21.930> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
contents of the previous layer across to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.120 
contents of the previous layer across to
the<00:02:22.350> new<00:02:22.500> one

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.400 

it's<00:02:28.760> then<00:02:28.970> simply<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.420> case<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.660> changing<00:02:30.320> the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
it's then simply a case of changing the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.380 
it's then simply a case of changing the
color<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:31.010> line<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.520> adjusting<00:02:32.240> its

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
color of the line and adjusting its

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.089 
color of the line and adjusting its
thickness

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.059 

and<00:02:38.219> there<00:02:38.969> you<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.480> retro<00:02:40.109> disco<00:02:40.530> text

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
and there you have it retro disco text

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.250 
and there you have it retro disco text
