00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
really right there that it'll it'll get

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.039 
really right there that it'll it'll get

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
two holes here and

two holes here and
that<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.370> still<00:02:14.610> basic<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.510> kind<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.110> kind<00:02:16.920> of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
that one still basic it kind of kind of

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.310

hold<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.310> together<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.760> use<00:02:18.150> fishing<00:02:18.480> line<00:02:18.810> and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
hold it together I use fishing line and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.680 
hold it together I use fishing line and
just<00:02:20.010> kind<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:23.400> know<00:02:23.520> tied<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.360> together

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
just kind of you know tied that together

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.230 
just kind of you know tied that together
and<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.710> held<00:02:26.010> pretty<00:02:26.250> well<00:02:26.490> but<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.150> was

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
and it it held pretty well but that was

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.700 
and it it held pretty well but that was
only<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.450> temporary<00:02:27.690> fix<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.380> can't<00:02:28.560> really

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
only a temporary fix you can't really

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.950 
only a temporary fix you can't really
just<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:28.980> around<00:02:29.160> with<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.460> knife<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.960> fishing

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
just go around with a knife with fishing

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.120 
just go around with a knife with fishing
line<00:02:31.170> on<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.650> not<00:02:31.740> going<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.010> hold

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
line on it it's not going to hold

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.840 
line on it it's not going to hold
together<00:02:32.460> very<00:02:32.970> well<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:34.740> I<00:02:34.770> did<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.370> I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
together very well so what I did do is I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.270 
together very well so what I did do is I
remembered<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.450> episode<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.530> Mythbusters<00:02:38.130> I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
remembered that episode of Mythbusters I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.910 
remembered that episode of Mythbusters I
was<00:02:38.730> thinking<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.210> wow<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:40.260> used<00:02:40.440> seven

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
was thinking like wow they used seven

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.600 
was thinking like wow they used seven
drops<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.340> crazy<00:02:41.550> glue<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.030> hold<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.810> car

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
drops of crazy glue to hold up a car

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.500 
drops of crazy glue to hold up a car
that's<00:02:44.610> pretty<00:02:44.910> impressive

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
that's pretty impressive

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.450 
that's pretty impressive
and<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.620> was<00:02:46.710> thinking<00:02:46.800> well<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.370> you

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
and I was thinking well it's like you

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.480 
and I was thinking well it's like you
know<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:48.170> scales<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> liners<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.250> this

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
know the scales and the liners of this

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.330 
know the scales and the liners of this
knife<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.940> metal<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:52.290> get<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.070> do<00:02:53.190> have

knife is metal and you get you do have

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.400 
knife is metal and you get you do have
g10<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:55.640> took<00:02:56.640> a<00:02:56.670> moment<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:57.000> thank<00:02:57.410> just

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
g10 so took a moment to thank just

screws I lifted this up and in between

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.190 
screws I lifted this up and in between
these<00:03:11.610> two<00:03:11.910> sections<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.680> know<00:03:13.710> for

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.950 
applied Krazy Glue along the entire side
and<00:03:19.730> into<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> holes<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.210> just<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.540> made<00:03:21.840> sure

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
and into the holes and just I made sure

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.510 
and into the holes and just I made sure
to<00:03:21.990> kind<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.440> goober<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.100> everywhere<00:03:23.430> to

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
to kind of just goober it everywhere to

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.310 
to kind of just goober it everywhere to
make<00:03:23.550> sure<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.880> covered<00:03:24.480> up<00:03:24.630> any<00:03:24.810> area<00:03:25.140> that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
make sure it covered up any area that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.440 
make sure it covered up any area that
could<00:03:25.500> uh<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:26.220> would<00:03:26.370> help<00:03:26.490> it<00:03:26.670> hold<00:03:26.880> hold

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
could uh that would help it hold hold

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.520 
could uh that would help it hold hold
the<00:03:27.600> knife<00:03:27.690> together<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:30.110> overall<00:03:31.110> it's<00:03:31.320> done

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
the knife together and overall it's done

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.830 
the knife together and overall it's done
pretty<00:03:31.710> well<00:03:31.860> it's<00:03:32.190> held<00:03:32.400> up<00:03:32.580> ever<00:03:32.850> since<00:03:33.180> and

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
pretty well it's held up ever since and

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.830 
pretty well it's held up ever since and
that<00:03:34.290> was<00:03:34.440> probably<00:03:35.310> about<00:03:35.640> a<00:03:35.700> month<00:03:36.300> ago<00:03:36.510> I

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
that was probably about a month ago I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.320 
that was probably about a month ago I
think<00:03:38.090> so

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
think so

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.720 
think so
I<00:03:39.360> mean<00:03:39.840> Krazy<00:03:40.140> Glue<00:03:40.320> definitely<00:03:40.770> definitely

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
I mean Krazy Glue definitely definitely

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.980 
I mean Krazy Glue definitely definitely
good<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:41.910> wouldn't<00:03:42.120> recommend<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.630> to<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> knife

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
good I wouldn't recommend it to a knife

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.280 
good I wouldn't recommend it to a knife
