00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Today, I want to share with you the three-dimensional repair face makeup 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 A little trick can make your face look deep and deep. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 I have a face and eye makeup on my face. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Use concealer to get on the forehead above the nose and on both sides of the mouth. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Then spread it evenly 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Under the eyes, you can use a gentle tap to evenly add a few fine lines. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Use the mask to fill the shadow seat 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 Chin on both sides 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Facial rim and forehead 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 Cheeks on both sides 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Use honey powder to fix makeup 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Next, use the repairing cake to draw on the sides of the bridge of the nose to the brow. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 Eyebrow shadow 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Remember to use a brush to push the shadows on both sides of the bridge of the nose so that it doesn't look unnatural. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Then use bright powder to brighten the apple muscles. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Pick up blush 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Finally, don't forget the lip gloss. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Simple three-dimensional repair makeup is complete 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Instantly create a small V face three-dimensional mountain root and deep eyes 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Remember to match the smoked eye makeup to make the facial features look more three-dimensional
