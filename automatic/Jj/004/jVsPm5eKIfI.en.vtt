00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
guys know that I drove my one-tenth

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.220 
guys know that I drove my one-tenth
e-revo<00:00:13.959> for<00:00:14.260> the<00:00:14.320> very<00:00:14.500> first<00:00:14.680> time<00:00:14.799> and<00:00:16.230> using

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
e-revo for the very first time and using

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.099 
e-revo for the very first time and using
the<00:00:17.529> water<00:00:17.770> breaking<00:00:18.369> method<00:00:18.789> is<00:00:18.970> very<00:00:19.539> very

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:20.109 
the water breaking method is very very

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.990 
the water breaking method is very very
effective<00:00:20.619> it<00:00:20.890> does<00:00:21.220> actually<00:00:21.430> give<00:00:21.760> you<00:00:21.820> more

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
effective it does actually give you more

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.550 
effective it does actually give you more
power<00:00:22.180> and<00:00:22.480> I'm<00:00:22.689> least<00:00:23.140> i'm<00:00:23.260> pretty<00:00:23.410> sure

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
power and I'm least i'm pretty sure

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
power and I'm least i'm pretty sure
because<00:00:23.980> i<00:00:24.220> think<00:00:25.150> it<00:00:25.480> does<00:00:25.630> over<00:00:26.080> what<00:00:26.289> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
because i think it does over what the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.930 
because i think it does over what the
what<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.260> rated<00:00:29.619> respect<00:00:30.070> is<00:00:30.220> for<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.580> and<00:00:30.730> i

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
what the rated respect is for it and i

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.420 
what the rated respect is for it and i
think<00:00:30.970> it's<00:00:31.240> supposed<00:00:31.330> to<00:00:31.449> be<00:00:31.570> like<00:00:31.630> 30<00:00:31.869> or<00:00:32.020> 35

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
think it's supposed to be like 30 or 35

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.680 
think it's supposed to be like 30 or 35
it<00:00:33.430> sure<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:33.730> feels<00:00:33.820> like<00:00:34.000> it's<00:00:34.149> going<00:00:34.270> faster

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
it sure it feels like it's going faster

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.450 
it sure it feels like it's going faster
than<00:00:34.719> that<00:00:34.899> and<00:00:35.230> it's<00:00:35.770> got<00:00:36.010> some<00:00:36.160> definite

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
than that and it's got some definite

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.709 
than that and it's got some definite
bite<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.789> it<00:00:36.820> when<00:00:37.000> you<00:00:37.090> when<00:00:37.300> it<00:00:37.390> takes<00:00:37.510> off

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
bite to it when you when it takes off

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.180 
bite to it when you when it takes off
and<00:00:37.899> stuff<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:38.819> if<00:00:39.819> you<00:00:39.940> guys<00:00:40.769> are<00:00:41.769> gonna<00:00:41.890> give

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
breaking method it works i mean its

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.969 
breaking method it works i mean its
first<00:00:49.269> time<00:00:49.420> i've<00:00:49.510> used<00:00:49.690> it<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.019> i<00:00:50.319> noticed<00:00:50.769> a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
video of the water breaking method and

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.900 
video of the water breaking method and
how<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.400> do<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:23.350> in<00:01:23.500> my<00:01:23.800> channel<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:24.820> you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
believe it's called brushed brush motor

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.350 
believe it's called brushed brush motor
water<00:01:29.920> break<00:01:30.190> in<00:01:30.370> I<00:01:30.550> think<00:01:31.000> that's<00:01:31.120> what<00:01:31.240> it's
