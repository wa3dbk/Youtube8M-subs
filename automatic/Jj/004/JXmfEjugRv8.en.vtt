not expecting more that's pretty hard

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.310 
not expecting more that's pretty hard
yeah<00:02:08.020> easy

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
yeah easy

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:19.530 
yeah easy
yeah<00:02:09.590> oh<00:02:12.580> good<00:02:13.580> today<00:02:13.760> huh<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:18.230> know<00:02:18.380> nice

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.930 
yeah oh good today huh you know nice
good<00:02:22.900> for<00:02:23.900> me<00:02:24.110> back<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.590> 1983<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.550> hardest

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
good for me back in 1983 the hardest

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.450 
good for me back in 1983 the hardest
part<00:02:26.180> was<00:02:26.420> around<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.590> face<00:02:27.830> move<00:02:28.190> but<00:02:28.430> I

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
part was around the face move but I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.400 
part was around the face move but I
think<00:02:28.700> that's<00:02:28.880> more<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.720> way<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.080> ethics

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
think that's more the way the ethics

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.140 
think that's more the way the ethics
that<00:02:30.620> we<00:02:30.740> did<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.070> because<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.880> couldn't

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
that we did it because I couldn't

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.080 
that we did it because I couldn't
practice<00:02:32.620> yeah<00:02:33.620> yeah<00:02:33.890> moose<00:02:34.130> soap<00:02:34.670> with<00:02:34.880> yo

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
practice yeah yeah moose soap with yo

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.390 
practice yeah yeah moose soap with yo
Ewing<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.570> everytime<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.620> lower<00:02:36.800> down<00:02:36.920> I've

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
Ewing it everytime I lower down I've

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:52.290 
Ewing it everytime I lower down I've
rehearsed<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> bottom<00:02:38.630> became<00:02:38.930> easier

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.690 

so<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.540> hardest<00:02:54.050> bit<00:02:54.260> was<00:02:54.320> all<00:02:54.890> yourself<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
so the hardest bit was all yourself the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.100 
so the hardest bit was all yourself the
bit<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.060> higher<00:02:56.270> because<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.780> don't<00:02:56.989> know

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
bit the higher because you don't know

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.710 
bit the higher because you don't know
what<00:02:57.260> you're<00:02:57.380> doing<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.670> then<00:02:58.850> once<00:02:59.090> up<00:02:59.300> when

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
what you're doing but then once up when
