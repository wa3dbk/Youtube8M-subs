00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119

thing<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> complain<00:01:33.810> about<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.560> that's<00:01:34.770> just

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
thing to complain about but that's just

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.800 
thing to complain about but that's just
my<00:01:35.100> opinion<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> don't<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
my opinion you know I don't think that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.690 
my opinion you know I don't think that
really<00:01:37.049> changes<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.829> what<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> they<00:01:38.640> think

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
really changes what what is they think

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.429 
really changes what what is they think
it's<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> copy<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.720> paste<00:01:39.900> from<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
it's just the copy and paste from that

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.429 
it's just the copy and paste from that
but<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.400> overall<00:01:42.299> still<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.810> flood<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> think

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
but I overall still like flood I think

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
but I overall still like flood I think
it's<00:01:43.590> really<00:01:43.829> unique<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.520> try<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> make

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's really unique that they try to make

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.210 
it's really unique that they try to make
you<00:01:45.149> play<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.630> flood<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:47.009> they

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you play as a flood and you know they

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.999 
you play as a flood and you know they
gave<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.579> exclusive<00:01:48.740> assassinations<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
gave you exclusive assassinations as the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
gave you exclusive assassinations as the
flood<00:01:50.189> too<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.450> downside<00:01:52.020> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
flood too but the one downside that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.960 
flood too but the one downside that
really<00:01:52.590> kind<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> bugs<00:01:53.040> me<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.490> can't<00:01:53.759> give

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
really kind of bugs me is you can't give

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.569 
really kind of bugs me is you can't give
blood<00:01:54.210> weapons<00:01:54.960> unless<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.070> use<00:01:56.280> mods

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
blood weapons unless if you use mods

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.730 
blood weapons unless if you use mods
then<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.180> give<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.390> weapons<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.290> other

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
then you can give them weapons but other

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.080 
then you can give them weapons but other
than<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.399> can't<00:01:59.670> give<00:01:59.790> them<00:01:59.909> weapons

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
than that you can't give them weapons

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.899 
than that you can't give them weapons
which<00:02:00.420> kind<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.719> sucks<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.130> think

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
which kind of sucks because I think

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.889 
which kind of sucks because I think
that's<00:02:03.180> something<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.570> lot<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.780> people

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
that's something that a lot of people

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.510 
that's something that a lot of people
like<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.469> makes<00:02:04.680> infection<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.340> more

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
like it makes infection a lot more

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.419 
like it makes infection a lot more
interesting<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:07.799> does<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
interesting you know it really does and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.010 
interesting you know it really does and
I<00:02:08.520> love<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:08.970> halo<00:02:09.360> 3<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.780> Halo<00:02:09.869> Reach

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
I love that about halo 3 and Halo Reach

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.410 
I love that about halo 3 and Halo Reach
but<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> same<00:02:11.190> time<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.910> still<00:02:12.239> an

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
but at the same time what is still an

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.730 
but at the same time what is still an
interesting<00:02:12.989> thing<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.200> they<00:02:13.440> brought

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
interesting thing that they brought

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.050 
interesting thing that they brought
to<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> table<00:02:14.280> i'm<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.760> say<00:02:14.910> it's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
to the table i'm not going to say it's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.900 
to the table i'm not going to say it's
terribly<00:02:15.480> bad<00:02:16.200> because<00:02:16.740> i<00:02:16.770> still<00:02:17.220> love<00:02:17.580> flood

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
terribly bad because i still love flood

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.030 
terribly bad because i still love flood
but<00:02:18.420> i<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.540> like<00:02:19.050> infection<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.680> bit<00:02:19.860> more

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
but i do like infection a bit more

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.860 
but i do like infection a bit more
because<00:02:20.220> again<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> has<00:02:20.940> those<00:02:21.150> fundamentals

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
because again it has those fundamentals

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.170 
because again it has those fundamentals
that<00:02:21.990> blood<00:02:22.380> doesn't<00:02:22.670> although<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.030> know

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
that blood doesn't although you know

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.490 
that blood doesn't although you know
flood<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:24.840> cool<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.230> could<00:02:25.350> play

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
flood was cool that you could play

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.200 
flood was cool that you could play
zombies<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.580> probably<00:02:26.850> pretty<00:02:27.000> good

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
zombies and it was probably pretty good

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.480 
zombies and it was probably pretty good
for<00:02:27.360> Machinima's<00:02:27.870> horror<00:02:28.410> machinimas<00:02:28.980> so

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
for Machinima's horror machinimas so

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.250 
for Machinima's horror machinimas so
again<00:02:30.000> they<00:02:30.210> both<00:02:30.420> have<00:02:30.600> their<00:02:30.630> ups<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.170> downs

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
again they both have their ups and downs

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.400 
again they both have their ups and downs
but<00:02:31.530> again<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:32.010> like<00:02:32.540> infection<00:02:33.540> more<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.990> lot<00:02:34.320> of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
but again I like infection more a lot of

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.170 
but again I like infection more a lot of
people<00:02:34.650> seem<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.040> infection<00:02:35.520> more<00:02:35.730> but

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
people seem to like infection more but

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.240 
people seem to like infection more but
what<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.600> still<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> great<00:02:37.200> game<00:02:37.440> type<00:02:37.710> I<00:02:37.890> still

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
what is still a great game type I still

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.430 
what is still a great game type I still
like<00:02:38.400> infection<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.390> mean<00:02:39.660> flood<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.320> I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
like infection and I mean flood and I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.230 
like infection and I mean flood and I
believe<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> lot<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.430> other<00:02:41.610> people<00:02:41.790> still<00:02:42.120> like

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
believe a lot of other people still like

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.390 
believe a lot of other people still like
blood<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.710> opinion<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.370> like

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
blood but this is my opinion I like

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.100 
blood but this is my opinion I like
infection<00:02:45.000> more<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.300> be<00:02:45.420> sure<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.750> tell<00:02:46.020> me
