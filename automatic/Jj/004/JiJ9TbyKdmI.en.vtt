00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
really what I wouldn't think is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.630 
really what I wouldn't think is
high-quality<00:00:39.210> headset<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.710> microphone<00:00:41.309> is

high-quality headset the microphone is
not<00:00:41.730> nearly<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:44.030> positional<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.570> would

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
not nearly as positional as you would

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.290 
not nearly as positional as you would
assume<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.640> it's<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.820> an<00:00:47.940> annoying

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
assume that it is it's got an annoying

click to it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.580

when you move the microphone and all at
all<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:54.270> really<00:00:54.600> don't<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.079> it's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
all I just really don't like it it's

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.340 
all I just really don't like it it's
made<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> cheap<00:00:55.980> plastic<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
made out of cheap plastic and it just it

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.939 
made out of cheap plastic and it just it
reads<00:00:59.300> the<00:01:00.300> xl1<00:01:00.930> does<00:01:01.199> include<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> color

green which is probably messing with our
chroma<00:01:04.229> key<00:01:04.409> however<00:01:05.070> I'm<00:01:05.909> trying<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> keep<00:01:06.630> it
