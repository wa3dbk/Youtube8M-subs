00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
another thing I should clarify is that

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.379 
another thing I should clarify is that
when<00:06:09.390> I<00:06:09.419> say<00:06:09.810> that<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:10.889> Japanese<00:06:11.370> comics<00:06:11.940> have

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
when I say that the Japanese comics have

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.530 
when I say that the Japanese comics have
more<00:06:12.600> value<00:06:12.780> than<00:06:12.990> the<00:06:13.169> English<00:06:13.380> translation

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
more value than the English translation

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.050 
more value than the English translation
it<00:06:15.540> doesn't<00:06:15.900> mean<00:06:16.050> that<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.590> English<00:06:17.400> comics

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
it doesn't mean that the English comics

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.880 
it doesn't mean that the English comics
are<00:06:18.510> going<00:06:18.780> to<00:06:18.840> have<00:06:18.960> zero<00:06:19.229> value<00:06:19.590> of<00:06:19.680> course

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
are going to have zero value of course

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.680 
are going to have zero value of course
they're<00:06:20.040> going<00:06:20.160> to<00:06:20.280> have<00:06:20.370> value<00:06:20.729> anything

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
they're going to have value anything

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.510 
they're going to have value anything
I'll<00:06:21.810> have<00:06:21.930> value<00:06:22.229> later<00:06:22.470> especially<00:06:22.800> if<00:06:23.190> you

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
I'll have value later especially if you

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.480 
I'll have value later especially if you
can<00:06:23.729> find<00:06:23.940> a<00:06:24.620> market<00:06:25.620> for<00:06:25.770> it<00:06:25.830> people<00:06:26.280> want<00:06:26.430> to

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490
