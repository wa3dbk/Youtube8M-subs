00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
the fastest thing to do to connect to a

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.710 
the fastest thing to do to connect to a
proxy<00:05:17.449> but<00:05:17.900> yeah<00:05:18.789> we<00:05:19.789> don't<00:05:20.000> need<00:05:20.240> everything

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
proxy but yeah we don't need everything

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.469 
proxy but yeah we don't need everything
of<00:05:20.840> course<00:05:20.870> you<00:05:21.680> can't<00:05:21.949> have<00:05:22.160> everything<00:05:22.479> it's

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
of course you can't have everything it's

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.620 
of course you can't have everything it's
not<00:05:23.570> that<00:05:23.960> slow<00:05:24.289> but<00:05:24.680> it's<00:05:25.580> not<00:05:25.850> super<00:05:26.030> fast<00:05:26.389> as

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
not that slow but it's not super fast as

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.450 
not that slow but it's not super fast as
you<00:05:26.720> can<00:05:26.900> see<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.169> loaded<00:05:27.530> they're<00:05:27.740> perfectly

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
you can see it loaded they're perfectly

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.890 
you can see it loaded they're perfectly
fine<00:05:28.729> and<00:05:29.740> so<00:05:30.740> get<00:05:31.220> started<00:05:31.490> as<00:05:32.389> you<00:05:32.479> can<00:05:32.630> see

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
fine and so get started as you can see

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.379 
fine and so get started as you can see
it's<00:05:33.110> will<00:05:33.440> say<00:05:33.710> magnetized<00:05:34.300> actually<00:05:35.300> it

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
it's will say magnetized actually it

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.760 
it's will say magnetized actually it
will<00:05:35.599> say<00:05:35.870> sign<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.889> right<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:39.169> will<00:05:39.380> tell<00:05:39.650> me
