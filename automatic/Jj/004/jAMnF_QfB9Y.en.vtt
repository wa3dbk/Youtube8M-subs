00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 Welcome to our 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.460
 unboxing of the agricultural simulator 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.240
 2009 15 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.199
 and we have the collector's here 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.230
 edition is very important for us 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.840
 here is a box that is about as of 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 Above one more looks like here 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.619
 side view and now we pack that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.810
 Just look what I do 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.550
 very stupid is this is this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.899
 vision can be easily torn away 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 that if I was a little stupid 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:43.010
 but well , here we come once 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.670
 content and that is what we have here 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.879
 tractor mother of the siku and that is the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.289
 the new holland I think he would have 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.059
 its exactly i am not so now 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.530
 tractor expert just that once that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.140
 then we have one more here 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.250
 keychains with 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.909
 Farming simulator she namely 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.799
 also very nice 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.000
 The me here then we have here 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.810
 after sticker of different 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.170
 Machine manufacturers in the game 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:24.830
 Among others I represent once 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:31.259
 man new holland is something of 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:34.909
 water lilies liu fly vÃ¤derstad liebherr 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.930
 and so on and so forth 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.110
 and then you come too 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.350
 next a farm in simulator modding 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.630
 tutorials there are tutorials how to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.509
 created his own tractor and in the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.840
 insert if I am correct 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.450
 have informed and then there is here 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 still a bonus note 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.140
 Agricultural simulator additional 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.640
 content gives here the lamborghini 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.310
 nitro 120 we can lamborghini can 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.550
 we go down 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.459
 and exactly fine and then 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.230
 we can here once to the cover of the game 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.900
 and the requirements are actually 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.250
 relatively low and that is what we have here 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.770
 Once on the back we need 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.880
 two gigahertz two gigabytes of ram and 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:33.020
 at least 512 mb memory which also on 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.970
 memory and three gigabytes more free 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.620
 Hard disk storage and in 15 minutes 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.989
 the game is already 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.100
 Of course, it also comes installed on the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.150
 calculator on it 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.810
 Let's go on there 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.239
 a dvd a cd in it just let the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.760
 I just put it in there 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.459
 then we have something else here too 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.970
 old fashioned one 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.760
 Farming simulator games 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.810
 there are instructions in the new players 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.080
 they are not anymore 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.450
 because everything is on pdf files 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.459
 written and from this I find 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.890
 that's pretty pretty that I'm here 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:15.900
 once again pack a guide and 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:18.170
 very sympathetic exactly the instructions and 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.390
 then there is still a simulator 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.640
 modding for dummies 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.620
 as is described among other things as 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.380
 you create your own tractor 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.170
 can insert games or stop 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.829
 can copy it into it so that it can 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.030
 pretty thick book as you can see here 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.570
 even very briefly a little bit here 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.570
 daily 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.890
 exactly and of course you can 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.810
 study if you want i want it 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.730
 not therefore I leave that one completely 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.870
 stay beautiful 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.610
 Well then we'll do another here 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.390
 Rough content from this collector's 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.170
 edition where here is a special 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.090
 sink and that one 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.129
 farm simulator posters that we 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.129
 now spread out here once 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.889
 it looks pretty good 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:24.210
 that's what the good piece looks like and then 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.729
 let's see what else on the 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.080
 back there is also something else 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:35.639
 and here once the map of the game 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.510
 and she's actually pretty tall 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.780
 Of course they will play as well 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.440
 that's no question 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:46.020
 because even times as a total surveying of 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.100
 the collector's edition and we are there 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.449
 is pretty much in it 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.700
 the whole table is practically occupied 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:56.100
 and the box has faith on Amazon 40 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.850
 euro cost if I'm still right 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.060
 in scene 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.710
 the normal version costs 30 of that 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.520
 I'm for the collector's 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.669
 edition decided and then thank you 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.349
 me for watching and until the 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.349
 next unboxing
