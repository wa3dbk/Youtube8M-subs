00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:14.230
 cardeñosa Rodriguez was born July 27 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.900
 October 1949 in the famous neighborhood of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.869
 the blonde in Valladolid is your countryman 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.820
 but he is adopted son of seville because 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.520
 is the player who has played the most minutes 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.380
 disputed with the betis shirt was 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.630
 a thin southpaw who played normally 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.300
 stuck to the band but whose quality with 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.250
 the years it took him to get more into the 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.960
 center and even play brain your 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.750
 story was tragic because nobody 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.630
 remember for his fine lefty remind him 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.030
 for his mistake a historical eye error 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.620
 alleged historical error has also 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.560
 there were others like the famous July 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.899
 salinas in rooms of 94 only in front of 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.360
 gianluca pagliuca the error of arconada 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.640
 in the eurocopa of '84 but certainly the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.040
 most famous mistake of all is that of 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.010
 Cardenous history tells us that 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.110
 loyal center santillana jump in one of 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.329
 its majestic jumps in suspension 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.820
 He left the dead ball at the feet of 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.799
 Cardenous with the beaten goalie only 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.289
 July Cardeñosa had to overcome a 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.240
 defense to an amaral field player and 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.840
 however he did what he did not have to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.520
 do 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.170
 the real fault of Cardenosa was not 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.090
 know how to use your right leg in a 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.729
 critical moment the goal would have 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.619
 allowed Spain beat Brazil and 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.420
 qualify for the second phase of the 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.520
 world finally Spain was 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.189
 eliminated and ranked brazil and 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.189
 austria very well once said all this 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.829
 I saw the goal of katalinski but let's think 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.079
 maybe a moment maybe I did not see it really 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.869
 what I saw was an adulterated image 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.350
 also it said that Real Madrid won 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.959
 Six European Cups between 1956 and 1966 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.810
 but Real Madrid may not have won them 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.579
 maybe all of that is also a product of the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.530
 imagination of some because the madrid 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.969
 he will have won only four European cups 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.939
 then the same as Barcelona for 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.890
 True, maybe those six have not existed 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.569
 first this is the part of the script in 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.789
 the one that the ghosts of 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.129
 gonzalo de mole a few minutes so that 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.229
 recover the sense of reality not 

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.030
 walking not no doubt do not doubt me you're not 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.620
 understanding perhaps the images that we have 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.989
 seen before the ruling of Cardeñosa are 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.930
 images intervened and adulterated by 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.760
 the Argentine dictatorship of 78 I saw the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.590
 katalinski's goal has had access in 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.019
 scoop 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.680
 what really happened that afternoon 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.130
 of June 7 , 1978 in Mar del Plata 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.560
 the loyal leads 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.210
 gets the ball into the long area up to 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.680
 the heads of santillana sentinel leaves 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.630
 door for dry hair 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.630
 mark it 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.630
 nervous 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.580
 what do you think there is that carpentry 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.590
 diago marco marco is a tribute this 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.450
 discovery to july charity of the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.280
 Spanish team in need of encouragement 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410
 after the failure of the last World Cup in 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.510
 Brazil, then Gonzalo, you tell me you've 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.550
 changed the story and those that we have 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.590
 lived wrong we have been the rest 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.410
 of humanity for the past 40 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.030
 40's not 36 but I'm not 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.880
 inventing nothing we have simply had 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.650
 access to a historical document that 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.430
 I was under 70 keys in drawers 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.430
 impenetrable 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.219
 I pay my respects until the next
