00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.250
 I greet you 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.160
 today we will talk with you about 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.900
 good frames we will not think about 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.779
 technique on how to open close 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.119
 diaphragm are those little things that would be 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.160
 must learn themselves either the camera 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 will do everything for you camera today become 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.279
 smarter than some photographers we are left 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.590
 reflect on the philosophy of photography about 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.180
 how to make her 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.020
 filled with plot how to make it 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.090
 burdened with meaning how to make her 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.260
 forcing those who ponder this 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.379
 the photo looks me 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.079
 the photo 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.809
 conditionally consists of three components 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.899
 good photo i will talk about 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.660
 these components are not in order of importance 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.300
 in the first place let's say light 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.820
 drawing pictures how it is volume 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.159
 After all, the frame on the computer screen or on 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.890
 paper is still a plane so 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.049
 light drawing is not in the sense of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.540
 beautifully highlighted you do not know there 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.320
 boat at sunset but in the sense that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.810
 flat objects with the light you have in 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.509
 frame gain volume using the game 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.479
 higher and lower contrast with 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.479
 backlight you create volume 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.409
 I do not know the model of the portrait that you 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.960
 take off so the light gives a picture 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.100
 volume of the photo, he certainly should 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.729
 be secondarily I will tell about the plot 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.979
 frames 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.310
 I even think that the plot can be safely 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.829
 put in first place because the plot 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.560
 even without the light still remain 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.360
 curious places and you grabbed him in 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.979
 the plot we usually have heroes and usually 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:03.149
 the storyline answers our question 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:07.539
 who is where and what usually does 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.560
 creating a story about a hero you fill 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.390
 frame plot you surround your hero 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.780
 secondary items and events 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.760
 which emphasize it and often 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.390
 minor items small items 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.920
 in the frame small objects in the frame 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.650
 underline the hero with the most powerful 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.730
 way they need to pay 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:38.799
 my attention and in third place I would 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:41.410
 an accident put that breeze he 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.120
 called the decisive moment that 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.959
 some are called divine 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.030
 intervention 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.519
 some great chance 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.760
 which interferes with your frame she can 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.090
 happen suddenly you don't expect it she 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.220
 can happen because you are long 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.269
 waited for it to happen and finally 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.900
 caught her but usually if you 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.480
 building a frame 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.450
 his mind can usually be 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.450
 hard all in and not interesting but if 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.750
 the frame intervenes a small accident 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.120
 a small event that adorns it 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.120
 then the photo is truly 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.780
 memorable and interesting of course 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.680
 that you can not take the camera in hand 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.780
 go outside to throw it off and start 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.080
 click in a row interesting photos where 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.480
 light creates volume where the plot is about the hero 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.360
 already built and where else is the divine 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.530
 Intervention right in your frame inserted 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.240
 some interesting detail and all you 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.790
 have to do and try 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.550
 consistently start with light because 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.470
 that the light here is probably the simplest 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.490
 don't know take a person take 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.260
 item take about some still life and 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.720
 try to understand how the light is exposed 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.760
 I for example to my herd understood it not 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.160
 so long ago and that principle when here I am 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.320
 I read it myself many times 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.290
 there is some kind of flood light 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.090
 backlight is drawing light is 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.080
 never exactly understood why not 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.840
 I need to explain in simple Russian 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.570
 photograph this plane if you are me in 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.580
 face lit up with light that's right from 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.540
 I get a camera face absolutely 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:36.320
 the fruit is lit but flat since the volume 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.290
 my cheekbones the volume of my head hair you 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.450
 see nothing of it if you are at it 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.100
 behind me highlight a spotlight at me 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.800
 such sacred appears on the head 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.530
 pasha stupid yes I explain now 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.730
 stupid words but this one illuminated 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.740
 the fluff creates another facet 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.380
 that is , the face was lit and suddenly 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.660
 another highlight appears 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.580
 creating a second like second plane 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.530
 which you see next 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.140
 put drawing light that shines 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.070
 such as me somewhere on the forehead or right here 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.620
 on the toe or hair well 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.020
 look at people who are professional 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.020
 put the light let's bright glare here 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.790
 creating here another plane and that 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.790
 we have classic lighting 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.520
 some kind of floodlight is obtained 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:28.669
 just a lighting object not like kontra 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.610
 warriors are creating another facet of this 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.770
 glowing and some flare on the face which 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.400
 create another plane 3 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:41.330
 the point we form a volumetric 3d 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.520
 images the plane is very rough but 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.550
 approximately in this direction you need to look 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.949
 and it always seemed to me like this 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.750
 Here is the color that I have just described this inheritance 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.210
 studio shooting when you put 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.599
 some kind of spotlight some kind of back 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.310
 shine 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.830
 she is a street you do not need anything 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.659
 like on the street you think the same 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.259
 categories only there it is more difficult to do 

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:05.780
 there you can have a sun back 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.659
 light and face illuminate from home 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.599
 which is light white on his face 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:14.180
 there is light that is a reflection of different 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.419
 items on the street create the same for you 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.360
 two or three sources of light decorating your 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.889
 frame therefore 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.590
 aiming to make your frame 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.909
 interesting we are 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.370
 divine effect will leave on 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:31.729
 then it will not come to his will 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.740
 wait for the plot component I think we 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.979
 you have already discussed this again 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:43.639
 let's talk about begin and I recommend you 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:47.270
 Start searching for lighting in the frame with 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:50.860
 understanding how sources work 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.729
 light and with natural light 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.099
 light sources in the studio are not 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.889
 take care and first it's boring 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:59.810
 came up with lazy people who want 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:01.759
 make a lot of money in order to 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.430
 they always stood alone in the studio 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:06.529
 same light and they shot ads in it before 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.349
 natural light is much more beautiful 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:12.680
 much more complicated much more interesting and 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:15.020
 texture and color and pattern and 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.909
 the number of items from which he can 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.940
 reflect so go outside 

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:21.940
 look for the light and do your tests
