in<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.890> end<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.190> should<00:03:34.220> get<00:03:34.460> something<00:03:34.670> that

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
in the end you should get something that

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.670 
in the end you should get something that
looks<00:03:35.120> like<00:03:35.180> this<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.780> remember<00:03:36.410> you<00:03:36.530> can
