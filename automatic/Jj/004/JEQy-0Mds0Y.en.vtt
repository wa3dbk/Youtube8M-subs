for 30 seconds and it recharges with

for 30 seconds and it recharges with
every<00:02:15.510> kill<00:02:15.750> now<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.950> managed<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.459> keep<00:02:17.549> that

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
every kill now I managed to keep that

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.220 
every kill now I managed to keep that
going<00:02:17.879> for<00:02:18.060> eight<00:02:18.180> minutes<00:02:18.540> straight<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.019> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
going for eight minutes straight and the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.559 
going for eight minutes straight and the
only<00:02:19.409> reason<00:02:19.560> why<00:02:20.099> it<00:02:20.579> dropped<00:02:20.730> off<00:02:21.000> was

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
only reason why it dropped off was

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.970 
only reason why it dropped off was
because<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:22.200> commander<00:02:22.590> got<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.769> little

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
because the commander got a little

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.880 
because the commander got a little
confused<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.060> zerg<00:02:24.299> went<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.930> little<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
confused and the zerg went a little it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.649 
confused and the zerg went a little it
kind<00:02:26.129> of<00:02:26.189> went<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.400> little<00:02:26.549> bit<00:02:26.700> wonky<00:02:26.939> so<00:02:27.390> we

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
kind of went a little bit wonky so we

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.910 
kind of went a little bit wonky so we
didn't<00:02:27.870> have<00:02:27.900> everybody<00:02:28.349> in<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> same<00:02:28.739> place

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
didn't have everybody in the same place

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.610 
didn't have everybody in the same place
which<00:02:29.430> means<00:02:29.730> sadly<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.870> wasn't<00:02:31.200> able<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.470> get<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
which means sadly I wasn't able to get a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.130 
which means sadly I wasn't able to get a
kill<00:02:31.890> killing<00:02:32.700> an<00:02:32.790> 80<00:02:33.000> veteran<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.659> my<00:02:33.780> own<00:02:33.959> is

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
kill killing an 80 veteran on my own is

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.160 
kill killing an 80 veteran on my own is
a<00:02:34.439> little<00:02:35.069> bit<00:02:35.250> more<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.519> ask<00:02:35.849> a<00:02:36.359> little<00:02:36.959> bit

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
a little bit more to ask a little bit

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.229 
a little bit more to ask a little bit
too<00:02:37.290> much<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.590> ask<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:38.159> my<00:02:38.760> poor<00:02:39.060> little

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
too much to ask for my poor little

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.199 
too much to ask for my poor little
guardian<00:02:39.659> so<00:02:40.349> there's<00:02:41.159> that<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.519> well<00:02:41.730> now<00:02:42.030> i'm

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
guardian so there's that as well now i'm

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.440 
guardian so there's that as well now i'm
also<00:02:42.420> using<00:02:42.569> halloween<00:02:43.319> buff<00:02:43.560> food<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.450> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
also using halloween buff food so the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.420 
also using halloween buff food so the
lowest<00:02:45.750> level<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.109> is<00:02:46.349> candied<00:02:46.739> apples<00:02:47.190> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
lowest level one is candied apples and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.280 
lowest level one is candied apples and
the<00:02:48.239> reason<00:02:48.450> i'm<00:02:48.510> using<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:48.989> because

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
the reason i'm using that is because

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.589 
the reason i'm using that is because
it's<00:02:49.530> fifteen<00:02:50.190> percent<00:02:50.670> extra<00:02:51.209> experience

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
it's fifteen percent extra experience

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.220 
it's fifteen percent extra experience
instead<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.799> usual<00:02:52.829> 10<00:02:53.489> now<00:02:54.450> what's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
instead of the usual 10 now what's

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.229 
instead of the usual 10 now what's
perfect<00:02:55.709> about<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:56.069> is<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.519> while<00:02:56.879> you<00:02:57.030> get

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
perfect about this is that while you get

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.629 
perfect about this is that while you get
a<00:02:57.450> lot<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.780> experience<00:02:58.349> from<00:02:58.439> the<00:02:58.590> mobs<00:02:58.799> the

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
a lot of experience from the mobs the

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.610 
a lot of experience from the mobs the
legendary<00:03:00.329> mobs<00:03:00.659> which<00:03:00.900> are<00:03:01.109> still<00:03:01.319> here<00:03:01.590> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
legendary mobs which are still here and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.710 
legendary mobs which are still here and
still<00:03:01.739> drop<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.280> champion<00:03:02.639> bags<00:03:02.849> still<00:03:03.510> drop

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
still drop the champion bags still drop

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.229 
still drop the champion bags still drop
exotic<00:03:04.379> champion<00:03:04.980> backs<00:03:05.189> so<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:06.150> example

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
exotic champion backs so for example

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.410 
exotic champion backs so for example
before<00:03:06.959> i<00:03:07.409> got<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:08.040> bag<00:03:08.370> which<00:03:08.609> had<00:03:08.819> an<00:03:09.030> onyx

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
before i got a bag which had an onyx

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.080 
before i got a bag which had an onyx
lodestone<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.079> it<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:11.040> you're<00:03:11.579> actually<00:03:11.700> not

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
lodestone in it so you're actually not

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.390 
lodestone in it so you're actually not
missing<00:03:12.450> out<00:03:12.540> too<00:03:12.780> much<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.200> loom<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
missing out too much on the loom the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.640 
missing out too much on the loom the
only<00:03:14.609> downside<00:03:14.879> in<00:03:15.510> fact<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.049> any<00:03:16.440> loot

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
only downside in fact is that any loot

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.800 
only downside in fact is that any loot
that<00:03:16.769> drops<00:03:17.069> from<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.459> regular<00:03:18.060> veterans<00:03:18.690> on

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
that drops from the regular veterans on

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.869 
that drops from the regular veterans on
mobs<00:03:19.049> is<00:03:19.530> going<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:19.919> be<00:03:19.980> downscaled<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.760> your

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
mobs is going to be downscaled to your

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.780 
mobs is going to be downscaled to your
level<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:22.109> will<00:03:22.230> drop<00:03:22.410> bags<00:03:22.799> appropriate

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
level so it will drop bags appropriate

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.020 
level so it will drop bags appropriate
for<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.480> tier<00:03:25.079> material<00:03:25.829> of<00:03:26.010> your<00:03:26.280> level<00:03:26.639> so

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
for the tier material of your level so

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.159 
for the tier material of your level so

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
which are pretty decent at farming or at

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.600 
which are pretty decent at farming or at
least<00:04:45.750> produce<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:46.500> getting<00:04:46.740> hits<00:04:46.950> on<00:04:47.160> mobs

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610

for<00:04:48.000> farming<00:04:48.330> in<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:49.230> basically<00:04:50.040> you've<00:04:50.220> got

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
for farming in that basically you've got

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.940 
for farming in that basically you've got
a<00:04:50.430> nice<00:04:50.640> bit<00:04:50.880> of<00:04:50.910> AOE<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:52.170> can<00:04:52.320> actually<00:04:52.560> get<00:04:52.890> a

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
a nice bit of AOE you can actually get a

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.280 
a nice bit of AOE you can actually get a
lot<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.280> levels<00:04:53.580> very<00:04:54.150> very<00:04:54.450> quickly<00:04:54.780> using

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
lot of levels very very quickly using

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.960 
lot of levels very very quickly using
the<00:04:55.500> crown<00:04:55.710> pavilion<00:04:56.130> but<00:04:56.370> remember<00:04:56.700> this<00:04:56.820> is

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
the crown pavilion but remember this is

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.570 
the crown pavilion but remember this is
not<00:04:57.000> going<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.420> be<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.570> bit<00:04:57.780> available<00:04:58.350> forever

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
not going to be a bit available forever

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.910 
not going to be a bit available forever
it<00:04:59.580> might<00:04:59.970> actually<00:05:00.210> pass<00:05:00.600> in<00:05:00.900> two<00:05:01.200> weeks<00:05:01.410> but

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
it might actually pass in two weeks but

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.920 
it might actually pass in two weeks but
probably<00:05:02.400> not<00:05:02.610> I'd<00:05:02.850> hope<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.510> it<00:05:03.600> doesn't

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
probably not I'd hope that it doesn't

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.240 
probably not I'd hope that it doesn't
pass<00:05:04.080> in<00:05:04.260> two<00:05:04.410> weeks<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.770> that's<00:05:04.830> here<00:05:05.100> for

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
pass in two weeks and that's here for

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.130 
pass in two weeks and that's here for
the<00:05:05.340> full<00:05:05.490> month<00:05:05.760> of<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.420> living<00:05:06.810> story

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
the full month of the living story

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.510 
the full month of the living story
section<00:05:07.560> so<00:05:09.230> basically<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.920> time<00:05:11.130> limit<00:05:11.400> is

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
section so basically the time limit is

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.370 
section so basically the time limit is
going<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:11.850> be<00:05:12.000> either<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.720> month<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:13.170> the

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
going to be either the month of the

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.400 
going to be either the month of the
living<00:05:13.620> story<00:05:13.890> or<00:05:14.780> two<00:05:15.780> weeks<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.290> which

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
living story or two weeks in which

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.320 
living story or two weeks in which
they'll<00:05:16.650> change<00:05:16.890> something<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.370> maybe<00:05:17.550> maybe

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
they'll change something and maybe maybe

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.600 
they'll change something and maybe maybe
it<00:05:18.810> will<00:05:18.960> become<00:05:19.080> inaccessible<00:05:19.560> for<00:05:20.250> whatever

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
it will become inaccessible for whatever

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.850 
it will become inaccessible for whatever
reason<00:05:21.000> but<00:05:21.420> just<00:05:22.170> want<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.470> share<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:22.710> with

reason but just want to share that with

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.500 
reason but just want to share that with
you<00:05:23.070> in<00:05:23.220> case<00:05:23.340> you<00:05:23.430> got<00:05:23.580> any<00:05:23.790> old<00:05:23.970> that<00:05:24.360> you

feel felt just just might need that

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.290 
feel felt just just might need that
extra<00:05:28.620> little<00:05:28.830> push<00:05:28.980> now<00:05:29.700> I'll<00:05:29.940> probably<00:05:30.120> get

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
extra little push now I'll probably get

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.150 
extra little push now I'll probably get
my<00:05:30.450> guardian<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:30.930> 80<00:05:31.110> tonight<00:05:31.530> doing<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:31.920> is

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
my guardian to 80 tonight doing this is

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.110 
my guardian to 80 tonight doing this is
it<00:05:32.400> boring<00:05:32.670> yes<00:05:33.450> it<00:05:33.630> is<00:05:33.660> but<00:05:34.110> is<00:05:34.320> it<00:05:34.470> efficient

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
it boring yes it is but is it efficient

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.250 
it boring yes it is but is it efficient
definitely<00:05:36.120> this<00:05:36.420> is<00:05:36.540> probably<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.900> most

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
definitely this is probably the most

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.990 
definitely this is probably the most
efficient<00:05:37.800> way<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:37.920> level<00:05:38.310> outside<00:05:38.610> of

efficient way to level outside of

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.390 
efficient way to level outside of

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
crafting so you can't really complain

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.170
