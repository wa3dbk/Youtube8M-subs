00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
actually not that bad the second time I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.480 
actually not that bad the second time I
guess<00:01:50.880> that's<00:01:51.090> probably<00:01:51.299> why<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.649> started

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
guess that's probably why I I started

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.450

cooking<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> first<00:01:55.020> place<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.430> I

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
cooking in the first place the more I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
cooking in the first place the more I
can<00:01:56.549> control<00:01:57.030> what<00:01:57.360> goes<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.320> better<00:01:58.530> it
