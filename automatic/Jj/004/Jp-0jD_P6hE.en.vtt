00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
to you when to use the dome and how to

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.240 
to you when to use the dome and how to
use<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.650> okay<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:12.059> your<00:00:12.920> this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.070> when<00:00:14.219> I

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
use it okay so on your this is when I

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.860 
use it okay so on your this is when I
print<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:14.730> from<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> PDF<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.690> your

print it out from the PDF but on your

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.200 
print it out from the PDF but on your
instruction<00:00:16.410> card<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:17.640> comes<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:18.060> your

the<00:00:22.650> pocket<00:00:23.010> guides<00:00:23.189> you'll<00:00:23.850> see<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.050> have

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the pocket guides you'll see that I have

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.250 
the pocket guides you'll see that I have
Hanyu<00:00:25.920> here<00:00:26.160> when<00:00:26.849> not<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.300> use<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.630> dome<00:00:27.840> when

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
Hanyu here when not to use the dome when

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.140 
Hanyu here when not to use the dome when
to<00:00:28.470> use<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.800> dome<00:00:28.980> when<00:00:29.340> use<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> amber<00:00:29.970> dome

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to use the dome when use the amber dome

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.030 
to use the dome when use the amber dome
things<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.349> let's<00:00:31.619> start<00:00:31.859> with

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
things like that so let's start with

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.490 
things like that so let's start with
when<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.790> use<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> dome<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.989> not<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.380> use

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
when not to use the dome when not to use

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.250 
when not to use the dome when not to use
the<00:00:34.649> dome<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.100> pretty<00:00:35.460> much<00:00:35.610> anytime<00:00:36.239> indoors

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the dome is pretty much anytime indoors

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.530 
the dome is pretty much anytime indoors
the<00:00:37.680> reason<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> because<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.850> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.300> use

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the reason is is because I want to use

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.020 
the reason is is because I want to use
the<00:00:39.989> ceiling<00:00:40.739> as<00:00:40.860> much<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.520> as<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> fill

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the ceiling as much as I can as a fill

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.540 
the ceiling as much as I can as a fill
light<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.660> you've<00:00:42.960> got<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.410> tuxedo<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
light if you've got a tuxedo like a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.430 
light if you've got a tuxedo like a
black<00:00:44.820> tuxedo<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.539> people<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:45.930> dark<00:00:46.200> hair

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
black tuxedo of people with dark hair

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.729 
black tuxedo of people with dark hair
you<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.399> huge<00:00:47.879> huge<00:00:48.410> ceiling<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.590> be

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you want that huge huge ceiling to be

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.709 
you want that huge huge ceiling to be
your<00:00:49.980> fill<00:00:50.280> light<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:51.239> only<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.449> but

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
your fill light and not only that but

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.889 
your fill light and not only that but
makes<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> room<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.590> brighter<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
makes the room a lot brighter so

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.090 
makes the room a lot brighter so
typically<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.110> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> dome<00:00:55.829> off

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
typically we want to have the dome off

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.680 
typically we want to have the dome off
and<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.550> gives<00:00:56.760> us<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> softest<00:00:57.480> possible

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
and that gives us the softest possible

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.430 
and that gives us the softest possible
lighting<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:59.070> start<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.730> some<00:01:00.570> shadows

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
lighting if we start to see some shadows

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.930 
lighting if we start to see some shadows
in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> eyes<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.460> looks<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
in the eyes like it looks like the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
in the eyes like it looks like the
lights<00:01:03.270> too<00:01:03.539> directly<00:01:03.960> above<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.260> means

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
lights too directly above that means

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.530 
lights too directly above that means
we've<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:05.070> too<00:01:05.280> much<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.670> ratio<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.299> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
we've got too much of a ratio going to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
we've got too much of a ratio going to
the<00:01:06.659> ceiling<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.799> therefore<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.400> put<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> dome

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the ceiling so therefore we put the dome

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.080 
the ceiling so therefore we put the dome
on<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.320> put<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> dome<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.850> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
on and we put the dome on just like this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.450 
on and we put the dome on just like this
most<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> time<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.710> want<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> dome<00:01:14.189> off

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
most of the time we want the dome off

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700 
most of the time we want the dome off
why<00:01:14.790> simply<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.930> makes<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> larger

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
why simply because it makes for a larger

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.390 
why simply because it makes for a larger
diffuser<00:01:17.119> if<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.360> put<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.689> inside<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.290> course<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
diffuser if I put it inside of course it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.460 
diffuser if I put it inside of course it
doesn't<00:01:20.640> make<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.090> quite<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:21.780> large<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
doesn't make it quite as large of a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
doesn't make it quite as large of a
diffuser<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.759> don't<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> benefit

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
diffuser because I don't get the benefit

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.490 
diffuser because I don't get the benefit
of<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> action<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.350> extra<00:01:25.950> height<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:27.500> this

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
of that action that extra height so this

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
of that action that extra height so this
goes<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.979> when<00:01:29.520> there<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> low<00:01:30.329> bright

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
goes on when there is a low bright

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.469 
goes on when there is a low bright
ceiling<00:01:31.640> typically<00:01:32.640> you'll<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.060> too

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
ceiling typically you'll have just too

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.600 
ceiling typically you'll have just too
much<00:01:33.659> light<00:01:33.960> coming<00:01:34.619> down<00:01:34.650> from<00:01:34.950> above<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
much light coming down from above so

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.630 
much light coming down from above so
that's<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.090> goes<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:37.439> also<00:01:37.740> used

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that's when that goes on it's also used

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.760 
that's when that goes on it's also used
outdoors<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.290> want<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.590> give<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
outdoors when you just want to give a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.410 
outdoors when you just want to give a
little<00:01:41.040> bit<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> fill<00:01:41.579> light<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.270> you're

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
little bit of fill light and if you're

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.789 
little bit of fill light and if you're
in<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> bright<00:01:42.780> Sun<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.170> don't<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.560> enough

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
in the bright Sun you don't have enough

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.270 
in the bright Sun you don't have enough
power<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.850> you'll<00:01:45.329> go<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.649> shoot

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
power then you'll go like this and shoot

wonderful<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> why<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.610> ever

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
wonderful for that why would you ever

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.920 
wonderful for that why would you ever
put<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> dome<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.399> inside<00:01:59.659> well<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
put the dome on the inside well in a

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
put the dome on the inside well in a
case<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.290> where<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> don't<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> lens

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
case like this where I don't have a lens

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.780 
case like this where I don't have a lens
shade<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.149> might<00:02:04.020> throw<00:02:04.439> some<00:02:04.560> flare<00:02:05.159> onto<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
shade I might throw some flare onto the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.280 
shade I might throw some flare onto the
lens<00:02:05.969> because<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.509> proximity<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
lens because of the proximity to the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.729 
lens because of the proximity to the
lens<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.280> I'll<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.670> take<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.000> guy<00:02:09.239> and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
lens so I'll just take this guy and

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.470 
lens so I'll just take this guy and
simply<00:02:10.739> turn<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.039> around<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.489> then<00:02:12.030> I'll<00:02:12.270> have

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
simply turn it around and then I'll have

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
simply turn it around and then I'll have
it<00:02:12.660> away<00:02:12.959> from<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it away from the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.550 
it away from the
lenz<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.970> i<00:02:15.000> won't<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:15.510> much<00:02:15.660> flair<00:02:15.990> but

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
lenz now i won't have as much flair but

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.090 
lenz now i won't have as much flair but
it<00:02:17.490> won't<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.880> as<00:02:18.090> soft<00:02:18.690> because<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.620> light<00:02:19.830> is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
it won't be as soft because the light is

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.900 
it won't be as soft because the light is
closer<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.660> light<00:02:21.870> source<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.380> therefore

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
closer to the light source and therefore

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.370 
closer to the light source and therefore
there<00:02:23.910> will<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.600> little<00:02:24.780> bit<00:02:24.990> of<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.200> hot

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
there will be just a little bit of a hot

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.840 
there will be just a little bit of a hot
spot<00:02:25.680> right<00:02:25.710> there<00:02:25.890> in<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> center<00:02:26.400> which<00:02:26.670> she

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
spot right there in the center which she

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.540 
spot right there in the center which she
would<00:02:27.030> avoid<00:02:27.420> if<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:28.230> are<00:02:28.500> turned<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.340> all<00:02:29.460> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
would avoid if you are turned it all the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.570 
would avoid if you are turned it all the
way<00:02:29.640> around<00:02:29.760> okay<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.350> short<00:02:31.620> always<00:02:32.430> the

way around okay so in short always the
