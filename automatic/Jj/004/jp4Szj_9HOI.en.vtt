first<00:00:09.680> you<00:00:09.800> want<00:00:09.920> to<00:00:10.010> begin<00:00:10.220> by<00:00:10.460> outlining

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
first you want to begin by outlining

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.270 
first you want to begin by outlining
your<00:00:11.030> mask<00:00:11.360> I<00:00:11.690> started<00:00:12.470> with<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:12.740> eye<00:00:12.770> sockets

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
your mask I started with the eye sockets

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.950 
your mask I started with the eye sockets
and<00:00:13.400> I<00:00:13.520> used<00:00:13.760> a<00:00:13.880> white<00:00:14.030> paint<00:00:14.300> on<00:00:14.450> a<00:00:14.510> fairly

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
and I used a white paint on a fairly

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.779 
and I used a white paint on a fairly
thin<00:00:15.170> brush<00:00:15.440> now<00:00:16.010> the<00:00:16.070> shape<00:00:16.309> needs<00:00:16.550> to<00:00:16.699> be

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
thin brush now the shape needs to be

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.000 
thin brush now the shape needs to be
quite<00:00:17.029> triangular<00:00:17.750> you<00:00:18.109> need<00:00:18.260> it<00:00:18.380> wider<00:00:18.680> on

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
quite triangular you need it wider on

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.620 
quite triangular you need it wider on
the<00:00:19.130> outside<00:00:19.520> edges<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:20.090> getting<00:00:20.300> narrower

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
the outside edges and getting narrower

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.630 
the outside edges and getting narrower
towards<00:00:21.110> the<00:00:21.230> inner<00:00:21.500> eye<00:00:21.530> and<00:00:22.160> I<00:00:22.220> didn't<00:00:22.490> take

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
towards the inner eye and I didn't take

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.300 
towards the inner eye and I didn't take
it<00:00:22.670> up<00:00:22.910> above<00:00:23.150> my<00:00:23.330> eyebrows<00:00:23.750> I<00:00:24.250> outlined<00:00:25.250> the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
it up above my eyebrows I outlined the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.710 
it up above my eyebrows I outlined the
rest<00:00:25.490> of<00:00:25.610> my<00:00:25.699> mask<00:00:25.940> following<00:00:26.390> the<00:00:26.510> same

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
rest of my mask following the same

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.510 
rest of my mask following the same
triangular<00:00:27.350> shape<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:27.710> I<00:00:27.860> try<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:28.220> make<00:00:28.490> sure

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
triangular shape and I try to make sure

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.070 
triangular shape and I try to make sure
that<00:00:28.730> it<00:00:28.970> was<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.090> same<00:00:29.359> thickness<00:00:29.660> all<00:00:30.020> the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
that it was the same thickness all the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.229 
that it was the same thickness all the
way<00:00:30.230> around<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:30.770> decided<00:00:31.490> to<00:00:31.699> keep<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.090> shape

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
way around I decided to keep the shape

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.119 
way around I decided to keep the shape
of<00:00:32.359> my<00:00:32.509> mask<00:00:32.780> just<00:00:33.140> around<00:00:33.379> my<00:00:33.530> eyes<00:00:33.710> but<00:00:34.010> you

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
of my mask just around my eyes but you

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.709 
of my mask just around my eyes but you
could<00:00:34.309> always<00:00:34.489> round<00:00:34.909> out<00:00:35.059> the<00:00:35.179> forehead<00:00:35.539> like

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
could always round out the forehead like

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.479 
could always round out the forehead like
a<00:00:35.749> real<00:00:35.989> skull<00:00:36.319> if<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:36.739> wanted<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.100> cover<00:00:37.249> more

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
a real skull if you wanted to cover more

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.090 
a real skull if you wanted to cover more
of<00:00:37.550> your<00:00:37.729> face<00:00:38.109> next<00:00:39.109> I<00:00:39.229> swapped<00:00:39.559> to<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.739> larger

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
of your face next I swapped to a larger

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.739 
of your face next I swapped to a larger
brush<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.519> I<00:00:40.579> filled<00:00:40.850> in<00:00:40.999> the<00:00:41.149> entire<00:00:41.449> shape

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:41.749 
brush and I filled in the entire shape

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:43.599 
brush and I filled in the entire shape
with<00:00:41.989> a<00:00:42.019> white<00:00:42.319> paint<00:00:42.620> now<00:00:43.129> you<00:00:43.190> need<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.460> make

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
with a white paint now you need to make

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.729 
with a white paint now you need to make
sure<00:00:43.789> that<00:00:43.909> you<00:00:44.030> mix<00:00:44.300> this<00:00:44.600> color<00:00:44.659> quite<00:00:45.350> thick

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
sure that you mix this color quite thick

00:00:45.739 --> 00:01:03.380 
sure that you mix this color quite thick
so<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:46.280> it's<00:00:46.429> not<00:00:46.579> too<00:00:46.639> wishy-washy

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.840 

to<00:01:04.199> add<00:01:04.320> some<00:01:04.500> shading<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.040> took<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> dark<00:01:05.610> gray

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
to add some shading I took a dark gray

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.550 
to add some shading I took a dark gray
and<00:01:06.150> i<00:01:06.210> roughly<00:01:06.570> blended<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.050> into<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> white

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and i roughly blended it into the white

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.830 
and i roughly blended it into the white
now<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.030> overly<00:01:09.390> neat<00:01:09.690> as

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
now you don't have to be overly neat as

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.450 
now you don't have to be overly neat as
rough<00:01:10.140> jagged<00:01:10.350> lines<00:01:10.710> will<00:01:10.950> give<00:01:11.070> your<00:01:11.220> skull

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
rough jagged lines will give your skull

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.230 
rough jagged lines will give your skull
some<00:01:11.640> texture

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
some texture

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.219 
some texture
I<00:01:14.030> focus<00:01:15.030> most<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.510> shading<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I focus most of the shading around the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.840 
I focus most of the shading around the
eyes<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.710> around<00:01:16.800> the<00:01:17.040> outside<00:01:17.070> edges<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
eyes and around the outside edges of the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.400 
eyes and around the outside edges of the
mouth<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.869> need<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> add<00:01:19.290> it

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
mouth but you just need to add it

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:30.500 
mouth but you just need to add it
anywhere<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.009> want<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.340> look<00:01:20.490> sunken<00:01:20.970> in

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.640 

to<00:01:31.510> try<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:31.810> make<00:01:31.900> it<00:01:32.080> look<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.260> bit<00:01:32.530> more

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
to try and make it look a bit more

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.240 
to try and make it look a bit more
realistic

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
realistic

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.160 
realistic
I<00:01:33.370> painted<00:01:33.760> small<00:01:34.120> gray<00:01:34.330> dents<00:01:34.600> just<00:01:34.960> above

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
I painted small gray dents just above

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.990 
I painted small gray dents just above
where<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.530> teeth<00:01:35.710> would<00:01:35.860> be<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.280> then<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:36.729> also

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
where the teeth would be and then I also

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.969 
where the teeth would be and then I also
added<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.540> really<00:01:37.750> angry<00:01:37.930> frown<00:01:38.470> between<00:01:38.860> my

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
added a really angry frown between my

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:56.270 
added a really angry frown between my
eyebrows

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.560 

next<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.369> swap<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:57.789> black<00:01:57.969> paint<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.479> a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
next I swap to a black paint and a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.940 
next I swap to a black paint and a
thinner<00:01:58.750> brush<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.259> I<00:01:59.320> went<00:01:59.500> over<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.799> gray

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
thinner brush and I went over the gray

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:31.670 
thinner brush and I went over the gray
areas<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.490> give<00:02:00.610> them<00:02:00.759> a<00:02:00.820> bit<00:02:00.969> more<00:02:01.090> depth<00:02:01.360> I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.780 

completely<00:02:32.680> covered<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.040> whole<00:02:33.250> eye<00:02:33.280> socket

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
completely covered the whole eye socket

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.100 
completely covered the whole eye socket
with<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> black<00:02:34.150> paint<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.630> then<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.870> carefully

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
with a black paint and then I carefully

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.569 
with a black paint and then I carefully
went<00:02:35.500> around<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.829> edges<00:02:36.099> just<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.400> neaten

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
went around the edges just to neaten

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.910 
went around the edges just to neaten
things<00:02:36.940> up<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.780> could<00:02:37.959> also<00:02:38.140> add<00:02:38.500> black

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
things up and you could also add black

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.440 
things up and you could also add black
eyeliner<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.549> waterline<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.239> wanted

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
eyeliner to the waterline if you wanted

00:02:40.450 --> 00:03:00.580 
eyeliner to the waterline if you wanted
to<00:02:40.569> make<00:02:40.690> your<00:02:40.840> eyes<00:02:40.959> look<00:02:40.989> really<00:02:41.410> dark

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.050 

for<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.680> scroll<00:03:01.890> knows<00:03:02.159> all<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> did<00:03:02.670> was<00:03:02.819> paint

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
for the scroll knows all I did was paint

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.940 
for the scroll knows all I did was paint
a<00:03:03.209> black<00:03:03.420> triangle<00:03:03.689> on<00:03:04.079> either<00:03:04.200> side<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.829> then

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
a black triangle on either side and then

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:21.290 
a black triangle on either side and then
just<00:03:05.010> fill<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.489> in

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.020 

and<00:03:21.410> then<00:03:22.410> very<00:03:22.740> carefully<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.250> outlined<00:03:23.850> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
and then very carefully I outlined the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.060 
and then very carefully I outlined the
entire<00:03:24.420> mask<00:03:24.750> now<00:03:25.290> it's<00:03:25.470> much<00:03:25.620> easier<00:03:26.040> to

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
entire mask now it's much easier to

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.860 
entire mask now it's much easier to
paint<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.550> outline<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:27.030> one<00:03:27.240> quick<00:03:27.510> movement

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
paint the outline in one quick movement

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.630 
paint the outline in one quick movement
rather<00:03:28.380> than<00:03:28.680> lots<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.010> little<00:03:29.250> strokes

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
rather than lots of little strokes

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.580 
rather than lots of little strokes
because<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.240> can<00:03:30.390> always<00:03:30.540> go<00:03:30.810> back<00:03:30.840> over<00:03:31.440> with

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
because you can always go back over with

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.230 
because you can always go back over with
a<00:03:31.650> thicker<00:03:31.950> line<00:03:32.190> if<00:03:32.430> your<00:03:32.580> edges<00:03:32.880> are<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.030> bit

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
a thicker line if your edges are a bit

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.780 
a thicker line if your edges are a bit
uneven<00:03:36.650> for<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.740> teeth<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.190> painted<00:03:38.580> one

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
uneven for the teeth I painted one

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.490 
uneven for the teeth I painted one
central<00:03:39.240> line<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.690> then<00:03:39.960> i<00:03:39.990> roughly

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
central line and then i roughly

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.440 
central line and then i roughly
positioned<00:03:41.040> each<00:03:41.310> tooth<00:03:41.790> going<00:03:42.090> along<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
positioned each tooth going along the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.320 
positioned each tooth going along the
mouth<00:03:42.630> now<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.590> further<00:03:43.920> along<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.460> go<00:03:44.730> you

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
mouth now the further along you go you

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.820 
mouth now the further along you go you
want<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.720> look<00:03:45.870> like<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.380> tooth<00:03:46.590> is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
want it to look like the tooth is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.070 
want it to look like the tooth is
sitting<00:03:47.340> behind<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.270> front<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.870> if

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
sitting behind the one in front of it if

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.880 
sitting behind the one in front of it if
that<00:03:49.470> makes<00:03:49.650> sense<00:03:51.290> once<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.470> had<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.710> shape

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
that makes sense once I had the shape

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.110 
that makes sense once I had the shape
that<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.070> wanted<00:03:53.460> I<00:03:53.580> then<00:03:53.730> went<00:03:53.850> back<00:03:54.090> over

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
that I wanted I then went back over

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.880 
that I wanted I then went back over
everything<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.990> made<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.290> outlines<00:03:55.590> much

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
everything and made the outlines much

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:21.760 
everything and made the outlines much
thicker

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.200 

next<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:22.860> rinsed<00:04:23.250> off<00:04:23.370> all<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.669> paint<00:04:23.880> from<00:04:24.030> my

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
next I rinsed off all the paint from my

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.180 
next I rinsed off all the paint from my
brush<00:04:24.449> and<00:04:24.660> then<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.930> just<00:04:25.199> used<00:04:25.470> water<00:04:25.770> to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
brush and then I just used water to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.250 
brush and then I just used water to
blend<00:04:26.699> the<00:04:26.880> inside<00:04:27.270> edge<00:04:27.449> of<00:04:27.479> each<00:04:27.720> tooth<00:04:28.050> and

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
blend the inside edge of each tooth and

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.810 
blend the inside edge of each tooth and
it<00:04:28.380> gave<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.680> bit<00:04:28.860> more<00:04:28.979> shape<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.580> stopped

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
it gave it a bit more shape and stopped

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:40.920 
it gave it a bit more shape and stopped
it<00:04:30.000> from<00:04:30.180> looking<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.630> flat

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.080 

I<00:04:43.830> painted<00:04:44.830> really<00:04:45.100> thin<00:04:45.340> strokes<00:04:45.669> all<00:04:45.910> the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
I painted really thin strokes all the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.460 
I painted really thin strokes all the
way<00:04:46.180> along<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.509> gum<00:04:46.660> line<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:47.050> try<00:04:47.199> and<00:04:47.289> make

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
way along the gum line to try and make

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.659 
way along the gum line to try and make
it<00:04:47.650> look<00:04:47.800> as<00:04:48.009> though<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> teeth<00:04:48.490> were

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
it look as though the teeth were

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:57.690 
it look as though the teeth were
sticking<00:04:49.030> out<00:04:49.150> of<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.360> bone

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.360 

and<00:04:58.990> then<00:04:59.990> with<00:05:00.200> some<00:05:00.410> white<00:05:00.590> pain<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:01.070> added<00:05:01.310> a

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
and then with some white pain I added a

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.100 
and then with some white pain I added a
few<00:05:01.400> highlights<00:05:02.060> around<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.510> design<00:05:02.840> and

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
few highlights around the design and

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.780 
few highlights around the design and
that's<00:05:03.260> it

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.360 

all<00:05:10.780> that's<00:05:11.020> left<00:05:11.140> to<00:05:11.320> do<00:05:11.470> now<00:05:11.500> is<00:05:11.680> put<00:05:12.100> on<00:05:12.190> your

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
all that's left to do now is put on your

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.760 
all that's left to do now is put on your
costume<00:05:12.820> and<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.180> decided<00:05:13.540> to<00:05:13.750> be<00:05:13.840> a<00:05:13.870> fancy

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
costume and I decided to be a fancy

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.590 
costume and I decided to be a fancy
formal<00:05:15.280> skull<00:05:15.550> with<00:05:15.730> a<00:05:15.760> bowtie<00:05:16.150> for<00:05:16.480> some

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
formal skull with a bowtie for some

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.540 
formal skull with a bowtie for some
reason<00:05:16.900> but<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:17.830> could<00:05:18.010> just<00:05:18.160> add<00:05:18.280> a<00:05:18.310> black

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
reason but you could just add a black

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.430 
reason but you could just add a black
cape<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:19.000> a<00:05:19.060> hood<00:05:19.210> and<00:05:19.450> you're<00:05:19.810> all<00:05:19.990> set
