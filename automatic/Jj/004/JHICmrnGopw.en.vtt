 This place that everyone talks about but I 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.970
 I want to get more drawings there for me. 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.850
 I there because otherwise he gets very 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.640
 complex must be drawn and if there 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.160
 we must have this vision of the future to 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.990
 that the coach can help I have today 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.480
 I should make a type declaration 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.760
 write what I want a mission for 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.520
 example is important in the important 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.860
 commission all that is written to pnl already 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.680
 proved that everything that is written 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.860
 our subconscious understands that it is 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.060
 important and when I set goals 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.030
 deadlines dates 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.260
 anyway this has a possibility of 98% 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.690
 to be realized 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.980
 so writing is very important what it is 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.050
 Your mission is to be an excellent parent with 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.180

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.640
 businessman what is your mission to help 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.690
 needy people need to 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.060
 needy 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.910
 all this is important reference in the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.340
 hotel feedback with very good plans 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.050
 Mario feedback actually happens 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.350
 during all sessions 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.150
 This is also fantastic in the process. 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.230
 because without feedback there is no 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.590
 coaching 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.320
 I advise you help you extend this 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.030
 vision of the future and I know you feedback eu 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.700
 Do not you two answers I'll give you 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.709
 feedback is different then at the end 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.260
 of the whole process is known a 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.230
 feedback from everything you've been through 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.019
 you came and how you are now 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.600
 brand thinks of this phrase who is in a hurry 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.660
 walk slowly 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.390
 and in a hurry, walk slowly is a little 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.100
 subjective that phrase because it has many 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.960
 people who actually have a 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.400
 need to hurry and not know 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.340
 where are they going 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.710
 you hurry that my god or 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.020
 Why are you in such a hurry and a 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.500
 walking slowly is sometimes necessary 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.770
 because I need to analyze I need 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.200
 to evaluate 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.050
 I need to re-design many times 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.930
 things so I think that's what the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.050
 way to re-evaluate planning 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.400
 It's important always planning and I say 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.090
 which is important for our lives 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.630
 staff for our professional life 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.180
 is if we take an example it has like 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.030
 go on vacation if you stay ten or 15 days 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.190
 without planning and possible 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.710
 because I need to have a planning 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.420
 financially I need to see who will be 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.240
 with me who composes 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.890
 in this context then the languages ​​things 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.350
 we need to plan for 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.850
 wake up in the morning and is currently on the 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.860
 My job, I need one. 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:30.550
 Today's planning is over here. 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.550
 to the next
