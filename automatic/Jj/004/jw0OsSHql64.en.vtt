00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.390 
rename it or delete it I recommend
remain<00:02:59.760> renaming<00:03:00.510> first<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:01.950> go<00:03:02.160> in

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
remain renaming first we have to go in

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.570 
remain renaming first we have to go in
there<00:03:02.690> properties<00:03:03.690> again<00:03:04.850> security<00:03:05.850> again

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
there properties again security again

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.160 
there properties again security again
extended<00:03:08.580> security<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.450> then<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:09.930> have<00:03:10.050> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
extended security and then we have to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.110 
extended security and then we have to
take<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.590> ownership<00:03:10.920> I've<00:03:11.250> already<00:03:11.730> done<00:03:11.970> it

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
take the ownership I've already done it

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.220 
take the ownership I've already done it
here<00:03:12.330> usually<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.959> click<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:14.900> take<00:03:15.900> your

you<00:03:22.570> can<00:03:22.840> delight<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.350> though<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.620> don't

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
you can delight it though I don't

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.220 
you can delight it though I don't
recommend<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:24.820> simply<00:03:25.270> rename<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:28.080> when<00:03:29.080> we

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
recommend it simply rename it when we

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.630 
recommend it simply rename it when we
need<00:03:29.380> a<00:03:29.410> picture<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.190> replace<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.880> with<00:03:32.310> go<00:03:33.310> in

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
need a picture to replace it with go in

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.630 
need a picture to replace it with go in
there<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:37.030> renew<00:03:37.330> name<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:37.990> away<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:39.430> has

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
there we renew name it just away it has

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.790 
there we renew name it just away it has
to<00:03:39.760> be<00:03:39.970> image<00:03:40.420> 100<00:03:41.170> JPEG<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:43.120> is<00:03:43.480> better<00:03:44.470> it's

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
to be image 100 JPEG it is better it's

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.220 
to be image 100 JPEG it is better it's
supposed<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.520> be<00:03:46.110> 1920<00:03:47.110> by<00:03:47.260> 1200<00:03:48.150> JPEG<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.390> tried

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
supposed to be 1920 by 1200 JPEG I tried

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.920 
supposed to be 1920 by 1200 JPEG I tried
with<00:03:50.500> PNG<00:03:50.920> but<00:03:51.430> Windows<00:03:51.760> didn't<00:03:52.090> accept<00:03:52.450> PNG

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
with PNG but Windows didn't accept PNG

with PNG but Windows didn't accept PNG
for<00:03:53.140> whatever<00:03:53.410> reason<00:03:54.070> maybe<00:03:54.310> it's

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
for whatever reason maybe it's

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.240 
for whatever reason maybe it's
hard-coded<00:03:55.390> which<00:03:55.630> of<00:03:55.900> those<00:03:56.290> fights<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.709> JPEG

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
hard-coded which of those fights is JPEG

which is PNG or whatever one thing is it

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.930 
which is PNG or whatever one thing is it
is<00:04:01.270> here<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.720> has<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.020> right<00:04:02.170> name<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.940> right
