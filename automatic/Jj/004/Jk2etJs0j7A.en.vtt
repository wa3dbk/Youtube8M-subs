00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.730
 hello welcome to paperworld point too 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.460
 point comes already that you are there 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.949
 Today I'll show you a flying one 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:27.940
 bird of the neill ramblers she needs 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:31.100
 an origami paper 1 15 15 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.500
 and you starting with the white side 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.040
 upwards white side points upwards 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:45.710
 and fold the lower tip 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:50.380
 the top notes the paper and folds 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.380
 again the lower tip on the upper 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.149
 open the paper again and you have 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.079
 the diagonal fold 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.759
 then you will deserve that and fold it 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.759
 edge on edge 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:28.810
 then turn the paper and open again 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:31.060
 Then you could know again then if you 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.470
 the update again here and now 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.570
 Let us consider the reason for a basic form 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.369
 that means collided with the triangle 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:49.440
 and the pages to the left and 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:52.860
 pressed down to the right and from the top 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.569
 on the paper 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:02.619
 now you have two wings on the left and 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:06.490
 right also two wings and now will 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:10.420
 a wing pushed to the right so that 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.080
 you have a wing on one side and 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.459
 on the other side three wings 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.459
 that is very important in the model 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:32.200
 then you should the lower edge of the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:36.310
 triangle to the left knew all the layers 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:43.930
 while there she finds that one 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:47.659
 oblique walter then you have it works 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:53.420
 Does the paper work out the first position of 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:55.430
 on the bottom and that can not be so 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.500
 there is one right to fold 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.500
 small resistance and then you have to 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:10.310
 So help the paper and a bit 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:18.680
 fold a triangle into a triangle so that the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:21.010
 paper flat is therefore lost 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.579
 that opened a book page anyway 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.930
 therefore, the top goes up and so 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.829
 then you press the paper so flat then 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.829
 you do the whole thing 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.280
 then you can get this weird line here 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.360
 is a mountain side that could do it again 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.700
 so turn it into a partial fold 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:56.450
 this this this top tip of 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.769
 triangle down folds exactly and then 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.090
 the same case occurs as her 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.830
 just have already done it 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.190
 the other side that is open 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.780
 here's the paper so you work it out so 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:14.519
 up so that the special up 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:17.639
 shows and thus the tip completely there 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.859
 So the page shows up where the 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.859
 Another tip is already here 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:29.910
 walk in from the side a bit 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:38.700
 press the flat and simultaneously with 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:43.130
 the other hand so they may be one 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:47.340
 Let's make an arrow out of here 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:58.760
 is still our behavior of the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:58.760
 beak and fugue and here is his line 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:08.550
 until this line knew about this 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:24.040
 folded here with invite 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:26.830
 hold on here is the fold now 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.200
 Turned the paper so that you from below 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:35.140
 you can see the paper should be purely 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:37.080
 Open a bit and then you have to 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:43.240
 paper 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:46.390
 find the fold here left this fold 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.960
 she in her also worked out the paper 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:52.740
 right up to this wrong we just 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.740
 have made 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:05.459
 that's all and now we do 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.539
 still the beak works like that 

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:17.029
 similar as just 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:17.029
 we should first a piece from 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:25.589
 then the whole thing will be opened 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:30.029
 and here from behind it will open 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:33.499
 so that you come here again the line 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:37.999
 then you will see the tip 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:48.330
 and at the same time you push 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:51.599
 the neck so together then the bird almost 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:56.039
 finished we have the test if synonymous 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:59.429
 you can fly the bird 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:02.539
 here at the front of the neck a chest tight and 

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:02.539
 behind the tail 

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:16.159
 thank you for watching
