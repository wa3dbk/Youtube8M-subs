00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
two on the automatic drinker system I

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.370 
two on the automatic drinker system I
built<00:00:12.309> for<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.730> rabbits<00:00:13.179> there's<00:00:14.049> the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
built for the rabbits there's the

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.679 
built for the rabbits there's the
five-gallon<00:00:15.160> bucket<00:00:15.490> that<00:00:16.150> holds<00:00:16.299> the<00:00:16.599> water

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
five-gallon bucket that holds the water

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.029 
five-gallon bucket that holds the water
and<00:00:18.419> drill<00:00:19.419> the<00:00:19.509> hole<00:00:19.689> now<00:00:20.590> I<00:00:20.619> made<00:00:20.859> a<00:00:20.890> mistake

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 
and drill the hole now I made a mistake

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.609 
and drill the hole now I made a mistake
on<00:00:21.460> this<00:00:21.580> I<00:00:21.850> drilled<00:00:22.300> a<00:00:22.570> little<00:00:22.990> bit<00:00:23.230> too<00:00:23.410> close

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
on this I drilled a little bit too close

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.290 
on this I drilled a little bit too close
to<00:00:23.830> the<00:00:23.920> bottom<00:00:24.039> so<00:00:24.430> it<00:00:24.490> was<00:00:24.609> kind<00:00:24.880> of<00:00:25.000> a<00:00:25.119> pain

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
to the bottom so it was kind of a pain

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.359 
to the bottom so it was kind of a pain
to<00:00:25.570> tighten<00:00:25.960> this<00:00:26.680> bulkhead<00:00:27.550> fitting<00:00:28.359> up<00:00:28.480> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
to tighten this bulkhead fitting up and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.360 
to tighten this bulkhead fitting up and
then<00:00:30.369> I<00:00:30.550> just<00:00:30.789> threaded<00:00:31.660> this<00:00:31.990> nipple<00:00:32.260> in<00:00:32.529> so

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
then I just threaded this nipple in so

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.119 
then I just threaded this nipple in so
that<00:00:33.519> I<00:00:33.640> can<00:00:33.820> then<00:00:33.850> start<00:00:34.239> my<00:00:34.420> PVC<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:35.470> you<00:00:35.530> can

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
that I can then start my PVC and you can

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.899 
that I can then start my PVC and you can
see<00:00:36.370> it<00:00:37.059> comes<00:00:37.269> down<00:00:37.570> and<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:39.070> goes<00:00:39.670> in

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
see it comes down and then goes in

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.070 
see it comes down and then goes in
through<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.420> cages<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:41.559> top<00:00:41.769> cages<00:00:42.129> up<00:00:42.250> here

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
through the cages the top cages up here

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.649 
through the cages the top cages up here
are<00:00:44.080> branch<00:00:44.379> off<00:00:44.559> of<00:00:44.589> this<00:00:44.860> line<00:00:45.699> and<00:00:45.970> then

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
are branch off of this line and then

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.460 
are branch off of this line and then
this<00:00:46.839> one<00:00:47.080> goes<00:00:47.110> down<00:00:47.519> to<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.640> bottom<00:00:48.729> cages

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
this one goes down to the bottom cages

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.490 
this one goes down to the bottom cages
there's<00:00:50.470> six<00:00:50.739> cages<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.339> they<00:00:52.089> each<00:00:52.299> are<00:00:53.260> set

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
there's six cages and they each are set

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.399 
there's six cages and they each are set
up<00:00:53.589> like<00:00:53.769> this<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:55.330> main<00:00:55.629> line<00:00:55.839> comes<00:00:56.140> across

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
up like this the main line comes across

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.680 
up like this the main line comes across
the<00:00:57.040> top<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.580> then<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.799> piece<00:00:59.799> comes<00:01:00.280> down<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
the top and then a piece comes down to

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.429 
the top and then a piece comes down to
the<00:01:01.839> drinker

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:02.439 
the drinker

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.820 
the drinker

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
I'll post a link on this video where you

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.580 
I'll post a link on this video where you
can<00:01:05.860> order<00:01:06.570> these<00:01:08.220> these<00:01:09.220> PVC<00:01:09.840> tees<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.140> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
can order these these PVC tees and the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.000 
can order these these PVC tees and the
the<00:01:12.130> drinkers<00:01:12.870> try<00:01:13.870> to<00:01:13.930> get<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.170> better<00:01:14.410> picture

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
the drinkers try to get a better picture

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.930 
the drinkers try to get a better picture
of<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.460> drink<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.750> it<00:01:19.930> is<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:21.790> all

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
of the drink of you there it is it's all

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:29.740 
of the drink of you there it is it's all
brass<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.740 

just<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:31.260> push<00:01:31.650> down<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.750> barb

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
just they push down on the little barb

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.110 
just they push down on the little barb
in<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> middle<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.800> water<00:01:34.980> comes<00:01:35.250> out<00:01:41.120> so

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
in the middle and the water comes out so

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.650 
in the middle and the water comes out so
that's<00:01:42.710> how<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.770> did<00:01:43.980> it<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.970> could<00:01:48.150> kind

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
that's how we did it and you could kind

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.450 
that's how we did it and you could kind
of<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> can't<00:01:49.320> back<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.560> far<00:01:49.950> enough<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.310> get

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
of see I can't back up far enough to get

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.600 
of see I can't back up far enough to get
all<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.910> in<00:01:51.030> view<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.480> each<00:01:52.470> cage<00:01:53.250> has<00:01:53.580> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
all of it in view but each cage has a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.180 
all of it in view but each cage has a
drinker<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.350> then<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.620> last<00:01:55.830> thing<00:01:56.070> I

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
drinker and then the one last thing I

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.780 
drinker and then the one last thing I
did<00:01:56.370> was<00:01:57.650> this<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.860> clean-out<00:01:59.190> for<00:01:59.670> any

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
did was this is a clean-out for any

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.310 
did was this is a clean-out for any
debris<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.390> might<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.750> down<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.140> here

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
debris that might get down in here

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
debris that might get down in here
rather<00:02:01.710> than<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.130> into<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.760> into<00:02:03.510> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
rather than it going into the into the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.460 
rather than it going into the into the
nipple<00:02:04.410> it<00:02:04.980> comes<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.020> unscrew

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
nipple it comes here and I can unscrew

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.810 
nipple it comes here and I can unscrew
this<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:10.649> bleed<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.040> system<00:02:11.430> with

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
this and I can bleed the system with

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.930 
this and I can bleed the system with
that<00:02:12.000> too<00:02:12.240> I<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.630> empty<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.670> clean<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.820> out

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
that too I can empty it and clean it out

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.660 
that too I can empty it and clean it out
and<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.750> can<00:02:15.930> also<00:02:16.080> get<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.800> catches<00:02:17.190> debris<00:02:17.550> in

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and I can also get it catches debris in

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.670 
and I can also get it catches debris in
here<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:18.510> each<00:02:18.720> cage<00:02:19.050> has<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:20.000> little<00:02:21.000> clean<00:02:21.210> out

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
here so each cage has a little clean out

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.030 
here so each cage has a little clean out
with<00:02:22.680> scrap<00:02:23.070> PVC<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.180> had<00:02:24.540> laying<00:02:24.750> around

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
with scrap PVC that I had laying around

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.890 
with scrap PVC that I had laying around
after<00:02:26.040> cutting<00:02:26.400> cutting<00:02:26.850> everything<00:02:27.150> else<00:02:27.980> so

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
after cutting cutting everything else so

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.800 
after cutting cutting everything else so
now<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:32.489> next<00:02:32.970> thing<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.390> getting<00:02:33.600> these

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
now the next thing is getting these

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.900 
now the next thing is getting these
rabbits<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.320> drink<00:02:34.560> out<00:02:34.739> of<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.459> drinkers

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
rabbits to drink out of the drinkers

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.400 
rabbits to drink out of the drinkers
rather<00:02:36.450> than<00:02:36.750> their<00:02:36.900> water<00:02:37.140> bottles<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:39.410> we'll

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
rather than their water bottles so we'll

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.590 
rather than their water bottles so we'll
hopefully<00:02:40.920> figure<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:41.790> how<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> teach<00:02:42.420> them

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
hopefully figure out how to teach them
