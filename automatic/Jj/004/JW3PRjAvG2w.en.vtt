systems we see nearby today we found out
how<00:01:08.420> fast<00:01:08.630> they<00:01:08.899> were<00:01:08.960> rotating<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:09.799> how<00:01:10.040> much

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
how fast they were rotating and how much

spectra from the Keck telescopes and
then<00:01:14.600> in<00:01:14.750> order<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.110> interpret<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.340> rotation

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
then in order to interpret the rotation

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.429 
then in order to interpret the rotation
measurements<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:17.540> needed<00:01:17.810> images<00:01:18.229> from<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439

measurements we needed images from the
Hubble<00:01:18.530> Space<00:01:18.890> Telescope<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.729> tell<00:01:19.939> us<00:01:20.090> how

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
the galaxies will oriented so we find

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.310 
the galaxies will oriented so we find

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
should slow down with time and this

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.940 
should slow down with time and this
might<00:02:26.340> be<00:02:26.610> why<00:02:27.269> we're<00:02:27.599> finding<00:02:28.019> this<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
might be why we're finding this in the
