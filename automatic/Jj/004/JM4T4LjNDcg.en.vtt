the<00:01:34.380> Peacekeeper<00:01:34.920> reload<00:01:35.310> time<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:35.640> I've

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the Peacekeeper reload time which I've

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
the Peacekeeper reload time which I've
actually<00:01:35.880> had<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.270> manually<00:01:36.869> test<00:01:37.170> myself<00:01:37.530> is

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
actually had to manually test myself is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.880 
actually had to manually test myself is
one<00:01:38.310> point<00:01:38.640> 22<00:01:38.939> seconds<00:01:39.570> which<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:40.439> second

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
one point 22 seconds which is one second

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
one point 22 seconds which is one second
22<00:01:41.340> milliseconds<00:01:41.759> which<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.570> really

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
22 milliseconds which is really really

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.719 
22 milliseconds which is really really
quick<00:01:43.079> I'm<00:01:43.229> surprised<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.740> quick<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.610> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
quick I'm surprised a quick is this is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090 
quick I'm surprised a quick is this is
without<00:01:45.030> fast<00:01:45.479> mags<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.110> might<00:01:46.380> test<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> again

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
without fast mags I might test it again

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.280 
without fast mags I might test it again
later<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:48.030> fast<00:01:48.360> mags<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.200> how

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
later on fast mags is just to see how

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.539 
later on fast mags is just to see how
quickly<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.009> probably<00:01:50.280> gonna<00:01:50.430> be

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
quickly it is it's probably gonna be

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.170 
quickly it is it's probably gonna be
under<00:01:51.360> one<00:01:51.540> second<00:01:51.869> which<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.110> insane<00:01:53.180> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
under one second which is insane the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.810 
under one second which is insane the
rate<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.390> fire<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.689> 720<00:01:55.619> which<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.700> not

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
rate of fire is 720 which is it's not

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.179 
rate of fire is 720 which is it's not
amazing<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.329> probably<00:01:57.540> more<00:01:57.689> about<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.189> kind

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
amazing is probably more about the kind

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.950 
amazing is probably more about the kind
of<00:01:59.250> rate<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> fire<00:01:59.729> you'd<00:01:59.969> expect<00:02:00.329> from<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
of rate of fire you'd expect from like a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
of rate of fire you'd expect from like a
light<00:02:01.259> machine<00:02:01.649> gun<00:02:01.890> or<00:02:02.040> an<00:02:02.130> assault<00:02:02.460> rifle

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
light machine gun or an assault rifle

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249 
light machine gun or an assault rifle
which<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.509> why<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> hybrid

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
which is kind of why it's a hybrid

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.050 
which is kind of why it's a hybrid
between<00:02:04.350> submachine<00:02:05.070> gun<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.790> assault

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
between submachine gun and the assault

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.499 
between submachine gun and the assault
rifle<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.659> fire<00:02:07.200> mode<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.649> course<00:02:08.190> is

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
rifle and the fire mode of course is

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.520 
rifle and the fire mode of course is
automatic<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.660> there's<00:02:09.840> some<00:02:09.989> stats<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
automatic so there's some stats for you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.229 
automatic so there's some stats for you
there<00:02:10.739> we're<00:02:11.190> also<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.700> right<00:02:12.090> at

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
there we're also going to go right at

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.130 
there we're also going to go right at
the<00:02:12.330> end<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.569> video<00:02:12.750> we're<00:02:12.989> going<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the end of this video we're going to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.820 
the end of this video we're going to
compare<00:02:13.440> both

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
compare both

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
compare both
the<00:02:13.920> recall<00:02:14.370> which<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> recoil<00:02:15.240> pattern

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
the recall which is the recoil pattern

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.290 
the recall which is the recoil pattern
on<00:02:16.290> two<00:02:16.620> walls<00:02:16.890> between<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.820> Scorpion

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
on two walls between the Scorpion

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.390 
on two walls between the Scorpion
peacekeeper<00:02:18.900> seeking<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.710> see<00:02:19.890> which

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
peacekeeper seeking so you can see which

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.940 
peacekeeper seeking so you can see which
kind<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.970> there<00:02:21.480> actually<00:02:21.990> recalls<00:02:22.680> less

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
kind of there actually recalls less

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.740 
kind of there actually recalls less
which<00:02:23.160> recalls<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.760> most<00:02:23.970> let's<00:02:24.630> move

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
which recalls the most let's move

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.990 
which recalls the most let's move
straight<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.230> scorpion<00:02:25.820> alright<00:02:26.820> so

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
straight on to the scorpion alright so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.930 
straight on to the scorpion alright so
moving<00:02:27.150> swiftly<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.290> scorpion<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
moving swiftly on to the scorpion the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.940 
moving swiftly on to the scorpion the
which<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.510> actually<00:02:30.660> or<00:02:31.050> was<00:02:31.260> before<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
which is actually or was before the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.860 
which is actually or was before the
Peacekeeper<00:02:32.910> was<00:02:33.030> released<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.450> highest

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
Peacekeeper was released the highest

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.660 
Peacekeeper was released the highest
level<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.410> unlock<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.920> submachine<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
level to unlock a submachine and the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.760 
level to unlock a submachine and the
highest<00:02:36.000> level<00:02:36.720> unlock<00:02:37.110> for<00:02:37.350> some<00:02:37.530> machine

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
highest level unlock for some machine

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.990 
highest level unlock for some machine
gun<00:02:37.890> I've<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.340> get<00:02:38.430> all<00:02:38.520> my<00:02:38.580> words<00:02:38.790> mixed

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
gun I've kind of get all my words mixed

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.840 
gun I've kind of get all my words mixed
up<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.050> damage<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.590> 33<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.400> 18<00:02:41.700> which

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
up here but the damage is 33 to 18 which

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.190 
up here but the damage is 33 to 18 which
is<00:02:41.970> exactly<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.390> same<00:02:42.510> as<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> Peacekeeper

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
is exactly the same as the Peacekeeper

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.860 
is exactly the same as the Peacekeeper
so<00:02:43.710> for<00:02:43.920> damage<00:02:44.250> both<00:02:44.580> guns<00:02:44.880> are<00:02:45.000> very<00:02:45.060> very

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
so for damage both guns are very very

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.680 
so for damage both guns are very very
similar<00:02:46.500> exactly<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.490> same<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.480> magazine

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
similar exactly the same the magazine

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.430 
similar exactly the same the magazine
size<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.590> slightly<00:02:50.430> bigger<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:51.090> 32<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:52.290> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
size is slightly bigger it's 32 in a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.810 
size is slightly bigger it's 32 in a
normal<00:02:52.620> magazine<00:02:53.130> which<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.580> standard

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
normal magazine which is your standard

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.930 
normal magazine which is your standard

an<00:02:59.700> extra<00:02:59.970> two<00:03:00.090> bullets<00:03:00.420> wishes<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.230> helpful

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
an extra two bullets wishes it's helpful

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.250 
an extra two bullets wishes it's helpful
but<00:03:02.160> would<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.940> really<00:03:03.240> be<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.930> helpful

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
but would it really be that helpful

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.620 
but would it really be that helpful
another<00:03:05.010> two<00:03:05.220> bullets<00:03:05.550> now<00:03:05.880> probably<00:03:06.180> not<00:03:06.480> so

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
another two bullets now probably not so

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.880 
another two bullets now probably not so
that<00:03:06.780> that's<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.170> really<00:03:07.350> matter<00:03:07.530> too<00:03:07.650> much<00:03:07.680> it

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
that that's a really matter too much it

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.760 
that that's a really matter too much it
kind<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.070> cancels<00:03:08.490> out<00:03:09.470> obviously<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> number

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
kind of cancels out obviously the number

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.490 
kind of cancels out obviously the number
of<00:03:10.860> bullets<00:03:11.130> in<00:03:11.310> each<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:12.180> each<00:03:12.390> gun<00:03:12.990> or<00:03:13.200> you

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
of bullets in each in each gun or you

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.260 
of bullets in each in each gun or you
start<00:03:13.709> off<00:03:13.800> with<00:03:13.950> 32<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.670> clip<00:03:15.000> already

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
start off with 32 in the clip already

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.630 
start off with 32 in the clip already
reloaded<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:15.870> then<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.260> have<00:03:16.380> 96<00:03:17.010> allows<00:03:17.490> you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
reloaded and then you have 96 allows you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.910 
reloaded and then you have 96 allows you
to<00:03:17.760> reload<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.090> gun<00:03:18.390> four<00:03:19.140> times<00:03:19.440> or<00:03:19.650> three

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
to reload the gun four times or three

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.110 
to reload the gun four times or three
times<00:03:20.100> with<00:03:20.340> together<00:03:20.580> so<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.730> can<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.910> four

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
times with together so you can have four

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.110 
times with together so you can have four
mags<00:03:21.330> pretty<00:03:21.600> much<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.560> reload<00:03:22.950> time<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.340> 1.9

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
mags pretty much the reload time is 1.9

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.940 
mags pretty much the reload time is 1.9
seconds<00:03:24.570> which<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.750> good<00:03:25.140> for<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.350> submachine

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
seconds which is good for a submachine

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.729 
seconds which is good for a submachine
gun<00:03:26.130> but<00:03:26.370> not<00:03:27.180> nowhere<00:03:27.690> near<00:03:28.110> as<00:03:28.320> quick<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
gun but not nowhere near as quick as the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.229 
gun but not nowhere near as quick as the
Peacekeeper<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.220> peacekeepers<00:03:29.640> insane<00:03:30.030> for

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
Peacekeeper the peacekeepers insane for

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.670 
Peacekeeper the peacekeepers insane for
the<00:03:30.300> reload<00:03:30.600> time<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:31.260> that's<00:03:31.380> one<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
the reload time for that's one of the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.080 
the reload time for that's one of the
things<00:03:31.709> quite<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> lot<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.550> people<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:32.880> so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
things quite a lot of people like so

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.310 
things quite a lot of people like so
much<00:03:33.180> ballot<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> don't<00:03:34.019> have<00:03:34.170> to

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
much ballot is that you don't have to

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.440 
much ballot is that you don't have to
use<00:03:34.590> an<00:03:34.980> attachment<00:03:35.310> on<00:03:35.640> fast<00:03:35.880> mags<00:03:36.090> alone<00:03:36.360> if

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
use an attachment on fast mags alone if

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.660 
use an attachment on fast mags alone if
it's<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.630> glitch<00:03:36.810> 07<00:03:37.260> but<00:03:37.500> it's<00:03:37.709> insanely<00:03:38.280> quick

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
it's a glitch 07 but it's insanely quick

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.650 
it's a glitch 07 but it's insanely quick
you<00:03:38.790> know<00:03:38.910> when<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.060> made<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.269> video<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.600> other

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
you know when I made a video the other

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.320 
you know when I made a video the other
day<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.140> was<00:03:40.170> ridiculously<00:03:41.070> quick<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.610> anyway

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
day it was ridiculously quick so anyway

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.720 
day it was ridiculously quick so anyway
let's<00:03:42.510> get<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:44.070> rate<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.310> fire<00:03:44.580> now

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
let's get on to the the rate of fire now

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.280 
let's get on to the the rate of fire now
the<00:03:44.790> rate<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.000> fire<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:45.269> absolutely<00:03:46.110> insane

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
the rate of fire is absolutely insane

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.530 
the rate of fire is absolutely insane
it's<00:03:46.800> almost<00:03:47.190> double<00:03:47.730> what's<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
it's almost double what's the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.670 
it's almost double what's the
peacekeepers<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.290> rectifier<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:51.200> 1250<00:03:52.200> rpm

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
peacekeepers the rectifier is 1250 rpm

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.650 
peacekeepers the rectifier is 1250 rpm
which<00:03:52.709> if<00:03:53.070> i'm<00:03:53.519> not<00:03:53.790> wrong<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.390> might<00:03:54.630> be

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
which if i'm not wrong I might be

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.949 
which if i'm not wrong I might be
mistaken<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.530> highest<00:03:56.070> firing<00:03:56.750> gun<00:03:57.750> in

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
mistaken is the highest firing gun in

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.570 
mistaken is the highest firing gun in
black<00:03:58.110> ops<00:03:58.320> 2<00:03:58.410> is<00:03:58.650> absolutely<00:03:59.040> insane<00:03:59.160> how

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
black ops 2 is absolutely insane how

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.770 
black ops 2 is absolutely insane how
quick<00:03:59.820> that<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.180> know<00:04:00.239> I've<00:04:00.390> never<00:04:00.570> seen

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
quick that is you know I've never seen

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.110 
quick that is you know I've never seen
any<00:04:01.200> gun<00:04:01.500> fire<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.220> quick<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.700> test<00:04:02.910> that

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
any gun fire that quick and to test that

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.850 
any gun fire that quick and to test that
I<00:04:03.180> mean<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.630> don't<00:04:04.019> test<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.470> because<00:04:04.739> as

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
I mean I don't test that because as

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.160 
I mean I don't test that because as
asked<00:04:05.489> just<00:04:05.790> crazy<00:04:06.180> how<00:04:06.360> quickly<00:04:06.720> much<00:04:06.900> did

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
asked just crazy how quickly much did

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.199 
asked just crazy how quickly much did
that<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:08.100> fire<00:04:08.310> mode<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.730> course<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.120> all

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
that the fire mode of course it's all

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.400 
that the fire mode of course it's all
sort<00:04:09.510> also<00:04:10.110> automatic<00:04:10.769> so<00:04:10.980> v<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.959> guns<00:04:13.290> are

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
sort also automatic so v is the guns are

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.470 
sort also automatic so v is the guns are
fairly<00:04:13.890> even<00:04:14.459> first<00:04:14.850> I'll<00:04:15.060> give<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.299> my

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
fairly even first I'll give you my

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.289 
fairly even first I'll give you my
opinion<00:04:15.600> now<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.470> Peacekeeper<00:04:17.209> kind<00:04:18.209> of

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
opinion now the Peacekeeper kind of

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.699 
opinion now the Peacekeeper kind of
fails<00:04:18.479> on<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.780> right<00:04:18.930> fiber<00:04:19.229> obviously<00:04:19.620> the

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
fails on the right fiber obviously the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.070 
fails on the right fiber obviously the
reload<00:04:20.010> time<00:04:20.040> is<00:04:20.310> amazing<00:04:20.820> but<00:04:21.600> would<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
reload time is amazing but would the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.900 
reload time is amazing but would the
rate<00:04:22.289> of<00:04:22.350> fire<00:04:22.590> really<00:04:23.010> affect<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> gun<00:04:23.669> too

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
rate of fire really affect the gun too

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.790 
rate of fire really affect the gun too
much<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.360> think<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.050> rectifier<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.440> one<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.740> the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
much I think the rectifier is one of the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.610 
much I think the rectifier is one of the
things<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.039> makes<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.550> Scorpion<00:04:27.030> so

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
things that makes the Scorpion so

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.070 
things that makes the Scorpion so
like<00:04:27.889> kind<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.729> so<00:04:28.970> recall<00:04:29.449> he<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.780> has<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.900> lot

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
like kind of so recall he and has a lot

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.719 
like kind of so recall he and has a lot
of<00:04:30.110> recall<00:04:30.470> but<00:04:30.680> we'll<00:04:30.979> see<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:31.220> in<00:04:31.250> a<00:04:31.340> second

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
of recall but we'll see that in a second

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.070 
of recall but we'll see that in a second
so<00:04:31.820> anyway<00:04:32.030> let's<00:04:32.180> go<00:04:32.300> ahead<00:04:32.479> let's<00:04:32.960> get

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
so anyway let's go ahead let's get

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.320 
so anyway let's go ahead let's get
straight<00:04:33.410> into<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.889> recoil<00:04:34.820> against<00:04:35.150> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
straight into the recoil against the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.090 
straight into the recoil against the
wall<00:04:35.479> on<00:04:35.630> plaza<00:04:35.860> remember<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.949> leave<00:04:37.010> your

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
wall on plaza remember to leave your

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.650 
wall on plaza remember to leave your
opinion<00:04:37.580> down<00:04:37.729> below<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.270> I'll<00:04:38.419> see<00:04:38.449> you<00:04:38.630> next

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
opinion down below and I'll see you next

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.169 
opinion down below and I'll see you next
time<00:04:38.960> goodbye
