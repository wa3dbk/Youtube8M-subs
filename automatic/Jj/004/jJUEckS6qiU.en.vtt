00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
2211 and starting off that list guys we

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.009 
2211 and starting off that list guys we
have<00:00:08.160> John<00:00:08.370> Tavares<00:00:08.639> an<00:00:08.910> 89<00:00:09.269> overall<00:00:09.690> center

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
have John Tavares an 89 overall center

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.720 
have John Tavares an 89 overall center
John<00:00:10.679> Tavares<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:11.010> think<00:00:11.250> should<00:00:11.370> actually<00:00:11.519> be

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
John Tavares I think should actually be

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.919 
John Tavares I think should actually be
rated<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.000> little<00:00:12.240> higher<00:00:12.360> than<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.660> he's

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
rated a little higher than this he's

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.209 
rated a little higher than this he's
just<00:00:13.139> such<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> good<00:00:13.559> player<00:00:13.740> I'd<00:00:13.920> probably

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
just such a good player I'd probably

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.740 
just such a good player I'd probably
have<00:00:14.429> him<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> top<00:00:14.880> 10<00:00:15.089> players<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> NHL

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
have him the top 10 players in the NHL

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.870 
have him the top 10 players in the NHL
last<00:00:16.590> year<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.890> NHL<00:00:17.190> 13<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.580> think<00:00:17.730> he<00:00:17.789> was

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
last year in NHL 13 I think he was

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.609 
last year in NHL 13 I think he was
ranked<00:00:18.090> 86<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.690> thought<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.080> way<00:00:19.289> too<00:00:19.320> low

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
ranked 86 I thought that was way too low

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.590 
ranked 86 I thought that was way too low
for<00:00:19.680> Tavarez<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.340> 89s<00:00:21.119> definitely<00:00:21.480> good

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
for Tavarez so 89s definitely good

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.790 
for Tavarez so 89s definitely good
improvement<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> think<00:00:22.320> he<00:00:22.380> could<00:00:22.529> even<00:00:22.680> be

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
improvement but I think he could even be

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.340 
improvement but I think he could even be
in<00:00:22.859> 90<00:00:23.189> next<00:00:23.820> guys<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.210> Joe<00:00:24.359> Thornton<00:00:24.750> 90

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
in 90 next guys we have Joe Thornton 90

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.470 
in 90 next guys we have Joe Thornton 90
overall<00:00:25.710> center<00:00:26.070> Joe<00:00:26.849> Thornton<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.300> think

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
overall center Joe Thornton I think

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.790 
overall center Joe Thornton I think
that's<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.720> pretty<00:00:27.960> decent<00:00:28.260> rating<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.680> he

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that's a pretty decent rating for he

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.410 
that's a pretty decent rating for he
might<00:00:28.920> even<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.220> an<00:00:29.310> 89<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.939> know<00:00:30.029> he's<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.179> as

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
might even be an 89 you know he's not as

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.089 
might even be an 89 you know he's not as
good<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.109> he<00:00:31.199> was<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.470> know<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> few<00:00:31.619> years<00:00:31.830> ago

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
good as he was you know a few years ago

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.100 
good as he was you know a few years ago
anyone<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.880> Ross<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> starch<00:00:33.870> but

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
anyone like the out Ross and starch but

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.200 
anyone like the out Ross and starch but
he's<00:00:34.500> still<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:34.920> good<00:00:35.040> player<00:00:35.250> at

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
he's still a really good player at

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.600 
he's still a really good player at
number<00:00:36.480> 18<00:00:36.780> gadget<00:00:37.140> Marian<00:00:37.410> Gaborik<00:00:37.610> 890

number 18 gadget Marian Gaborik 890

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.280 
number 18 gadget Marian Gaborik 890
overall<00:00:38.910> driving<00:00:39.090> sniper<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.750> think<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
overall driving sniper I think it's a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.380 
overall driving sniper I think it's a
bit<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> an<00:00:40.620> over<00:00:41.070> value<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:41.579> Gaborik<00:00:42.120> last

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
bit of an over value for Gaborik last

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.240 
bit of an over value for Gaborik last
year<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.719> an<00:00:42.809> 89<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.379> really<00:00:43.800> didn't<00:00:44.040> prove

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
year was an 89 I really didn't prove

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.799 
year was an 89 I really didn't prove
anything<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.670> me<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> would<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.750> know

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
anything to me that it would you know

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.299 
anything to me that it would you know
grant<00:00:46.110> him<00:00:46.260> being<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.620> overall<00:00:46.860> higher<00:00:47.100> if

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
grant him being one overall higher if

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.920 
grant him being one overall higher if
anything<00:00:47.640> should<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.090> overall<00:00:48.390> lower<00:00:48.600> so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
anything should be one overall lower so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
anything should be one overall lower so
he's<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.649> 90<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:50.340> he's<00:00:50.460> probably

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
he's in 90 but I think he's probably

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.330 
he's in 90 but I think he's probably
better<00:00:50.910> at<00:00:51.030> an<00:00:51.120> 89<00:00:51.480> 88<00:00:51.780> next<00:00:52.710> guys<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.100> Number

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
just shows you how good he's playing us

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
just shows you how good he's playing us
a<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.180> good<00:01:18.299> rating<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.720> him<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.110> don't

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a pretty good rating for him I don't

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
a pretty good rating for him I don't
know<00:01:19.680> maybe<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.280> little<00:01:20.400> over<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.939> top<00:01:20.970> maybe

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
know maybe a little over the top maybe

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
know maybe a little over the top maybe
he<00:01:21.689> should<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.930> around<00:01:22.080> an<00:01:22.259> 89<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:23.070> but

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
he should be around an 89 I think but

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880 
he should be around an 89 I think but
still<00:01:23.310> pretty<00:01:24.210> good<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> ballpark<00:01:25.290> at

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
still pretty good in the ballpark at

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530 
still pretty good in the ballpark at
number<00:01:26.189> 14<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.030> guys<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.390> had<00:01:27.479> an

number 14 here guys you have had an

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.210 
number 14 here guys you have had an
excited<00:01:27.840> break<00:01:27.960> 90<00:01:28.229> overall<00:01:28.619> playmaking<00:01:28.950> left

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
excited break 90 overall playmaking left

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.679 
excited break 90 overall playmaking left
wing<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> an<00:01:30.329> upgrade<00:01:30.450> for

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
wing so that's a bit of an upgrade for

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.929 
wing so that's a bit of an upgrade for
zetterberg<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.110> believe<00:01:31.320> he<00:01:31.470> was<00:01:31.619> an<00:01:31.740> 89<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.640> 88

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
zetterberg I believe he was an 89 or 88

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
zetterberg I believe he was an 89 or 88
last<00:01:33.210> year<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.659> he<00:01:34.259> played<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.590> well<00:01:34.680> this

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
last year so he played really well this

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.109 
last year so he played really well this
year<00:01:34.950> though<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.430> stepped<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
year though really stepped up as the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.580 
year though really stepped up as the
captain<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> red<00:01:36.689> wings<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.079> think<00:01:37.439> that's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
captain of the red wings I think that's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
captain of the red wings I think that's
a<00:01:37.650> pretty<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:37.920> rating<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.310> him<00:01:38.430> next<00:01:39.210> guys<00:01:39.479> a

playmaking<00:01:42.299> right<00:01:42.659> winger<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.380> don't<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.130> why

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
playmaking right winger I don't know why

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
playmaking right winger I don't know why
they<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.850> wing<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.090> feel<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.689> he

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
they have a right wing I feel like he

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
they have a right wing I feel like he
played<00:01:46.079> Center<00:01:46.470> last<00:01:47.250> year<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> thought<00:01:47.790> he<00:01:47.880> was

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
played Center last year I thought he was

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.490 
played Center last year I thought he was
sending<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> first<00:01:48.479> line<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.720> maybe<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.259> hundred

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
sending the first line I maybe a hundred

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.710 
sending the first line I maybe a hundred
sent<00:01:49.829> along<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.369> anyways<00:01:51.149> i'm<00:01:51.360> at<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> right

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
sent along but anyways i'm at the right

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
sent along but anyways i'm at the right
wing<00:01:51.899> position<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.880> faceoffs

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
wing position so I don't know faceoffs

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.910 
wing position so I don't know faceoffs
85<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> feel<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.290> center<00:01:55.530> last<00:01:55.649> year

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
85 I feel like he was center last year

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560 
85 I feel like he was center last year
maybe<00:01:56.369> I'm<00:01:56.520> wrong<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:57.119> regards<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
maybe I'm wrong in regards to the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.130 
maybe I'm wrong in regards to the
reigning<00:01:57.899> 90<00:01:58.170> overall<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:59.360> don't<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.450> he

didn't do that great last year with the
year<00:02:02.520> before<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.820> he<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.270> crushed<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
year before that he just crushed it so

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.810 
year before that he just crushed it so
it's<00:02:04.140> hard<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.320> say<00:02:04.409> Drew's<00:02:05.219> probably<00:02:05.700> around

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
it's hard to say Drew's probably around

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.789 
it's hard to say Drew's probably around

good rating I would obviously have them
lower<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.450> due<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.690> defense<00:02:13.020> when<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
lower but just due to the defense when I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.730 
lower but just due to the defense when I
ranked<00:02:13.530> 80
