00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
like Marvin Philips wife was when he

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600 
like Marvin Philips wife was when he
invented<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.439> makes<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.280> chore

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
invented this it just makes that chore

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.190 
invented this it just makes that chore
so<00:01:45.360> much<00:01:45.600> easier<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.770> feature<00:01:47.189> price

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
so much easier to do feature price

one<00:03:36.570> four<00:03:36.989> five<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:37.860> I<00:03:37.890> love<00:03:38.130> about<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.519> is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
one four five what I love about this is

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.870 
one four five what I love about this is
the<00:03:38.730> fact<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.239> also<00:03:39.620> folds<00:03:40.620> away<00:03:41.310> right

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the fact that it also folds away right

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.590 
the fact that it also folds away right
so<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.329> folds<00:03:42.570> into<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.959> very<00:03:43.320> very<00:03:43.650> slender

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
so it folds into a very very slender
