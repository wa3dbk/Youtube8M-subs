these techniques with daily activity so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.360 
these techniques with daily activity so
you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.570> sneak<00:00:36.809> exercise<00:00:37.410> throughout<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you can sneak exercise throughout the

you can sneak exercise throughout the
day<00:00:38.579> without<00:00:38.850> ever<00:00:39.210> having<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.629> go<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.989> gym

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
day without ever having to go to a gym

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.979 
day without ever having to go to a gym
there's<00:00:40.980> no<00:00:41.219> music<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.270> yet<00:00:42.510> there's<00:00:42.719> dance

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
there's no music but yet there's dance

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350 
there's no music but yet there's dance
theory<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.010> biggest<00:00:44.550> question<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.120> get

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
theory and the biggest question I get

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.920 
theory and the biggest question I get
there<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.620> T<00:00:47.010> tab<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:48.059> since<00:00:48.719> each

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
there what is T tab so since each

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.619 
there what is T tab so since each
exercise<00:00:49.410> looks<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.190> simple<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.360> always

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
exercise looks so simple but they always

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
exercise looks so simple but they always
involve<00:00:52.140> five<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.649> seven<00:00:53.010> muscles<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
involve five to seven muscles at the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
involve five to seven muscles at the
same<00:00:54.120> time<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:55.110> need<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> feel<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
same time you need to feel the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.590 
same time you need to feel the
difference<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.430> let's<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.879> together<00:00:57.149> so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
difference so let's do it together so

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.349 
difference so let's do it together so
you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.989> understand<00:00:58.500> how<00:00:58.949> less<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.640> more<00:01:00.059> with

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
you can understand how less is more with

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.160 
you can understand how less is more with
TT<00:01:00.840> body<00:01:01.829> alignment<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.550> very<00:01:02.640> important<00:01:03.449> toes

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
TT body alignment is very important toes

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.130 
TT body alignment is very important toes
forward<00:01:04.850> shoulders<00:01:05.850> hips<00:01:06.180> ankles<00:01:06.450> most

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
forward shoulders hips ankles most

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
forward shoulders hips ankles most
people<00:01:07.500> stand<00:01:07.860> hip<00:01:08.189> width<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:08.850> everything

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
people stand hip width so get everything

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.090 
people stand hip width so get everything
into<00:01:09.390> alignment<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.110> don't<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.830> your<00:01:10.950> feet

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
into alignment and don't have your feet

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
into alignment and don't have your feet
turned<00:01:11.369> out<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.420> other<00:01:12.570> thing<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.290> always

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
turned out the other thing is I always

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.429 
turned out the other thing is I always
activate<00:01:14.460> all<00:01:14.640> muscles<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.420> both<00:01:15.720> attachments

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
activate all muscles at both attachments

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
activate all muscles at both attachments
both<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> origin<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> insertion<00:01:18.299> so

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
both at the origin and the insertion so

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.469 
both at the origin and the insertion so
you<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.900> full<00:01:19.380> fibre<00:01:19.950> muscle<00:01:20.490> activity<00:01:20.909> so

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you get full fibre muscle activity so

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
you get full fibre muscle activity so
you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.840> muscle<00:01:22.320> density<00:01:22.560> instead<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you can get muscle density instead of
