that we can on things like this but this

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.270 
that we can on things like this but this
one<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.110> mean<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.440> can<00:01:28.650> see<00:01:28.799> right<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
one I mean you can see right here is a

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.789 
one I mean you can see right here is a
sign<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.420> comes<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.900> pretty<00:01:31.110> okay<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
sign of it comes out pretty okay in the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
sign of it comes out pretty okay in the
spring<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.210> May<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> when

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
spring but they I think May is when

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.539 
spring but they I think May is when
they're<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.439> starting<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.159> explode

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
they're really starting to explode

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.700 
they're really starting to explode
that's<00:01:36.000> right<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.540> we're<00:01:36.750> looking<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.290> new

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that's right so we're looking at new

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.620 
that's right so we're looking at new
foliage<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.760> but<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
foliage up here but you can see the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.260 
foliage up here but you can see the
older<00:01:40.020> damaged<00:01:40.439> foliage<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.880> happened

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
older damaged foliage and what happened

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.590 
older damaged foliage and what happened
was<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.689> they<00:01:43.229> overwinter<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.250> eggs<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.210> they

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
was so they overwinter as eggs and they

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.830 
was so they overwinter as eggs and they
lay<00:01:45.810> their<00:01:46.049> eggs<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.280> underside<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
lay their eggs on the underside of the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.390 
lay their eggs on the underside of the
length<00:01:49.350> okay

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
length okay

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.380 
length okay
so<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.890> they're<00:01:52.890> damaged<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.850> kind

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390

new<00:02:02.700> growth<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.329> coming<00:02:03.689> out<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:04.560> they<00:02:04.860> will

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
new growth is coming out then they will

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.609 
new growth is coming out then they will
hatch<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.579> into<00:02:05.820> little<00:02:06.060> nymphs<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.840> then

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
hatch out into little nymphs and then

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.289 
hatch out into little nymphs and then
they<00:02:07.799> will<00:02:07.950> migrate<00:02:08.159> to<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.670> new<00:02:08.789> growth<00:02:09.030> okay

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
they will migrate to the new growth okay

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.150 
they will migrate to the new growth okay
and<00:02:09.720> that's<00:02:10.110> when<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.439> do<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.739> sucking

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and that's when they do this sucking

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.339 
and that's when they do this sucking
part<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.610> damages<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.300> that's<00:02:12.750> correct<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
part that damages it that's correct so

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.130 
part that damages it that's correct so
always<00:02:13.800> bugs<00:02:14.099> are<00:02:14.430> sucking<00:02:14.849> type<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.480> insects

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
always bugs are sucking type of insects

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.050 
always bugs are sucking type of insects
and<00:02:16.260> they<00:02:16.560> sucked<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.220> plant<00:02:17.460> juices<00:02:17.880> out

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
and they sucked the plant juices out

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.380 
and they sucked the plant juices out
that's<00:02:18.390> why<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:19.380> looks<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.950> blotched<00:02:20.460> so

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that's why this looks so blotched so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.180 
that's why this looks so blotched so
Terrell<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.110> Collier's<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.160> a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
Terrell at Collier's you do have a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.190 
Terrell at Collier's you do have a
couple<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.790> options<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.450> address<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.020> issue

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
couple of options to address this issue

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.800 
couple of options to address this issue
in<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.470> garden<00:02:25.740> yes<00:02:26.310> there's<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.240> couple<00:02:27.690> of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
in the garden yes there's a couple of

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.450 
in the garden yes there's a couple of
different<00:02:28.260> ways<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.130> do<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> you

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
different ways that you can do it you

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.090 
different ways that you can do it you
can<00:02:29.490> either<00:02:29.790> do<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.560> organically<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.920> there

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
can either do it organically but there

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.000 
can either do it organically but there
are<00:02:32.190> also<00:02:32.370> some<00:02:32.880> very<00:02:33.090> good<00:02:34.010> non-organic

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
are also some very good non-organic

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.310 
are also some very good non-organic
types<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.880> controls<00:02:36.300> with<00:02:36.690> systemic

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
types of controls with systemic

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.850 
types of controls with systemic
materials<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:38.370> systemic<00:02:39.120> means<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.680> can

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
materials now systemic means that it can

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.910 
materials now systemic means that it can
be<00:02:41.540> treated<00:02:42.540> on<00:02:42.660> one<00:02:42.900> side<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.410> plant<00:02:43.650> on

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
be treated on one side of the plant on

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.880 
be treated on one side of the plant on
the<00:02:43.980> leaves<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.720> will<00:02:45.900> be<00:02:46.050> absorbed<00:02:46.470> into

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
the leaves and it will be absorbed into

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.040 
the leaves and it will be absorbed into
the<00:02:47.190> plant<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.760> control<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.600> sucking

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
the plant and control the sucking

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.770 
the plant and control the sucking
insects<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.740> bottom<00:02:50.190> part<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.760> those<00:02:51.570> are

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
insects on the bottom part so those are

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.230 
insects on the bottom part so those are
the<00:02:51.870> most<00:02:52.020> effective<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.120> don't

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
the most effective and and you don't

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.820 
the most effective and and you don't
have<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.600> be<00:02:54.720> quite<00:02:55.020> as<00:02:55.170> thorough<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.800> your

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
have to be quite as thorough in your

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.520 
have to be quite as thorough in your
applications<00:02:56.720> but<00:02:57.720> we<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.380> this

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
applications but we can do this

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.660 
applications but we can do this
organically<00:02:59.280> with<00:02:59.520> soaps<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.450> oils<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.670> but

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
organically with soaps and oils and but

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.940 
organically with soaps and oils and but
we<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:03.150> very<00:03:03.480> thorough<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.170> we<00:03:04.740> have

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
we have to be very thorough and we have

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.340 
we have to be very thorough and we have
to<00:03:05.130> get<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> treatment<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.120> bottom<00:03:07.050> side

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
to get the treatment on the bottom side

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.560 
to get the treatment on the bottom side
of<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.770> leaf<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.430> every<00:03:08.970> single<00:03:09.390> leaf

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
of the leaf and on every single leaf

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.170 
of the leaf and on every single leaf
yeah<00:03:09.930> otherwise<00:03:10.680> you'll<00:03:11.520> still<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:12.060> an

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
yeah otherwise you'll still have an

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.630 
yeah otherwise you'll still have an
infestation<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.140> if<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:13.560> miss<00:03:13.770> one<00:03:14.010> leaf<00:03:14.220> and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
infestation and if you miss one leaf and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.580 
infestation and if you miss one leaf and
and<00:03:14.940> since<00:03:15.240> they're<00:03:15.390> aggressive<00:03:15.870> that's<00:03:16.320> just

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
and since they're aggressive that's just

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.560 
and since they're aggressive that's just
like<00:03:16.740> giving<00:03:17.160> them<00:03:17.370> right<00:03:17.850> away<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.090> go<00:03:18.270> at<00:03:18.420> it

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
like giving them right away to go at it

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.479 
like giving them right away to go at it
again<00:03:18.660> yes<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.440> because<00:03:19.620> they<00:03:19.950> spread<00:03:20.250> so

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
again yes and because they spread so

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.210 
again yes and because they spread so
rapidly<00:03:20.519> there<00:03:21.239> are<00:03:21.360> multiple<00:03:22.220> probably

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
rapidly there are multiple probably

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.670 
rapidly there are multiple probably
about<00:03:23.730> three<00:03:24.209> generations<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.140> year<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.470> lace

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
about three generations a year of lace

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.640 
about three generations a year of lace
bugs<00:03:26.300> that<00:03:27.300> get<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.570> your<00:03:27.810> zelli's<00:03:28.260> and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
bugs that get on your zelli's and

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.650 
bugs that get on your zelli's and
rhododendrons<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.030> really<00:03:30.390> want<00:03:30.570> to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
rhododendrons so you really want to

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.300 
rhododendrons so you really want to
catch<00:03:30.900> them<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.350> take<00:03:31.650> care<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:31.980> them<00:03:32.130> and

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
catch them and take care of them and

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.710 
catch them and take care of them and
it's<00:03:32.670> not<00:03:32.730> gonna<00:03:32.910> be<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.090> one-time<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.510> thing

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
it's not gonna be a one-time a thing

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.570 
it's not gonna be a one-time a thing
it's<00:03:34.050> gonna<00:03:34.230> take<00:03:34.500> some<00:03:34.800> some<00:03:35.100> effort<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.459> get

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
it's gonna take some some effort to get

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.340 
it's gonna take some some effort to get
right<00:03:35.850> them<00:03:36.030> yes<00:03:36.450> unfortunately<00:03:36.690> they're

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
right them yes unfortunately they're

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.810 
right them yes unfortunately they're
gonna<00:03:37.440> be<00:03:37.620> kind<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.890> like<00:03:37.950> rip<00:03:38.310> weevil<00:03:38.640> the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
gonna be kind of like rip weevil the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.270 
gonna be kind of like rip weevil the
fact<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.269> you<00:03:40.140> will<00:03:40.290> probably<00:03:40.530> never<00:03:40.950> get

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
fact that you will probably never get

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.190 
fact that you will probably never get
rid<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.580> them<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:42.030> will<00:03:42.360> need<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.660> manage<00:03:43.170> that

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
rid of them you will need to manage that

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.710 
rid of them you will need to manage that
yeah<00:03:43.980> all<00:03:44.519> right<00:03:44.730> well<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.030> know<00:03:45.150> we<00:03:45.510> love<00:03:45.660> our
