00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:04.830
 bromont day clubs then have two other Japanese developers 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.750
 in europe from the plastic 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.750
 suddenly to career for proof we can take care 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.129
 of a very simple thing to remove what is acquired the phone part which 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.189
 is there 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.369
 here you have a small wafer 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.339
 click is enough 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.609
 the click went nicely 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.980
 with the tools you want and together his host 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.019
 you have here 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.129
 the front camera and rear camera part connector and everything 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.730
 the entire integrated circuit 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.970
 which is on the plate how many goals 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.320
 connected 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.920
 so we put it next to it 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.190
 she takes care of the rest 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.470
 in fact, there are three or four things that need to be 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.430
 be very careful what are all the connectors here you have a small 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.880
 connector 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.040
 golden 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.770
 that you to straighten them out 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.270
 vertically 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.190
 if we continue with the army 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.920
 here is 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.870
 something to gently remove with a pass 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.310
 do not change that and loot 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.600
 this earthquake the coaxial cable that you fall back far enough so that 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.780
 that it does not bother you 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.950
 here if you still have a connector 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.900
 on a green pad 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.850
 it is necessary to eclipse 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 fold them vertically so as to release them 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.390
 there you have a very large connectors 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.430
 under this plate of silver 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.430
 that you can find out who is also 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.180
 going through here 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.390
 ouattara 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.950
 always the same we fall back vertically 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.190
 and to see the very attention 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.950
 you said if the contact 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.420
 Kyiv or allows you to start your GPS 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.270
 who is stuck with a flexible colleague 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.560
 so you go gently 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.620
 avoid using a guardian 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.170
 with a blade here 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.780
 all together 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.350
 maybe to go up from there 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.989
 so at this plate there 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.589
 go slow 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:13.849
 can be removed 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.849
 your phone to the water summary 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:20.149
 we have side 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.959
 and we'll see more
