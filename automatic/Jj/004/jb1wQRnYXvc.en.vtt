00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
larger screens now and the couple things

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
larger screens now and the couple things
you<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.360> know<00:01:15.420> about<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.960> fall<00:01:16.369> first

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you want to know about this fall first

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.510 
you want to know about this fall first
as<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.700> said<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> larger<00:01:18.479> display<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.650> your

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
as I said is the larger display so your

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.300 
as I said is the larger display so your
apps<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.780> bigger<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:23.220> know

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
apps are going to be bigger you know

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.460 
apps are going to be bigger you know
typing<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:23.939> probably<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.270> easier<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
typing will probably be easier this

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.929 
typing will probably be easier this
because<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.799> have<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.920> larger<00:01:26.250> display<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
because you have a larger display and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.390 
because you have a larger display and
they're<00:01:27.570> also<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.500> rumor<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.950> make

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
they're also going to the rumor is make

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.460 
they're also going to the rumor is make
it<00:01:29.430> sharper<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.450> put<00:01:30.689> more<00:01:30.869> pixels<00:01:31.259> in

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it sharper so they put more pixels in

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.730 
it sharper so they put more pixels in
there<00:01:31.680> okay<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.329> it'll<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:33.570> better<00:01:33.960> kind<00:01:34.680> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
there okay so it'll look better kind of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
there okay so it'll look better kind of
like<00:01:34.860> when<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.130> went<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.670> old<00:01:35.880> iphone

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
like when you went from the old iphone

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.569 
like when you went from the old iphone
to<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> retina<00:01:36.960> display<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.530> iphone<00:01:37.890> 4<00:01:38.220> of

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
to the retina display on iphone 4 of

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.200 
to the retina display on iphone 4 of
sharper<00:01:39.000> few<00:01:39.530> second<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.650> its<00:01:40.799> thin<00:01:41.210> wait

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
sharper few second is its thin wait

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.530 
sharper few second is its thin wait
thinner<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.530> feels<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:44.759> ipod<00:01:45.240> touch

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
thinner so it feels like an ipod touch

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.139 
thinner so it feels like an ipod touch
the<00:01:45.750> current<00:01:46.079> ipod<00:01:46.380> touch<00:01:46.649> rather<00:01:46.979> than<00:01:47.250> the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
to finish I really don't like how the

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.890 
to finish I really don't like how the
antenna<00:03:39.209> lines<00:03:39.510> look<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.290> back<00:03:40.470> here<00:03:40.920> but

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
antenna lines look on the back here but

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.940 
antenna lines look on the back here but
again<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.019> stomach<00:03:43.530> model<00:03:43.709> these<00:03:43.799> are

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
again the stomach model these are

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.800 
again the stomach model these are
painted<00:03:44.400> on<00:03:44.519> these<00:03:44.760> aren't<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.030> actual<00:03:45.480> real

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
painted on these aren't the actual real

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.479 
painted on these aren't the actual real
antenna<00:03:46.380> line<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.769> maybe<00:03:46.980> they'll<00:03:47.130> be<00:03:47.190> thinner

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
antenna line so maybe they'll be thinner

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.599 
antenna line so maybe they'll be thinner
but<00:03:48.150> what<00:03:48.299> about<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.660> size<00:03:48.900> i<00:03:49.260> like<00:03:49.650> 4.7<00:03:50.489> I

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
but what about the size i like 4.7 I

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:51.890 
but what about the size i like 4.7 I
think<00:03:50.880> it's<00:03:51.000> if<00:03:51.150> you<00:03:51.269> have<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.389> bigger<00:03:51.599> hands

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
think it's if you have a bigger hands

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.080 
think it's if you have a bigger hands
yeah<00:03:52.799> it's<00:03:53.010> not<00:03:53.160> just<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.430> hands<00:03:53.639> though<00:03:53.849> it's

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
yeah it's not just the hands though it's

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.740 
yeah it's not just the hands though it's
like<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.419> want<00:03:54.780> more<00:03:55.019> space<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.799> my<00:03:56.040> screen<00:03:56.750> do

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.080 
like I want more space on my screen do
stuff<00:03:58.169> so<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:58.680> when<00:03:58.980> i<00:03:59.010> set<00:03:59.280> android<00:03:59.819> phones

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
has more room on it yeah that's my

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.520 
has more room on it yeah that's my
opinion<00:04:11.819> if<00:04:12.419> I<00:04:12.569> like<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.900> body<00:04:13.109> i<00:04:13.230> like<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
opinion if I like the body i like the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.259 
opinion if I like the body i like the
shape<00:04:13.560> i<00:04:13.950> definitely<00:04:14.370> like<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.579> larger<00:04:15.030> screen

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
shape i definitely like a larger screen

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.240 
shape i definitely like a larger screen
I<00:04:15.599> like<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.019> be<00:04:16.139> more<00:04:16.320> high<00:04:16.500> resolution

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
I like it to be more high resolution

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.879 
I like it to be more high resolution
that<00:04:18.120> all<00:04:18.359> sounds<00:04:18.780> great<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:19.200> me<00:04:19.260> bigger

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
that all sounds great to me bigger

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.319 
that all sounds great to me bigger
screen<00:04:20.220> though<00:04:20.400> I'm<00:04:20.549> happy<00:04:20.820> about<00:04:20.910> especially

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
screen though I'm happy about especially

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.270 
screen though I'm happy about especially
because<00:04:21.720> it<00:04:21.840> feels<00:04:22.289> pretty<00:04:22.500> similar<00:04:22.979> in<00:04:23.070> your

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
because it feels pretty similar in your

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.000 
because it feels pretty similar in your
hands<00:04:23.639> so<00:04:23.789> it's<00:04:24.150> not<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.599> you<00:04:25.110> shanks<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.740> big

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
hands so it's not that you shanks a big
