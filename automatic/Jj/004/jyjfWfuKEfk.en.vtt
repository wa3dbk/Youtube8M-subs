00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
your overall outlook on that event well

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.960 
your overall outlook on that event well
I<00:03:18.500> think<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.890> lot<00:03:18.980> of<00:03:19.040> people<00:03:19.310> underestimate

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
I think a lot of people underestimate

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.220 
I think a lot of people underestimate
how<00:03:20.000> much<00:03:20.209> time<00:03:20.510> we're<00:03:20.660> really<00:03:20.780> putting<00:03:21.079> in

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
how much time we're really putting in

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.960 
how much time we're really putting in
right<00:03:21.410> now<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.620> mean<00:03:21.860> what<00:03:22.400> we've<00:03:22.549> been<00:03:22.760> home

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
right now I mean what we've been home

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.289 
right now I mean what we've been home
maybe<00:03:23.950> 16<00:03:24.950> days<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.519> almost<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.820> last<00:03:25.940> three

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
maybe 16 days and almost the last three

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.930 
maybe 16 days and almost the last three
months<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.320> that's<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.860> lot<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.220> time<00:03:28.519> spent

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
months and so that's a lot of time spent

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.860 
months and so that's a lot of time spent
towards<00:03:29.269> your<00:03:29.390> goal
