00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
pretty much what I did and also I added

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.280 
pretty much what I did and also I added
some<00:03:59.060> more<00:03:59.239> rocks<00:03:59.650> around<00:04:00.650> here<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:02.290> built

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
some more rocks around here and built

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.830 
some more rocks around here and built
these<00:04:03.440> bridges<00:04:03.829> here<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:05.360> look<00:04:05.510> kind<00:04:05.690> of

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
these bridges here that look kind of

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.210 
these bridges here that look kind of
weird<00:04:05.959> because<00:04:06.230> they<00:04:06.410> don't<00:04:06.560> have<00:04:06.590> any<00:04:06.769> sports

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
weird because they don't have any sports

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.490 
weird because they don't have any sports
yet<00:04:07.579> I<00:04:07.790> will<00:04:08.000> do<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.299> next<00:04:08.480> episode<00:04:08.930> probably

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.410 
yet I will do that next episode probably
I<00:04:09.739> don't<00:04:10.250> know<00:04:10.370> for<00:04:10.519> sure<00:04:10.549> yet<00:04:10.819> if<00:04:10.910> I'm<00:04:11.180> gonna

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
I don't know for sure yet if I'm gonna

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.660 
I don't know for sure yet if I'm gonna
support<00:04:11.599> them<00:04:12.019> at<00:04:12.230> all<00:04:12.379> because<00:04:12.860> right<00:04:13.250> now<00:04:13.489> it

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
support them at all because right now it

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.160 
support them at all because right now it
looks<00:04:13.700> pretty<00:04:14.060> cool<00:04:14.209> when<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.510> add<00:04:14.720> some<00:04:14.959> more

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
looks pretty cool when I add some more

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.349 
looks pretty cool when I add some more
rocks<00:04:15.470> around<00:04:15.799> here<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.790> won't<00:04:16.910> be<00:04:17.090> able<00:04:17.180> to

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
rocks around here you won't be able to

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.599 
rocks around here you won't be able to
see<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:17.539> floating<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.260> let's<00:04:18.950> see<00:04:19.250> what<00:04:19.370> we<00:04:19.459> do

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
see it floating so let's see what we do

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.909 
see it floating so let's see what we do
there<00:04:19.940> but<00:04:20.750> then<00:04:20.930> these<00:04:21.079> for<00:04:21.289> these<00:04:21.530> bridges

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
there but then these for these bridges

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.980 
there but then these for these bridges
are<00:04:22.190> here<00:04:22.400> so<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.729> people<00:04:22.940> don't<00:04:23.330> need<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.570> go

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
are here so that people don't need to go

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.779 
are here so that people don't need to go
through<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.710> water<00:04:24.949> because<00:04:25.340> I'm<00:04:25.460> not<00:04:25.580> sure

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
through the water because I'm not sure

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.510 
through the water because I'm not sure
if<00:04:26.030> they<00:04:26.210> can<00:04:27.070> because<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.160> think<00:04:28.190> they<00:04:28.460> can

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
if they can because I think they can

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.730 
if they can because I think they can
just<00:04:28.850> get<00:04:29.120> in<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.960> go<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.380> next<00:04:30.560> station

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
just get in and go to the next station

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.730 
just get in and go to the next station
and<00:04:30.979> get<00:04:31.130> out<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:32.139> think<00:04:33.139> you<00:04:33.440> know<00:04:33.560> that's

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
and get out and I think you know that's

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.050 
and get out and I think you know that's
not<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.070> way<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.430> wanted<00:04:34.850> to

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.380 
it's just a patina to fill it with trees
or<00:04:52.350> whatever<00:04:52.440> or<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.340> waterfall<00:04:53.880> it's<00:04:54.090> kinda

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390
