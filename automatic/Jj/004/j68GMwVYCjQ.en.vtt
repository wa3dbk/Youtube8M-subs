what<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.450> really<00:02:37.720> like<00:02:37.840> about<00:02:37.870> using<00:02:38.350> at<00:02:38.470> what

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
what I really like about using at what

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.240 
what I really like about using at what
is<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.910> seems<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.600> make<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.320> blend<00:02:42.040> in

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
is that it seems to make it blend in

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.680 
is that it seems to make it blend in
with<00:02:42.460> my<00:02:42.640> skin<00:02:42.910> butter<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.420> doesn't<00:02:43.600> really

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
with my skin butter so it doesn't really

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:52.059 
with my skin butter so it doesn't really
look<00:02:43.870> like<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.050> wearing<00:02:44.500> makeup

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.489 

so<00:02:52.640> there<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:52.819> have<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.209> on<00:02:53.269> my<00:02:53.450> face<00:02:53.659> the<00:02:54.260> next

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.460 

and<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:40.420> sponge<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:40.870> makes<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:41.140> much

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
and the sponge just makes it so much

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.770 
and the sponge just makes it so much
easier<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.790> blend<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.150> out
