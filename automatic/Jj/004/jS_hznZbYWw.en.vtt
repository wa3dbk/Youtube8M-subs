threads<00:02:56.330> well<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.110> pushes<00:02:57.530> on<00:02:57.680> there<00:02:58.120> then

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
threads well it pushes on there then

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.880

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
on those rolling down the driveway this

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.190 
on those rolling down the driveway this
is<00:03:13.250> ten

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:30.130 

I<00:03:19.200> don't<00:03:19.740> know<00:03:19.800> maybe

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.630 

there's<00:03:30.530> 35

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
there's 35

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:44.080 
there's 35
it<00:03:32.940> could<00:03:33.180> be<00:03:33.300> 35

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.630 

I<00:03:45.520> don't<00:03:46.520> think<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:47.569> is<00:03:47.630> 60

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:04:42.820 

I<00:03:50.670> think<00:03:51.180> this<00:03:51.300> is<00:03:51.450> 60

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.860 

this<00:04:43.009> is<00:04:43.190> definitely<00:04:43.400> not<00:04:43.699> 50<00:04:44.449> miles<00:04:44.659> an<00:04:44.840> hour

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
this is definitely not 50 miles an hour

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.899 
this is definitely not 50 miles an hour
right<00:04:45.259> now

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
right now

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.670 
right now
still<00:04:47.659> not
