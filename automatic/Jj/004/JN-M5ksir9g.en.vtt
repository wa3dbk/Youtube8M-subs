00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.570
 is the end of the video showing the installation 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.930
 of electric glass 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.440
 I'm going to show exactly the placement of this 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.440
 piece 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:27.920
 this part that is the support for the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.750
 set of buttons that during the 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.059
 purchase kit 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:38.480
 he already gives me this piece that as 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.380
 you can see in the other video the 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.000
 which he calls a crank that was 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.710
 replaced by this equipment 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.200
 So how was it made to do the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.200
 placement of this 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.920
 we have here these handles the amount 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.920
 no lining 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.690
 we look in the back 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.690
 Handles they are welded 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.219
 he is burned only from plastic 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.240
 you already have the opportunity to 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:15.170
 to witness is when you have a plastic 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.200
 with the other 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.139
 This is called welding, so you go. 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 do the following back 

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:27.409
 it has two pins and two more are 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.850
 four pins or serve as iron 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.459
 soldering with a knife you're going to cut 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.409
 When you cut this part here she 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:43.840
 loose it gets loose is loose 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:47.509
 done that you are going to put that piece 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.219
 they will need to make four four holes 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.919
 in the door liner to get the 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.909
 screws in my case I put 

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:56.929
 screw 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:02.419
 but it comes in the material ready to be 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:06.590
 hailed in this part also measured the 

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:08.690
 period all serums stuck not in the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.599
 future market with the own iron of only 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:17.040
 you may not be doing with a 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:20.340
 drilling a drill eight millimeters 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.909
 lined the dog holes here how's it going 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.769
 be loose you pull and then it goes 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:34.250
 to fit it right it looks like 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.250
 which is original is very simple 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.019
 So people love this strong tip. 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.019
 Hugs to you
