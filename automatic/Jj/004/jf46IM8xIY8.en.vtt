on down here even though there's a lot
of<00:01:44.420> pedals<00:01:44.840> but<00:01:45.500> there<00:01:45.979> was<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.130> song<00:01:46.430> by<00:01:47.210> The

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
of pedals but there was a song by The

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
of pedals but there was a song by The
Ventures<00:01:47.720> called<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.110> 2,000<00:01:48.860> pound<00:01:49.340> be<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.290> I

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
Ventures called the 2,000 pound be and I

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.459 
Ventures called the 2,000 pound be and I
can<00:01:51.439> hack<00:01:51.680> it<00:01:51.890> up<00:01:51.979> but<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.340> kind<00:01:52.549> of<00:01:52.610> went<00:01:52.760> on

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.170 

like<00:01:59.469> that<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.369> I'm<00:02:00.820> going<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:01.000> use<00:02:01.060> that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
like that so I'm going to use that

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:10.660 
like that so I'm going to use that
here's<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.049> one<00:02:02.229> town<00:02:02.500> be

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:21.150 

ok

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.120 

here's<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> one-time<00:02:22.670> fee<00:02:22.849> again

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.220 

alright<00:02:30.130> i<00:02:30.480> mentioned<00:02:31.480> earlier<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:31.870> this

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
alright i mentioned earlier that this

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.580 
alright i mentioned earlier that this
uses<00:02:32.739> a<00:02:32.920> 309<00:02:34.080> silicon<00:02:36.569> transistor<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:38.290> it's

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
uses a 309 silicon transistor so it's

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.510 
uses a 309 silicon transistor so it's
got<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.520> thicker<00:02:40.360> gain<00:02:40.750> on<00:02:41.020> it<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.410> it's<00:02:42.220> less

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
got a thicker gain on it and it's less

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.420 
got a thicker gain on it and it's less
splatty<00:02:43.030> while<00:02:43.630> i<00:02:43.900> tried<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.319> stick<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
splatty while i tried to stick to a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.930 
splatty while i tried to stick to a
vintage<00:02:46.420> style<00:02:46.870> silicon<00:02:47.800> metal<00:02:48.040> can<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:48.760> had

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
vintage style silicon metal can that had

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.140 
vintage style silicon metal can that had
to<00:02:49.090> splatter<00:02:49.480> your<00:02:49.660> sound<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.860> has<00:02:51.099> a

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
to splatter your sound so this has a

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.240 
to splatter your sound so this has a
deeper<00:02:52.150> low<00:02:52.420> end<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.530> little<00:02:53.800> more<00:02:53.890> girth

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
deeper low end and a little more girth

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.949 
deeper low end and a little more girth
and<00:02:54.519> this<00:02:55.090> seems<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.660> little<00:02:55.870> more

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
and this seems to be a little more

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.540 
and this seems to be a little more
splatty<00:02:56.410> but<00:02:56.680> I'm<00:02:56.739> gonna<00:02:56.860> play<00:02:57.069> that<00:02:57.280> that

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
splatty but I'm gonna play that that

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:24.510 
splatty but I'm gonna play that that
riff<00:02:57.819> again<00:02:58.209> there's<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.989> guitar

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:39.410 

and<00:03:25.290> then<00:03:26.290> same<00:03:26.620> thing<00:03:26.860> with<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.070> seltzer<00:03:27.490> auto

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.520 

hey<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.810> think<00:03:40.870> that's<00:03:41.290> where<00:03:41.470> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
hey and I think that's where the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.530 
hey and I think that's where the
similarities<00:03:42.160> end<00:03:42.160> because<00:03:43.030> on<00:03:43.210> the<00:03:43.330> cell

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
similarities end because on the cell

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:54.040 
similarities end because on the cell
tirado<00:03:44.730> bring<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.850> volume

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.750 

I'm<00:03:55.050> going<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.260> bring<00:03:55.440> up<00:03:55.710> the<00:03:55.920> game<00:03:56.160> on<00:03:56.550> my

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
I'm going to bring up the game on my

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.870 
I'm going to bring up the game on my
pedal<00:03:57.180> and<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.570> move<00:03:57.900> through<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.890> mid<00:03:59.670> range

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
pedal and I move through the mid range

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.240 
pedal and I move through the mid range
filter<00:04:00.210> that's<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.260> difference<00:04:01.470> between<00:04:01.800> the

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
filter that's the difference between the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.250 
filter that's the difference between the
two<00:04:02.430> there's<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.820> versatility<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.900> mid-range

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
two there's a versatility of a mid-range

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
two there's a versatility of a mid-range
filter

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.600 

so<00:04:10.280> I'm<00:04:10.459> going<00:04:10.489> to<00:04:10.640> take<00:04:10.790> this<00:04:11.180> pedal<00:04:11.599> vol.12

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
so I'm going to take this pedal vol.12

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.120 
so I'm going to take this pedal vol.12
gain<00:04:13.610> up<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.790> 12<00:04:14.349> so<00:04:15.349> they're<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.620> same<00:04:15.799> thing

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
gain up to 12 so they're the same thing

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.020 
gain up to 12 so they're the same thing
volume<00:04:16.729> getting<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> same<00:04:17.359> same<00:04:17.930> chord

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
volume getting the same same chord

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.620 
volume getting the same same chord
here's<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.180> one<00:04:20.329> time<00:04:20.600> be<00:04:20.949> everything<00:04:21.949> at<00:04:22.040> 12

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.150 

here's<00:04:26.630> a<00:04:26.720> cell<00:04:26.930> tirado<00:04:27.320> everything<00:04:27.770> at<00:04:27.889> 12

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
here's a cell tirado everything at 12

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.760 
here's a cell tirado everything at 12
again<00:04:28.699> this<00:04:29.270> filter<00:04:29.690> is<00:04:29.720> completely<00:04:30.199> open<00:04:30.380> or

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
again this filter is completely open or

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:41.570 
again this filter is completely open or
out<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:31.789> circuit<00:04:36.789> 110<00:04:37.789> be

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.920 

all<00:04:42.580> right<00:04:42.759> cell<00:04:43.059> Toronto<00:04:43.449> again<00:04:45.809> I'm<00:04:46.809> gonna

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
all right cell Toronto again I'm gonna

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:56.650 
all right cell Toronto again I'm gonna
start<00:04:47.169> turning<00:04:47.529> this<00:04:47.649> filter<00:04:48.069> back

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.900 

so<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.410> hear<00:04:57.650> how<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:57.920> got<00:04:58.070> darker<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.700> mid

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
so you hear how it got darker the mid

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.660 
so you hear how it got darker the mid
smooth<00:04:59.240> out<00:04:59.540> I<00:04:59.810> think<00:05:00.530> by<00:05:00.740> being<00:05:01.280> able<00:05:01.430> to

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
smooth out I think by being able to

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.090 
smooth out I think by being able to
adjust<00:05:02.030> this<00:05:02.240> I<00:05:02.450> can<00:05:02.630> get<00:05:02.780> close<00:05:03.140> to<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.680> 110b

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
adjust this I can get close to the 110b

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:29.570 
adjust this I can get close to the 110b
sound<00:05:04.670> here's<00:05:04.940> my<00:05:05.120> pedal<00:05:05.450> again

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.390 

here's<00:05:30.479> my<00:05:30.720> pedal<00:05:31.139> I've<00:05:31.860> got<00:05:32.039> the<00:05:32.189> midst

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
here's my pedal I've got the midst

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.830 
here's my pedal I've got the midst
filter<00:05:32.789> on

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.220 

now<00:05:40.710> i<00:05:40.740> can<00:05:41.100> open<00:05:41.280> mine<00:05:41.669> all<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.000> way<00:05:42.240> up<00:05:42.480> here

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
now i can open mine all the way up here

00:05:43.230 --> 00:06:02.560 
now i can open mine all the way up here
the<00:05:43.410> difference<00:05:43.560> between<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.580> two

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.939 

so<00:06:03.570> there's<00:06:03.960> a<00:06:04.080> demo<00:06:04.350> between<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:05.160> 110b<00:06:06.000> and

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
so there's a demo between the 110b and

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.949 
so there's a demo between the 110b and
silverado
