00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.569 
guy ever so it's going to be a little
bit<00:00:30.810> difficult<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.769> me<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:31.980> first<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.309> once<00:00:32.460> I

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
bit difficult for me at first but once I

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.310 
bit difficult for me at first but once I
get<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> hang<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.329> should<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:34.290> pretty

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
get the hang of it it should go pretty

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.340 
get the hang of it it should go pretty
quickly<00:00:35.219> hopefully<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.540> mouse<00:00:36.899> keys<00:00:37.140> they're

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
quickly hopefully but mouse keys they're

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
quickly hopefully but mouse keys they're
