instructions<00:01:25.650> again<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.729> i'll<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:26.909> go<00:01:27.540> where

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
instructions again so i'll just go where

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
instructions again so i'll just go where
I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.259> fold<00:01:28.650> these<00:01:28.799> panels<00:01:31.880> fold<00:01:32.880> these

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I think fold these panels fold these

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
I think fold these panels fold these
panels<00:01:33.479> up<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:35.090> wheels<00:01:36.090> fold<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:37.100> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
panels up like that wheels fold in the

panels up like that wheels fold in the
front<00:01:38.340> wheels<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:39.110> like<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:41.600> let<00:01:42.600> me<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.869> let

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
front wheels do like so let me think let

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:54.230 
front wheels do like so let me think let
me<00:01:43.049> think<00:01:43.140> let<00:01:43.320> me<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:46.040> yeah<00:01:53.119> separate<00:01:54.119> this

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
me think let me think yeah separate this

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.999 
me think let me think yeah separate this
panel<00:01:56.689> same<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> other<00:01:57.990> side<00:01:58.140> there<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.890> go

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
panel same on the other side there we go

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.950 
panel same on the other side there we go
then<00:01:59.790> pull<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> legs<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:01.110> with<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> waist

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
then pull the legs down with the waist

then pull the legs down with the waist
sorry<00:02:03.650> yep<00:02:04.070> forward<00:02:04.520> right<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.150> then<00:02:05.810> you

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
sorry yep forward right so then you

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.850 
sorry yep forward right so then you
rotate<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:07.090> next<00:02:08.090> up<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.990> upper<00:02:09.259> fight<00:02:09.530> at

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
rotate the next up the upper fight at

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.030 
rotate the next up the upper fight at
the<00:02:09.950> hip<00:02:10.490> should<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.800> pull<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.920> feet<00:02:13.100> down<00:02:15.040> base

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
the hip should I pull the feet down base

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.770 
the hip should I pull the feet down base
it<00:02:16.220> out<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.520> legs<00:02:16.700> then<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.240> grab<00:02:17.630> this

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
it out the legs then you just grab this

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.240 
it out the legs then you just grab this
front<00:02:18.080> bumper<00:02:18.470> bring<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:18.830> down<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:21.250> that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
front bumper bring it down and that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.949 
front bumper bring it down and that
forms<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.959> part<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:26.770> think<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.920> says<00:02:28.160> to

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
forms that part then I think it says to

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.990 
forms that part then I think it says to
separate<00:02:32.290> these<00:02:33.290> lifts<00:02:34.040> at<00:02:34.220> least<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.910> then

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
separate these lifts at least I and then

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.350 
separate these lifts at least I and then
pull<00:02:35.360> out<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.630> arms<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.800> then<00:02:37.130> fold<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
pull out the arms and then fold in the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.070 
pull out the arms and then fold in the
doors<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.910> lot<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.180> folding<00:02:41.600> on<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.870> one

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
doors it's a lot of folding on this one

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.320 
doors it's a lot of folding on this one
this<00:02:42.290> good<00:02:42.800> fun<00:02:43.310> transformation<00:02:44.030> once<00:02:44.209> you

got used to it then with the arms just

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.020 
got used to it then with the arms just
rotate<00:02:48.980> them<00:02:49.130> round<00:02:49.870> fold<00:02:50.870> up<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.230> panel

want<00:03:35.269> my<00:03:35.329> half<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.780> would<00:03:35.870> probably<00:03:36.110> just<00:03:36.410> be<00:03:36.530> a

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
want my half it would probably just be a

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.979 
want my half it would probably just be a
better<00:03:37.130> read<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.459> being<00:03:38.060> more<00:03:38.180> shiny<00:03:38.570> this<00:03:38.840> is

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
better read it being more shiny this is

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.039 
better read it being more shiny this is
this<00:03:39.320> as<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.950> can<00:03:40.010> see<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.579> a<00:03:40.640> plastic<00:03:41.360> red

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
this as you can see is a plastic red

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.259

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
red plastic bit dull but I'm sure that

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.259 
red plastic bit dull but I'm sure that
it<00:03:48.079> will<00:03:48.230> be<00:03:48.290> bright<00:03:49.280> red<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.820> head<00:03:50.000> mold

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
it will be bright red and the head mold

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.650 
it will be bright red and the head mold
is<00:03:51.079> good<00:03:51.410> for<00:03:51.769> Inferno<00:03:52.070> but<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.910> doesn't<00:03:53.540> quite

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
is good for Inferno but it doesn't quite

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.380 
is good for Inferno but it doesn't quite
have<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.019> look<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.500> g1<00:03:54.890> lot<00:03:55.100> to<00:03:55.340> me<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:55.790> just
