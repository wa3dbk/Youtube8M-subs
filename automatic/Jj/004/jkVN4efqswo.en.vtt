00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 moin moin dear friends and right 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.600
 welcome to a new pc 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.900
 Buy recommendation today for the price of 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.900
 700 euro with a really great galle 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.470
 offer as cpu we have the intel here 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.850
 core i5 45 70 with 4 x 3.2 gigahertz and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 as a turbo boost of 3.6 ghz 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.090
 the new series herschel this is the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.949
 five is as strong as the 46 70 km 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.740
 and is actually the best cpu 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.079
 which you can buy so to gamble 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 as a cooler for the 5 we have here 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.149
 arctic cooling freezer 13 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.280
 the cpu cooler is cool enough for that 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.579
 cpu because you do not overclock this synonymous 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.989
 It can and will be more pleasant 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 operating temperature also hold very well 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.090
 and the cooler is also very much 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.190
 quiet and easy to install 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.719
 as mainboard that it rocca 87 m per 4 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.870
 the mainboard has everything you need 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.470
 needs four memory slots 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.080
 pci express 3.0 and a 2.0 being the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.650
 2.0 you could not think here anymore 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.750
 use 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 because the graphics card although you have to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.860
 perhaps so as to fit the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.799
 graphics card is a 3 slot graphics card 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.810
 that actually fits as far as everything 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.930
 7.1 sound card and four usb-3 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.990
 0 connections and 220 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.020
 as a normal memory 8 gb 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.200
 ddr3 1333 megahertz count new tool 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.630
 kit cheaper memory runs but 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.360
 and 8 gb should be for the next few years 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.799
 still enough for gambling 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.140
 Let's get to the graphics card that's him 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.119
 really really cool price performance 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.399
 we had just had a relationship 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:50.570
 here the asus radeon hd 79 70 direct co2 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:53.790
 with 3GB of video storage and one 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.240
 gpu clock of 1000 megahertz the 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.329
 graphics card comes to the gtx 770 grams 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.280
 But it costs only 250 euros and is very 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.920
 very quiet thanks to the cooler of asus den 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.509
 we have on it and consumed 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 actually about as much as that 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.430
 gtx 77 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.680
 and for 250 euros really a very cool 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.950
 offer and that's what you get 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.330
 you three games can pick it 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 and there are those 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.040
 games like now crysis 3 bioshock 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.780
 infinite or just far cry 3 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.100
 as hard disk we have the 1000 here 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.980
 gb seagate desktop hdd or just seagate 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.840
 barracuda as you would like with 7200 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.020
 turns very very fast hdd and 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.200
 for 51 euros also price performance 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.410
 technically top as a power supply a very 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.630
 quiet 500 watt peak power l8 without that 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.220
 cable management 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.230
 I think that at such low 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.160
 wattzahlen not a cable management 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.780
 it is always essential to get there 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.410
 actually most cables too 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.870
 used 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.070
 and then if only one or two somewhere 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.160
 lying around and you can actually 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.959
 always hide well with the cable tie 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.180
 and so I think now the time 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.340
 without cable management it is not that bad 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.680
 the power supply is very very quiet 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.730
 actually inaudible in the housing and for 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.440
 43 53 eur 500 watt offers be quite here 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.750
 also really a very good price 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.010
 performance ratio as housing times 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.540
 again just a matter of taste you can 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.570
 then of course take each other 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.660
 the cool master song 430 black with the 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.850
 red fan on the front of the housing 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.519
 had side window is relatively small 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.730
 but everything fits in and should 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.860
 accordingly be very space-saving 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.070
 and I think for 31 euros you can 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.290
 Again, do not complain all then 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.330
 we come to the final price here we are 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.989
 arrived at 6 706 euros 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.459
 with the i5 the 79 70 from asus and 8 gb 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.420
 R.A.M 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.940
 as I said the housing is 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.620
 matter of taste and I think for 706 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.160
 We have a really great deal here 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.400
 very very cool gamer calculator to the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.070
 graphics performance of gtx 77 rankommt and 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.410
 I really do not understand 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.640
 and yes friends so perhaps you 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.169
 noticed that here is the drive 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.070
 let out that was just the 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.270
 very simple reason 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.130
 since I used windows with the usb stick 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.690
 Can install and most games 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.660
 the way you got over steam 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.979
 downloads or the like 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.750
 that means today is a run 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.740
 a drive is not necessarily 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.720
 always needed 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.580
 of course you can do that if 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.140
 you want to have one for now 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.750
 15 euros to pack yet 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.630
 but I think so too for 706 europas 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.310
 so yes it would be right now 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.720
 Just tell me 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.400
 times criticism or any other 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.380
 notes in the comments 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.150
 Let me know what you think of me 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.380
 want to see next and otherwise 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.539
 just have a look on a canal 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.690
 past because there are still lots of 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.580
 other buying recommendations and love 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.000
 friends then it would be that now 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.419
 Well 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.419
 pure skin
