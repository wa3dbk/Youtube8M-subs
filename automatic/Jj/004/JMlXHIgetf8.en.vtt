get me drawing and just to get something
down<00:00:18.800> all<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.859> set<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.580> do<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.240> draw

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
down all I set out to do is to draw

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.259 
down all I set out to do is to draw
something<00:00:21.869> off<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.350> top<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.590> my<00:00:22.740> head<00:00:23.180> using<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
something off the top of my head using a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.960 
something off the top of my head using a
felt<00:00:24.539> tip<00:00:24.630> marker<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.890> i<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.189> actually

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
felt tip marker so that i can actually

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.460 
felt tip marker so that i can actually
erase<00:00:27.539> any<00:00:27.869> lines<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.910> can

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
erase any lines and so that you can

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.410 
erase any lines and so that you can
actually<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.189> lines<00:00:32.399> i'm<00:00:32.669> drawing<00:00:33.210> much

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
better on camera i gotta say i didn't

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.630 
better on camera i gotta say i didn't
really<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.140> much<00:00:37.170> planned<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.399> was

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
really have much planned for what I was

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.780 
really have much planned for what I was
drawing<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.420> wanted<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> draw<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.110> bigger

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
drawing I just wanted to draw a bigger

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.869 
drawing I just wanted to draw a bigger
at<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.969> moment<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.540> heavily<00:00:43.110> into<00:00:43.789> trying<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
at the moment I'm heavily into trying to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.260 
at the moment I'm heavily into trying to
draw<00:00:45.620> science<00:00:46.620> fiction<00:00:46.829> type<00:00:47.430> themes<00:00:47.940> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
draw science fiction type themes and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.560 
draw science fiction type themes and
stuff<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.870> that's<00:00:49.079> why

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
stuff so that's why

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.880 
stuff so that's why
to<00:00:49.750> do<00:00:50.260> here<00:00:50.680> and<00:00:51.579> as<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.060> can<00:00:52.270> see<00:00:52.739> come<00:00:53.739> up

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
to do here and as you can see come up

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.150 
to do here and as you can see come up
with<00:00:54.130> is<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.280> figure<00:00:54.790> of<00:00:54.940> some<00:00:55.360> kind<00:00:55.660> of

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
with is a figure of some kind of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.150 
with is a figure of some kind of
absolute<00:00:57.160> bounty<00:00:57.610> hunter<00:00:58.059> or<00:00:58.360> I<00:00:58.739> may<00:00:59.739> be<00:00:59.800> some

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
absolute bounty hunter or I may be some

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.490 
absolute bounty hunter or I may be some
sort<00:01:00.670> of<00:01:00.790> gun-slinging<00:01:01.090> type<00:01:01.980> character<00:01:02.980> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
sort of gun-slinging type character and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.530 
sort of gun-slinging type character and
using<00:01:05.500> some<00:01:05.890> kind<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:06.400> really<00:01:06.820> awkward<00:01:07.240> pose

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
using some kind of really awkward pose

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.780 
using some kind of really awkward pose
partly<00:01:08.470> because<00:01:08.680> that's<00:01:09.160> just<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.520> way<00:01:09.729> no

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
partly because that's just the way no

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.999 
partly because that's just the way no
lines<00:01:10.180> went<00:01:10.570> down<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:11.080> also<00:01:11.380> time<00:01:11.619> for<00:01:11.650> the

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
lines went down and also time for the

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.570 
lines went down and also time for the
best<00:01:12.660> but<00:01:13.660> also<00:01:14.050> out<00:01:14.500> like<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.860> cutaway<00:01:15.280> view

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
best but also out like the cutaway view

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.650 
best but also out like the cutaway view
and<00:01:15.790> interesting<00:01:16.450> pose<00:01:16.780> rather<00:01:17.350> than<00:01:17.560> just

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
and interesting pose rather than just

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.410 
and interesting pose rather than just
guys<00:01:19.660> standing<00:01:20.380> straight<00:01:21.130> up<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:21.490> down<00:01:21.520> not

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
guys standing straight up and down not

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.560 
guys standing straight up and down not
doing<00:01:22.720> much<00:01:22.899> of<00:01:22.960> anything<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.759> also<00:01:24.940> notice<00:01:25.450> I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
doing much of anything you also notice I

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.749 
doing much of anything you also notice I
didn't<00:01:25.840> give<00:01:25.960> him<00:01:26.080> much<00:01:26.110> more<00:01:26.289> faces<00:01:27.190> wearing

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
didn't give him much more faces wearing

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.910 
didn't give him much more faces wearing
more<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.180> helmet<00:01:28.660> kind<00:01:29.259> of<00:01:29.470> thing<00:01:29.710> and

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
more of a helmet kind of thing and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.460 
more of a helmet kind of thing and
sketch<00:01:30.490> that's<00:01:31.240> again<00:01:31.600> partly<00:01:32.110> because<00:01:32.229> of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
sketch that's again partly because of

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.290 
sketch that's again partly because of
the<00:01:32.649> way<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.979> lines<00:01:33.220> sort<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.789> went<00:01:34.000> down

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
the way the lines sort of went down

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.020 
the way the lines sort of went down
because<00:01:34.890> when<00:01:35.890> I<00:01:35.920> was<00:01:36.100> drawing<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.580> gun<00:01:36.820> it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
because when I was drawing the gun it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.560 
because when I was drawing the gun it
sort<00:01:37.300> of<00:01:37.390> ended<00:01:37.930> up<00:01:38.020> inside<00:01:38.440> of<00:01:38.500> those<00:01:38.740> at<00:01:39.130> once

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
sort of ended up inside of those at once

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.980 
sort of ended up inside of those at once
and<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.899> couldn't<00:01:41.140> kinda<00:01:41.710> work<00:01:42.399> out<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:43.000> decent

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
and I couldn't kinda work out a decent

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.290 
and I couldn't kinda work out a decent
facebook<00:01:44.800> so<00:01:45.280> that's<00:01:46.270> why<00:01:46.509> he<00:01:46.570> doesn't

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.090 

so<00:01:50.300> that's<00:01:50.480> my<00:01:50.660> quick<00:01:50.930> sketch<00:01:51.320> until<00:01:51.860> next

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
so that's my quick sketch until next

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.780 
so that's my quick sketch until next
time<00:01:52.250> we<00:01:52.730> shall<00:01:52.970> see<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.540> later
