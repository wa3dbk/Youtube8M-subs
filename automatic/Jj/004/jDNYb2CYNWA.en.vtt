00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 so good day to all with you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.859
 again on the autumn mouse with the next 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.750
 little sleep bout what I 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.750
 so liked drawing and period 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.210
 u in this style like i used 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.609
 local colors that I decided to repeat and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.039
 same thing just by choosing 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.830
 completely different character this time 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.710
 I decided to take Frankie from the monster school 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.160
 matte why exactly franky 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 well this question is actually difficult 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.899
 answer though i have a guess 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.940
 why did I still make such a choice 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.040
 if anyone follows my public skills 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.550
 or even for subscribed to my page 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 on waka 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.579
 but surely knows that not so long ago I 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.670
 I got a fake on monster high 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.910
 Chinese is slightly shorter with very bad 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.860
 body but very pretty face so 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.320
 Here is an assumption that this is a fake 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.250
 most likely is a fake exactly 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.969
 under franky 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.079
 That's probably why I decided 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.140
 take exactly and try to draw 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.600
 franky what again did i use 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.360
 I didn't draw completely local colors 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.909
 no those no smooth transitions here 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.850
 just one color and generally played with 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.740
 lines and everything in general process me 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.799
 delivered a very large number 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.509
 pleasure because i liked 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.250
 this style and i think i will 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.460
 enjoy later pretty 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.829
 often what I did and Frank again 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.619
 practically no fig so in 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.659
 On the Internet, I tried to find suitable ones. 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.119
 pictures to be inspired but 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.450
 again as their happens before and a bunch 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.909
 fan arts a bunch of a bunch of pictures of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.579
 which figs you will understand which is more or less 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.890
 like the original sown on the soul 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.780
 original doll what if you just 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.869
 chose some photo which is me 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.990
 seemed less likeable and 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.390
 decided to use her for inspiration 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.270
 so here I basically painted frankie 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.240
 I again such and did not want to do Frankie 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.550
 exactly as it goes everything went to those 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.860
 same puppet 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.869
 releases so I decided again 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.700
 come up with some new hairstyle 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.920
 maybe in some of the dolls 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.440
 series she's exactly like that I just donâ€™t 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.970
 very next such matters I still 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.170
 suddenly decided to try with me 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.530
 finally got to do something 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.160
 original what fans and never 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.560
 did not see 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.330
 so here and so was born 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.890
 the very miracle that you are now 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.770
 watching on the screen what was fun 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.860
 I again used only three layers 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.170
 or 4 seems to create it all 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.970
 masterpiece that is, and the bottom layer and then y 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.209
 I have here the gray background that I 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.480
 I fill the second layer with a uniform color 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.000
 me it goes neck on my frankie but also 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.190
 the third layer is the head hair the face and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 general in general head with all her 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.520
 attributes 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.340
 Well, on the fourth layer, I think then 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.070
 subsequently put a little workout 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.360
 airbrush im well it 's basically now 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.980
 see for yourself soon 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.410
 I have the original video process 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.140
 more precisely this process of drawing from me 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.540
 took somewhere there forty minutes what in 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.840
 Basically nice I basically the same with the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.000
 so fast and draw so i'm for 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.640
 you sped him up in nine 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.450
 small and it turned out that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.580
 It turned out strangely enough I these tails 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.220
 when I threw a hair and in general I 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.959
 I throw so fast for a freebie 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.970
 then when it became to draw 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.950
 I realized that I very well sketched them 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.420
 from virtually nothing changed only 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.880
 as if adding were 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.110
 make more detailed adding in general 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.890
 hairs that stick out in different 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.570
 sides of the neck I decided to decorate and 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.060
 incomprehensible developing scarf and here 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.040
 some hint of a blouse on my shoulder and i 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.319
 decided to do something like sewn 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.620
 tattoos 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.489
 heart but probably it is not very clear 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.629
 what a closet. 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.590
 for me it did not work out very well therefore 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.239
 having worked from the place at the bottom and realized that 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.760
 she doesn't look good and decided 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.799
 cover up this squat scarf at all in 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.479
 principle and everything i did over franky 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:19.099
 Further, my corporate background for lazy 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.470
 small airbrush toning them like me 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.400
 already and said, and that's what I have 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.970
 happened 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.530
 fuck matte from on the wall the mouse can still 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.750
 just look at the picture 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.970
 I hope you enjoyed my process 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.039
 work and hope that I inspired you 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.199
 so march to draw and don't forget 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:40.690
 brag about your drawings to everyone 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.690
 creative day and bye bye
