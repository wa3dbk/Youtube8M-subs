00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.110
 once in the booster collection again 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.650
 recounted 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.590

 these are so so many that I have 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.450
 some would ask the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.590
 I'll have protective films someday 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.590

 posters for the federal assembly 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.770

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.530

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.140
 Once I have looked at it in so 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.500
 an old copy paper carton 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.149
 assumption that he used photocopier paper in it 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.090
 now this is labeled booster 0 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.580

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.470
 I'll be eight more in and two in 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.630
 a new carton, however, is that 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.760
 me something yes that is something stupid in 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.200
 this carton 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.909
 they can slip and so you can 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.670
 See that I'm on the air here 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.070
 and if you have an idea where I have the idea 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 booster always best 50 anyway 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.390
 or 100 or 150 booster or what 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.030
 together somehow perfect in one 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.290
 get carton or in a one 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.159
 packaging is there for extra 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.590
 packagings 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.790

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.840
 did not find it 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.729
 and if you know how I somehow 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.080
 could store perfectly then you can me 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.450
 Write that once in the comments 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.090
 the idea otherwise I do that 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.890
 first so on 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.869

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.650

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:04.220

 see different six pieces now 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:16.819
 First of all, it is relatively similar 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.079
 but if you turn around such 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.630
 promo poster here is no barcode on it 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.640
 over the 3 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.500
 because here is a barcode on it 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.240
 You could just buy it in the kiosk this way 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.120
 here and these were here at the 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.320
 blisters or at the wallet 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.450

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.590

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.540

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.020

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.470

 i think of disney and they existed 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.510
 Last tree to the kiosk I thought 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:23.220

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:26.640

 and then it's the Ice Queen 7 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.400
 she comes to the others as queens 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.190

 still slamet extra mill 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.670
 that would have to text too long for the others 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.480
 where are they on this page? 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.030

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.650

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.680
 comments what a carton 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.440
