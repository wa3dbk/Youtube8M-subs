00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.670
 manaudou chapel the foundation is going 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.450
 get rich with a new truck 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.610
 explain to me a little bit what we 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.359
 let's go make this truck is this 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.119
 truck continues the history of the truck 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.970
 french in the spirit in which paul 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.820
 Bernier created the foundation ago 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.240
 now 31 years old and must capitalize 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.820
 on know-how and it is in this 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.550
 mind that we accept well 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:42.120
 obviously this vehicle of which we have 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:44.430
 the number 1 which dates back to 1990 23 years 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.879
 for a vehicle 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.559
 so we are in a star who 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.270
 continue it's a whole slice break 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.510
 of history me when I was named 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.010
 commercial director in 83 years by a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.730
 moonless night I was introduced to the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.430
 first model of the magnum and then there 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.640
 it was a little surprised afterwards towards 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.369
 program has developed and in 85 we have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.480
 almost gave up because it was 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.560
 a little bit out of time 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.400
 too expensive too and finally I got the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.830
 joy of being able to launch it in 1990 here 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.510
 even at bourque for a month and a half 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.780
 with 200 customers a day 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.400
 and then we created the event we had 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.840
 had all the Germans who said this is 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.160
 not possible it is not we who have it 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.810
 did the flat floor et cetera he had 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.850
 he had little notes of our 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.220
 German competitor 10 years that everything 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.530
 who did not go and finally ben that was 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.560
 marked the spirits and 23 years of life is 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.400
 beautiful adventure this magnum had been 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.090
 announced by the berliet centaur in 1978 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.050
 and these corresponded to the concern of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.860
 paul berliet of the comfort of safety 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.550
 of the user and the concern of the men 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.190
 together 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.010
 sir chabert you acquired the 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.910
 last magnum what did you 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.920
 brought to make this acquisition 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.660
 it's them it's a whole series of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 vehicles we had already ordered 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.550
 and I did not know that I was the last 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.100
 to take in the last pure chance 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.520
 pure chance so you have a stable 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.580
 which is made up of a lot of our senses 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.550
 for his 50th vehicle what do you 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.450
 only carry sea ​​containers 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.209
 for you it's a truck like 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.100
 others of course the games at us the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.210
 problem it's 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.210
 they sell more they come back 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.700
 it's a magnum retirement 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.500
 but it's also a new start with 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.239
 the lake tea is just from elsewhere 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.560
 new products the novelty is 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.360
 actually somewhere a little bit 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.950
 fusion of magnum and premium ie 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.629
 we kept all the comfort and 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.480
 the habitability of the magnum that is 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.430
 still there again improved and then we have 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.049
 kept the premium efficiency of which one 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.209
 knows he's totally recognized for 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.799
 its consumption and so it's good 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.879
 alliance of the two with 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.230
 improvement that is to say that the 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.060
 new consumer is a lot 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.079
 better than the premium and comfort of the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.459
 new is much better than the 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.470
 magnum again so you see it's 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.120
 it's both inheritance and then 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.120
 progress that's the new range
