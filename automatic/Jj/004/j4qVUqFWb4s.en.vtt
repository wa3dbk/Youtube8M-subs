sucks so the soulstone mechanics have
changed<00:01:03.760> quite<00:01:03.820> a<00:01:03.969> bit<00:01:04.710> now<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:06.520> can't<00:01:06.820> use<00:01:07.030> it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
to pump the numbers to the point where a

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.499 
to pump the numbers to the point where a
basic<00:01:09.160> minion<00:01:09.490> can't<00:01:09.789> get<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.119> so<00:01:10.300> now<00:01:10.420> you

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
basic minion can't get it so now you

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.320 
basic minion can't get it so now you
just<00:01:10.660> use<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.259> get<00:01:11.350> extra<00:01:11.649> flips<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:13.119> flip

but<00:04:36.770> literally<00:04:37.340> with<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.640> gremlins<00:04:38.000> I<00:04:38.210> am<00:04:38.419> not

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
but literally with the gremlins I am not

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.450 
but literally with the gremlins I am not
really<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.200> familiar<00:04:39.410> with<00:04:39.800> them<00:04:39.950> so<00:04:40.280> there

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
really that familiar with them so there

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.640 
really that familiar with them so there
is<00:04:40.490> lots<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.150> new<00:04:41.240> stuff<00:04:41.300> in<00:04:41.660> there<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.530> one

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
is lots of new stuff in there the one

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.990 
is lots of new stuff in there the one
thing<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:42.860> I<00:04:42.980> thought<00:04:43.220> was<00:04:43.370> interesting<00:04:43.550> is

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
thing that I thought was interesting is

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.050 
thing that I thought was interesting is
that<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.390> moon<00:04:44.660> shinobi<00:04:45.310> guys<00:04:46.310> they<00:04:46.580> actually

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
that the moon shinobi guys they actually

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.000 
that the moon shinobi guys they actually
they're<00:04:47.419> positive<00:04:47.990> flips<00:04:48.230> become<00:04:48.560> negative

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
they're positive flips become negative

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.920 
they're positive flips become negative
flips<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.400> there-<00:04:49.550> flips<00:04:50.060> become<00:04:50.390> positive

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
flips and there- flips become positive

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.260 
flips and there- flips become positive
flips<00:04:51.200> so<00:04:51.770> it's<00:04:52.130> very<00:04:52.400> cool<00:04:52.580> if<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:52.910> want<00:04:53.120> to

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
flips so it's very cool if you want to

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.810 
flips so it's very cool if you want to
make<00:04:53.810> one<00:04:53.990> miss<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.860> have<00:04:55.040> to<00:04:55.220> buffum<00:04:55.550> and

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
make one miss you have to buffum and

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.150 
make one miss you have to buffum and
then<00:04:56.360> 10<00:04:56.720> thunders<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.110> yet<00:04:57.620> again<00:04:57.740> something

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
then 10 thunders is yet again something

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.630 
then 10 thunders is yet again something
that<00:04:58.430> I'm<00:04:58.640> not<00:04:58.669> overly<00:04:59.330> familiar<00:04:59.600> with<00:05:00.490> but<00:05:01.490> it

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
that I'm not overly familiar with but it

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.130 
that I'm not overly familiar with but it
looks<00:05:01.820> like<00:05:01.970> most<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.300> their<00:05:02.450> stuff<00:05:02.750> because

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
looks like most of their stuff because

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.580 
looks like most of their stuff because
it's<00:05:03.169> so<00:05:03.440> new<00:05:03.650> is<00:05:03.890> all<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:05.720> same<00:05:05.930> they<00:05:06.260> do<00:05:06.320> have

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590
