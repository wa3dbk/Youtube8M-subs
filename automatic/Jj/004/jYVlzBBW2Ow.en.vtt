this I don't know it's you know NXT
looks<00:00:36.420> very<00:00:36.660> promising<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.649> again<00:00:38.010> who<00:00:38.579> is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
looks very promising but again who is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
looks very promising but again who is
going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.480> added<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.170> main<00:00:40.530> events

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
going to be added to the main events

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.979 
going to be added to the main events
that's<00:00:41.520> why<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.149> said<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.750> that's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that's why I like I said I think that's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
that's why I like I said I think that's
the<00:00:43.140> reason<00:00:43.530> why<00:00:43.559> Kevin<00:00:44.190> Owens<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.610> really

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the reason why Kevin Owens is really

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.619 
the reason why Kevin Owens is really
getting<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.730> push<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.969> he's<00:00:48.120> getting<00:00:48.329> right

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
getting the push that he's getting right

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.740 
getting the push that he's getting right
now<00:00:48.840> because<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:50.100> really<00:00:50.610> dot<00:00:50.910> make<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.510> list

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
now because you really dot make the list

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.430 
now because you really dot make the list
of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> top<00:00:52.440> heels<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.280> WWE<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.539> would<00:00:55.260> never

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
of the top heels in WWE and would never

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.799 
of the top heels in WWE and would never
think<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.949> years<00:00:56.430> ago<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:57.000> Kevin<00:00:57.210> would<00:00:57.600> be

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
think that years ago that Kevin would be

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.830 
think that years ago that Kevin would be
one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.829> those<00:00:59.010> guys<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.370> just<00:01:00.210> by<00:01:00.390> necessity
