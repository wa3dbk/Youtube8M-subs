00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.230 
good chance of not working up because
it's<00:02:38.770> got<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.070> grow<00:02:39.310> both<00:02:39.630> roots<00:02:40.630> and

production<00:02:46.240> or<00:02:46.360> ripening<00:02:46.870> process<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:49.170> you

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
production or ripening process and you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.570 
production or ripening process and you
can<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.530> don't<00:02:50.710> know<00:02:50.740> if<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.070> see<00:02:51.280> or<00:02:51.430> not

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
can I don't know if you can see or not

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.490 
can I don't know if you can see or not
see<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.000> little<00:02:52.360> bitty<00:02:52.540> strings<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.410> are

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
see the little bitty strings that are

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.770 
see the little bitty strings that are
hanging<00:02:53.770> out<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.100> here<00:02:54.610> I'm<00:02:55.060> hoping<00:02:55.600> these

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
hanging out on here I'm hoping these

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.770 
hanging out on here I'm hoping these
will<00:02:56.020> look<00:02:56.170> up<00:02:56.380> water<00:02:56.650> look<00:02:56.980> like<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.670> hair<00:02:58.270> or

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
will look up water look like a hair or

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.610 
will look up water look like a hair or
like<00:02:59.020> roots<00:02:59.380> and<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:01.810> we<00:03:01.960> can<00:03:02.110> do<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.410> wait<00:03:02.560> a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
like roots and all we can do is wait a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.200 
like roots and all we can do is wait a
couple<00:03:02.830> weeks<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.550> keep<00:03:03.880> an<00:03:04.000> eye<00:03:04.240> on<00:03:04.270> this<00:03:04.720> and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
couple weeks and keep an eye on this and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.150 
couple weeks and keep an eye on this and
if<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.390> look<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:07.840> plant<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.470> see<00:03:08.920> this

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
if you look on this plant to see this

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.520 
if you look on this plant to see this
stem<00:03:09.490> right<00:03:09.700> here<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.300> this<00:03:10.750> stem<00:03:11.050> right<00:03:11.200> here

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.310 
stem right here and this stem right here
this<00:03:12.130> was<00:03:12.430> possibly<00:03:12.910> two<00:03:13.270> more<00:03:13.480> flowers<00:03:14.050> that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
this was possibly two more flowers that

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.400 
this was possibly two more flowers that
may<00:03:14.530> have<00:03:14.710> been<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.130> male<00:03:15.490> flowers<00:03:16.150> but<00:03:17.140> I've

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
may have been the male flowers but I've

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.980 
may have been the male flowers but I've
read<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:18.070> actually<00:03:18.460> need<00:03:18.700> another<00:03:18.730> vine<00:03:19.420> for

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
read you actually need another vine for

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.930 
read you actually need another vine for
the<00:03:20.880> pollen<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.060> go<00:03:22.240> on<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:23.080> produce<00:03:23.590> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
the pollen to go on and produce the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.400 
the pollen to go on and produce the
fruit<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:26.190> these<00:03:27.190> were<00:03:27.400> just<00:03:27.430> two<00:03:28.410> flowers

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
fruit so these were just two flowers

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.510 
fruit so these were just two flowers
that<00:03:29.650> didn't<00:03:29.980> make<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:31.050> fruit<00:03:32.050> for<00:03:32.350> me<00:03:32.520> I'm

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
that didn't make it to fruit for me I'm

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:45.080 
that didn't make it to fruit for me I'm
going<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.910> take<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.450> stick<00:03:34.750> out<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.140> hole

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.970 

and<00:03:45.599> put<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.110> down<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.560> ground<00:03:48.980> bring

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
and put this down to the ground bring

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.500 
and put this down to the ground bring
the<00:03:50.130> dirt<00:03:50.340> are<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.730> getting<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.239> need<00:03:51.420> to

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
the dirt are you getting it you need to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:08.690 
the dirt are you getting it you need to
get<00:03:51.780> up<00:03:51.900> closer<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.530> see<00:03:52.890> what<00:03:53.099> I'm<00:03:53.190> doing<00:04:07.700> and

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
get up closer to see what I'm doing and

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.110 
get up closer to see what I'm doing and
their<00:04:09.180> fruit<00:04:09.420> itself<00:04:10.519> we're<00:04:11.519> just<00:04:11.730> gonna<00:04:11.849> keep

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
their fruit itself we're just gonna keep

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.909 
their fruit itself we're just gonna keep
out<00:04:12.300> of<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.540> Sun<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:13.730> um<00:04:15.380> continues<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.680> ripen

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
out of the Sun and um continues to ripen

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.360 
out of the Sun and um continues to ripen
and<00:04:17.310> grow<00:04:18.019> it<00:04:19.019> gets<00:04:19.350> kind<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.709> hard<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.010> keep

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
and grow it gets kind of hard to keep

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.830 
and grow it gets kind of hard to keep
going<00:04:20.609> up<00:04:20.820> there<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.209> hoping<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.720> the

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
going up there and hoping that the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.680 
going up there and hoping that the
fruits<00:04:22.139> still<00:04:22.620> there<00:04:22.860> we've<00:04:23.250> seen<00:04:23.580> plenty<00:04:24.479> of

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
fruits still there we've seen plenty of

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.510 
fruits still there we've seen plenty of
other<00:04:24.810> fruits<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.410> have<00:04:25.950> came<00:04:26.220> and

other fruits that have came and
disappeared<00:04:27.419> there's<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.290> groundhog<00:04:28.770> that's

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
disappeared there's a groundhog that's

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.879 
disappeared there's a groundhog that's
active<00:04:29.550> up<00:04:29.700> there<00:04:29.940> in<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.150> area<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:31.200> he's

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
active up there in the area and he's

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.300 
active up there in the area and he's
more<00:04:32.340> than<00:04:32.520> likely<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:33.030> one<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.960> took<00:04:34.500> all

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
more than likely the one that took all

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.420 
more than likely the one that took all
the<00:04:35.490> fruits<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:35.970> we've<00:04:36.330> found<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:36.720> far<00:04:37.430> I'm

gonna set him in there to keep the

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.810 
gonna set him in there to keep the
weight<00:04:40.320> off<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.710> branch<00:04:43.010> if<00:04:44.010> anyone<00:04:44.490> knows
