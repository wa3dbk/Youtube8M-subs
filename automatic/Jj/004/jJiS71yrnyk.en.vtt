00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello selig gold your dance teacher 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.859
 in this video we offer 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.269
 with anna the step of rock boat in 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.269
 four times it's gone 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.960
 the interest of rock in four times is 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.060
 to dance to rhythms with 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.310
 rather slow tempos so you'll have 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.450
 a music that is not too fast 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.900
 pretty catchy music but not too much 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.029
 quick 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.059
 the rock in four beats will be quite 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.640
 adapted first rule of this style of 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.180
 rock is the positioning of the weight of the 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.470
 body and the alternation of supports we will 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.570
 try to score well every step is 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.480
 so to transfer his body weight 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.050
 this is the first rule the dance of 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.880
 couple always went from one foot to 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.149
 another then I make you one 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.540
 easy and if just to know on which 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.350
 foot dance so that we go well and 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.200
 well another one then to continue on 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.300
 will try to step back 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 both of them the dancer is watching 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.330
 move back the left foot the dance is 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.160
 chose to move back the right foot 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.500
 we show you that my left foot is going 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.020
 leave behind the dancer from right 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.710
 and we put one foot behind and one foot 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.420
 in front of a step and a front 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.180
 try to transfer his weight well 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.650
 body from one foot to another like this 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.320
 what we did to them would not be on their side 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.290
 we try to score well back 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.439
 this movement is reminiscent of a ball in c 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.110
 -b in English swinging it is said or 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.100
 swing where you are already at the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.310
 half of rock'n'roll 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.520
 so now just handsets get 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.869
 swing with the starting step and we 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.670
 shows you that at the feet 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:03.049
 we will have behind and in front and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.600
 side the sides and behind and in front and 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.640
 side is side we try to leave well 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.850
 both sets back and well 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.840
 lay on the spot behind and in front and 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.739
 side is side we will put accounts 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.310
 when we go back 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:23.420
 it will be 1 and 2 back on the spot 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.109
 3 and 4 years stabilizes and 1 and 2 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.480
 every time we go back 1 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.709
 2 etc. 3 and 4 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.810
 the idea is to be together 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.700
 with your partner to ask all 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.470
 two our customers are back and 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.519
 together two sides to create a 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.349
 harmony in your dancing couple and and 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.269
 2 3 and 4 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.860
 I advise you to learn how to 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.900
 to consider in talent and in 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.360
 mastering what you do with the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.519
 feet to control the speed of you 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.150
 tap related to what we hear on 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.640
 the music 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.560
 3 4 and 1 2 and 3 and 4 the principle of 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.440
 couple dancing and trying to 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.730
 dissociate between the up and down the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.379
 upper body will be the part 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.109
 communicative that allows us to 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.450
 forward our information down the 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.650
 rhythmic part the part of the action 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.660
 feet 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.970
 all this dissociation is going to you 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.140
 to communicate and dance in 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.750
 keeping a harmony with your 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.670
 partner in this movement not basic 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.560
 of rock in four times you have this 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.599
 first dissociation at the level of the 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.489
 hand the idea is that if you want to be 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.290
 together with your partner and 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.359
 back both at the same time 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.120
 will have to for the dancer try to 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.769
 push back while going back 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.400
 that is, I reject the 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.169
 partner and have moved back 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.269
 I'm going to push back my partner and have 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.650
 not far back 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.139
 I will try to push my 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.780
 partner just before moving back my 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.680
 support links on the and before the 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.579
 a delirium and we give our information 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:04.930
 is then back 1 2 3 4 I 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:10.609
 regrowth and 3.4 inches 2 3 4 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:15.680
 kilometers from a set 3 4 and 2 3 4 and 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:17.690
 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 3 and 4 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.940
 let's talk about the defects of 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.220
 things you have to try to avoid 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.870
 first thing is when you step back 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.849
 your your support 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.470
 it is not to ask your support 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:31.449
 thoroughly, ie to make a support 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:35.580
 partial on you shows it gives this 1 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:39.120
 1 but mark 1 and 2 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.800
 3 and the 4 and the 1 and the 2 and the 3 and the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.990
 4 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.610
 the other fault is to make a big 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.979
 not when we step back and find each other 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.000
 with the arms relaxed and far away one of 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.219
 the other and 1 2 3 4 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.189
 yes we are very far it is not very very 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:59.400
 comfortable to dance while if we 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:03.000
 reduce the step that we only go back 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.680
 foot and not the shoulder and we have some 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.780
 something that will be much more pleasant to 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.849
 dance so in summary communication of 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.669
 the hand mark well supports them a 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.430
 after another and in years back 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:22.680
 without taking a big step here is the step of 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:25.319
 rock base in four times you do not have 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.150
 more than you train press release 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.919
 trying to do is not to have 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.599
 a harmony in your dancing couple 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.139
 then have fun 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.139
 and see you soon
