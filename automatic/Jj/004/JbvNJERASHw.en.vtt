00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
but think about this for a second again

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.910

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.310 
the whole purpose of the United States
of<00:04:23.040> America<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.640> can't<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.180> your<00:04:24.840> idea

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
of America is you can't have your idea

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.080 
of America is you can't have your idea
of<00:04:25.380> God<00:04:25.800> or<00:04:25.980> your<00:04:26.130> religion<00:04:26.550> influenced<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
of God or your religion influenced the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.600 
of God or your religion influenced the
laws<00:04:27.240> right<00:04:27.630> so<00:04:28.380> just<00:04:28.560> imagine<00:04:28.800> for<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.220> second

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
laws right so just imagine for a second
