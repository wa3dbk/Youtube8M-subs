talk about recoil compensation the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.580 
talk about recoil compensation the
recent<00:01:33.180> patch<00:01:33.479> implemented<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> new<00:01:34.350> way<00:01:34.560> of

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
recent patch implemented a new way of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.590 
recent patch implemented a new way of
compensating<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.460> recoil<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.090> essentially

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
compensating for recoil this essentially

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.140 
compensating for recoil this essentially
means<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:37.650> players<00:01:38.189> camera<00:01:38.670> automatically

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
means the players camera automatically

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.660 
means the players camera automatically
resets<00:01:39.600> after<00:01:40.170> shooting<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.189> started

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
resets after shooting to the started

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.789 
resets after shooting to the started
position<00:01:42.150> however<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.590> player

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
position however if the player

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
position however if the player
compensates<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.729> recoil<00:01:45.119> themselves

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
compensates for the recoil themselves

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.359 
compensates for the recoil themselves
manually<00:01:46.320> by<00:01:46.470> moving<00:01:46.710> their<00:01:46.920> mouse<00:01:47.070> down

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
manually by moving their mouse down

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.819 
manually by moving their mouse down
while<00:01:47.640> firing<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.659> compensation<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.470> still

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
while firing the compensation will still

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.249 
while firing the compensation will still
be<00:01:50.009> calculated<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.759> once<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> finish<00:01:51.869> firing

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
be calculated in once you finish firing

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.800 
be calculated in once you finish firing
this<00:01:53.130> resulted<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.790> costner<00:01:54.180> being<00:01:54.570> much

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this resulted in your costner being much

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
this resulted in your costner being much
lower<00:01:55.110> than<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.100> started<00:01:56.490> firing

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
lower than it is when you started firing

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.300 
lower than it is when you started firing
now<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> good<00:01:58.590> change<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.130> just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
now that's not a good change it just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
now that's not a good change it just
doesn't<00:01:59.670> really<00:01:59.790> make<00:01:59.939> much<00:02:00.000> sense<00:02:00.210> now<00:02:00.600> this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
doesn't really make much sense now this

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020 
doesn't really make much sense now this
change<00:02:01.560> kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> makes<00:02:02.100> sense<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.640> single

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
change kind of makes sense for single

you fire a shot and after about half a

you fire a shot and after about half a

you don't have to manually move your

you don't have to manually move your

because<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.680> compensation<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.430> happening

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849

however this doesn't work for any other
sort<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.650> weapon<00:02:28.769> what<00:02:29.640> happens<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.239> when

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
sort of weapon what happens is when

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.410 
sort of weapon what happens is when
you're<00:02:30.630> firing<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.680> your<00:02:31.830> crosshair

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
you're firing and you see your crosshair

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.640 
you're firing and you see your crosshair
going<00:02:33.420> off<00:02:33.569> of<00:02:33.599> your<00:02:33.810> target<00:02:33.989> due<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.380> Rico

going off of your target due to Rico

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.410 
going off of your target due to Rico
you're<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> compensate<00:02:35.340> for<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.000> on

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
you're going to compensate for that on

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.610 
you're going to compensate for that on
your<00:02:36.599> own<00:02:36.660> you're<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> move<00:02:37.260> your<00:02:37.410> mouse

your own you're going to move your mouse
down<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.670> don't<00:02:38.760> need<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> game<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.510> that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
down you don't need the game to do that

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
down you don't need the game to do that
because<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.230> game<00:02:40.410> isn't<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.069> keep<00:02:41.250> the

some sort of smart aiming tech but it
really<00:02:53.730> isn't<00:02:53.940> because<00:02:54.329> players<00:02:54.569> are<00:02:54.780> going

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
really isn't because players are going

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.059 
really isn't because players are going
