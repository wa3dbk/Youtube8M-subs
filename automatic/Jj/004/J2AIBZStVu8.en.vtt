little bit no don't ever think these

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.360 
little bit no don't ever think these
things<00:01:33.570> guys<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.200> mean<00:01:34.410> it's<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:35.040> rocket

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
things guys I mean it's not rocket

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.770 
things guys I mean it's not rocket
science<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:35.910> just<00:01:36.030> make<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> tent<00:01:36.510> heading

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
science for just make a tent heading

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
science for just make a tent heading
here<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.770> getting<00:01:37.980> that<00:01:38.010> blunt<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.520> over<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
here just getting that blunt it over and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910 
here just getting that blunt it over and
then<00:01:39.230> I'm<00:01:40.230> going<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.410> straighten<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.860> out

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
then I'm going to straighten that out

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.250 
then I'm going to straighten that out
and<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:41.880> gonna<00:01:42.030> put<00:01:42.300> maybe<00:01:42.900> like<00:01:43.080> what<00:01:43.230> I

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
and I'm gonna put maybe like what I

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.440 
and I'm gonna put maybe like what I
coulda<00:01:43.470> said<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.740> rabbit<00:01:44.100> choose<00:01:44.310> around<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
coulda said like rabbit choose around it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.320 
coulda said like rabbit choose around it
so<00:01:46.080> it<00:01:46.110> doesn't<00:01:46.950> bust<00:01:47.430> when<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.730> when<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.060> start

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
so it doesn't bust when I when I start

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.780 
so it doesn't bust when I when I start
hammering<00:01:48.510> on<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.710> I'll<00:01:50.370> be<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:50.670> back

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790

when i get this love without all right
so<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.159> got<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.460> kind<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.730> straight<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.150> I

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so we got to the kind of straight now I

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.000 
so we got to the kind of straight now I
could<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:54.780> simply<00:01:55.080> used<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> saw<00:01:55.740> on

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
could have just simply used the saw on

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.810 
could have just simply used the saw on
that<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.060> wanted<00:01:57.300> to<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:58.370> how<00:01:59.370> this<00:01:59.550> wood

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that but I wanted to see how this wood

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.800 
that but I wanted to see how this wood
cutting<00:02:00.480> so<00:02:01.220> I'm<00:02:02.220> going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> simply<00:02:02.820> put<00:02:03.030> just

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
cutting so I'm going to simply put just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.990 
cutting so I'm going to simply put just
some<00:02:03.960> dump<00:02:04.320> dimples<00:02:05.070> around<00:02:05.400> there<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:06.710> to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
some dump dimples around there just to

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.639 
some dump dimples around there just to
make<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> doesn't<00:02:09.390> break<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:10.110> easy

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
make it so it doesn't break as easy

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.020 
make it so it doesn't break as easy
split<00:02:11.250> on<00:02:11.489> me

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
split on me

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.500 
split on me
that's<00:02:12.840> exactly<00:02:13.020> what<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.500> does<00:02:13.740> helps<00:02:14.190> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
that's exactly what that does helps it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.940 
that's exactly what that does helps it
helps<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.750> from<00:02:15.930> splitting<00:02:16.459> smashing

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:33.450 

ok

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.220 

now<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.520> next<00:02:34.610> part<00:02:34.910> kara<00:02:35.600> man<00:02:35.780> might<00:02:35.990> want<00:02:36.170> to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
now the next part kara man might want to

gonna do is we're gonna pull this all
out<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.860> multi-tool<00:02:43.340> because<00:02:44.210> I<00:02:44.450> don't<00:02:44.480> want

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
out of a multi-tool because I don't want

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.510 
out of a multi-tool because I don't want
a<00:02:44.810> regular<00:02:45.020> notch<00:02:45.350> in<00:02:45.590> here<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:46.010> actually

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
a regular notch in here I actually

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.210 
a regular notch in here I actually
prefer<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.270> diagonal<00:02:48.170> notch<00:02:48.410> that's<00:02:49.070> gonna

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
prefer a diagonal notch that's gonna

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.420 
prefer a diagonal notch that's gonna
catch<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.090> bring<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.780> cordage<00:02:51.680> up<00:02:51.860> into<00:02:52.310> it

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
catch and bring the cordage up into it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:10.300 
catch and bring the cordage up into it
so<00:02:55.330> start<00:02:56.330> out<00:02:56.920> right<00:02:57.920> about<00:02:58.310> there

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:18.700 

yep

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.010 

now<00:03:19.700> if<00:03:19.760> I<00:03:19.880> was<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.090> making<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.450> regular<00:03:20.780> notch

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
now if I was just making a regular notch

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.320 
now if I was just making a regular notch
I<00:03:21.380> could<00:03:22.070> do<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.670> with<00:03:22.850> my<00:03:23.000> knife<00:03:23.350> but<00:03:24.350> uh<00:03:25.330> to

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
I could do that with my knife but uh to

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.350 
I could do that with my knife but uh to
make<00:03:26.510> this<00:03:26.690> diagonal<00:03:27.290> notch<00:03:27.500> that<00:03:27.740> I<00:03:27.770> want<00:03:28.040> Oh

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
make this diagonal notch that I want Oh

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.030 
make this diagonal notch that I want Oh
need<00:03:29.360> to<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:29.870> just<00:03:30.050> faster<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.500> do<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.770> with<00:03:30.890> a

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
need to it's just faster to do it with a

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.610 
need to it's just faster to do it with a
saw<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.790> could<00:03:31.940> do<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:32.120> with<00:03:32.210> a<00:03:32.240> knife<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:32.750> this

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
saw I could do it with a knife but this

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:59.090 
saw I could do it with a knife but this
is<00:03:33.740> more<00:03:33.920> efficient<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.370> do<00:03:34.520> this<00:03:34.670> way

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.160 

reason<00:03:59.940> why<00:04:00.030> I'm<00:04:00.120> doing<00:04:00.300> it<00:04:00.420> like<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:00.780> song

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
reason why I'm doing it like that song

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.440 
reason why I'm doing it like that song
like<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.740> because<00:04:01.860> it's<00:04:02.250> green<00:04:02.580> what

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
like that is because it's green what

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.350 
like that is because it's green what
would<00:04:03.690> get<00:04:04.260> hung<00:04:04.500> up<00:04:04.620> real<00:04:04.860> easy<00:04:04.890> just<00:04:05.460> want<00:04:06.300> to

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
would get hung up real easy just want to

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.420 
would get hung up real easy just want to
get<00:04:06.480> in<00:04:06.690> there<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.110> can<00:04:07.260> get<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.410> bite<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:07.650> on

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
get in there so I can get a bite on on

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.640 
get in there so I can get a bite on on
it<00:04:08.900> yeah<00:04:10.730> that's<00:04:11.730> about<00:04:11.880> good<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:13.410> don't<00:04:13.530> want

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
it yeah that's about good you don't want

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.380 
it yeah that's about good you don't want
to<00:04:13.710> go<00:04:13.770> too<00:04:13.830> far<00:04:14.010> into<00:04:14.460> the<00:04:14.940> wood<00:04:15.120> there

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
to go too far into the wood there

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.850 
to go too far into the wood there
because<00:04:15.570> then<00:04:15.780> you're<00:04:15.930> going<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.200> affect<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
because then you're going to affect the

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.979 
because then you're going to affect the
structural<00:04:17.250> integrity<00:04:17.580> of<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:18.750> bike

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
structural integrity of the this bike

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.500 
structural integrity of the this bike
itself<00:04:21.890> then<00:04:22.890> kind<00:04:23.160> of<00:04:23.220> will<00:04:24.150> get<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.360> here

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
itself then kind of will get in here

00:04:24.510 --> 00:05:03.910 
itself then kind of will get in here
with<00:04:24.660> our<00:04:24.750> knife<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.640> clean<00:04:26.640> this<00:04:26.790> up

there and I like to cross them over pull

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.380 
there and I like to cross them over pull
it<00:05:26.180> taut<00:05:26.620> today<00:05:27.620> at<00:05:27.830> a<00:05:27.860> 45<00:05:28.430> degree<00:05:28.460> angle<00:05:28.820> and

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
it taut today at a 45 degree angle and

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.480 
it taut today at a 45 degree angle and
you<00:05:30.110> know<00:05:30.260> what<00:05:30.440> this<00:05:30.650> ground<00:05:30.950> is<00:05:31.040> really<00:05:31.280> soft

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
you know what this ground is really soft

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.160 
you know what this ground is really soft
I<00:05:31.670> probably<00:05:31.850> have<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.150> put<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.360> stabilizer<00:05:32.870> in

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
I probably have to put a stabilizer in

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.400 
I probably have to put a stabilizer in
we'll<00:05:34.130> see
