00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
about the team and that's what we got to

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.030 
about the team and that's what we got to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
makes us unique you know maybe we're not

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.049 
makes us unique you know maybe we're not
good<00:00:40.829> enough<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.670> beat<00:00:41.910> up

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
good enough to just go out and beat up

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.580 
good enough to just go out and beat up
beat<00:00:42.270> people<00:00:42.570> one-on-one<00:00:42.780> matchups<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.500> when

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
beat people one-on-one matchups but when

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.470 
beat people one-on-one matchups but when
we<00:00:43.649> play<00:00:43.770> together<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.190> team<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
we play together as a team you know I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.690 
we play together as a team you know I
think<00:00:45.570> we're<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> hard<00:00:45.960> team<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.140> beat<00:00:49.610> just<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
think we're a hard team to beat just a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.279 
think we're a hard team to beat just a
mentality<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> think<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:51.930> our<00:00:52.110> guys<00:00:52.260> are

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
mentality I think I think our guys are

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.660 
mentality I think I think our guys are
sick<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.800> here<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.280> can't<00:00:53.460> run<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
sick of here and that we can't run the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.979 
sick of here and that we can't run the
ball<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> mean<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.239> led<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> league<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.809> rushing

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
ball I mean we led the league in rushing

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.510 
ball I mean we led the league in rushing
or<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.680> we're<00:00:55.829> second<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.160> rushing<00:00:56.460> in

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
or you know we're second in rushing in

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.639 
or you know we're second in rushing in
the<00:00:56.579> first<00:00:56.640> five<00:00:56.940> games<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.199> it's

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the first five games and it's just it's

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.099 
the first five games and it's just it's
just<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> mentality<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.300> also<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
just a mentality and I think also like I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.450 
just a mentality and I think also like I
said<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.739> earlier<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.039> week<00:01:02.309> it's

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
said you know earlier this week it's

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.680 
said you know earlier this week it's
it's<00:01:02.640> our<00:01:02.760> third<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.180> row<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> same

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it's our third we can row it the same

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
it's our third we can row it the same
line<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.650> means<00:01:04.920> something<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
line and and that means something you

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.980 
line and and that means something you
know<00:01:05.519> those<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.180> five<00:01:06.420> guys<00:01:06.689> that

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
know those are that's five guys that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.200 
know those are that's five guys that
have<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> work<00:01:07.439> as<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> running

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
have to work as one and the running

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.520 
have to work as one and the running
backs<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> make<00:01:09.720> those<00:01:09.869> guys<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
backs have to make those guys right so I

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
backs have to make those guys right so I
think<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> combination<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.210> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
think you know the combination of a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.730 
think you know the combination of a
bunch<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.840> things<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.380> did<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> great<00:01:13.710> job

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
bunch of things but they did a great job

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
bunch of things but they did a great job
and<00:01:14.159> obviously<00:01:14.790> when<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.060> run<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> ball<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and obviously when we run the ball I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.179 
and obviously when we run the ball I
think<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.900> opens<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.500> ton<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> other<00:01:16.950> things

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
think it opens up a ton of other things

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.999 
think it opens up a ton of other things
in<00:01:17.310> our<00:01:17.610> game<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> don't<00:01:25.770> know<00:01:25.979> I

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
in our game you know what I don't know I

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
in our game you know what I don't know I
mean<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.090> feel<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.600> feel

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
mean you can just feel it you can feel

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
win in every game it's such a long

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.369 
win in every game it's such a long
season<00:02:08.310> there's<00:02:08.640> seven<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:08.970> games<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.450> go
