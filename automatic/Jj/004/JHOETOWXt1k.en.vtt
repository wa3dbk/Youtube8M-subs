before we get going I'm going to come in

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.209 
before we get going I'm going to come in
here<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.480> go<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.990> boat<00:00:10.139> detail<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
here and go to the boat detail and

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.580 
here and go to the boat detail and
you'll<00:00:11.519> notice<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.000> there<00:00:12.210> are<00:00:12.389> no<00:00:12.809> mats

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
you'll notice that there are no mats

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.499 
you'll notice that there are no mats
assignor<00:00:14.130> no<00:00:14.309> matches<00:00:14.700> assigned<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> match<00:00:15.240> yet

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
assignor no matches assigned a match yet

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.910 
assignor no matches assigned a match yet
and<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.230> went<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> mat<00:00:16.740> side

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
and so if I went to a mat side

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.070 
and so if I went to a mat side
controller<00:00:17.369> right<00:00:17.580> now<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.060> went<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> search

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
controller right now I went to search

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.010 
controller right now I went to search
for<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> match<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.460> wouldn't<00:00:21.000> find<00:00:21.180> any<00:00:21.449> there<00:00:21.689> so

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
for a match I wouldn't find any there so

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.330 
for a match I wouldn't find any there so
we<00:00:22.170> need<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.410> go<00:00:22.529> ahead<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.859> load<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.160> mats

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
we need to go ahead and load the mats

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.950 
we need to go ahead and load the mats
first<00:00:23.699> before<00:00:23.910> we'll<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.750> I'm<00:00:24.840> just

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.679 
first before we'll see that so I'm just
gonna<00:00:25.050> come<00:00:25.320> into<00:00:25.500> mats<00:00:26.060> I'm<00:00:27.060> gonna<00:00:27.210> go<00:00:27.359> into

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
gonna come into mats I'm gonna go into

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.370 
gonna come into mats I'm gonna go into
load<00:00:27.900> mats<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.800> type<00:00:29.099> load<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.260> I'd

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380

already selected my schemes I came here

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.389 
already selected my schemes I came here
to<00:00:33.300> hit<00:00:33.420> load<00:00:33.660> type<00:00:34.260> load<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.860> then<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.190> when

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
to hit load type load and then now when

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.139 
to hit load type load and then now when
I<00:00:35.520> go<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:36.140> about<00:00:37.140> detail<00:00:37.829> you'll<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.090> I

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.770 
definitely move matches from this page
that's<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.340> side<00:01:35.549> note<00:01:35.780> not

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that's kind of a side note not

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
that's kind of a side note not
necessarily<00:01:37.290> about<00:01:37.619> loading<00:01:37.920> mats<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.610> if

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
necessarily about loading mats but if

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.249 
necessarily about loading mats but if
you<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.060> an<00:01:39.150> injury<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:39.630> some<00:01:39.930> other<00:01:40.049> reason

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you have an injury or some other reason

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.770 
you have an injury or some other reason
to<00:01:40.500> move<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.729> want<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> override<00:01:42.329> what<00:01:42.689> our

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to move and want to override what our

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.539 
to move and want to override what our
system<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> doing<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.890> that's<00:01:44.100> how<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.340> can

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
system is doing then that's how you can

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.450 
system is doing then that's how you can
do<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.960> now<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.409> use<00:01:46.500> mat<00:01:46.770> six

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
do it and then so now if we use mat six

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.749 
do it and then so now if we use mat six
as<00:01:47.640> an<00:01:47.790> example<00:01:48.170> once<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.439> mat<00:01:49.710> match<00:01:50.399> gets

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
as an example once this mat match gets

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.749 
as an example once this mat match gets
done<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.720> result<00:01:52.020> gets<00:01:52.259> entered<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.340> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
done and a result gets entered then this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.670 
done and a result gets entered then this
next<00:01:54.030> map<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:54.450> being<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.780> match<00:01:55.259> which<00:01:55.560> would

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
next map which being a match which would

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
next map which being a match which would
be<00:01:55.740> Nano<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.549> would<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:56.820> assigned<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
be Nano for that would get assigned to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.880 
be Nano for that would get assigned to
mat<00:01:57.360> 6<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> mat<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.439> always<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
mat 6 so this mat is always going to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.499 
mat 6 so this mat is always going to
stay<00:01:59.070> three<00:01:59.369> deep<00:01:59.549> just<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.969> my<00:02:00.149> other<00:02:00.329> ones

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
stay three deep just like my other ones

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.660 
stay three deep just like my other ones
if<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.110> had<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.439> DP<00:02:01.740> would<00:02:01.860> stay<00:02:02.040> too<00:02:02.100> deep<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
if you had to DP would stay too deep and

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.359 
if you had to DP would stay too deep and
if<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.880> had<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> deeper<00:02:04.020> selection<00:02:04.979> there<00:02:05.159> it

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
if you had a deeper selection there it

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
if you had a deeper selection there it
would<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> same<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.360> that's<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.079> do

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
would do the same but that's what you do

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
would do the same but that's what you do
basically<00:02:07.710> go<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.039> mats<00:02:08.250> page<00:02:08.599> click<00:02:09.599> on

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
basically go to the mats page click on

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.479 
basically go to the mats page click on
load<00:02:10.200> mats<00:02:10.410> type<00:02:10.770> load<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.129> you're<00:02:11.220> ready<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
load mats type load and you're ready to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.700 
load mats type load and you're ready to
go
