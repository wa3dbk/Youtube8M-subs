this frittata basically we're making the
filling<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.039> made<00:00:59.309> from<00:00:59.579> piquillo

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

garlic and sherry vinegar so let's get

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.370 
garlic and sherry vinegar so let's get
started<00:01:05.700> whenever<00:01:06.000> we're<00:01:06.240> cutting<00:01:06.630> avocados

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
started whenever we're cutting avocados

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.100 
started whenever we're cutting avocados
we<00:01:08.130> take<00:01:08.580> our<00:01:08.729> hand<00:01:09.000> lay<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.299> flat<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.900> top

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
we take our hand lay it flat on the top

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
we take our hand lay it flat on the top
and<00:01:10.350> then<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.920> turn<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.460> avocado<00:01:11.970> around

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
and then just turn the avocado around

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
and then just turn the avocado around
like<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.600> turn<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.810> open<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
like this then we turn it open it up and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.580 
like this then we turn it open it up and
then<00:01:18.090> it's<00:01:18.299> really<00:01:18.570> easy<00:01:18.720> you're<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.290> gonna

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
then it's really easy you're just gonna

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.530 
then it's really easy you're just gonna
take<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.100> seed<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.520> I'll<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.759> pop<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.420> out

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
take the seed out I'll just pop it out

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
take the seed out I'll just pop it out
just<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> tip<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.040> spoon

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
just like that with the tip of a spoon

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.760 
just like that with the tip of a spoon
it<00:01:23.549> pops<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.170> simply<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.590> I'm<00:01:25.680> gonna

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it pops out very simply now I'm gonna

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
it pops out very simply now I'm gonna
cut<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.250> avocado<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:27.000> quarters<00:01:27.390> because

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
cut that avocado in quarters because

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
cut that avocado in quarters because
it's<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> easiest<00:01:28.290> way<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.619> peel<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.950> we're

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it's the easiest way to peel it we're

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.740 
it's the easiest way to peel it we're
gonna<00:01:29.189> basically<00:01:29.850> feel<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> banana

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
gonna basically feel it like a banana

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.469 
gonna basically feel it like a banana
and<00:01:31.200> also<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.280> how<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.640> there's<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> dark

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
and also you see how that there's a dark

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.350 
and also you see how that there's a dark
green<00:01:34.470> part<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.220> closest<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.030> skin

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
green part that's closest to the skin

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.120 
green part that's closest to the skin
that's<00:01:36.990> where<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> greatest<00:01:37.650> concentration

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that's where the greatest concentration

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.310 
that's where the greatest concentration
of<00:01:38.670> nutrients<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.299> want<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> make<00:01:39.840> sure<00:01:39.869> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
of nutrients is want to make sure that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.310 
of nutrients is want to make sure that
you<00:01:40.439> don't<00:01:40.590> leave<00:01:40.979> them<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.509> skin<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.110> if

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you don't leave them on the skin so if

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.800 
you don't leave them on the skin so if
you<00:01:43.470> use<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:44.040> peeling<00:01:44.610> method<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.450> works

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
you use this peeling method it works

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230 
you use this peeling method it works
really<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.409> well<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.250> mean<00:01:47.310> literally<00:01:47.790> this

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
this frittata is ready we don't want to

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.770 
this frittata is ready we don't want to
overcook<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.730> because<00:04:56.030> we<00:04:56.150> like<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.480> eggs<00:04:56.660> to

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
overcook it because we like the eggs to

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.330 
overcook it because we like the eggs to
be<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:56.870> little<00:04:57.200> bit<00:04:57.320> soft<00:04:57.710> so<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:58.010> get<00:04:58.160> that

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
be a little bit soft so you get that

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.850
