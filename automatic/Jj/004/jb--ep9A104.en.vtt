I chose things that I had scraps for
that's<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.570> nice<00:00:15.719> thing<00:00:15.870> about<00:00:15.929> stained<00:00:16.350> glass

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.680 
that's a nice thing about stained glass
as<00:00:16.920> if<00:00:16.949> you're<00:00:17.190> careful<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.150> preserve<00:00:18.630> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
as if you're careful you can preserve a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.050 
as if you're careful you can preserve a
lot<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.199> scraps<00:00:19.590> from<00:00:19.859> prior<00:00:20.160> projects<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
lot of scraps from prior projects and

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.120 
lot of scraps from prior projects and
use<00:00:21.210> them<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.510> future<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> looked<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.039> my

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
use them in the future so I looked in my

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.340 
use them in the future so I looked in my
box<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.550> pieces<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> instead<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.510> using<00:00:24.720> kind

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
box of pieces and instead of using kind

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
box of pieces and instead of using kind
of<00:00:25.439> these<00:00:25.529> nice<00:00:25.740> big<00:00:26.130> pieces<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.699> showed<00:00:26.939> you

of these nice big pieces I showed you
earlier<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.480> are<00:00:27.720> kind<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:27.960> untouched<00:00:28.349> maybe

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
earlier that are kind of untouched maybe

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.410 
earlier that are kind of untouched maybe
I'll<00:00:29.189> save<00:00:29.429> those<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> future<00:00:30.090> project

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
made this design so i could use one of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
made this design so i could use one of
these<00:01:30.720> melted<00:01:31.170> marbles<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.710> middle<00:01:32.009> i'm

remember I've already numbered the
pieces<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:42.000> puzzle<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:43.380> I've<00:01:43.470> done

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
pieces of my puzzle and what I've done
is<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.250> probably<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> can't<00:01:45.450> read

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
is you probably you know you can't read

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.200 
is you probably you know you can't read
it<00:01:45.750> from<00:01:45.780> there<00:01:46.140> obviously<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.490> right<00:01:47.880> here

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it from there obviously but right here

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.690 
it from there obviously but right here
I've<00:01:48.420> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> written<00:01:48.930> my<00:01:49.229> plan<00:01:49.649> which<00:01:50.430> says

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
I've kind of written my plan which says

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.560 
I've kind of written my plan which says
that<00:01:50.729> piece<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.119> 1<00:01:51.630> 12<00:01:52.140> 13<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.040> 14<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:54.270> kind

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
that piece is 1 12 13 and 14 these kind

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.569 
that piece is 1 12 13 and 14 these kind
of<00:01:54.630> roundish<00:01:55.079> ones<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> use<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
of roundish ones I'm going to use this

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.569 
of roundish ones I'm going to use this
scrap<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.619> one<00:01:58.619> kind<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.950> another<00:01:59.310> way<00:01:59.460> is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
scrap for it one kind of another way is

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.609 
scrap for it one kind of another way is
sort<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> cheated<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.259> scrap

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
sort of cheated is that this scrap

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.319 
sort of cheated is that this scrap
happen<00:02:02.040> already<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> nice<00:02:02.820> little<00:02:03.000> curve

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
happen already have a nice little curve

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.450 
happen already have a nice little curve
to<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.649> curves<00:02:05.009> are<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.280> little

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
to it and because curves are a little

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980 
to it and because curves are a little
bit<00:02:05.610> more<00:02:05.729> difficult<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.240> cut<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.479> thought<00:02:06.840> oh

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
bit more difficult to cut I thought oh

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.260 
bit more difficult to cut I thought oh
well<00:02:07.259> maybe<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.920> cut<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.910> these<00:02:09.000> pieces

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
well maybe I can cut one of these pieces

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.220 
well maybe I can cut one of these pieces
out<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.080> already<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.500> my<00:02:10.649> curve

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
out of that and already have my curve

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.020 
out of that and already have my curve
and<00:02:11.409> so<00:02:11.620> that's<00:02:12.310> kind<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.610> one<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.909> neat

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and so that's kind of one of the neat

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.250 
and so that's kind of one of the neat
things<00:02:13.060> about<00:02:13.300> stained<00:02:13.629> glass<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.080> be

things about stained glass you can be
thinking<00:02:14.560> about<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.890> most<00:02:15.099> economical<00:02:15.790> way

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
thinking about the most economical way

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.640 
thinking about the most economical way
to<00:02:15.970> use<00:02:16.209> pieces<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.930> sometimes<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.379> can<00:02:17.500> find

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
to use pieces and sometimes you can find

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.770 
to use pieces and sometimes you can find
a<00:02:17.769> use<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.250> scrap<00:02:18.549> you've<00:02:18.790> got<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.540> anyway

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
glass i'm going to do seven eight nine

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.390 
glass i'm going to do seven eight nine
ten<00:02:33.519> these<00:02:34.269> four<00:02:34.599> in<00:02:34.780> here<00:02:35.049> in<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.769> yellow<00:02:36.129> and

ten these four in here in the yellow and
then<00:02:36.970> i'll<00:02:37.120> do<00:02:37.299> these<00:02:37.510> rectangles<00:02:38.170> these

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
then i'll do these rectangles these

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.160 
then i'll do these rectangles these
three<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.709> six<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.879> blue<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.720> i<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:41.019> that
