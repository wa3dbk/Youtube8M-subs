00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.150
 I hope you are well 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.900
 I received your 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.849
 we will tell your first wife so the dessert 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.849
 they want the canvas with its layer of form 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.369
 even if it's good the lot chrosomes we have on the bottom we will really have 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.359
 many serve us to warm the whole thing up like in the foliage at 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.890
 foreground of trees back too 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.599
 at the photo level 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.599
 the drawing has arrived very well you have 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.999
 it's just the outline 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.379
 we can see the lot of hills behind 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.190
 the reflection in the water 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.930
 vau-l'eau waterway 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.540
 the house inforad rafa passion and maybe a little bit too low to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.000
 about this novel on the line but the mythical climb slightly above 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.580
 be careful that is a little more talking 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.580
 slightly rectangular horizontally 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.760
 worse if you have% 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.830
 you said you take them off the couille conveyed on the bottom you 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.630
 can see the criticism or the hill back that's not a bad 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.970
 idea 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.790
 to give a little more depth, that is to say that we 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.260
 repeat that the successive 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.630
 further still than 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.140
 all the trees that are fed up 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.860
 with a little hill in the fort there behind this trio dribbling tea 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.880
 to say that it is far behind 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.640
 ok at the drawing level so it's really beautiful we just know his mayor 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.200
 since it was necessary 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.020
 so what would I do if I had to lose this canvas 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.700
 I will of course start from the well - towards the nearest so with the sky I 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.460
 will make a blue sky 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.520
 because even enough sustained for a beautiful contrast with the storms in the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.740
 trees 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.830
 so I might go with a cobalt blue in the water and then go down with 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.330
 the series come to the bar of course 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.650
 both will be laid out with a little bit of blame for easter on the hole 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.020
 strengths 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620
 then with a whole corpus of blain in the lower rhine 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.100
 then after once I was me too 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.049
 a layer 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.450
 fluid c 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.760
 dilute it all is a first layer 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.630
 I'll come back with blues tinged with pink a little bit to do the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.350
 clouds I will not put blame for the clouds but here is a theme that is 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990
 a little bit of pink 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.580
 done with a red 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.000
 the incas we are carmen so in red that pulls rather on the month 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.949
 for the bullish plan that pulls on the horror 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.329
 then after that I will make the hill the reform signed with the same color of the 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.229
 sky in which I will add a little more blue little more than 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.579
 truck 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.189
 so that giggle 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.989
 we ask in the end to marnay psy it's too short and I'll put a little land 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.319
 in the burned shadow of ben arous 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.109
 to make it public 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.319
 to tarnish a little swimming must not be too French 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.949
 for that it is clearer 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.339
 that trees to navarrenx 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.039
 but a little darker than the sky 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.939
 caen then abbas after that i break russia so there i 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.939
 will give a vertical brush stroke like that 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.739
 history of doing exchange exchange walks type 2 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.349
 dorin gm that little red little bit of the cooler air of the mixes of 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.749
 colors a little in that sense 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.789
 always with the same pain is a port night 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.510
 it's one of too much really calculating what I'm doing 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.729
 but vital year that it be regular 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.599
 and allies a sick on a little bit the general trend of the photo this is to 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.809
 to say that here bowman has more greens I will put more war by that 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.589
 after here gilles yellow orange spots 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.409
 I come back with greens here down above the house and then rodez 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:15.169
 bram 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.429
 burnt sienna 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.069
 red carmen a little bit of red 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.319
 hyphen for the brightest reds 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.829
 a little bit of john kani moved from red to law i got a little 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.829
 and so on and so I'll do all the trees here 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.859
 with just tasks like that 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.479
 then not all the height like plaster that would do too much 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:38.219
 I do tasks like this threshold like that here I come back to do 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.499
 others little bit lower like that 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.879
 and for the barÃ§a would be to reflect what we did in fact I would do the 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.559
 same thing in the water 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.089
 and if the same as what I did in less land in the same 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.759
 trends if if I have arboras 1 gb joffrin plunge 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.609
 6 here is the air is fresh various here 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.839
 once that's done I'm going to make the blue long 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.509
 so here I leave the darkest here 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.389
 he is named in the clearest 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.359
 about the same colors as in the sky but darker a little 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.119
 so I would put - white 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:11.619
 tabet for the drawing on pass over it is not very serious too t for 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:13.279
 locate in the right engine 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:15.639
 we can do it a second time 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.689
 once the sky has been done 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:21.079
 at this moment 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.960
 we will be able to do here the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.580
 the soil so I will take French dutrey this time from the land of hamburg 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.330
 burnt 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.050
 maybe even sometimes but the two blues to blacken the fort have 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.139
 always dreamed of making small patches of burnt sienna so 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.159
 join again 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.120
 and I can 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.999
 at the level of foliage that comes over the reflection of salt in the water 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.349
 it is certain that when we will lose our color to mix 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.499
 to blue so that will make a color that will not be pretty 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.130
 but it does not matter I would do it like boiler room 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.749
 the stems very very thin 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.869
 and labeling to flag the leaves a few and joeffrey not 

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:58.189
 all but a few 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:00.139
 it was going place saturday situ 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.199
 as if it has a lot more red but very tight or red here the green 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.949
 and black frightened up benches 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:08.240
 and here it's true 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.800
 the yellow ochres here and it's the same if i will come up matri floor so 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.650
 today 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.650
 little earth of sienna burnt in my chicken to make French 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.960
 but in small quantities 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.090
 joffrey not all the leaves I'm careful of not clogged the sky 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.110
 kemboi work 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.919
 if the colors that I apply to the sky 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.009
 the mountain or hunt under but there I spend a lot of things had 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.599
 spent in lucian first layer 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:32.629
 it is not serious 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.139
 we do not have the right metro color 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.229
 we know where we put them and his dismay we will not come back and touched 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.979
 when we will do the second layer 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.300
 neighbor of the sky 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.650
 so that we will be able to come back on top of that will be dry 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.740
 pedro I will do a first coat with a diluted paint 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.729
 with that directly from solvin we put back the age of 12 years and five to 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.729
 five lens cities on 15% synth on the arm 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.300
 so there we must respect the rule of fat on mac 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:03.449
 and once the first layer fr 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.119
 without any detail 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:06.659
 we will let it dry 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.509
 they are in trouble to send the picture if you want to send a picture and 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.319
 intermediate before you finish the first layer do not hesitate can 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.289
 do it 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.330
 but if we could go for the first layer this year 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.969
 the important thing even though things went to do 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.719
 since in any case we will cover everything again 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.559
 with the second blow choller will walk maybe a little bit more 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:27.240
 ap by step that is to say that it will be just for the sky first more or less 

00:06:27.239 --> 00:06:28.999
 a photo 4 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.740
 mountain etc. 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.639
 we will go quietly 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.759
 so db I thank a lot 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.520
 if the effort you have questions do not hesitate to ask me by 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.270
 email or 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.469
 and then I could answer 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:43.360
 fast enough 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.990
 so I wait patiently 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.919
 the photo of your first layer 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:49.219
 thank you very much for a day
