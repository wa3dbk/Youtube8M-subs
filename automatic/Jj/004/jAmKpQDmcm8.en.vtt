00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.780 
about it well I'll tell you what it
seems<00:00:15.169> like<00:00:15.320> with<00:00:15.440> a<00:00:15.469> lot<00:00:15.620> more<00:00:15.860> than<00:00:15.980> 120<00:00:16.610> days

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
seems like with a lot more than 120 days

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.660 
seems like with a lot more than 120 days
I'll<00:00:17.090> say<00:00:17.270> that<00:00:17.540> it<00:00:17.690> was<00:00:17.780> a<00:00:17.810> long<00:00:18.140> long<00:00:18.680> tough

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
I'll say that it was a long long tough

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.769 
I'll say that it was a long long tough
process<00:00:20.390> tough<00:00:20.990> negotiation<00:00:21.890> but<00:00:22.480> at<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.630> end

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
process tough negotiation but at the end

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.380 
process tough negotiation but at the end
of<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:23.990> day<00:00:24.170> I<00:00:24.199> think<00:00:24.439> both<00:00:24.859> sides

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
of the day I think both sides

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.759 
of the day I think both sides
compromised<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.630> bit<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.050> I<00:00:27.109> think<00:00:27.410> we<00:00:27.560> came

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
compromised a bit and I think we came

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.160 
compromised a bit and I think we came
out<00:00:27.980> with<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:28.189> fair<00:00:28.760> deal<00:00:29.029> we're<00:00:29.300> not<00:00:29.449> I<00:00:29.720> don't

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
out with a fair deal we're not I don't

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.960 
out with a fair deal we're not I don't
think<00:00:30.380> either<00:00:30.500> one<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:30.800> us<00:00:30.980> are<00:00:31.220> thrilled<00:00:31.699> with

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
think either one of us are thrilled with

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.630 
think either one of us are thrilled with
everything<00:00:32.119> that's<00:00:32.480> in<00:00:32.630> there<00:00:32.840> but<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.830> I

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
everything that's in there but but I

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.090 
everything that's in there but but I
think<00:00:35.390> it<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.600> fair<00:00:35.960> deal<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:36.710> I<00:00:36.829> think<00:00:36.860> the

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
think it is a fair deal and I think the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.549 
think it is a fair deal and I think the
best<00:00:37.309> news<00:00:37.610> for<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.000> fans<00:00:38.750> is<00:00:39.110> that<00:00:39.320> it's<00:00:39.469> a

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
best news for the fans is that it's a

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.560 
best news for the fans is that it's a
10-year<00:00:40.100> deal<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:40.850> they're<00:00:41.270> not<00:00:41.390> going<00:00:41.510> to

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
10-year deal and they're not going to

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.080 
10-year deal and they're not going to
have<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:41.870> read<00:00:42.649> or<00:00:42.890> hear<00:00:43.039> about<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:43.550> for

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
have to read or hear about this for

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.440 
have to read or hear about this for
another<00:00:44.300> ten<00:00:44.570> years<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.260> I<00:00:45.469> think<00:00:46.070> for<00:00:47.059> the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
another ten years so I think for the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.540 
another ten years so I think for the
league<00:00:47.690> as<00:00:47.989> a<00:00:48.079> whole<00:00:48.289> for<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.739> clubs<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.399> for

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
league as a whole for the clubs and for

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.760 
league as a whole for the clubs and for
the<00:00:49.610> players<00:00:49.989> it's<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.110> very<00:00:51.320> good<00:00:51.530> development

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
the players it's a very good development

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.889 
the players it's a very good development
do<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.399> feel<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.969> left<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.449> game<00:00:53.629> in<00:00:53.809> a

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
do you feel you left the game in a

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.020 
do you feel you left the game in a
chaotic<00:00:54.260> State<00:00:54.859> for<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.370> next<00:00:55.670> couple<00:00:55.850> of

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
chaotic State for the next couple of

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.510 
chaotic State for the next couple of
weeks<00:00:56.090> I<00:00:56.570> think<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:57.590> Mike<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:57.859> certainly<00:00:58.250> think

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
weeks I think so Mike I certainly think

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.549 
weeks I think so Mike I certainly think
you're<00:00:59.180> going<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.390> have<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.840> flurry<00:01:00.469> of

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
you're going to have a flurry of

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.819 
you're going to have a flurry of
signings<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:01.399> players<00:01:02.390> changing<00:01:03.230> teams<00:01:03.440> and

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
signings and players changing teams and

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.229 
signings and players changing teams and
yeah<00:01:03.980> it's<00:01:04.129> going<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.340> be<00:01:04.400> pretty<00:01:04.670> hectic<00:01:04.910> for

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
yeah it's going to be pretty hectic for

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.630 
yeah it's going to be pretty hectic for
the<00:01:05.360> next<00:01:05.660> ten<00:01:06.530> days<00:01:06.560> or<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.010> but<00:01:07.370> then<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.520> think

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
the next ten days or so but then I think

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.330 
the next ten days or so but then I think
once<00:01:08.060> say<00:01:08.360> once<00:01:08.990> everything<00:01:09.350> settles<00:01:09.680> down<00:01:09.890> I

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
once say once everything settles down I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.030 
once say once everything settles down I
will<00:01:11.120> start<00:01:11.390> playing<00:01:11.600> games<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.350> it'll<00:01:12.920> be

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.710 
specifically well trying to agree on
schedules<00:01:42.620> and<00:01:43.100> whatnot<00:01:43.460> I<00:01:43.850> don't<00:01:44.570> think

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
schedules and whatnot I don't think

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.580 
schedules and whatnot I don't think
there<00:01:44.810> was<00:01:44.870> anything<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:46.330> we

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
there was anything that that we

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.840 
there was anything that that we
absolutely<00:01:48.590> had<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.220> have<00:01:49.490> them<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.790> the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
absolutely had to have them and the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.810 
absolutely had to have them and the
players<00:01:50.090> certainly<00:01:50.630> were<00:01:50.780> very<00:01:51.430> strong<00:01:52.430> about

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
players certainly were very strong about

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.880 
players certainly were very strong about
you<00:01:53.690> know<00:01:53.780> wanting<00:01:54.080> to<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.350> some<00:01:54.560> different

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
you know wanting to have some different

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.030 
you know wanting to have some different
work<00:01:55.040> rules<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.790> effect<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.980> know

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
work rules in effect and you know

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.560 
work rules in effect and you know
limiting<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.490> amount<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.850> time<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.450> they

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
limiting the amount of time that they

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.240 
limiting the amount of time that they
were<00:01:59.630> on<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.900> field<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.440> amount<00:02:00.650> of<00:02:00.710> contact

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
were on the field the amount of contact

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.990 
were on the field the amount of contact
and<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.910> everything<00:02:02.480> and<00:02:02.600> we<00:02:02.720> made<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.880> know

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
and and everything and we made you know

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.649 
and and everything and we made you know
several<00:02:05.300> compromises<00:02:06.140> on

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
several compromises on

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.089 
several compromises on
some<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.899> those<00:02:06.990> issues<00:02:07.229> those<00:02:07.679> were<00:02:07.859> very

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
some of those issues those were very

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.830 
some of those issues those were very
important<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> them<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
important to them and I think in the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.320 
important to them and I think in the
long<00:02:10.080> run<00:02:10.730> it's<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> good

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
long run it's going to be a good

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.479 
long run it's going to be a good
development<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.800> going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> help<00:02:14.190> player

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
development it's going to help player

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.920 
development it's going to help player
safe<00:02:14.849> he's<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.480> them<00:02:15.629> off<00:02:15.780> the

safe he's going to get them off the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.050 
safe he's going to get them off the

field a little bit more and you know to
be<00:02:18.180> honest<00:02:18.450> with<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:19.530> was<00:02:19.980> never<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.250> huge

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
be honest with you I was never a huge

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.699 
be honest with you I was never a huge
fan<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.480> two-a-day<00:02:21.750> practices<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
fan of the two-a-day practices in the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.979 
fan of the two-a-day practices in the
summer<00:02:22.950> anyway<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.430> just<00:02:23.549> not<00:02:24.540> really<00:02:24.810> sure

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
summer anyway I just not really sure

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.449 
summer anyway I just not really sure
what<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.379> what<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.769> accomplish<00:02:26.280> by<00:02:26.310> doing

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
what you what you accomplish by doing

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.270 
what you what you accomplish by doing
that<00:02:26.879> we<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:27.989> guys<00:02:28.170> out<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.709> get<00:02:29.040> more

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
that we are in guys out and get more

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.050 
that we are in guys out and get more
guys<00:02:29.459> hurt<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.870> think<00:02:31.049> we<00:02:31.440> we<00:02:32.370> made<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> lot

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
guys hurt so so I think we we made a lot

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.320 
guys hurt so so I think we we made a lot
of<00:02:33.739> adjustments<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:35.010> lot<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.340> compromises<00:02:35.879> that

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
of adjustments a lot of compromises that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.789 
of adjustments a lot of compromises that
I<00:02:36.540> think<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.959> long<00:02:37.140> run<00:02:37.170> are<00:02:37.470> going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> be

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
I think in the long run are going to be

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.789 
I think in the long run are going to be
good<00:02:38.010> was<00:02:38.519> this<00:02:38.760> was<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.720> necessary<00:02:39.989> could

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
good was this was this necessary could

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.289 
good was this was this necessary could
this<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.160> been<00:02:41.220> accomplished<00:02:41.849> back<00:02:42.090> in

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
this have been accomplished back in

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.910 
this have been accomplished back in
March<00:02:42.599> Oh<00:02:42.900> was<00:02:43.140> there<00:02:43.319> stuff<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:43.890> that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
March Oh was there stuff here that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.890 
March Oh was there stuff here that
couldn't<00:02:44.459> have<00:02:44.579> been<00:02:44.610> accomplishment<00:02:45.390> well<00:02:45.540> I

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
couldn't have been accomplishment well I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.410 
couldn't have been accomplishment well I
don't<00:02:46.379> know<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.760> think<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:47.879> probably<00:02:48.060> could

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
don't know I think we probably could

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.229 
don't know I think we probably could
have<00:02:48.450> gotten<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.840> done<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.019> lot<00:02:49.319> earlier<00:02:49.769> but

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
have gotten it done a lot earlier but

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.729 
have gotten it done a lot earlier but
you<00:02:51.239> know<00:02:51.329> a<00:02:51.540> lot<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.810> times<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.349> labor

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
you know a lot of times in labor

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.759 
you know a lot of times in labor
negotiations<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:54.420> feel<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:54.900> way<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:55.349> until

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
negotiations you feel that way but until

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.270 
negotiations you feel that way but until
both<00:02:56.579> sides<00:02:56.879> are<00:02:57.440> under<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> gun<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.040> really

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
both sides are under the gun and really

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.619 
both sides are under the gun and really
feel<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.879> pressure<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.440> calendar

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
feel the pressure of the calendar

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.000 
feel the pressure of the calendar
oftentimes<00:03:03.629> deals<00:03:03.959> don't<00:03:04.200> get<00:03:04.379> done<00:03:04.590> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
oftentimes deals don't get done and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.680 
oftentimes deals don't get done and
that's<00:03:05.340> exactly<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:06.030> happened<00:03:06.420> here

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's exactly what happened here

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.180

I<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.530> don't<00:03:08.040> think<00:03:08.329> either<00:03:09.329> side<00:03:09.859> felt<00:03:10.859> like

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
I I don't think either side felt like

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.650 
I I don't think either side felt like
they<00:03:11.370> were<00:03:11.430> under<00:03:11.579> a<00:03:11.730> lot<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:12.000> pressure<00:03:12.150> back

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
they were under a lot of pressure back

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
there just came a point in time where we

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.710 
there just came a point in time where we
had<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.370> decide<00:04:25.700> one<00:04:25.970> way<00:04:26.000> or<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.300> other<00:04:26.330> so

to do in this process I think it depends

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.630 
to do in this process I think it depends
on<00:06:07.880> the<00:06:08.000> player<00:06:08.270> I<00:06:08.300> mean<00:06:08.510> I<00:06:08.660> I<00:06:08.900> think<00:06:09.229> the<00:06:09.590> the

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
on the player I mean I I think the the

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.770 
on the player I mean I I think the the
marquee<00:06:10.640> players<00:06:10.970> the<00:06:11.210> guys<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.540> are<00:06:11.660> really

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
marquee players the guys that are really

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.420 
marquee players the guys that are really
in<00:06:11.990> demand<00:06:12.169> are<00:06:12.650> going<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:12.860> be<00:06:12.950> right<00:06:13.280> behind

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
in demand are going to be right behind

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.790 
in demand are going to be right behind
long<00:06:13.760> term<00:06:14.000> those<00:06:14.360> are<00:06:14.900> special<00:06:15.140> what<00:06:15.590> about

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
long term those are special what about

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.130 
long term those are special what about
the<00:06:15.919> rank<00:06:16.130> and<00:06:16.250> file<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.700> think<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.450> lot<00:06:17.870> of<00:06:18.020> those

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
the rank and file I think a lot of those

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.920 
the rank and file I think a lot of those
contracts<00:06:19.010> could<00:06:19.220> be<00:06:19.340> short-term<00:06:19.930> contracts

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
contracts could be short-term contracts

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.950 
contracts could be short-term contracts
I<00:06:21.050> think<00:06:21.229> that's<00:06:21.410> certainly<00:06:21.710> a<00:06:21.800> possibility

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
I think that's certainly a possibility

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.770 
I think that's certainly a possibility

you know it's going to be very hectic

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.530 
you know it's going to be very hectic
period<00:06:26.780> and<00:06:26.930> you're<00:06:27.020> not<00:06:27.169> going<00:06:27.289> to
