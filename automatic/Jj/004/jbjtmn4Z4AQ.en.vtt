00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the only thing I hate really is a fact

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.540 
the only thing I hate really is a fact
that<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> Google<00:00:37.530> search<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:38.280> 10

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
that if you do a Google search in top 10

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.060 
that if you do a Google search in top 10
top<00:00:38.879> 5<00:00:39.149> pre<00:00:39.360> workouts<00:00:39.780> whatnot<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.559> seems<00:00:40.890> like

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
top 5 pre workouts whatnot it seems like

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.670 
top 5 pre workouts whatnot it seems like
in<00:00:41.219> almost<00:00:41.550> every<00:00:41.910> case<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.899> thing<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.379> in

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
in almost every case this thing is in

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.910 
in almost every case this thing is in
the<00:00:44.100> list<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:44.899> maybe<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.410> good

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
the list so maybe it's really good

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
the list so maybe it's really good
and<00:00:47.010> maybe<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.789> one<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> few<00:00:48.570> people

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and maybe I'm just one of the few people

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.709 
and maybe I'm just one of the few people
out<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.170> who<00:00:49.440> find<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.280> c4<00:00:50.550> isn't<00:00:51.539> all

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
out there who find that c4 isn't all

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.260 
out there who find that c4 isn't all
that<00:00:52.129> but<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.640> works<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:54.059> other

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that but you know it works for other

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.069 
that but you know it works for other
people<00:00:54.920> but<00:00:55.920> um<00:00:56.180> it's<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.510> taken<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
people but um it's really taken to that

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.319 
people but um it's really taken to that

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
we just have to kind of look at what

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.799 
we just have to kind of look at what
this<00:01:00.420> programs<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.969> human<00:01:03.629> or

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
this programs with and we as a human or

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.710 
this programs with and we as a human or
us<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> human<00:01:04.760> what<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.689> our

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
us as a human what what it is that our

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.399 
us as a human what what it is that our
body

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
body

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
body
you<00:01:07.799> know<00:01:07.920> uses<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.970> react<00:01:09.570> with

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you know uses how do we react with

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
you know uses how do we react with
certain<00:01:10.070> ingredients<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.220> these<00:01:11.729> pre

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
certain ingredients in these pre

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
certain ingredients in these pre
workouts<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.560> reason<00:01:13.860> why<00:01:13.979> maybe<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.460> lot

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
workouts so the reason why maybe a lot

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.270 
workouts so the reason why maybe a lot
of<00:01:14.790> people<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.150> c-4<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> fact<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
of people like c-4 is the fact that it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.010 
of people like c-4 is the fact that it
doesn't<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> much<00:01:17.909> caffeine<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
doesn't have that much caffeine and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.100 
doesn't have that much caffeine and
let's<00:01:19.170> talk<00:01:19.380> about<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.799> scoop<00:01:20.070> size<00:01:20.720> um<00:01:21.720> one

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
let's talk about the scoop size um one

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.179 
let's talk about the scoop size um one
of<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> bad<00:01:22.409> things<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.710> want<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> say<00:01:23.040> this

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
of the bad things I want to say this

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.990 
of the bad things I want to say this
thing<00:01:23.340> doesn't<00:01:23.610> come<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.909> full<00:01:24.119> at<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
thing doesn't come to full at all and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.899 
thing doesn't come to full at all and
it's<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.560> practically<00:01:28.560> less<00:01:28.950> than<00:01:29.159> half<00:01:29.520> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it's like practically less than half of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.960 
it's like practically less than half of
this<00:01:30.450> container<00:01:30.840> comes<00:01:31.759> filled<00:01:32.759> with

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
this container comes filled with

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.580 
this container comes filled with
pre-workout<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.689> you're<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.229> getting

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
pre-workout so you're really not getting

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620 
pre-workout so you're really not getting
your<00:01:34.799> money's<00:01:35.159> worth<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.119> per<00:01:36.299> workup

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
your money's worth of this per workup

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
your money's worth of this per workup
and<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:36.869> another<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.590> say<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and that's another thing I can say that

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.219 
and that's another thing I can say that
I<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.369> about<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:39.049> however<00:01:40.049> this

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
I don't like about this however this

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
I don't like about this however this
isn't<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.829> mine<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.909> my<00:01:42.150> brother's<00:01:42.479> role

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
isn't really mine it's my brother's role

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.389 
isn't really mine it's my brother's role
no<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.899> didn't<00:01:43.229> ask<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> try<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.829> out<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.220> know

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
no I didn't ask to try it out you know

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.929 
no I didn't ask to try it out you know
and<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.810> gotta<00:01:46.020> say<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.460> worst

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
and I gotta say it's not the worst

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.240 
and I gotta say it's not the worst
pre-workout<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.840> also<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> best<00:01:49.530> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
pre-workout it's also not the best so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.010 
pre-workout it's also not the best so
it's<00:01:50.430> kind<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.790> an<00:01:50.880> average<00:01:51.270> pre-workout

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's kind of like an average pre-workout

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.830 
it's kind of like an average pre-workout
this<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.380> how<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> powder<00:01:52.829> looks<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.840> over

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
this is how the powder looks like over

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.800 
this is how the powder looks like over
here<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.729> one<00:01:57.030> scoop<00:01:57.270> size<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.509> think

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
here and this is one scoop size I think

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.090 
here and this is one scoop size I think
it's<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.170> six<00:01:58.500> point<00:01:58.829> five<00:01:59.219> grams<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:01.100> powder

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it's a six point five grams of powder

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.730 
it's a six point five grams of powder
per<00:02:02.729> scoop<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.719> dump<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> into<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
per scoop and just dump it into the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.029 
per scoop and just dump it into the
shaker<00:02:05.040> yes<00:02:05.399> I'm<00:02:05.549> using<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.850> shaker<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.329> time

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
shaker yes I'm using a shaker this time

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.999 
shaker yes I'm using a shaker this time
because<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.220> safe<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.670> use<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.819> shaker<00:02:09.890> why<00:02:10.890> am

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
because it's safe to use a shaker why am

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.110 
because it's safe to use a shaker why am
I<00:02:11.099> saying<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.550> safe

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
I saying it's safe

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.550 
I saying it's safe
the<00:02:12.270> some<00:02:12.510> pro<00:02:12.629> records

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the some pro records

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
the some pro records
actually<00:02:13.830> tell<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> use<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> shaker<00:02:15.900> by

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
actually tell you not to use a shaker by

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.809 
actually tell you not to use a shaker by
the<00:02:16.260> way<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.739> haven't<00:02:16.890> noticed<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.670> the

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
the way if you haven't noticed and the

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.309 
the way if you haven't noticed and the
color<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.060> moving<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.630> because<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.080> ice

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
color is moving this because it's ice

color is moving this because it's ice
blue<00:02:19.830> raspberry<00:02:20.250> now<00:02:21.090> let's<00:02:21.270> talk<00:02:21.360> about<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
blue raspberry now let's talk about the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.390 
blue raspberry now let's talk about the
ingredients<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.230> why<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.560> thing<00:02:22.739> is<00:02:22.920> really

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
ingredients and why this thing is really

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.570 
ingredients and why this thing is really
you<00:02:24.239> know<00:02:24.270> off<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.780> chain<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:26.190> why<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> lot<00:02:26.459> of

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
you know off the chain and why a lot of

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.339 
you know off the chain and why a lot of
people<00:02:26.700> probably<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> first

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
people probably like it so the first

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.630 
people probably like it so the first
things<00:02:28.500> first<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.069> point<00:02:29.280> out<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
things first we want to point out the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.390 
things first we want to point out the
caffeine<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.269> loads<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.980> caffeine<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.340> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
caffeine the loads of caffeine is it a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.130 
caffeine the loads of caffeine is it a
lot<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.849> it<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> little<00:02:33.239> bit<00:02:33.480> no<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:33.959> not

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
lot is it a little bit no it's not

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.040 
lot is it a little bit no it's not
actually<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:35.010> only<00:02:35.220> 150<00:02:35.940> milligrams<00:02:36.390> per

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
actually it's only 150 milligrams per

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.400 
actually it's only 150 milligrams per
scoop<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.739> if<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:39.540> look<00:02:39.900> at<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.019> pre-workout

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
scoop and if you look at a pre-workout

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.320 
scoop and if you look at a pre-workout
that<00:02:40.650> I'm<00:02:40.739> taking<00:02:41.130> really<00:02:41.430> right<00:02:41.790> now<00:02:41.819> which

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
that I'm taking really right now which

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.470 
that I'm taking really right now which
is<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.630> dyno<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.530> has<00:02:43.890> 400<00:02:44.760> milligrams<00:02:45.209> of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
is the dyno it has 400 milligrams of

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.920 
is the dyno it has 400 milligrams of
caffeine<00:02:45.750> versus<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.830> guy<00:02:47.069> that<00:02:47.370> has<00:02:47.580> only

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
caffeine versus this guy that has only

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.539 
caffeine versus this guy that has only
150<00:02:48.930> milligrams<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.440> caffeine<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.950> scoop

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
150 milligrams of caffeine and the scoop

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.330 
150 milligrams of caffeine and the scoop
sizes<00:02:51.060> are<00:02:51.239> almost<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.230> same<00:02:52.260> probably<00:02:53.040> by

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
sizes are almost the same probably by

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.949 
sizes are almost the same probably by
one<00:02:53.370> gram<00:02:53.910> less<00:02:54.269> or<00:02:54.510> more<00:02:54.900> um<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:57.420> doesn't<00:02:57.750> have

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
one gram less or more um it doesn't have

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.530 
one gram less or more um it doesn't have
much<00:02:58.349> in<00:02:58.560> there<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:59.040> say<00:02:59.220> like<00:02:59.519> that's<00:02:59.700> unusual

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
much in there to say like that's unusual

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.229 
much in there to say like that's unusual
I<00:03:01.040> see<00:03:02.040> there's<00:03:02.250> creatine<00:03:02.700> in<00:03:02.819> there<00:03:02.970> there's

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
I see there's creatine in there there's

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.289 
I see there's creatine in there there's
arginine<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:04.230> there's<00:03:04.700> l-tyrosine<00:03:05.700> which<00:03:06.180> is

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
arginine on there's l-tyrosine which is

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.750 
arginine on there's l-tyrosine which is
all<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:07.080> whole<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.739> explosive<00:03:08.280> energy<00:03:08.580> blend

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
all be whole the explosive energy blend

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.570 
all be whole the explosive energy blend
contains<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.690> caffeine<00:03:10.080> area<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.340> fiend

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
contains the caffeine area like a fiend

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.030 
contains the caffeine area like a fiend
it<00:03:11.819> has<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.870> altair<00:03:13.349> sign<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.860> only

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
it has the altair sign and the only

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.650 
it has the altair sign and the only
thing<00:03:14.160> that<00:03:14.250> has<00:03:14.400> me<00:03:14.670> really<00:03:14.940> thinking<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:15.599> I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
thing that has me really thinking and I

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.360 
thing that has me really thinking and I
decided<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.140> do<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> quick<00:03:16.530> little<00:03:16.709> research<00:03:17.130> on

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
decided to do a quick little research on

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.580 
decided to do a quick little research on
this<00:03:17.579> thing<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.810> thing<00:03:19.049> called<00:03:19.320> the

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
this thing is this thing called the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.610 
this thing is this thing called the
velvet<00:03:20.130> bean<00:03:20.489> seed<00:03:21.209> extract<00:03:21.660> it's<00:03:22.290> one<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
velvet bean seed extract it's one of the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.170 
velvet bean seed extract it's one of the
ingredients<00:03:22.739> listed<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.670> may<00:03:23.910> not<00:03:23.940> be

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
ingredients listed here you may not be

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.000 
ingredients listed here you may not be
able<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.359> see<00:03:24.570> it<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.590> did<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.799> quick

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
able to see it but I did a quick

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.530 
able to see it but I did a quick
research<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.850> turns<00:03:27.090> out<00:03:27.269> this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
research on it and it turns out this

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.949 
research on it and it turns out this
velvet<00:03:28.049> bean<00:03:28.320> thing<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.970> sort<00:03:30.569> of<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.810> on

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
velvet bean thing it's a sort of like on

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.099 
velvet bean thing it's a sort of like on
medicine<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.680> treating<00:03:32.069> pain<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:33.329> says

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
medicine for treating pain it says

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.569 
medicine for treating pain it says
reduces<00:03:34.530> inflammation<00:03:34.769> increases

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
reduces inflammation increases

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.930 
reduces inflammation increases
testosterone<00:03:35.970> um<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.260> terms<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.670> bite

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
testosterone um in terms of the bite

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.750 
testosterone um in terms of the bite
area<00:03:39.180> uh<00:03:39.920> we're<00:03:40.920> looking<00:03:41.010> at<00:03:41.250> snake<00:03:41.549> bite

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
area uh we're looking at snake bite

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.640 
area uh we're looking at snake bite
scorpion<00:03:42.299> bites<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.930> kind<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.109> treats<00:03:43.350> some

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
scorpion bites so it kind of treats some

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.940 
scorpion bites so it kind of treats some
pain<00:03:44.639> from<00:03:44.910> poison<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.630> guess<00:03:45.900> from<00:03:46.319> snake

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
nervous system and all that whatnot so

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.550 
nervous system and all that whatnot so
that's<00:04:02.340> why<00:04:02.639> it's<00:04:02.880> found<00:04:03.480> in<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:04.170> thing<00:04:04.530> so

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
that's why it's found in this thing so

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.069 
that's why it's found in this thing so
basically<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.549> an<00:04:05.639> all-around<00:04:06.480> type<00:04:06.900> of

basically it's an all-around type of

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.800 
basically it's an all-around type of
ingredient<00:04:07.769> as<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:09.060> can<00:04:09.180> see<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.450> the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
ingredient as you can see the the

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.569 
ingredient as you can see the the
contents<00:04:10.380> are<00:04:10.470> kind<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.709> settling<00:04:11.130> in<00:04:11.340> without

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
contents are kind of settling in without

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.789 
contents are kind of settling in without
any<00:04:11.819> shaking<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:12.480> obviously<00:04:12.989> this<00:04:13.230> thing<00:04:13.290> has

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
any shaking so obviously this thing has

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.750 
any shaking so obviously this thing has
a<00:04:14.069> great<00:04:14.549> mix<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.420> with<00:04:15.959> little<00:04:16.229> effort

to 20 minutes I'm you'll always feel the
beta-alanine<00:05:44.789> burst<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:45.889> it<00:05:46.889> doesn't<00:05:47.520> um<00:05:48.300> for

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
beta-alanine burst and it doesn't um for

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.439 
beta-alanine burst and it doesn't um for
me<00:05:49.110> it's<00:05:49.349> not<00:05:49.560> long<00:05:49.919> long<00:05:50.190> long<00:05:50.400> lasting<00:05:50.969> but

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
me it's not long long long lasting but

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.390 
me it's not long long long lasting but
it<00:05:51.539> does<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.840> job<00:05:52.080> I<00:05:52.349> guess<00:05:52.830> because<00:05:53.099> of<00:05:53.250> the

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
it does the job I guess because of the

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.339 
it does the job I guess because of the
Kathina<00:05:53.759> and<00:05:53.969> as<00:05:54.300> always<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:54.990> know<00:05:55.080> caffeine

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
is elves the main ingredient in terms of

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.589 
is elves the main ingredient in terms of
energy<00:05:57.330> from<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.229> pre-workout<00:05:58.969> so<00:05:59.969> if<00:06:00.389> you're
