a<00:00:36.630> normal<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.910> probably

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
a normal way and it's this is probably

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.020 
a normal way and it's this is probably
the<00:00:39.540> easiest<00:00:41.300> lens<00:00:42.300> maybe<00:00:42.510> less<00:00:42.780> he<00:00:42.960> use<00:00:44.030> here

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030

not too good but I open it up and I see
fairly<00:00:59.489> reassuring<00:01:00.180> mental<00:01:00.480> parts<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
fairly reassuring mental parts and I

fairly reassuring mental parts and I
also<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:04.229> thing<00:01:04.290> which<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:06.260> device

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
also have this thing which is a device

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
also have this thing which is a device
for<00:01:08.270> inserting<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.750> stops<00:01:10.049> take<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.220> little

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
for inserting the stops take this little

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.140 
for inserting the stops take this little
magnetic<00:01:12.330> piece<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.880> just

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
magnetic piece right here and you just

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
magnetic piece right here and you just
lift<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.430> this<00:01:17.430> stop<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.439> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> history<00:01:19.950> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
lift out this stop and in the history of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.359 
lift out this stop and in the history of
photography<00:01:20.570> this<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.200> stop<00:01:22.860> that's<00:01:23.189> what

to stop is physically it's a it's a kind
of<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:29.070> piece<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.270> black<00:01:30.450> material<00:01:30.960> with

of like a a piece of black material with
a<00:01:31.140> hole<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.409> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
a hole in it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.510 
a hole in it
and<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:33.540> stop<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.040> now<00:01:35.070> is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and the stop that's in here right now is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.340 
and the stop that's in here right now is
at<00:01:35.880> four<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.430> they've<00:01:38.970> got<00:01:39.210> stops<00:01:40.110> for

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
at four and and they've got stops for

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
at four and and they've got stops for
oddly<00:01:40.710> F<00:01:41.040> stops<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:41.939> such<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:43.460> 2.8<00:01:44.460> now<00:01:44.729> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
oddly F stops in here such as 2.8 now I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
oddly F stops in here such as 2.8 now I
don't<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.799> guys<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:47.490> but

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
don't know if you guys can see this but

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.319 
don't know if you guys can see this but
the<00:01:47.880> 2.8<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.770> diameter<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.579> twice<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.090> size

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the 2.8 the diameter is twice the size

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.160 
the 2.8 the diameter is twice the size
of<00:01:51.720> f/4<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:53.100> 2.8<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.149> one<00:01:54.390> stop<00:01:54.659> farther

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
of f/4 because 2.8 is one stop farther

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.580 
of f/4 because 2.8 is one stop farther
open<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> farther<00:01:56.159> opened<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> stop<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
open and the farther opened the stop the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
open and the farther opened the stop the
the<00:01:58.590> tighter<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.219> depth<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.939> field<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
the tighter the depth of field the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:08.950 
the tighter the depth of field the
smaller<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.320> field<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.710> focus<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:04.159> drop<00:02:05.159> in

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:16.570 

the<00:02:09.729> F<00:02:10.729> for<00:02:11.860> stop<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:14.980> drops<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.190> just<00:02:16.430> like

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
the F for stop and drops in just like

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.140 
the F for stop and drops in just like
this<00:02:16.790> very<00:02:17.720> easy<00:02:17.990> it's<00:02:18.950> got<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.190> really<00:02:19.580> nice

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
this very easy it's got a really nice

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.350 
this very easy it's got a really nice
aluminum<00:02:23.230> rear<00:02:24.230> right<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:24.920> all<00:02:25.730> mental

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
aluminum rear right here all mental

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.360 
aluminum rear right here all mental
parts<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:28.209> it's<00:02:29.209> actually<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:30.190> much<00:02:31.190> better

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
parts and so it's actually a much better

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.180 
parts and so it's actually a much better
builds<00:02:31.940> than<00:02:32.120> I<00:02:32.270> was<00:02:32.450> led<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.660> believe<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.830> I'm

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
builds than I was led to believe so I'm

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.910 
builds than I was led to believe so I'm
happy<00:02:34.730> with<00:02:35.000> that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.320 

okay<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.850> fits<00:02:41.090> nice<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.330> snug<00:02:41.540> yeah<00:02:42.470> this

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
okay it fits nice and snug yeah this

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.070 
okay it fits nice and snug yeah this
black<00:02:44.330> ring<00:02:44.720> right<00:02:45.110> here<00:02:46.600> can<00:02:47.600> be<00:02:47.780> tightened

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
black ring right here can be tightened

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.100 
black ring right here can be tightened
and<00:02:48.350> loosened<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:49.130> what<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.519> does<00:02:49.790> is<00:02:50.180> it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
and loosened and what it does is it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.430 
and loosened and what it does is it
allows<00:02:51.850> for<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.180> ball<00:02:53.810> joint<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:55.459> move<00:02:56.440> more

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
allows for this ball joint to move more

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.979 
allows for this ball joint to move more
easily<00:02:57.890> or<00:02:58.220> or<00:02:59.019> or<00:03:00.019> less<00:03:00.680> easily<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:04.989> you

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
easily or or or less easily and so you

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.750 
easily or or or less easily and so you

that a lot of folks who are interested
into<00:04:37.370> this<00:04:37.520> lens<00:04:37.789> baby<00:04:38.060> probably<00:04:38.389> use<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.810> lot

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
into this lens baby probably use a lot

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.060 
into this lens baby probably use a lot
of<00:04:39.160> zoom<00:04:40.160> lenses<00:04:40.669> because<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:42.229> prime<00:04:42.830> lens

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
of zoom lenses because a prime lens

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.379 
of zoom lenses because a prime lens
shooter<00:04:43.520> can<00:04:43.789> can<00:04:44.419> achieve<00:04:44.930> that<00:04:46.090> type<00:04:47.090> of

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
shooter can can achieve that type of

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.409 
shooter can can achieve that type of
look<00:04:48.050> without<00:04:51.580> necessarily<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.729> toy<00:04:53.000> camera

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
look without necessarily that toy camera

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.700 
look without necessarily that toy camera
look<00:04:53.599> so<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.750> think<00:04:53.990> it's<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.169> matter<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.440> choice

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
look so I think it's a matter of choice

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.240 
look so I think it's a matter of choice
if<00:04:55.010> you<00:04:55.130> want<00:04:55.400> those<00:04:55.669> really<00:04:56.770> shallow<00:04:57.770> shots

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
if you want those really shallow shots

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.450 
if you want those really shallow shots
with<00:04:58.880> with<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.870> lot<00:05:00.169> of<00:05:00.200> blur<00:05:00.560> in<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.130> rest<00:05:01.310> of

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
with with a lot of blur in the rest of

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.240 
with with a lot of blur in the rest of
the<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:02.330> frame<00:05:02.599> it's<00:05:03.260> it's<00:05:03.650> really<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.979> choice

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
the the frame it's it's really a choice

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.830 
the the frame it's it's really a choice
whether<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.700> want<00:05:04.849> to<00:05:05.240> do<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.570> with<00:05:05.810> a
