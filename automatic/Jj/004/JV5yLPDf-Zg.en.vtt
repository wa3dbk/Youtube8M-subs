00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it's pretty cool is I basically just I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929 
it's pretty cool is I basically just I
set<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> up<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:08.010> big<00:01:08.280> system<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
set it up so this is one big system so

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
set it up so this is one big system so
both<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.299> these<00:01:09.540> tanks<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.049> plumbing<00:01:10.380> into

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
both of these tanks are plumbing into

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.600 
both of these tanks are plumbing into
this<00:01:10.830> sump<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.510> did<00:01:12.689> was<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
this sump right here all I did was I

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.010 
this sump right here all I did was I
drilled<00:01:16.520> wait<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.790> drilled<00:01:18.390> right<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
drilled wait I drilled right here in the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800 
drilled wait I drilled right here in the
back<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> tank<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.939> basically<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.630> don't

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
back of the tank so basically I don't

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
back of the tank so basically I don't
need<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> pump<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.439> pump<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> water<00:01:22.860> out<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
need a pump to pump the water out it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.950 
need a pump to pump the water out it
just<00:01:23.700> drains<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.390> main<00:01:27.630> pump

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
just drains out and then on my main pump

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.679 
just drains out and then on my main pump
right<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.740> set<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.759> put<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> tee<00:01:30.420> right

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
right here I set up I put a tee right

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
right here I set up I put a tee right
there<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> was<00:01:31.229> valve<00:01:32.360> which<00:01:33.360> runs<00:01:34.130> up<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
there it was valve which runs up to the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.630 
there it was valve which runs up to the
tank<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.200> basically<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.290> have<00:01:37.530> about<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.130> said<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
tank so basically I have about I said it

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.850 
tank so basically I have about I said it
so<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.329> about<00:01:39.509> 40%<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> smaller

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so I have about 40% this is a smaller

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980 
so I have about 40% this is a smaller
tank<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> right<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.540> about

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
tank the one on the right I have about

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.620 
tank the one on the right I have about
40%<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.920> flow<00:01:44.189> coming<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.299> pump

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
40% of the flow coming out of this pump

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.800 
40% of the flow coming out of this pump
40%<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.280> way<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.880> 60%<00:01:48.570> going

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
40% of it going that way and 60% going

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
40% of it going that way and 60% going
that<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.140> because<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.950> obviously<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that way because this is obviously a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.420 
that way because this is obviously a
bigger<00:01:50.670> tank<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.119> needs<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.570> flow<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:53.070> is

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
bigger tank at needs more flow it is

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.460 
bigger tank at needs more flow it is
working<00:01:53.939> brilliantly<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.079> surprised

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
working brilliantly I'm really surprised

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.530 
working brilliantly I'm really surprised
I'm<00:01:56.369> really<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.880> surprised<00:01:57.240> at<00:01:57.390> how<00:01:57.509> well

I'm really really surprised at how well

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.240 
I'm really really surprised at how well
it's<00:01:57.960> working<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.560> got<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.070> first

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
delicate coral tank and the reason I

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.760 
delicate coral tank and the reason I
wanted<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> plumb<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.660> into<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.020> one<00:02:49.230> sump<00:02:49.590> is

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
wanted to plumb it into this one sump is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.330 
wanted to plumb it into this one sump is
because<00:02:50.100> as<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.550> know<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:52.800> know<00:02:52.920> with<00:02:53.100> nano

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
because as you know you know with nano

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.770 
because as you know you know with nano
tanks<00:02:53.850> it's<00:02:53.970> kind<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.210> assumed<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.630> can

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
tanks it's kind of assumed that it can

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.020 
tanks it's kind of assumed that it can
be<00:02:54.900> hard<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.220> time<00:02:56.220> on<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.520> to<00:02:56.640> keep<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.000> water

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
be hard to time on it to keep the water

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.210 
be hard to time on it to keep the water
quality<00:02:57.420> good<00:02:58.290> because<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.860> know<00:02:58.950> you're<00:02:59.070> not

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
quality good because you know you're not

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.610 
quality good because you know you're not
you're<00:02:59.850> working<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.270> such<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.540> small<00:03:00.930> volume

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
you're working with such a small volume

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.410 
you're working with such a small volume
of<00:03:01.860> water<00:03:02.070> if<00:03:02.400> something<00:03:02.640> goes<00:03:02.790> wrong<00:03:02.880> it's

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
of water if something goes wrong it's

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.220 
of water if something goes wrong it's
just<00:03:03.480> amplified<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.580> really

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
just amplified so this is really

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.360 
just amplified so this is really
plumbing<00:03:07.230> into<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.530> into<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:07.950> making<00:03:08.310> it

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
plumbing into this into this making it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.770 
plumbing into this into this making it
one<00:03:08.520> big<00:03:08.670> system<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.330> gonna<00:03:09.510> help<00:03:09.690> me

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
one big system is really gonna help me

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.960 
one big system is really gonna help me
out<00:03:10.050> growing<00:03:10.560> hard<00:03:11.010> corals<00:03:11.400> because<00:03:11.640> as<00:03:11.850> you
