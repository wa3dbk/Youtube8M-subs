about<00:00:04.259> plugins<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.660> I've<00:00:06.660> got<00:00:06.930> quite<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.259> few

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
about plugins and I've got quite a few

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.480 
about plugins and I've got quite a few
of<00:00:07.649> them<00:00:07.770> in<00:00:08.010> my<00:00:08.519> arsenal<00:00:08.960> run<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> MacBook<00:00:10.440> Pro

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
of them in my arsenal run a MacBook Pro

of them in my arsenal run a MacBook Pro
I<00:00:11.490> am<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.660> much<00:00:12.840> into<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.230> plugin<00:00:13.530> thing<00:00:13.969> that

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
I am so much into this plugin thing that

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.510 
I am so much into this plugin thing that
I<00:00:15.330> will<00:00:15.960> be<00:00:16.080> making<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.470> plunge<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.490> a

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
I will be making the plunge to a

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.220 
I will be making the plunge to a
solid-state<00:00:18.180> drive

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
solid-state drive

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.470 
solid-state drive
not<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> spinning<00:00:20.250> hard<00:00:20.430> drive<00:00:20.520> was<00:00:21.090> you

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
not that the spinning hard drive was you

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.400 
not that the spinning hard drive was you
know<00:00:21.980> was<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:24.119> bad<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.810> serving<00:00:25.320> me

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
know was a is was bad it was serving me

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.070 
know was a is was bad it was serving me
well<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.279> trying<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.000> find<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> fastest

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
well you know trying to find the fastest

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
well you know trying to find the fastest
interface<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.859> then<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.099> found<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
interface and then I found out that you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.110 
interface and then I found out that you
know<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:31.170> pull<00:00:31.410> many<00:00:32.099> times<00:00:32.489> more<00:00:35.120> voices

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
know you can pull many times more voices

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.350 
know you can pull many times more voices
and<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.290> get<00:00:37.440> far<00:00:38.340> better<00:00:38.610> performance<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and just get far better performance and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.569 
and just get far better performance and
better<00:00:39.420> stability<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.590> solid<00:00:41.430> state

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
better stability because solid state

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
better stability because solid state
drives<00:00:41.820> don't<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.149> any<00:00:42.300> moving<00:00:42.510> parts<00:00:42.629> out

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
drives don't have any moving parts out

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.959 
drives don't have any moving parts out
of<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.620> solid-state<00:00:44.040> drive<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.940> just

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
of a solid-state drive it just they just

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.049 
of a solid-state drive it just they just
cost<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.600> lot<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.110> an<00:00:47.100> external<00:00:47.550> solid-state

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
cost a lot so an external solid-state

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.510 
cost a lot so an external solid-state
drive<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.600> uses<00:00:49.050> Apple's<00:00:49.410> Thunderbolt<00:00:49.920> will

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
drive that uses Apple's Thunderbolt will

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.459 
drive that uses Apple's Thunderbolt will
run<00:00:50.760> me<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.239> three<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.719> half<00:00:51.750> which<00:00:52.440> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
run me about three and a half which is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.689 
run me about three and a half which is
that's<00:00:53.370> kind<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.760> steep<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:55.170> anyway<00:00:55.699> let's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that's kind of steep but anyway let's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.360 
that's kind of steep but anyway let's
let's<00:00:57.379> look<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.530> some<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.800> these<00:00:58.890> plugins<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
let's look at some of these plugins that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.619 
let's look at some of these plugins that
I<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.670> off<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.809> old<00:01:01.050> fashioned<00:01:01.620> spinning

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
I have off of my old fashioned spinning

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.350 
I have off of my old fashioned spinning
7200<00:01:03.629> rpm<00:01:04.049> SATA<00:01:04.589> drive<00:01:05.030> this<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.270> ivory<00:01:06.600> -<00:01:08.360> let

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
7200 rpm SATA drive this is ivory - let

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.200 
7200 rpm SATA drive this is ivory - let
me<00:01:09.600> click<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.680> where<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.250> yeah<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.880> go

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
ivory - right there and this is the

ivory - right there and this is the
American<00:01:17.070> Dee<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.600> did<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> video<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.439> this

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
American Dee and I did a video on this

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.510 
American Dee and I did a video on this
before<00:01:21.350> regarding<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.710> benchmarking<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
before regarding the benchmarking of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.890 
before regarding the benchmarking of
that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.789 

and

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.160 

and<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.429> a<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:38.070> has<00:01:38.880> body<00:01:39.270> tip<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and it's a it's very it has body tip to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.499 
and it's a it's very it has body tip to
me<00:01:40.320> uh<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.429> it's<00:01:41.759> different

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
me uh it's it's different

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.139 
me uh it's it's different
I've<00:01:42.740> done<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:44.100> tweaking<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.000> then<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
I've done some tweaking to it and then I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.169 
I've done some tweaking to it and then I
went<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> had<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> listen<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:47.179> synthesise

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
went in and had to listen to synthesise

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.209 
went in and had to listen to synthesise
presets<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.079> found<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.069> are

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
presets and found that some of them are

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.609 
presets and found that some of them are
pretty<00:01:50.520> good<00:01:50.640> they're<00:01:50.909> vanilla<00:01:51.270> one<00:01:51.560> they<00:01:52.560> do

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
pretty good they're vanilla one they do

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.459 
pretty good they're vanilla one they do
turn<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.219> dynamic<00:01:53.700> range<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.240> lot<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
turn up the dynamic range a lot on it

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.859 
turn up the dynamic range a lot on it
and<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> pedal<00:01:57.119> noise<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.479> which<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
and they have the pedal noise on which I

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.160 
and they have the pedal noise on which I
don't<00:01:57.929> I<00:01:58.350> mean<00:01:58.920> care<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> turn<00:02:00.569> that<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
don't I mean care for I turn that up and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.209 
don't I mean care for I turn that up and
go<00:02:02.039> check<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.579> pedal<00:02:02.909> noise<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:04.219> one

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
go check it out pedal noise and one

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.749 
go check it out pedal noise and one
thing<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> I've<00:02:05.610> noticed<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
thing that I've noticed is that the

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.360 
thing that I've noticed is that the
sustain<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.090> sympathetic<00:02:09.450> resonance<00:02:10.370> takes

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
sustain the sympathetic resonance takes

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.660 
sustain the sympathetic resonance takes
some<00:02:12.120> CPU<00:02:12.660> resources<00:02:13.069> but<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.099> mean<00:02:14.370> I've

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
some CPU resources but I mean I've

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.819 
some CPU resources but I mean I've
gotten<00:02:14.970> an<00:02:15.209> 8-quart<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.349> even<00:02:16.590> though<00:02:16.680> it's

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
gotten an 8-quart here even though it's

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:18.890 
gotten an 8-quart here even though it's
an<00:02:16.920> old<00:02:17.099> one<00:02:17.430> from<00:02:17.519> 2008<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.420> don't<00:02:18.599> have<00:02:18.720> any

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
an old one from 2008 I don't have any

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.150 
an old one from 2008 I don't have any
problem<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.200> horsepower<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.069> my

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
problem with horsepower and then my
