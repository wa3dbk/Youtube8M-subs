00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.960
 Hello today, February 28, 15 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.430
 thousands of people around the world and argue 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.110
 what color is the dress in the photo which 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.209
 put all ns feelings to the singer of the loop 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.860
 hinted something two close eyebrows 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.469
 gathered to get married and mother to the bride 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.420
 sent photos of this dress 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.490
 when the bride showed the dress to the groom they 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.590
 argued because of its color, some say 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.689
 I suppose that the black blue others see white 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.339
 gold is already out well in the original 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.990
 the board is really blue with black but 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.640
 why the part user sees it as 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.529
 white with gold let 's see if 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.509
 digital this and consists of tiny 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.430
 elements that form the surface 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.079
 images and so-called pixels 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.760
 when no detail could appear 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.460
 display each element gives us 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.460
 a combination of three primary colors 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.379
 red green and blue changes 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.960
 the sine of each color here we get 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.699
 specific perception of light if then 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.590
 same time display is illuminated by external 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.420
 With light, this light is reflected and 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.609
 mixed with that which emits 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.140
 each picture element everything in general 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.300
 perceived optics eyes perrin 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.160
 determined by the retina a huge role in 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.809
 tom perception pictures may not play 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.699
 the individual features of that eye 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.740
 another person is the ability 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.380
 register those three main 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.210
 colors we talked about above vision 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.009
 just adjust and then this minute hatch 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.799
 let's go of the three primary colors between 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.700
 picture elements depends on 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.020
 Artov to the image I will prove to you that the dress 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.000
 blue with black lace 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.000
 of this i will save this image 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.510
 then I will open his memory here 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.380
 wonderful feature called palette 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.860
 with the help of which you can see the color 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.920
 dresses 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.230
 Well, first we will select the area that 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.510
 everyone sees the same pink 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.010
 region 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.870
 there is also pink now 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.430
 choose this area which 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:02.420
 some videos are black and some 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:04.970
 a golden network appeared black if 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.090
 choose this area that you see 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.570
 some white some blue is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:16.210
 a dark blue color we proved 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.210
 that the dress is blue with black lace
