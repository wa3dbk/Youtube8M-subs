00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.220
 surely they are imagining has 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.660
 what to do with the gym 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.730
 that's why they see me in this context a lot 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.860
 more informal surely they are not 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.200
 used to seeing me in this context 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.800
 because they always see me more formal if I 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.690
 somewhat casual but anyway 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.660

 dress appropriately in the gym how 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.250
 let's dress in these spaces that already 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.310
 they stopped being spaces to train 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.730
 Nowadays they are recreational spaces 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.470
 are social media and why then 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.329
 because you already find the person who 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.790
 is in your work and you are at 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.860

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.350

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.890
 healthy but we have the small risk 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.080
 that 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.659
 everything we are using as 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.180
 clothes will talk for us is going to 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.580

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.770
 we are then I must give three 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.860
 very specific recommendations for

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.880
 first and most important all that 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.610
 dressed in the gym speaks for you 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.110
 this is not worth using garments that 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.329
 they no longer use 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.430
 a recommendation but it is no longer valid 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.500
 do this kind of thing you're going to have to 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.820
 consider that all your clothes in the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.850
 gym or in any activity 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.480
 merely after training or 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.950
 physical activity will walk for you 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.560
 2 the old clothes is not to go to 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.450
 gym happens to me a lot when I'm going to give 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.670
 advice and I will do analysis of 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.320
 wardrobe with my clients 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.330
 Customs that tell me is already the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.460
 I'm going to take it out or better leave it for the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.300
 gym now that I'm in this in this 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.700
 environment there are no specific clothes to go 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.830
 to the gym as well as you buy clothes 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.170
 for winter or shopping clothes for the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.140
 summer you have to buy clothes for 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.870
 do exercise there specific shoes 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.420
 to exercise there are shorts there 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.690
 pants there are licras there t-shirts 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.070
 specific to exercise and 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.960
 according to what you are looking for 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.660
 communicate you have to acquire them 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.600
 2 then you will not use the clothes 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.730
 old to go to the gym and the third 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.290
 recommendation is that you consider very well 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.100
 your characteristics and proportions 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.170
 physical what that means is true 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.000
 that going to the gym allows us 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.740
 wear fairer clothing than 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.650
 we usually use it 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.610
 wear clothes that are more tight 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.950
 but you have to consider your 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.410
 physical characteristics not at all we 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.720
 it's all there will be people who can 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.250
 use the most just clothing there will be who 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.500
 you can not use the clothes so fair and 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.330
 have to use a little more baggy 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.340
 you have to consider very well your 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.010
 physical characteristics and from 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.140
 there you will choose the color of the clothes that 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.820
 I passed you and I give you a tip, avoid the 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.130
 gray color that is being used a lot 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.900
 to go to the gym avoid it because this one 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.240
 It shows a lot of sweat when you're 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.250
 perspiring does not let see much is not 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.810
 the best color to go to the gym but 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.300
 you are going to choose the colors from your 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.160
 physical characteristics you will choose what 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.620
 you are going to use a few shorts three quarters 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.360
 or to the middle of the knee or above the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.770
 knee or if you're going to use light very 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.380
 just or if you're going to wear a t-shirt 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.080
 sleeves how are you going to use all that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.670
 it will depend on your characteristics 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.440
 physical much eye with the combinations 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.570
 what are you doing because suddenly in the 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.850
 gym I run into combinations that 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.250
 you say because it occurred to him to combine this 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.840
 color with this other we suddenly believe 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.700
 that the gym allows us to do 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.220
 very strange or folkloric combinations 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.920
 and this is not the case, we have to keep just 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.860
 the proportions like when we dress the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.630
