though even though they're thralls are
meant<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.800> be<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:52.920> kind<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.490> there<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.790> get

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
meant to be just kind of there to get

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.650 
meant to be just kind of there to get
munched<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.450> they<00:02:55.140> also<00:02:55.350> have<00:02:55.650> okay<00:02:56.040> stats<00:02:56.660> so

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
munched on they also have okay stats so

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.060 
munched on they also have okay stats so
they're<00:02:57.900> still<00:02:58.110> stronger<00:02:58.440> than<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.620> halfling

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070

so<00:03:00.750> more<00:03:01.200> or<00:03:01.290> less<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.950> pretty<00:03:02.460> solid

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
so more or less it's a pretty solid
