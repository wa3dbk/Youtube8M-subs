00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.259 
now as you can see here just like take
that<00:04:00.319> situation<00:04:00.830> for<00:04:01.010> example<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.580> knew<00:04:02.239> that

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
that situation for example I knew that

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.120 
that situation for example I knew that
that<00:04:02.630> enemy<00:04:03.230> was<00:04:03.380> coming<00:04:03.650> because<00:04:03.769> I<00:04:03.980> could

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
that enemy was coming because I could

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.430 
that enemy was coming because I could
hear<00:04:04.430> him<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.690> positioned<00:04:05.690> myself<00:04:05.690> in<00:04:06.140> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
hear him I positioned myself in a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.300 
hear him I positioned myself in a
location<00:04:06.830> where<00:04:07.269> I<00:04:08.269> would<00:04:09.200> be<00:04:09.350> close<00:04:09.769> within<00:04:10.130> a

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
location where I would be close within a

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.580 
location where I would be close within a
knifing<00:04:10.700> range<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.019> when<00:04:12.230> we<00:04:12.260> did

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
knifing range so that when we did

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.530 
knifing range so that when we did
encounter<00:04:12.769> I<00:04:13.400> would<00:04:13.580> have<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.940> upper<00:04:14.209> hand<00:04:14.239> in

the advantage I'm a lot of the enemies
we're<00:04:19.010> actually<00:04:19.220> running<00:04:19.639> like<00:04:19.970> fmg9<00:04:20.389> akin

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
we're actually running like fmg9 akin

the model but that FMT niner kimbos in
the<00:04:29.180> strike<00:04:29.479> even<00:04:29.810> go<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.020> hell<00:04:31.180> come<00:04:32.180> so<00:04:32.630> that

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
the strike even go to hell come so that

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.320 
the strike even go to hell come so that
basically<00:04:33.289> sort<00:04:33.800> of<00:04:33.919> far<00:04:34.190> in<00:04:34.400> more<00:04:34.820> if<00:04:35.000> further

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
basically sort of far in more if further

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.300 
basically sort of far in more if further
amplifies<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.320> point<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.650> I'm<00:04:36.770> previously

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
amplifies the point that I'm previously

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.440 
amplifies the point that I'm previously
sort<00:04:37.729> of<00:04:37.789> trying<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.060> get<00:04:38.150> across<00:04:39.160> basically

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
sort of trying to get across basically

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.760 
sort of trying to get across basically
shotguns<00:04:41.450> are<00:04:41.570> actually<00:04:41.960> also<00:04:42.140> played<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.740> a

the fastest killing fastest killing rate

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.490 
the fastest killing fastest killing rate
out<00:04:57.289> of<00:04:57.380> any<00:04:57.500> gun<00:04:57.710> in<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:57.919> game<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:59.380> out<00:05:00.380> of

one<00:05:07.090> shot<00:05:07.300> one<00:05:07.330> kill<00:05:07.479> so<00:05:08.440> basically<00:05:08.940> you<00:05:09.940> need

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
one shot one kill so basically you need

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.820 
one shot one kill so basically you need

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
that knifing range and you need to be

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.950 
that knifing range and you need to be
quick<00:05:15.130> enough<00:05:15.280> and<00:05:15.610> responsive<00:05:16.539> enough<00:05:16.630> to

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
quick enough and responsive enough to

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.170
