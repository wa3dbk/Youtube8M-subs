 in black and then in it and it's very 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.520
 Probably the light will come out there by the 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.020
 2017 where we will all be three more years 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.240

 that you also count today a thousand dollars and its 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.740
 cost is due to the micro technology that 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.959

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.300
