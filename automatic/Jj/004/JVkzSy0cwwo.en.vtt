are out there I agree with him there are
fossils<00:00:40.820> of<00:00:41.149> dinosaurs<00:00:41.659> and<00:00:41.809> by<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.019> way<00:00:42.199> for

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
fossils of dinosaurs and by the way for

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.989 
fossils of dinosaurs and by the way for
the<00:00:42.530> Christians<00:00:42.890> out<00:00:43.010> there<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.370> say<00:00:43.550> hey

the Christians out there that say hey
Satan<00:00:44.449> just<00:00:44.600> put<00:00:44.780> those<00:00:44.899> dinosaur<00:00:45.409> bones<00:00:45.589> here

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
Satan just put those dinosaur bones here

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.069 
Satan just put those dinosaur bones here
to<00:00:45.890> fool<00:00:46.069> us<00:00:46.309> no<00:00:46.999> that's<00:00:47.329> actually<00:00:47.719> not<00:00:47.870> true

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
to fool us no that's actually not true

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.829 
to fool us no that's actually not true
they<00:00:48.319> really<00:00:48.920> did<00:00:49.219> live<00:00:49.699> we<00:00:50.359> talked<00:00:50.600> about

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
they really did live we talked about

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.090 
they really did live we talked about
that<00:00:50.989> on<00:00:51.019> a<00:00:51.140> regular<00:00:51.350> basis<00:00:51.890> they<00:00:52.039> were

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
that on a regular basis they were

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.680 
that on a regular basis they were
created<00:00:52.579> in<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.789> Garden<00:00:53.089> of<00:00:53.120> Eden<00:00:53.269> with<00:00:53.420> Adam

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
created in the Garden of Eden with Adam

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.569 
created in the Garden of Eden with Adam
and<00:00:53.749> Eve<00:00:53.929> they<00:00:54.499> really<00:00:54.890> did<00:00:55.129> live<00:00:55.280> they<00:00:55.489> were

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
and Eve they really did live they were

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.279 
and Eve they really did live they were
on<00:00:55.729> the<00:00:55.850> ark<00:00:55.999> with<00:00:56.149> Noah<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.629> they've<00:00:57.109> always

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
on the ark with Noah and they've always

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.169 
on the ark with Noah and they've always
lived<00:00:57.589> with<00:00:57.769> mankind<00:00:58.339> throughout<00:00:58.639> history<00:00:58.850> I

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
lived with mankind throughout history I

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.910 
lived with mankind throughout history I
suspect<00:00:59.690> this<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.839> what<00:01:00.079> he's<00:01:00.199> alluding<00:01:00.649> to

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
suspect this is what he's alluding to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.060 
suspect this is what he's alluding to
the<00:01:01.460> idea<00:01:01.819> some<00:01:02.859> unfortunately<00:01:03.859> some

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
the idea some unfortunately some

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.030 
the idea some unfortunately some
Christians<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.439> erroneously<00:01:06.439> have<00:01:06.770> that

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
Christians and erroneously have that

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.889 
Christians and erroneously have that
dinosaurs<00:01:07.520> didn't<00:01:07.880> exist<00:01:08.360> of<00:01:08.479> course<00:01:08.509> they

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
dinosaurs didn't exist of course they

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.600 
dinosaurs didn't exist of course they
existed<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:09.710> he's<00:01:09.829> saying<00:01:09.979> they're<00:01:10.189> out<00:01:10.310> there

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
existed so he's saying they're out there

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.700 
existed so he's saying they're out there
they're<00:01:10.640> for<00:01:11.149> that<00:01:11.299> saying<00:01:11.630> that<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.380> Bible's

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
they're for that saying that the Bible's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.280 
they're for that saying that the Bible's
time<00:01:12.979> scale<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.280> wrong<00:01:13.430> not<00:01:14.149> so<00:01:14.540> right<00:01:15.110> of

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
time scale is wrong not so right of

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.679 
time scale is wrong not so right of
course<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.680> have<00:01:15.829> fossils<00:01:16.369> of<00:01:16.640> dinosaurs<00:01:17.270> but

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
course we have fossils of dinosaurs but

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.380 
course we have fossils of dinosaurs but
he's<00:01:17.899> actually<00:01:18.110> quoted<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.610> carcasses<00:01:20.360> of

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
he's actually quoted the carcasses of

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.179 
he's actually quoted the carcasses of
dinosaurs<00:01:20.990> he<00:01:21.110> is<00:01:21.200> quite<00:01:21.439> correcting<00:01:22.039> this

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
dinosaurs he is quite correcting this

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.830 
dinosaurs he is quite correcting this
that<00:01:22.399> there<00:01:22.549> are<00:01:22.670> actually<00:01:23.030> carcasses<00:01:23.659> I've

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
that there are actually carcasses I've

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.770 
that there are actually carcasses I've
on<00:01:24.079> fossilized<00:01:25.149> Tyrannosaurus<00:01:26.149> Rex<00:01:26.450> bones

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
that have been discovered right and this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:30.849 
that have been discovered right and this
is<00:01:29.030> actually<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.600> huge<00:01:30.200> problem<00:01:30.829> for

is actually a huge problem for

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
trying to work out how these things

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.120 
trying to work out how these things

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
could have been pickled or preserved

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.219 
could have been pickled or preserved
over<00:01:46.340> million<00:01:46.729> friars<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.689> obvious

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
over million friars but the obvious

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.319 
over million friars but the obvious
answer<00:01:48.409> Occam's<00:01:49.280> razor<00:01:49.369> suggest<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.240> should

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
answer Occam's razor suggest you should

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.520 
answer Occam's razor suggest you should
always<00:01:50.509> look<00:01:50.689> for<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.869> most<00:01:51.049> obvious<00:01:51.229> answer

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
always look for the most obvious answer

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.319 
always look for the most obvious answer
the<00:01:52.070> most<00:01:52.250> obvious<00:01:52.429> answer<00:01:52.700> is<00:01:52.969> that<00:01:53.210> these

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
the most obvious answer is that these

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.179 
the most obvious answer is that these
things<00:01:53.570> are<00:01:53.750> not<00:01:54.140> actually<00:01:54.710> millions<00:01:55.039> of

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
things are not actually millions of

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.700 
things are not actually millions of
years<00:01:55.310> old<00:01:55.700> at<00:01:55.969> all<00:01:56.149> he's<00:01:56.600> using<00:01:56.869> an<00:01:57.170> evidence

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
years old at all he's using an evidence

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.649 
years old at all he's using an evidence
that<00:01:57.890> actually<00:01:58.189> confirms<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.880> Bible<00:01:59.299> correct

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
that actually confirms the Bible correct
