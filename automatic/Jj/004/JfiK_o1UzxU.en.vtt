you'll also notice that white is down a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.350 
you'll also notice that white is down a
pawn<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.500> material<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.190> far<00:03:17.220> but<00:03:18.030> even<00:03:18.270> though

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
pawn in material so far but even though

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.850 
pawn in material so far but even though
that's<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.660> case<00:03:18.750> weight<00:03:19.290> still<00:03:19.530> has<00:03:19.710> the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
that's the case weight still has the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.170 
that's the case weight still has the
bishop<00:03:20.190> pair<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:20.610> board<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:20.970> still

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
bishop pair and the board is still

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.240 
bishop pair and the board is still
fairly<00:03:21.450> open<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:22.800> definitely<00:03:22.980> an

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
fairly open so that's definitely an

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.950 
fairly open so that's definitely an
advantage<00:03:23.640> for<00:03:24.030> white<00:03:24.210> to<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.540> those<00:03:24.750> two

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
advantage for white to have those two

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.040 
advantage for white to have those two
bishops<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.530> an<00:03:25.650> open<00:03:25.980> board<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:27.000> work<00:03:27.030> with<00:03:27.450> so

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
bishops in an open board to work with so

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.630 
bishops in an open board to work with so
even<00:03:28.260> though<00:03:28.350> White's<00:03:28.590> down<00:03:28.860> one<00:03:29.160> point<00:03:29.430> of

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
even though White's down one point of

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.630 
even though White's down one point of
material<00:03:30.150> from<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.080> technical<00:03:31.440> standpoint<00:03:31.830> in

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
material from a technical standpoint in

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.760 
material from a technical standpoint in
terms<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.180> piece<00:03:33.450> activity<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.260> presence

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
terms of piece activity and presence

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.230 
terms of piece activity and presence
White's<00:03:35.010> definitely<00:03:35.430> got<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.610> good<00:03:35.970> position

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
White's definitely got a good position

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.150 
White's definitely got a good position
to<00:03:36.480> work<00:03:36.660> from<00:03:36.900> now<00:03:37.500> if<00:03:37.590> we<00:03:37.680> take<00:03:37.800> a<00:03:37.860> look<00:03:38.010> at

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
to work from now if we take a look at

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.500 
to work from now if we take a look at
blacks<00:03:38.370> position<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.030> other<00:03:39.210> hand<00:03:39.360> it's

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
blacks position on the other hand it's

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.700 
blacks position on the other hand it's
definitely<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.870> quite<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> different<00:03:40.590> story

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
definitely a quite a different story

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.020 
definitely a quite a different story
like<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.550> rooks<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.940> are

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
like we have the rooks that are

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.090 
like we have the rooks that are
connected<00:03:42.450> which<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.720> good<00:03:42.990> but<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.860> Queen

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
connected which is good but the Queen

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.710 
connected which is good but the Queen
seems<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.490> be<00:03:44.610> passively<00:03:45.090> placed<00:03:45.420> here<00:03:45.660> on

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
seems to be passively placed here on

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.180 
seems to be passively placed here on
being<00:03:46.110> and<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.380> kind<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.680> married<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.100> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
being and it's kind of married to the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.280 
being and it's kind of married to the
protection<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.850> pawn<00:03:48.120> currently<00:03:48.660> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
protection of this pawn currently the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.350 
protection of this pawn currently the
bishop<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.770> protecting<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.400> isolated<00:03:51.150> pawn

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
bishop is protecting the isolated pawn

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.810 
bishop is protecting the isolated pawn
on<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.630> file<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.380> it's<00:03:52.800> also<00:03:52.980> stopping<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
on the a file and it's also stopping the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.720 
on the a file and it's also stopping the
rook<00:03:53.970> from<00:03:54.090> impacting<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:54.870> file<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.400> bishop

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
rook from impacting this file the bishop

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.310 
rook from impacting this file the bishop
also<00:03:56.940> has<00:03:57.240> another<00:03:57.450> purpose<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.080> then<00:03:58.170> it's

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
also has another purpose and then it's

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.870 
also has another purpose and then it's
kind<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.590> protecting<00:03:59.070> this<00:03:59.190> diagonal<00:03:59.700> from

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
kind of protecting this diagonal from

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.970 
kind of protecting this diagonal from
being<00:04:00.390> used<00:04:00.600> by<00:04:00.780> white<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.230> deliver<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.650> check

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
being used by white to deliver a check

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.650 
being used by white to deliver a check
which<00:04:02.550> kind<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.880> brings<00:04:03.060> us<00:04:03.210> to<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.450> biggest

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
which kind of brings us to the biggest

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.150 
which kind of brings us to the biggest
weakness<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.260> blacks<00:04:04.470> position<00:04:04.710> and<00:04:05.070> that

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
weakness of blacks position and that

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.360 
weakness of blacks position and that
this<00:04:05.400> King<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:05.640> very<00:04:06.030> exposed<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.860> when

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
this King is very exposed and when

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.220 
this King is very exposed and when
you're<00:04:08.490> facing<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.940> bishop<00:04:09.270> pair<00:04:09.480> I'm

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
you're facing a bishop pair I'm

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.870 
you're facing a bishop pair I'm
supported<00:04:10.680> by<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.830> queen<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.550> rooks<00:04:11.730> are

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
supported by a queen and the rooks are

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.100 
supported by a queen and the rooks are
still<00:04:12.060> on<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.270> board<00:04:12.450> like<00:04:12.720> having<00:04:12.990> an

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
still on the board like having an

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.720 
still on the board like having an
exposed<00:04:13.500> King<00:04:13.740> like<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:14.100> definitely<00:04:14.490> can't

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
exposed King like that definitely can't

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.630 
exposed King like that definitely can't
be<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.940> good<00:04:15.150> thing<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:16.290> knight<00:04:16.440> over<00:04:16.710> on<00:04:16.859> f6

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
be a good thing the knight over on f6

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.039 
be a good thing the knight over on f6
doesn't<00:04:18.090> really<00:04:18.210> have<00:04:18.420> a<00:04:18.450> lot<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.810> jump

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
doesn't really have a lot of jump

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.660 
doesn't really have a lot of jump
squares<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.590> can<00:04:19.710> access<00:04:19.950> currently<00:04:20.640> a

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
squares that it can access currently a

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.550 
squares that it can access currently a
lot<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:21.000> them<00:04:21.120> are<00:04:21.299> just<00:04:21.510> simply<00:04:22.020> it<00:04:22.260> would<00:04:22.410> be

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
lot of them are just simply it would be

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.250 
lot of them are just simply it would be
captured<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.180> knight<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.510> isn't<00:04:25.050> really

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
captured so the knight is isn't really

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.630 
captured so the knight is isn't really
serving<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.740> huge<00:04:25.980> function<00:04:26.460> right<00:04:26.580> now

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
serving a huge function right now

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.760 
serving a huge function right now
actually<00:04:27.180> it's<00:04:27.300> not<00:04:27.420> threatening<00:04:28.200> anything

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
actually it's not threatening anything

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.339 
actually it's not threatening anything
and<00:04:28.919> it's<00:04:29.040> not<00:04:29.220> really<00:04:29.460> defending<00:04:29.760> anything<00:04:30.210> I

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
and it's not really defending anything I

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.579 
and it's not really defending anything I
so<00:04:31.649> blacks<00:04:32.189> position<00:04:32.429> is<00:04:33.059> although<00:04:33.809> black<00:04:34.379> is

00:04:34.579 --> 00:04:34.589 
so blacks position is although black is

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:36.859 
so blacks position is although black is
a<00:04:34.619> pawn<00:04:34.979> up<00:04:35.159> and<00:04:35.309> material<00:04:35.479> is<00:04:36.479> definitely

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:36.869 
a pawn up and material is definitely

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:38.239 
a pawn up and material is definitely
inferior<00:04:37.469> to<00:04:37.830> whites

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:38.249 
inferior to whites

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:39.859 
inferior to whites
now<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.789> question<00:04:39.270> though<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.419> what<00:04:39.749> did

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:39.869 
now the question though is what did

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:41.600 
now the question though is what did
magnets<00:04:40.259> come<00:04:40.439> up<00:04:40.589> with<00:04:40.740> in<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:40.979> position<00:04:41.459> as

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
magnets come up with in this position as

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.639 
magnets come up with in this position as
the<00:04:41.789> white<00:04:41.939> player<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.509> capitalize<00:04:43.169> on<00:04:43.199> blacks

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:43.649 
the white player to capitalize on blacks

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:45.829 
the white player to capitalize on blacks
position<00:04:43.889> well<00:04:44.819> he<00:04:44.939> came<00:04:45.089> up<00:04:45.240> with<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.419> really

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:45.839 
position well he came up with a really

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.389 
position well he came up with a really
brilliant<00:04:46.020> move<00:04:46.409> actually<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:46.949> even<00:04:47.249> though

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:47.399 
brilliant move actually and even though

go<00:06:25.559> back<00:06:25.769> to<00:06:25.979> when<00:06:26.129> the<00:06:26.309> rook<00:06:26.759> captured<00:06:27.180> the

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
go back to when the rook captured the

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.409 
go back to when the rook captured the
bishop<00:06:27.629> on<00:06:27.779> b4<00:06:28.669> Aronian<00:06:29.669> had<00:06:29.849> another<00:06:30.149> move

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
bishop on b4 Aronian had another move

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.639 
bishop on b4 Aronian had another move
that<00:06:30.629> he<00:06:30.719> could<00:06:30.869> have<00:06:30.959> done<00:06:31.139> here<00:06:31.439> in<00:06:31.529> this

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:31.649 
that he could have done here in this

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:33.619 
that he could have done here in this
position<00:06:32.129> and<00:06:32.339> instead<00:06:32.969> of<00:06:33.089> capturing<00:06:33.479> the

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:33.629 
position and instead of capturing the

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:35.359 
position and instead of capturing the
rook<00:06:33.809> it<00:06:33.990> was<00:06:34.079> to<00:06:34.229> capture<00:06:34.469> the<00:06:34.769> bishop<00:06:35.189> and

00:06:35.359 --> 00:06:35.369 
rook it was to capture the bishop and

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:37.609 
rook it was to capture the bishop and
the<00:06:36.059> engines<00:06:36.389> have<00:06:36.629> the<00:06:36.930> rook<00:06:37.110> coming<00:06:37.379> over

00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:37.619 
the engines have the rook coming over

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:39.230 
the engines have the rook coming over
and<00:06:37.740> capturing<00:06:38.189> the<00:06:38.369> pawn<00:06:38.610> after<00:06:38.849> black<00:06:39.209> plays

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
and capturing the pawn after black plays

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.670 
and capturing the pawn after black plays
that<00:06:39.870> and<00:06:40.110> gives<00:06:41.009> white<00:06:41.809> theoretical<00:06:42.809> one

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
that and gives white theoretical one

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.420 
that and gives white theoretical one
pawn

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
pawn

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.940 
pawn
in<00:06:44.730> positional<00:06:45.300> strength<00:06:45.590> in<00:06:46.590> terms<00:06:46.770> of

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
in positional strength in terms of

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.320 
in positional strength in terms of
actual<00:06:47.280> material<00:06:47.880> though<00:06:48.000> it<00:06:48.150> would<00:06:48.300> have

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
actual material though it would have

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.000 
actual material though it would have
been<00:06:48.480> equal<00:06:48.930> so<00:06:49.470> there's<00:06:49.620> definitely<00:06:49.950> no

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.010 
been equal so there's definitely no

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.650 
been equal so there's definitely no
doubt<00:06:50.160> Aronian<00:06:50.670> missed<00:06:50.910> the<00:06:51.060> best<00:06:51.240> move<00:06:51.510> in

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
doubt Aronian missed the best move in

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.380 
doubt Aronian missed the best move in
that<00:06:51.780> position<00:06:52.320> but<00:06:53.310> you<00:06:53.550> know<00:06:53.640> credits<00:06:54.060> also

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.390 
that position but you know credits also

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.210 
that position but you know credits also
got<00:06:54.540> to<00:06:54.660> go<00:06:54.720> to<00:06:54.780> magnus<00:06:55.170> carlsen<00:06:55.380> because<00:06:55.980> he

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
got to go to magnus carlsen because he

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.620 
got to go to magnus carlsen because he
must<00:06:56.400> have<00:06:56.580> you<00:06:57.000> know<00:06:57.120> looked<00:06:57.360> at<00:06:57.480> both

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
must have you know looked at both

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.630 
must have you know looked at both
options<00:06:58.110> either<00:06:58.470> a<00:06:58.590> his<00:06:58.980> rook<00:06:59.190> gets<00:06:59.370> captured

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640 
options either a his rook gets captured

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.850 
options either a his rook gets captured
and<00:06:59.910> he<00:06:59.970> has<00:07:00.120> a<00:07:00.150> completely<00:07:00.660> winning<00:07:01.080> game<00:07:01.320> or

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
and he has a completely winning game or

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.730 
and he has a completely winning game or
B<00:07:02.280> his<00:07:02.520> Bishop<00:07:02.940> gets<00:07:03.090> taken<00:07:03.440> material<00:07:04.440> is<00:07:04.560> now

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
B his Bishop gets taken material is now

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.590 
B his Bishop gets taken material is now
balanced<00:07:05.310> so<00:07:05.400> he's<00:07:05.550> no<00:07:05.700> longer<00:07:05.880> down<00:07:06.210> a<00:07:06.240> pawn

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
balanced so he's no longer down a pawn

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.360 
balanced so he's no longer down a pawn
and<00:07:07.080> he's<00:07:07.260> got<00:07:07.410> a<00:07:07.440> better<00:07:07.680> position<00:07:07.890> to<00:07:08.220> work

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
and he's got a better position to work

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.580 
and he's got a better position to work
from<00:07:08.640> so<00:07:09.210> you<00:07:09.570> know<00:07:09.690> that's<00:07:09.930> the<00:07:10.110> that's<00:07:10.410> the
