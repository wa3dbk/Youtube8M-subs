00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello this video is for you 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.440
 learn as clearly as possible 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.440
 how to achieve an American blend 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.349
 so for that you will need a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.599
 card game and some 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 dexterity in the fingers and also 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.150
 a lot of patience because you have to 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.220
 know it's one of the most 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.109
 difficult and yet one of the most 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.449
 used mostly by croupiers 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.480
 around the casino tables and all that 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.480
 and so here it is this one 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.590
 it seems simple enough but still 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.120
 quite difficult because there is a 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 certain method and this method can 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.920
 change according to the hands of 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.750
 people and above all it takes a lot 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.550
 drive it must be done every 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 days every day we have a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.309
 pack of cards and a table at his 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.079
 provision then you have to try for 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.329
 the method 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.610
 first of all you have to see the position 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.090
 hands versus packs 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.170
 original then it'll be both 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.659
 fingers in front like this with both 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 inches behind that come catch the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.100
 package and the indexes that come up 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.390
 fold like this I address them here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.930
 come just fold for 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.610
 touch the package more simply so 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.009
 to lead you already simply to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.930
 touched the package like this is a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.509
 moment you will stop at 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.759
 middle when you feel ready 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.770
 so you stop in the middle half of the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.630
 package actually 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.970
 and there you pull the two packets there 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.500
 do not draw one because if 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 we only draw one after that 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.509
 shift the package will be more central 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.950
 that is, it takes to have a 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.700
 certain aesthetics in the mix 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.790
 the package must always be at the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.869
 same position at the beginning and at the end there 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:03.869
 must not be like that otherwise the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.750
 viewer sees sees less well and so 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.850
 once we have cut the two packets 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.970
 we stretch each on the sides 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.570
 you can equalize if you feel them 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.640
 step by step well balanced and that's the 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.750
 same position relative to the packets of 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.460
 leave the two fingers like those 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.690
 shoots like these and india is this 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:30.970
 who comes like this then according to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 your level of the habit that you 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.130
 you'll have to be able to do it you can 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.530
 first started by bringing the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.400
 tomorrow that allows you a catch 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.840
 much more reassured - airy but 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.330
 so much more reassured so from the beginning 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.130
 you have to try that one you put the 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.080
 grow along the edge and the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.440
 indexes come to lie on 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:59.580
 to the edge of the package that makes that 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:03.400
 you go like these started to 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.370
 touch the two packets with one another 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:12.190
 start again half we draw from both 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:16.300
 sides the three fingers on the slice there 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:20.740
 down the indexes layers and push them the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.960
 along the edge and let go 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.920
 gently in the same way each 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.920
 side here it's mostly a movement of 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.830
 synchronization that must be adopted 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.460
 in the beginning you will tend to let go 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.410
 packages rather than one to one to one 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.690
 and so long by doing this 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.150
 flicking training that you 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:50.410
 will feel the cards one by one and 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:54.580
 so then once you get this 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:58.390
 gesture there in the hands you will 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.220
 move back the position of the fingers in 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:06.370
 putting more towards the middle always the 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:09.040
 index bedtime and flicking and finally 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.870
 you can do the most space 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.090
 possible with a lot of ventilation between 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.650
 the cards that gives a mix 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.919
 much sharper is a lot more 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.919
 clean 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.800
 there is a lot a lot of 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.790
 variants for the American mix and 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.990
 that is, they have little to see 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.660
 one of the jerks and or so the indexes 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.800
 rather folded and so it will be rather the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.590
 indexes that will force on trips that 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.250
 there is much less air between 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.850
 cards but hey it depends on two euros 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.140
 preferably after if you prefer 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.669
 like that you can do more time 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.140
 like that it depends if you need 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:02.220
 but good especially it's the training the 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:04.290
 patience and will that will do 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.060
 that you will get there perfectly at the 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:12.690
 end here voila this tutoring is now 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:17.190
 finished I hope you'll get there 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.790
 that you will have a lot of success with 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.139
 this mixture 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:26.419
 that's a lot of training especially and 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.419
 a lot of patience here thank you
