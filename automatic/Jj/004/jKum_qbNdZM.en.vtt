00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.179
 trans adriatic pipeline tap is a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.059
 company created for the purpose of designing 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.160
 and build a pipeline to transport 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.080
 the azerbaigian natural gas from the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.140
 Greek Turkish border to Italy and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.720
 in Europe natural gas is the most 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.029
 clean of fossil sources a source of 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 sustainable energy that leads to heat e 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.650
 light to our homes and produces 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.800
 co2 emissions lower than 70 per 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.540
 hundred compared to the tap coal is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 designed to minimize 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.440
 the impact on the landscape heritage e 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.750
 naturalistic of the territories that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.600
 crosses ensuring in restoration 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 after the construction works 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.039
 today in Italy the main network of 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.180
 transport of gas and over 32,000 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.890
 kilometres 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.440
 the completion of the tap pipeline 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 will add value and provide new ones 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.870
 opportunities for the country and for the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.920
 territories crossed 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.230
 from the infrastructure natural gas is a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.180
 fuel than from the source to the point of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.939
 arrival does not need any 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.130
 transformation and tap brings it into our 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.680
 country with particular devices 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.920
 effective both for safety and for 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.350
 respect for the dap environment is energy 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 clean even more blue 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.340
 the tap project starts immediately in the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.380
 respect for nature and places that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.240
 go through before identifying the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
 best tap route has had a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 continuous and productive dialogue in more than 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.520
 500 meetings with more than 3500 parties 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.380
 interested studied and analyzed more 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.210

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.229
 dialogue with public institutions e 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 private organizations allowed to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.430
 identify the best route for 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.049
 respect the sea nature the earth and the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.689
 places of one of the most beautiful regions 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.270
 d'italia tap has made available 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.920
 economic resources to enhance 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.310
 further the territory crossed 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.340
 with social investments 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.340
 such tap reliability north European 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.299
 Italian sensibility 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.890
 here is the path of the tap pipeline 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.020
 the pipe coming from Greece e 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.649
 from albania resting on the bottom of the sea

 lands on the Salento coast with the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.769
 micro tunnel system that allows to 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.900
 preserve the Posidonia beds in 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.730

 coastal tumors rise on the mainland 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.860
 progressively towards the surface is a

 about 700 meters from the beach meets 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.299
 the interception valve remaining 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:36.440
 always buried at a minimum depth 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.780
 of 1.5 meters the 8.2 kilometers of 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.280
 pipeline in the stretch on the ground cross 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.110
 a portion of territory with a vocation 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.709
 mainly agricultural and not 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.620
 densely populated the pipe will always be 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.080
 positioned at a depth of at least 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.810
 1.5 meters so as not to interfere with 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.819
 any surface activity 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.769
 the entire area concerned at the end of 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.109
 works will be returned in his

 wholly original conditions 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.010
 the only constraints are cultivable 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.650
 those concerning the minimum distance 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.049
 from buildings 20 meters for construction 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.380

 buildings and the reception terminal where 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.280
 the pipeline connects to the network

 national will not produce emissions during 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.140
 normal operation and is located 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.239
 in an area with no olive trees it is designed 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.350
 to integrate and architecturally into

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.270
 the whole plant is in the phase 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.220
 realization that in the regime management is 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.810
 constantly monitored by 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.030

 overall economic linked to the project 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.800
 will be 290 million euros for the 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.440
 Puglia region and the province of Lecce 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.370
 with the creation of over 2000 posts of 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.230
 work 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.360
 tap has started a process 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.190
 involvement of local businesses for 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.049
 facilitate participation in tenders 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.310
 tendering of works allowing them 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.440
 to know the technical requirements 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.269
 requested and offering opportunities to 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.690
 training 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.910
 comes the stage blue brings with it 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.739
 clean energy pay attention to the 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.030
 territory and development support
