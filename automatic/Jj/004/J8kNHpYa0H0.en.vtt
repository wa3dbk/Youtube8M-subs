work for them when coming up with the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.139 
work for them when coming up with the
design<00:00:37.500> my<00:00:38.070> client<00:00:38.430> had<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> number<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
design my client had a number of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.270 
design my client had a number of
inspirations<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> kind<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.010> New

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
inspirations one was a kind of a New

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
inspirations one was a kind of a New
York<00:00:41.520> feel<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.270> other<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.050> Paris<00:00:43.350> feel

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
York feel and the other was a Paris feel

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
York feel and the other was a Paris feel
so<00:00:43.860> what<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.250> did<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.700> kind<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> mold<00:00:45.390> those<00:00:45.660> two

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
so what we did is kind of mold those two

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.869 
so what we did is kind of mold those two
ideas<00:00:46.110> together<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.460> really

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
ideas together to get this really

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.709 
ideas together to get this really
glamorous<00:00:48.410> curated<00:00:49.410> well-traveled<00:00:50.160> room

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
glamorous curated well-traveled room

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
glamorous curated well-traveled room
when<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:51.870> dealing<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.469> small<00:00:52.800> space

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
when you're dealing with a small space

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
when you're dealing with a small space
and<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.670> long<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.300> narrow<00:00:54.629> small<00:00:54.780> space<00:00:55.320> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and a long and narrow small space I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
and a long and narrow small space I
think<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> biggest<00:00:56.070> challenge<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> really

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
think the biggest challenge is to really

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
think the biggest challenge is to really
divide<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.350> room<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.039> feels<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
divide up that room so it feels like you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.510 
divide up that room so it feels like you
have<00:00:59.699> different<00:01:00.329> living<00:01:00.660> areas<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.920> added

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
have different living areas so we added

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.910 
have different living areas so we added
this<00:01:02.670> beautiful<00:01:03.090> marble<00:01:03.719> fireplace<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.500> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
this beautiful marble fireplace and it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.500 
this beautiful marble fireplace and it
was<00:01:05.040> centered<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> room<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.119> really

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
was centered in the room so it really

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.859 
was centered in the room so it really
gave<00:01:06.689> me<00:01:06.750> zones<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.470> work<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:08.780> when<00:01:09.780> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869

it<00:03:03.610> really<00:03:03.850> lets<00:03:04.030> your<00:03:04.180> eyes<00:03:04.360> travel<00:03:04.900> nothing

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
it really lets your eyes travel nothing

tranquil<00:03:07.930> ah

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.740 

so<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.370> was<00:03:12.610> very<00:03:12.850> thrilled<00:03:13.120> at<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.360> end<00:03:13.570> of<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
so I was very thrilled at the end of the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.720 
so I was very thrilled at the end of the
day<00:03:13.900> because<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.530> got<00:03:14.710> everything<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.430> was

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
day because we got everything that was

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.730 
day because we got everything that was
on<00:03:15.880> my<00:03:16.000> home<00:03:16.210> owners<00:03:16.600> wishlist<00:03:16.990> in<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.440> space

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
on my home owners wishlist in the space

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.470 
on my home owners wishlist in the space
so<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.190> guess<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.520> moral<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.000> story<00:03:19.120> is

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
so I guess the moral of the story is

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.860 
so I guess the moral of the story is
that<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.740> don't<00:03:21.040> have<00:03:21.130> to<00:03:21.370> sacrifice<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:22.630> live

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
that you don't have to sacrifice to live

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:32.520 
that you don't have to sacrifice to live
in<00:03:23.110> your<00:03:23.290> urban<00:03:23.620> center<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.130> can<00:03:24.310> have<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.610> all

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.590 

you
