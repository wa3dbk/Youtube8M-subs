00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
back and let me give my thoughts on I do

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.630 
back and let me give my thoughts on I do
I<00:03:07.200> think<00:03:07.470> that's<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.680> good<00:03:07.860> or<00:03:08.010> bad<00:03:08.040> thing<00:03:08.250> me

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
I think that's a good or bad thing me

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.430 
I think that's a good or bad thing me
personally<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.630> course<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.019> bad<00:03:10.200> thing

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
personally of course the bad thing

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.050 
personally of course the bad thing
because<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.950> hit<00:03:11.100> detection<00:03:11.220> shipping<00:03:11.850> right

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
because the hit detection shipping right

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.819 
because the hit detection shipping right
I<00:03:12.090> think<00:03:12.510> all<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.930> hit<00:03:13.079> detection<00:03:13.200> my<00:03:13.620> mother

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
I think all the hit detection my mother
