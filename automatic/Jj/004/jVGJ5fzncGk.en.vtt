was<00:02:14.599> but<00:02:14.930> for<00:02:15.739> some<00:02:15.980> reason<00:02:16.370> Firefox<00:02:16.879> just

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
was but for some reason Firefox just

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.240 
was but for some reason Firefox just
won't<00:02:17.480> tell<00:02:18.079> me<00:02:18.319> so<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.560> thought<00:02:18.829> something<00:02:19.220> was

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
won't tell me so I thought something was

going wrong here but make sure as it

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.440 
going wrong here but make sure as it
says<00:02:22.340> recommended<00:02:22.970> channel<00:02:23.329> art<00:02:23.540> size<00:02:25.450> 2560

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
says recommended channel art size 2560

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.449 
says recommended channel art size 2560
by<00:02:26.720> 1440<00:02:27.439> um<00:02:28.129> that's<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.329> biggest<00:02:29.659> uh<00:02:30.079> I<00:02:30.459> I

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
by 1440 um that's the biggest uh I I

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.670 
by 1440 um that's the biggest uh I I
have<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.879> file<00:02:32.180> size<00:02:32.450> here<00:02:32.810> let<00:02:32.959> me<00:02:33.049> look<00:02:33.230> it's

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
have a file size here let me look it's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.020 
have a file size here let me look it's
um

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
um

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.280 
um
I<00:02:35.470> think<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:36.530> should<00:02:36.709> be<00:02:36.769> in<00:02:36.920> here<00:02:37.340> let<00:02:37.640> me<00:02:37.730> say

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
I think it should be in here let me say

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.190 
I think it should be in here let me say
it's<00:02:39.290> right<00:02:39.680> how<00:02:40.489> big<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.849> this<00:02:41.060> okay<00:02:42.019> the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
it's right how big is this okay the

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.869 
it's right how big is this okay the
smallest<00:02:42.829> size<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.459> 248<00:02:44.299> by<00:02:44.859> 1152<00:02:45.859> that<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:46.640> I

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
smallest size is 248 by 1152 that you I

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.240 
smallest size is 248 by 1152 that you I
would<00:02:47.120> recommend<00:02:47.629> going<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.560> believe

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
would recommend going and I believe

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.800 
would recommend going and I believe
that's<00:02:49.459> like<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.730> smallest<00:02:50.120> size<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.720> could

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
that's like the smallest size you could

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.960 
that's like the smallest size you could
use<00:02:51.019> for<00:02:51.230> channel<00:02:51.590> art<00:02:51.769> but<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.519> other<00:02:52.670> thing

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
use for channel art but the other thing

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.210 
use for channel art but the other thing
you<00:02:53.359> want<00:02:53.389> to<00:02:53.569> make<00:02:53.780> sure<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.440> it's<00:02:54.650> under

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
you want to make sure that it's under

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.240 
you want to make sure that it's under
two<00:02:55.579> megabytes<00:02:56.329> or<00:02:56.629> at<00:02:57.170> least<00:02:57.500> two<00:02:57.739> megabytes

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
two megabytes or at least two megabytes

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.280 
two megabytes or at least two megabytes
if<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.879> go<00:02:59.060> any<00:02:59.239> higher<00:02:59.269> than<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.750> it<00:03:00.049> won't

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
if you go any higher than that it won't

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.819 
if you go any higher than that it won't
let<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.650> upload<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.400> channel<00:03:01.760> art<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.829> here's

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
let you upload the channel art so here's

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.379 
let you upload the channel art so here's
my<00:03:03.980> picture<00:03:04.340> right<00:03:04.549> here<00:03:04.579> I've<00:03:04.940> been<00:03:05.090> wanting

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
my picture right here I've been wanting

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.589 
my picture right here I've been wanting
to<00:03:05.889> actually<00:03:06.889> change<00:03:07.129> my<00:03:07.340> channel<00:03:07.700> art<00:03:07.879> so<00:03:08.480> I'm

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
to actually change my channel art so I'm

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.670 
to actually change my channel art so I'm
going<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.780> go<00:03:08.900> ahead<00:03:09.019> and<00:03:09.379> click<00:03:09.799> this<00:03:10.129> and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
going to go ahead and click this and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.770 
going to go ahead and click this and
actually<00:03:12.680> wait<00:03:12.889> I<00:03:13.459> think<00:03:14.030> this<00:03:14.239> still<00:03:14.569> might

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
actually wait I think this still might

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.650 
actually wait I think this still might
be<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:15.290> little<00:03:16.190> weird<00:03:16.489> let<00:03:16.879> me<00:03:16.970> see<00:03:17.150> how<00:03:17.359> big<00:03:17.540> is

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
be a little weird let me see how big is

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.780 
be a little weird let me see how big is
this<00:03:17.840> one<00:03:18.079> I<00:03:18.319> actually<00:03:18.949> I'm<00:03:19.310> going<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.489> go<00:03:19.609> with

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
this one I actually I'm going to go with

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.439 
this one I actually I'm going to go with
um<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.720> JPEG<00:03:21.319> because<00:03:21.620> for<00:03:21.889> some<00:03:22.069> reason

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
um the JPEG because for some reason

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.629 
um the JPEG because for some reason
every<00:03:23.449> time<00:03:23.629> I<00:03:23.660> try<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.019> do<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.319> PNG<00:03:25.099> like<00:03:25.609> a

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
every time I try and do a PNG like a

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.699 
every time I try and do a PNG like a
larger<00:03:26.150> file<00:03:26.359> size<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.900> gives<00:03:27.019> me<00:03:27.169> a<00:03:27.199> problem

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
larger file size it gives me a problem

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.490 
larger file size it gives me a problem
so<00:03:28.250> just<00:03:28.849> for<00:03:29.000> tutorial<00:03:29.810> purposes<00:03:29.840> I'm<00:03:30.440> going

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
so just for tutorial purposes I'm going

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.710 
so just for tutorial purposes I'm going
to<00:03:30.650> use<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.889> JPEG<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:32.239> I'm<00:03:32.329> going<00:03:32.449> to<00:03:32.510> go<00:03:32.599> ahead

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
to use a JPEG so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.750 
to use a JPEG so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:33.019> click<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.650> new<00:03:33.859> channel<00:03:34.310> art<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.730> I

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
and click the new channel art that I

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.449 
and click the new channel art that I
want<00:03:35.410> it's<00:03:36.410> going<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.620> go<00:03:36.739> ahead<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.160> upload

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
want it's going to go ahead and upload

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.110 
want it's going to go ahead and upload
