00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.839 
anything like this before these are
silicon<00:04:07.759> again<00:04:08.299> but<00:04:08.659> they<00:04:08.810> look<00:04:09.139> like<00:04:09.319> leaves

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
silicon again but they look like leaves

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.710 
silicon again but they look like leaves
so<00:04:10.849> they're<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.060> little<00:04:11.299> more<00:04:11.479> sophisticated

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
so they're a little more sophisticated

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.960 
so they're a little more sophisticated
than<00:04:12.560> some<00:04:12.799> of<00:04:12.889> the<00:04:12.949> other<00:04:13.099> ones<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.549> showed<00:04:13.909> you

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
than some of the other ones I showed you

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.330 
than some of the other ones I showed you
so<00:04:14.810> these<00:04:14.930> would<00:04:15.109> be<00:04:15.290> great<00:04:15.439> because<00:04:15.829> they

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
so these would be great because they

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.099 
so these would be great because they
would<00:04:16.549> actually<00:04:16.970> be<00:04:17.090> kind<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.389> appropriate<00:04:17.840> in

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
would actually be kind of appropriate in

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.360 
would actually be kind of appropriate in
an<00:04:18.259> adult's<00:04:18.620> bento<00:04:18.979> box

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
an adult's bento box

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.360 
an adult's bento box
unlike<00:04:20.060> happy<00:04:20.779> bunnies

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
unlike happy bunnies

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.030 
unlike happy bunnies

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.370 
so the last thing I want to show you was

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
this because it's just weird and bizarre

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.860
