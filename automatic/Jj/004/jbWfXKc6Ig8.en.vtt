into work somebody says here's the scene
and<00:06:29.960> then<00:06:30.349> you<00:06:30.500> improvise<00:06:31.069> that's<00:06:31.550> it<00:06:31.849> and

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779 
and then you improvise that's it and

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.870 
and then you improvise that's it and
it's<00:06:32.930> literally<00:06:33.409> just<00:06:33.649> as<00:06:34.069> simple<00:06:34.219> as<00:06:34.459> that<00:06:34.490> or

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.550 
it's literally just as simple as that or
not<00:06:35.240> easy<00:06:35.389> to<00:06:35.509> improvise<00:06:35.870> obviously<00:06:36.380> but

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
not easy to improvise obviously but

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.870 
not easy to improvise obviously but
that's<00:06:36.830> all<00:06:37.009> he<00:06:37.099> gives<00:06:37.250> you<00:06:37.459> right<00:06:37.610> then<00:06:37.789> you

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
that's all he gives you right then you

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.370 
that's all he gives you right then you
just<00:06:38.029> kind<00:06:38.149> of<00:06:38.240> go<00:06:38.419> with<00:06:38.449> it

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
just kind of go with it

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.100 
just kind of go with it
well<00:06:39.620> that's<00:06:40.040> pure<00:06:40.460> in<00:06:40.640> for<00:06:40.910> improv<00:06:41.420> because

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
well that's pure in for improv because

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.620 
well that's pure in for improv because
there<00:06:42.350> is<00:06:42.500> no<00:06:42.740> dialogue<00:06:43.280> with<00:06:43.520> none<00:06:43.940> boy

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:46.910 
that's not so you get you get a chance

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.150 
that's not so you get you get a chance
to<00:06:47.090> do<00:06:47.270> it<00:06:47.450> and<00:06:47.600> and<00:06:47.900> that's<00:06:48.170> what<00:06:48.530> we<00:06:48.710> do<00:06:48.890> it's

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 
to do it and and that's what we do it's

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:59.920 
to do it and and that's what we do it's
but<00:06:49.640> the<00:06:49.790> show<00:06:50.000> is<00:06:50.030> very<00:06:50.540> well<00:06:50.870> structured

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.990
