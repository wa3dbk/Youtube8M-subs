action piece where he needed the camera

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.089

to<00:00:30.689> move<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.989> lot<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.319> they<00:00:31.529> wanted<00:00:31.739> a<00:00:31.859> feature

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to move a lot and they wanted a feature

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
to move a lot and they wanted a feature
look<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.609> it<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.969> was<00:00:33.120> interested<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
look to it but I was interested and I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.610 
look to it but I was interested and I
thought<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.050> sounded<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.350> an<00:00:34.559> interesting

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
thought it sounded like an interesting

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.619 
thought it sounded like an interesting
project<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.579> designed<00:00:35.940> shots<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> work<00:00:36.480> with

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
project we designed shots to work with

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.209 
project we designed shots to work with
the<00:00:36.719> Ronin<00:00:36.930> M<00:00:37.199> which<00:00:37.440> takes<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.800> very<00:00:37.980> small

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
the Ronin M which takes a very small

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
the Ronin M which takes a very small
camera<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:39.000> has<00:00:39.449> a<00:00:39.480> stabilizer<00:00:40.019> motors<00:00:40.440> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
camera it has a stabilizer motors so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.930 
camera it has a stabilizer motors so
that<00:00:40.769> the<00:00:40.920> thing<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.370> moved<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that the thing can be moved and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.060 
that the thing can be moved and
transferred<00:00:42.719> from<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:43.109> carrier<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.829> another

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
transferred from one carrier to another

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.580 
transferred from one carrier to another
like<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> crane<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> person<00:00:45.870> walking<00:00:46.170> or<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
like a crane or a person walking or a

like a crane or a person walking or a
meter<00:00:46.890> machinery<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.969> Lin<00:00:48.179> was<00:00:48.539> trying<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
meter machinery what Lin was trying to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.110 
meter machinery what Lin was trying to
achieve<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.829> short<00:00:50.250> film<00:00:50.519> is<00:00:50.699> this<00:00:50.879> sort

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
achieve in the short film is this sort

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.930 
achieve in the short film is this sort
of<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.420> know<00:00:51.449> extended<00:00:52.050> shots<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
of you know extended shots and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
of you know extended shots and
disability<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> move<00:00:54.269> very<00:00:54.539> quickly<00:00:54.809> believe

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
disability to move very quickly believe

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.689 
disability to move very quickly believe
it<00:00:55.679> or<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:55.949> shot<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> whole<00:00:56.250> thing<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
it or not we shot the whole thing in

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
it or not we shot the whole thing in
seven<00:00:57.000> hours<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.019> child<00:00:58.260> labor<00:00:58.379> law

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
seven hours to to the child labor law

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.410 
seven hours to to the child labor law
and<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.190> was<00:00:59.280> impossible<00:00:59.460> with<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> DJI

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and that was impossible with the DJI

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.689 
and that was impossible with the DJI
Ronin<00:01:00.719> em<00:01:01.140> because<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.679> our<00:01:01.920> ability<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
Ronin em because of our ability to get a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.040 
Ronin em because of our ability to get a
lot<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:02.999> setups<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> short<00:01:03.780> amount<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.989> time

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
lot of setups in a short amount of time

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.050 
lot of setups in a short amount of time
I<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.070> has<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> lot<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.460> uses<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I think it has a lot of uses in

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.929 
I think it has a lot of uses in
individual<00:01:07.020> bits<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.439> pieces<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:08.490> make<00:01:08.610> up<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
individual bits and pieces to make up a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.340 
individual bits and pieces to make up a
good<00:01:09.150> action<00:01:09.540> scene<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:09.990> following

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
good action scene like following

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
good action scene like following
motorcycles<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:12.000> through<00:01:12.270> doorways
