00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 more powerful thinner lighter 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.589
 it's always the same story 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.899
 and it applies more than ever to 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.090
 this new apple tablet actually 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.280
 apple achieved the technical performance 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.309
 to stay in a much bigger format 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.100
 compact a screen of the same size 9 7 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.810
 inches approximately 25 cm diagonal 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.640
 we lose a little space on the edges 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.930
 when holding the ipad between 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.580
 hands but despite all this is not 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.130
 annoying because with the detector of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.140
 pressure as on the ipad milli eh well 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.810
 there is no unexpected action that 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.219
 trigger despite the touch screen to 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.469
 the apple interior put all his knowledge 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.960
 do the processor a5 that team 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.820
 also the new iPhone 5s 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.129
 and then this strange baptized processor 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.590
 m7 dedicated to capturing movements and 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.960
 to the sensors in a general way side 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.860
 4g the ipad is finally compatible with the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.719
 French 4g 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.399
 from the standpoint of autonomy little 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.260
 changes then the highlights of this 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.510
 new ipad and well these are those of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.600
 the ipad from the beginning elegance 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.879
 robustness robustness user-friendliness 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.250
 ios system this wealth of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.080
 applications over 475 thousand apps 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 available we gain a little speed 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.960
 it's nice for the video game 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.580
 since we know that today 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 tablets are now genuine 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.869
 game platforms the weak points 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.790
 all the same and well on the side of the photo 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.310
 it's not terrible terrible with a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.619
 photo sensor on the front and another on 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.360
 the back that stays below what is 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.900
 done elsewhere and especially on the iphone 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.299
 5 s 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.619
 we can also deplore the absence of 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.110
 fingerprint reader 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.640
 we expected it because this sensor 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.979
 biometric has appeared on 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.329
 iphone 5s apple explains that it's 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.130
 because the ipad is a family product 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.090
 that does not need to be unlocked 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.040
 every five minutes as a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.840
 smartphone but actually the explanation 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.479
 would be quite different is the mark at the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.500
 apple would have problems 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.250
 sensor supply 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.380
 biometric 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.869
 finally another weak point is the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.880
 price since the ipad starts at around 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.280
 500 euros to go right away in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.119
 the stratosphere to nearly 900 euros for 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.909
 the high-end model 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.880
 short no break we are in the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.799
 continuity with this new ipad r it's up to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.550
 compare more and more with ipad 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.760
 mini 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.050
 retina since the difference is reduced 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.220
 between the two products but the new 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.900
 ipad mini well we have no 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.670
 news precisely he had been 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.960
 announced at the same time as ipad r and 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.180
 there again apple encounter would have 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.670
 maybe production problems 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.080
 short apple digs its furrow nothing 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.780
 very new under the sun with this 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.340
 new ipad but probably enough 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.340
 to continue to dazzle fans
