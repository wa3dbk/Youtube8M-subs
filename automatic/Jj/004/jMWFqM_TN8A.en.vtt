00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.770
 love 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.200
 now good to all is to share the 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.079
 another day I told you that we were going to look for 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.719
 last shangri-la 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.010
 because I did not put shangri-la in history 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.629
 hidden because here in principle not 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.659
 there were images that he had been 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.659
 here peter although it's not a reason for 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.039
 let's think that Peter was here or for 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.339
 I do not think so, I think that 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.289
 possibly he was here but there's no 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.890
 blood marks like he used to 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:04.549
 leave assuming it was the vale 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.380
 so what do I see important here in 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.890
 blood which is why I put it now 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.500
 to look if you come down here 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.770
 here are super important things and that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 it is what was here plotting something 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.530
 here they are preparing something here 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.080
 some secret project because because 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.159
 fix 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.320
 they are the same 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.840
 containers we can call them like that the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.030
 same containers as in not of the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.600
 everything and that in five in the three sites 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.090
 in kino of the totem here and in face of the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.549
 dead these who were subjected 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.159
 I think I think I think these can be 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.210
 the former members of the tribe of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.370
 give those who lived here and those who 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.380
 rite formats 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.130
 I think it could be them and they are 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.260
 here stuck for some reason by something 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.869
 they are here and they are in the three 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.430
 sites 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.099
 because I've been here 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.010
 I do not know but if I tell you one thing 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.840
 I think watching the loading screen of 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.420
 here of blood the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.030
 you see the tornado of this one that goes towards the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.290
 earth and this tornado that goes towards the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.599
 land 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.160
 I in my opinion is in my point 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.370
 I can be wrong, but I think 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.670
 that this is worth this is triggered by 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.549
 something here something happened and then I think 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.260
 that this is the portal that opened the 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.950
 gap that opened hell 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.129
 and what better place than this 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.980
 coming from here from this mine and look 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.720
 the bodies are precisely the same 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.420
 bodies that are also in modes of d 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.819
 and in five that is worth it that this 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.220
 better then I'm supposed to be 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.580
 put the bodies that because when they 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.160
 died miners or zombies imprisoned or 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.440
 the scientists in face as the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.180
 they put in those sacks so they do not 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.670
 converted or if they became 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.940
 zombies to be able to keep them there is worth 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.989
 but what a coincidence that is in these 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.110
 same maps because you do not know people do not know it 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.350
 I know but this came here and this had 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.990
 one direction 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.770
 but is that look at these containers 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.730
 they were here inside and they are in face and in 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.160
 Chinese of the total 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.280
 I believe people that this 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.260
 for putting it this by putting us not being 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.540
 this was here prepared for 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.090
 take it somewhere and it came 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.930
 from other sites and I think that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.400
 these are portal portals people 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.550
 right the gap as the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.200
 demon the gap that opens up and it's like 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.450
 if it were a portal in time that's why 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.910
 I was wondering you see but how do you 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.670
 can have transport of this time 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.550
 that day back then there was no 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.590
 teleportation I think that's why 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.390
 there was the gap and that's why the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.730
 portal of the devil and that's why the devil 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.000
 I wanted to close it because of something we do not know 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.010
 what but there is still a lot to see here 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.190
 a lot to solve 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.910
 if you notice what he was saying this 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.000
 is in both the totem's Chinese and 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.370
 fire these vessels are in all three 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 sites 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.190
 in here in kindergarten at all and in five 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.050
 Well, if we go to for example here, 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.180
 see totem look is in the same place 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.240
 in the same place they are the same 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:50.680
 containers that is everything everything is the same 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.120
 because because here is there and because 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.580
 from there until you look where up to five 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.699
 because I also do not think I'm here 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.560
 for putting people and although if seen from 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.030
 here that you could have 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.550
 teleported by the 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.729
 teleportation that you see there is scam 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.790
 so far not see totem worth from this 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.960
 teleportation 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.870
 apart from teleporting through that 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:22.350
 they could have taken them in another way 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.020
 as I am saying the breach the portal 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.420
 in time through the devil and as 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.860
 well we know that the 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.510
 response 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.150
 they are practically the same in all 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.180
 for all the zombies but notice that 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.270
 here something changes 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.759
 if I had here look how is this in 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.430
 all the sites is the same but here 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.610
 change know the bodies that of the 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.750
 dead and the gap is in the earth 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:55.020
 same as the mold and like the 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.510
 entry that is in the mine here in 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.570
 blood the 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.690
 the truth is that at least suspicious 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.490
 is and I think the devil 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:09.620
 apart from existing tele transports 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:12.290
 portals were right so I could go 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.000
 from place to place and so too 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:18.320
 could end the demon and he 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.590
 I knew I tell you that this is possibly 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.440
 it would be the way the demon had and 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.960
 those around him to be able to get 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.230
 do everything they were doing but 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:34.780
 apart as I said before there is something 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:39.820
 hidden some mystery some project 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:44.740
 hidden behind these drums with 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:47.620
 possibly shines inside them 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.820
 what would they want to do with this what 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.070
 purpose would have 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.660
 we do not know 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:58.990
 but if I tell you something important 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:03.990
 happen here with these drums 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:07.400
 and this I will tell you very soon 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.400
 until the next video
