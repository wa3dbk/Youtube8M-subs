in how long to is Halloween too but at
least<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.550> music<00:05:15.640> suited<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.780> film<00:05:17.050> but<00:05:17.290> it

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
least the music suited the film but it

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.310

wasn't<00:05:17.710> music<00:05:17.890> from<00:05:18.190> another<00:05:18.310> film<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:20.169> this

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
wasn't music from another film and this

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.810 
wasn't music from another film and this
they<00:05:20.530> just<00:05:20.560> took<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.010> screen<00:05:21.250> music<00:05:21.580> and

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
they just took the screen music and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.530 
they just took the screen music and
slapped<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.540> in<00:05:22.690> there<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.620> was<00:05:23.890> kind<00:05:24.160> of

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
slapped it in there and that was kind of

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.720 
slapped it in there and that was kind of
craptastic<00:05:25.540> in<00:05:25.900> my<00:05:26.050> opinion<00:05:26.410> um<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.490> only

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
craptastic in my opinion um the only

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.670 
craptastic in my opinion um the only
other<00:05:28.090> thing<00:05:28.390> I<00:05:28.510> had<00:05:28.660> a<00:05:28.690> problem<00:05:28.960> with<00:05:29.140> it<00:05:29.470> in

other thing I had a problem with it in

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.380 
other thing I had a problem with it in
this<00:05:29.890> movie<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.340> I'm<00:05:30.460> sure<00:05:30.669> all<00:05:30.880> of<00:05:30.910> you<00:05:31.210> know

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390

this movie and I'm sure all of you know
what<00:05:31.630> I'm<00:05:31.720> gonna<00:05:31.870> say<00:05:32.140> is<00:05:32.320> that<00:05:32.919> they<00:05:33.190> used

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
what I'm gonna say is that they used

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.120 
what I'm gonna say is that they used
like<00:05:33.550> four<00:05:33.820> or<00:05:33.910> five<00:05:34.090> different<00:05:34.330> masks<00:05:35.130> and

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
like four or five different masks and

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.680 
like four or five different masks and
I'm<00:05:36.310> sure<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:36.850> could<00:05:36.970> have<00:05:37.090> been<00:05:37.180> avoided<00:05:37.419> I

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
I'm sure that could have been avoided I

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.360 
I'm sure that could have been avoided I
