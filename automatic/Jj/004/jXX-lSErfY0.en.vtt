want to make too many rules in the
beginning<00:01:45.620> yo<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.600> don't<00:01:48.600> worry<00:01:48.810> about

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
beginning yo you I don't worry about

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.930 
beginning yo you I don't worry about
what<00:01:49.500> would<00:01:49.770> happen<00:01:50.010> once<00:01:50.400> we<00:01:50.520> had<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.760> place

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
what would happen once we had to place

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.090 
what would happen once we had to place
and<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.450> would<00:01:51.720> happen<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.260> not<00:01:52.440> just<00:01:52.920> do

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and this would happen that's not just do

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.070 
and this would happen that's not just do
it<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.490> 28<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.150> are<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.630> once<00:01:54.960> you're

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
it and 28 they are and once you're

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.540 
it and 28 they are and once you're
confronted<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.680> real<00:01:55.860> problem<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.400> can

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
confronted with a real problem you can

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.070 
confronted with a real problem you can
think<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.880> how<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.030> deal<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.480> it<00:01:57.720> but<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.050> you

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
think of how to deal with it but if you

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.770 
think of how to deal with it but if you
make<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.470> too<00:01:58.680> many<00:01:59.030> rules<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.360> frameworks

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
make up too many rules and frameworks

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.840 
make up too many rules and frameworks
for<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.230> handle<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.890> special<00:02:02.340> situations

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
for how to handle a special situations

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.850 
for how to handle a special situations
then<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.870> end<00:02:04.050> up<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.440> lot<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.620> pure
