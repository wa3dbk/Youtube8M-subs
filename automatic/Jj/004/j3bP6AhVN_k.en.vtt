00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
cross by works between the ps3 as well

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.509 
cross by works between the ps3 as well
as<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.000> PS<00:02:29.420> Vita<00:02:29.750> edition<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.709> hopefully<00:02:31.400> it's

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
as the PS Vita edition so hopefully it's

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.979 
as the PS Vita edition so hopefully it's
only<00:02:31.700> going<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.849> be<00:02:31.909> five<00:02:32.150> dollars<00:02:32.360> maybe

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
only going to be five dollars maybe

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.559 
only going to be five dollars maybe
it'll<00:02:33.319> be<00:02:33.349> even<00:02:33.680> cheaper<00:02:33.890> but<00:02:34.849> in<00:02:35.000> my<00:02:35.420> opinion

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
it'll be even cheaper but in my opinion

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.149 
it'll be even cheaper but in my opinion
it<00:02:36.049> would<00:02:36.110> be<00:02:36.230> absolutely<00:02:36.440> awesome<00:02:36.739> if<00:02:37.129> you

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
it would be absolutely awesome if you

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.030 
it would be absolutely awesome if you
could<00:02:37.340> also<00:02:37.579> cross<00:02:38.230> transfer<00:02:39.230> your<00:02:39.440> maps<00:02:39.829> from

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
could also cross transfer your maps from

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.330 
could also cross transfer your maps from
the<00:02:40.129> ps3<00:02:40.489> over<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.690> PS<00:02:42.079> Vita<00:02:42.590> edition<00:02:43.220> I

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the ps3 over to the PS Vita edition I

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.649 
the ps3 over to the PS Vita edition I
don't<00:02:43.790> know<00:02:43.909> if<00:02:44.030> they're<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.329> end<00:02:44.510> up

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
don't know if they're going to end up

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.930 
don't know if they're going to end up
doing<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:45.140> because<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.799> Vita<00:02:46.129> might<00:02:46.489> not<00:02:46.700> be

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
doing that because the Vita might not be

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.390 
doing that because the Vita might not be
capable<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.659> actually<00:02:48.110> handed<00:02:48.620> handling<00:02:49.220> a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
capable of actually handed handling a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.479 
capable of actually handed handling a
ps3<00:02:50.390> map<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.470> think<00:02:51.709> if<00:02:51.799> they<00:02:51.920> were<00:02:51.980> capable

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
ps3 map but I think if they were capable

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.400 
ps3 map but I think if they were capable
of<00:02:52.790> adding<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.510> would<00:02:53.629> be<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.750> definite

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
of adding that it would be a definite

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.530 
of adding that it would be a definite
good<00:02:54.739> feature<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.459> do<00:02:55.640> because<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.390> can

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
good feature to do because you can
