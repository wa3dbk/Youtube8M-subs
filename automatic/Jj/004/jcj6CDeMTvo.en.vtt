00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.040
 fuel was falling 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.070
 at that moment they were trying to 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.880
 get the teacher ferra de bartol 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.469
 we we had to be 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.689
 transferred to the governor the first the 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.599
 second was the national deputy Daniel 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:24.070
 you take the third term when this one 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:26.199
 we saw the transfer of Héctor Pérez 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.970
 margarida were working are all 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.310
 neighbors who are there neighbors of the 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.239
 place that in one way or another were 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.059
 trying to get out of there 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.670
 to professor ferrá de bartol in another 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.160
 sector of that place was he 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.579
 the pilot there is there is cared for 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.789
 Anibal Tur and the pilot also observe 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.930
 the characteristics that is the trunk of the 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.930
 helicopter of the province 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:02.440
 everything had been left in that sector is a 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.420
 field that had been prepared for a 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.030
 kind of plow 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.490
 or a sidewalk there were some marks as if 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.200
 It would have been a little field for children 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.930
 You see it served as a heliport 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.869
 let's say in that sector there was the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.090
 helipad was from the image towards 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.200
 the right side now taking in 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.549
 account I'm seeing is seeing the 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.259
 front of the TV to the side 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.899
 right and it was heliport let's say that 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.610
 there at that moment the helicopter 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.369
 lift off take off lift off flight and 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.460
 move around that good place there will be 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.770
 see that subject there was a strong burst of 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.670
 wind at that time they say that you can 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.340
 have been the wind and that has 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.689
 displaced what we did see we had the 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.549
 opportunity to witness a cut 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.259
 very large electric power and when 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.539
 we arrived at that place 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.130
 high voltage cables pulled on the 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.100
 floor when I say high voltage are of 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.330
 high voltage because it's the big line 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.399
 that arrives and is equal to this I think it is 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.810
 the 132 in that sense or that is that 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.119
 aggravated 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.680
 Exactly aggravated all people 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:05.990
 this one continued the two 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.479
 the moments to be able to this 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.180
 safeguard 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.430
 the integrity of people especially 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.030
 trying to get the professor ferra 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.890
 of Bartol in that sense and well that was 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.870
 a moment of shock or is one has to 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.299
 evaluate at that instant and it 's a mix 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.180
 of all is once everything ends 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.760
 make a speech about a joke there 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.860
 down there was the teacher 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.140
 that is the tail of the helicopter if the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.120
 back and back and down is 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.430
 let's say they saw it when you say there the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.590
 rotor in that sector when you do take out the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.480
 teacher is because she was currently speaking 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.489
 unless I was apparently 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.950
 she was crushed down with her legs and 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.920
 they took it over by one of the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.099
 helicopter top windows 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.640
 I was lying on one side 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.640
 of the helicopter
