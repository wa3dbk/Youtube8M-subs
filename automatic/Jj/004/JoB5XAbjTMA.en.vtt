00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
quick Junior reference okay we're going

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.860 
quick Junior reference okay we're going
to<00:00:54.829> move<00:00:54.980> on<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:55.550> second<00:00:56.420> bar<00:00:56.600> but

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
to move on to the the second bar but

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.770 
to move on to the the second bar but
just<00:00:57.110> a<00:00:57.199> quick<00:00:57.350> bit<00:00:57.590> of<00:00:57.620> revision<00:00:58.510> at<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.629> end

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
just a quick bit of revision at the end

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.410 
just a quick bit of revision at the end
of<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.930> last<00:01:00.110> lesson<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:01.120> left<00:01:02.120> you<00:01:02.360> with<00:01:04.420> an

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
of the last lesson I left you with an

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:19.920 
of the last lesson I left you with an
exercise<00:01:05.810> for<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.380> right<00:01:06.619> hand

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.389 

what<00:01:20.930> I'm<00:01:21.049> gonna<00:01:21.170> suggest<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:21.920> do<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.189> try<00:01:22.369> and

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
what I'm gonna suggest you do to try and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.719 
what I'm gonna suggest you do to try and
spice<00:01:22.729> up<00:01:23.000> practicing<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:24.310> if<00:01:25.310> we<00:01:25.549> take

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
spice up practicing that is if we take

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.469 
spice up practicing that is if we take
out<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.030> bridging<00:01:26.630> bar<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.110> bar<00:01:27.289> of<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:29.090> bar

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
out the bridging bar the bar of the bar

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:51.700 
out the bridging bar the bar of the bar
of<00:01:29.509> G<00:01:30.380> drones<00:01:34.390> so<00:01:35.390> we<00:01:35.659> end<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:35.929> with

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.460 

and<00:01:53.600> what<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.690> trying<00:01:54.870> to<00:01:54.900> suggest<00:01:55.050> that<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and what I'm trying to suggest that you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.180 
and what I'm trying to suggest that you
do<00:01:55.650> here<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.330> we'll<00:01:57.440> throw<00:01:58.440> in<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.800> bridging

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
do here is we'll throw in the bridging

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.790 
do here is we'll throw in the bridging
bar<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.760> take<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.510> bridging<00:02:00.869> bar<00:02:01.080> kind

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
bar and take out the bridging bar kind

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.719 
bar and take out the bridging bar kind
of<00:02:01.860> try<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.420> think<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.690> the<00:02:03.810> fly

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
of try and think on the fly

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.010 
of try and think on the fly
you<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.850> maybe<00:02:06.060> sometimes<00:02:06.540> play<00:02:07.910> through

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
you know maybe sometimes play through

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.420 
you know maybe sometimes play through
three<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> row<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> bridging<00:02:10.950> bar<00:02:11.130> or

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
three in a row with the bridging bar or

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.120 
three in a row with the bridging bar or
one<00:02:11.640> without<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.970> bridging<00:02:12.240> bar<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.630> try<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.040 

mix<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.340> your<00:02:17.370> practice<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.209> wee<00:02:18.360> bit<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.810> it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
mix up your practice a wee bit so it

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.410 
mix up your practice a wee bit so it
makes<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> little<00:02:19.709> less<00:02:20.010> repetitive<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.209> it

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
makes it a little less repetitive and it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.140 
makes it a little less repetitive and it
gives<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:22.280> something<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.430> kind<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.790> think

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
gives you something to kind of think

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.960 
gives you something to kind of think
about<00:02:24.209> while<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.810> while<00:02:25.620> you're<00:02:25.970> practicing

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
about while you while you're practicing

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.410 
about while you while you're practicing
this<00:02:27.060> technique<00:02:28.670> okay<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.730> we<00:02:29.970> bring<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.270> left

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
this technique okay so we bring the left

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:55.130 
this technique okay so we bring the left
hand<00:02:30.570> bucket

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.360 

we'll<00:02:56.140> add<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.740> next<00:02:56.980> note

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.030 

now<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.910> next<00:03:04.300> note<00:03:04.599> is<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.080> only<00:03:05.230> unbe<00:03:05.769> that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
now the next note is the only unbe that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.009 
now the next note is the only unbe that
we're<00:03:06.190> gonna<00:03:06.280> play<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.180> means<00:03:07.420> pinching

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
we're gonna play and that means pinching

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.750 
we're gonna play and that means pinching
with<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.290> four<00:03:08.530> finger<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.250> thumb<00:03:09.489> at

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
with the four finger and the thumb at

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.800 
with the four finger and the thumb at
the<00:03:09.879> same<00:03:10.060> time<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:12.099> pinch<00:03:12.879> or<00:03:13.300> it

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
the same time and that pinch or it

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.100 
the same time and that pinch or it
sounds<00:03:14.140> awful<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.739> isolation<00:03:15.930> sounds<00:03:16.930> like

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
sounds awful and isolation sounds like

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.809 
sounds awful and isolation sounds like
it<00:03:17.260> couldn't<00:03:17.560> possibly<00:03:17.590> work<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.489> sounds

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
it couldn't possibly work it sounds

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.920 
it couldn't possibly work it sounds
really<00:03:18.970> discordant<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:21.340> in<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.239> context<00:03:22.840> of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
really discordant but in the context of

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.890 
really discordant but in the context of
the<00:03:23.410> rhythm<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:25.209> works

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
the rhythm it works

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:39.670 
the rhythm it works
so

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.100 

Paige<00:03:41.360> so<00:03:42.800> as<00:03:43.800> well<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.100> playing<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.490> open<00:03:45.110> B

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
Paige so as well as playing that open B

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.570 
Paige so as well as playing that open B
string<00:03:46.310> I've<00:03:47.310> raised<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.120> bass<00:03:48.330> note<00:03:48.660> there

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
string I've raised the bass note there

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.700 
string I've raised the bass note there
that's<00:03:50.580> a<00:03:50.880> string<00:03:52.370> instead<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.430> playing<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
that's a string instead of playing the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.780 
that's a string instead of playing the
usual<00:03:56.180> G<00:03:58.070> bass<00:03:59.070> notes<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:01.080> raised<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
usual G bass notes and raised it to the

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.450 
usual G bass notes and raised it to the
third<00:04:03.030> fret<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:04.290> we<00:04:04.980> pinched<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:07.800> open<00:04:08.280> B

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
third fret and we pinched the open B

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.770 
third fret and we pinched the open B
string<00:04:08.490> and<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.990> fretted<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.860> string

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
string and that fretted a string

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:31.590 
string and that fretted a string
together<00:04:12.780> so

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.500 

it<00:04:32.110> may<00:04:32.320> be<00:04:32.380> easy<00:04:32.650> just<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:33.070> add<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.460> last<00:04:34.240> wee

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
it may be easy just to add the last wee

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.940 
it may be easy just to add the last wee
bits<00:04:34.780> in<00:04:34.930> there<00:04:35.110> because<00:04:35.200> we're<00:04:35.410> almost<00:04:35.560> there

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
bits in there because we're almost there

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.290 
bits in there because we're almost there
we've<00:04:36.520> almost<00:04:36.670> got<00:04:37.090> both<00:04:37.360> bars<00:04:38.970> let<00:04:39.970> me<00:04:40.060> play

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
we've almost got both bars let me play

00:04:40.300 --> 00:05:06.020 
we've almost got both bars let me play
the<00:04:40.510> whole<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:42.130> whole<00:04:42.280> thing

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.029 

that's<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.150> whole<00:05:07.330> lick<00:05:07.569> they<00:05:08.110> only<00:05:08.409> there's

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
that's a whole lick they only there's

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.189 
that's a whole lick they only there's
only<00:05:09.099> really<00:05:09.370> one<00:05:09.550> additional<00:05:10.479> fretted<00:05:10.960> notes

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
only really one additional fretted notes

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.119 
only really one additional fretted notes
to<00:05:11.680> add<00:05:11.830> after<00:05:12.129> that<00:05:12.400> pinch<00:05:12.669> and<00:05:13.889> it's<00:05:14.889> on<00:05:15.009> the

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
to add after that pinch and it's on the

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.689 
to add after that pinch and it's on the
offbeat's

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
offbeat's

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.700
