00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.450

 well ten artists and showmen and for that 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.130
 I could be quite familiar 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.570
 with the term 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.510
 in fact it is welcome among 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.180
 viiip who have 3 15% off at this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.220
 moment of larry on their orders 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.650
 where are the products in store so I 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 felt a little bit I bought that some 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.260
 novelties do not take us so this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.580
 what they are it's really the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.830
 fun to make this video there today 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.239
 in addition that I took a few weeks 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.399
 really to test them for you 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.260
 will close old complete because I have 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.500
 noticed that most of the time I 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.329
 was making a hall and I still had 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700
 information to give you except as 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.960
 angers but every product and I was doing 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.120
 not always a return on every 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.530
 product that I act so I find that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.910
 this is a good opportunity to test 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.800
 products and tell you everything this is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.789
 that I thought so let's start all of 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.920
 after that that they just have 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.510
 because I told you I was going 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.329
 really tried every product but are 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.410
 200 exception still in their edge I 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.960
 do not know if you're like me but 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.519
 when I had a new article that I 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.540
 find that cute beauty whatever 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.460
 it is or if I want you 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.220
 often present geneva in the box 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 several weeks when 6 and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 road 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.100
 do not get me wrong they are really 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.869
 all tested 100 for that so the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.509
 first top 10 I got myself 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.939

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.299
 once I bought a care product 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.509

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.659
 command and it's for the simple and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.030

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.750
 little mitt that I forgot my 200 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.550

 used to put self-tanner 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.800
 before that of bioderma that I have 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.050
 really really less than this one 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.050
 this one is really excellent it's 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.789
 still not difficult to do 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.949
 streaks on the body applies super 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.599
 easily you I'm obviously 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.479
 pay attention to at least one foot or sell a 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:51.219

 I used it too much whatever it sounds 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.099
 not even in the water bottle 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.719
 unlike that of bioderma which 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.940
 yawns really fast they have to 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:02.289
