00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.920
 greetings to all work there pardo you 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.920
 Ready for this friendly with me 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.840
 head away from the ball 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.300
 part the shot away and defender up 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.320
 this shooting central throw absolutely 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.320
 convenient for the concierge 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.420
 the flight is then imposed 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.340
 to the attention of the general public 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.680
 obvious the blow but then in play 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.160
 very very aggressive attention 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.160
 pierluigi 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.590
 shepherd 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.980
 donal 12 hoped to surprise him in 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.980
 game 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.770
 Kagawa 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.350
 shepherd deep into ibra 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.800
 the goalkeeper inadvertently deflects the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.800
 ball in the goal 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.350
 a missile a missile that does not have 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.619
 let the doorman escape 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.040
 the power of zlatan ibrahimovic from the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.040
 long distance 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.870
 has room to pull does not hold 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.870
 eye and the ball comes out of very little 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.860
 by intercepted attention and with 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.860
 this network is equal 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.330
 a terrible mistake for the goalkeeper 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.810
 unforgivable inattention piero 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.490
 limit of ridicule but the young free 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.000
 to hit on the break equals more or 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.620
 less suicide once the administration 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.620
 they have therefore drawn 1 1 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.160
 paris saint germain from try to go 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.989
 forward cavani sat danger is 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.150
 this but the ball in the end is not 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.319
 I never expected to come in 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.930
 this conclusion from a distance 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.680
 prohibitive did not find the goal for 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.680
 very little 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.040
 with which I am a good balloon a 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.970
 midfield gains meters it skips by 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.850
 net 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.240
 rome the goal that gives the situation of 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.240
 equality 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.530
 look little and it would have been a goal 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.600
 they look for cavani in the middle 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.560
 apparently it hits the crossbar and comes back in 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.560
 gug field 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.240
 Earns meters towards the area 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.360
 ibra is a very heavy goal can 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.360
 to party 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.700
 two networks made up so far really a 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.959
 devastating impact on defense 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.520
 opposing 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.690
 this is lightning is not a shot has 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.680
 pierced the goalkeeper trusting 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.720
 in the low corner 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.680
 let's review this goal from another 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.370
 good angle the enterprise parade from 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.370
 part of the goalkeeper 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.190
 bove young puts it in and now it is 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.190
 all in a tie 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.310
 a magnificent match embellished by 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.140
 these three goals great power the ball 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.459
 it is stowed just under the crossbar 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.620
 a goal this deserves to be 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.620
 also revised from another angle 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.969
 search door is placed to celebrate the goal 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.969
 of the advantage 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.220
 but the unleashed they have now taken 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.220
 measures to the opponents that the only one 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.020
 we can't complain from the point of 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.200
 realization view is really a big one 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.200
 show 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.110
 approaches the area 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.759
 great shot and with this network is reported 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.759
 of equality 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.020
 maximum uncertainty in this race we are 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:12.440
 obviously every mistake can be 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:14.510
 decisive aubameyang warehouse that louis 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:22.190
 the draw therefore at the end of the nineties 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:24.200
 minutes there is tiredness is obvious but it is 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.400
 fundamental to field now 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.050
 all the energies begin 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:35.470
 additional eye seeks the area of 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.470
 penalty but the outside will be corner 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.060
 he hits his head and can celebrate 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.060
 the goal of the advantage 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.770
 and this could be the goal that 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.770
 decides the heavy game 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.699
 simon the teams are tired a goal a 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.340
 this point absolutely does the 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.259
 difference three substitutions 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.889
 therefore the ball with an intervention 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.889
 easy 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.580
 attention danger attention the goal 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.370
 I do n't feel as soon as I have pity not 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.470
 they seem to want to stop scoring again 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.710
 it starts from the result of 6 to 4 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.430
 surely they are not staining it seems 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.930
 lots of exits 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:57.230
 so ends the first half 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:57.230
 additional beta 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.460
 great the tiki taka here is in the door 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.600
 ball that ends at the side 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.600
 on the problem for the goalkeeper 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:26.479
 thanks helmets that goal beautifully 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.569
 now seem to have the situation below 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.569
 control 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.110
 steal it again to the bag 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:05.210
 and with that it's really been over 

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.260
 almost a walk for them today and 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.260
 the opponents are never
