it<00:05:58.520> at<00:05:58.669> that<00:05:58.729> all<00:05:59.569> right<00:06:01.750> but<00:06:02.750> uh<00:06:03.039> yeah<00:06:04.039> it's

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
it at that all right but uh yeah it's

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.330 
it at that all right but uh yeah it's
really<00:06:04.430> just<00:06:04.610> fantastic<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.389> I<00:06:05.509> think<00:06:06.219> if<00:06:07.219> you

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
really just fantastic and I think if you

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.100 
really just fantastic and I think if you
haven't<00:06:07.699> given<00:06:07.819> Windows<00:06:08.240> Phone<00:06:08.479> ago<00:06:08.750> I<00:06:08.780> think

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
haven't given Windows Phone ago I think

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.200 
haven't given Windows Phone ago I think
you<00:06:09.229> should<00:06:09.409> really<00:06:09.770> give<00:06:10.039> it<00:06:10.159> a<00:06:10.250> shot<00:06:10.550> if

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
you should really give it a shot if

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.969 
you should really give it a shot if
