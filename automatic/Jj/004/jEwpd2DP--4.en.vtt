00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.580
 hey tractors as such but in which 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.109
 more passion of very well today I bring you the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.210
 new review of this new motorcycle clip 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.950
 Grapo aroma falls from being point x 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.210
 remember that this amount is compatible 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.880
 with all the missions you have to see 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.310
 with the meter for grace jones 0 point x 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.840
 from now on we're like guys in 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.940
 the good one I liked a lot and because this 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.680
 way it's about the way achievements in the 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.660
 which then the world adds what they are 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.540
 the neutrals just as it offers as they can 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.399
 see adjust the mode we see a 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.649
 small button of what the letter would be 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.380
 which is in the lower right 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.829
 that as you can see the mote is created 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.390
 by yao 3300 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.739
 the mode is in Spanish and you can also 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.850
 be in English and ccoo since if you guys 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.200
 they speak English well also in the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.910
 description will be the fashion star 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.649
 in English as you can see we have 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.440
 some mountains which are very 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.100
 easy and our very difficult and as 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.990
 you can see this mode has this achievement 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.270
 of what would be pc like for example the 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.590
 end says find led 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.600
 I do not think they want the city 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.429
 implementing what would be the in 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.719
 basically they have not implemented it like this 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.579
 that then this monster that is not going to 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.710
 to be able to do and that would be 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.539
 investments forward so well as 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.310
 can see we also have basic mods 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.240
 like getting wood and you 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.399
 attacks a tree 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.979
 the block of wood salgado is worth 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:31.220
 example if I cut what this would be 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.190
 tree but as you can see right now 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.660
 wait wait as you can see more 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.000
 late the leader what he says achievement 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.160
 obtained by getting wood worth this 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.560
 achievement is something very easy because it is one of 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.660
 those that more of the easier ones but with 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.020
 aspects in what would be the city and the 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.420
 city â€‹â€‹and well that is not worth as you can see 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.400
 Well yes it has given me what it would be 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.630
 achievement and I have the wood now if I 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.910
 I want to make another module that I want 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.620
 work says elaborate a quad bank 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.690
 working with four wooden blocks 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.820
 what I would have to do would be to create 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.590
 a postman's table and how can you see 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.990
 I made the achievement obtained to work 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.610
 as you can see how what is added 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.990
 are the achievements of the pc and it has 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.060
 liked many boys 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.430
 as you can see now tells me now of 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.990
 mine which he says uses tables and 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.190
 sticks to make a peak is what I just 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.350
 to say guys how can you see 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.930
 right now and remember nothing is a point 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.970
 js and needs by wire because it requires 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.320
 the textures so they can come out of 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.959
 mold I do not know doing it will work 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.959
 well and then we're not going to do another 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.790
 that would be the hot topic of 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.470
 building a furnace is worth the only thing 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.300
 we have to do is get what 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.490
 it would be eight blocks 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.490
 of stone would be 1 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.500
 is with this color 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.380
 Four. Five 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.540
 6 7 and 8 is now worth what we have to 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.430
 to do would be to go to the search table 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.920
 the work table as industrial pussy 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.380
