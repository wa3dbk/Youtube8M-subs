00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
know I did some research on my own and

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.600 
know I did some research on my own and
some<00:00:30.060> private<00:00:30.420> lobbies<00:00:30.570> whatnot<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.610> list

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
some private lobbies whatnot with a list

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
some private lobbies whatnot with a list
some<00:00:32.760> people<00:00:33.060> and<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.540> did<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:33.840> testing<00:00:34.230> with

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
some people and I did some testing with

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.710 
some people and I did some testing with
the<00:00:34.500> mp5<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.160> figured<00:00:35.970> out<00:00:36.030> how<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.240> use<00:00:36.540> it

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
the mp5 and I figured out how to use it

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.530 
the mp5 and I figured out how to use it
long<00:00:36.900> range<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.470> little<00:00:37.830> bit<00:00:37.920> more<00:00:38.070> effectively

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
long range a little bit more effectively

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.760 
long range a little bit more effectively

just let you guys know I did some

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.440 
just let you guys know I did some
research<00:01:11.369> like<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.759> said<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> pulled<00:01:12.330> myself

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
research like I said I pulled myself

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.090 
research like I said I pulled myself
aside<00:01:12.899> with<00:01:13.050> some<00:01:13.170> other<00:01:13.290> players<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> did

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
aside with some other players and I did

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
aside with some other players and I did
some<00:01:14.880> testing<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.420> from<00:01:15.600> long<00:01:15.750> range<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
some testing on it from long range of

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.499 
some testing on it from long range of
whatnot<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.440> I<00:01:16.500> figured<00:01:16.800> out<00:01:16.860> why<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:18.149> recoil

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
whatnot and I figured out why the recoil

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.040 
whatnot and I figured out why the recoil
so<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.560> random<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.190> what<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.149> came<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.420> with<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
so so random and what I came up with and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.020 
so so random and what I came up with and
I<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.160> my<00:01:23.250> Sun<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:23.880> bit

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
I know there's my Sun a little bit

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.150 
I know there's my Sun a little bit
confusing<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> did<00:01:25.470> come<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.920> is

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
confusing but what I did come up with is

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.430 
confusing but what I did come up with is
you<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.729> when<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> use<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> mp5<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
you are when you use the mp5 you

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.320 
you are when you use the mp5 you
shouldn't<00:01:28.830> try<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.160> control<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.819> what<00:01:30.149> and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
shouldn't try to control it what and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.210 
shouldn't try to control it what and
what<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> mean<00:01:30.660> by<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.649> shouldn't<00:01:31.950> try

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
what I mean by that is you shouldn't try

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.639 
what I mean by that is you shouldn't try
to<00:01:32.250> aim<00:01:32.550> with<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> joystick<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:33.929> you

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
to aim with the joystick like this you

shouldn't<00:01:34.920> try<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.069> do<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.420> if<00:01:36.420> you're

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
shouldn't try to do that if you're

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:37.400 
shouldn't try to do that if you're
shooting<00:01:36.810> somebody

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
don't try to aim because that's where

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.999

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
recoil go try it yourself now if there's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
recoil go try it yourself now if there's
a<00:02:11.370> guy<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.580> comes<00:02:11.880> out<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> door<00:02:12.510> let's

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
a guy that comes out of the door let's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.860 
a guy that comes out of the door let's
just<00:02:13.200> use<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:13.500> dummy<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:13.980> instance<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.870> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
just use this dummy for instance if you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.900 
just use this dummy for instance if you
leave<00:02:16.230> your<00:02:16.770> crosshair<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.430> him<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.760> this

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
leave your crosshair on him like this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.670 
leave your crosshair on him like this
and<00:02:18.209> strafe<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.630> use<00:02:18.840> your<00:02:18.990> left<00:02:19.230> joystick<00:02:19.410> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
and strafe and use your left joystick to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.699 
and strafe and use your left joystick to
aim<00:02:20.000> it's<00:02:21.000> gonna<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> lot<00:02:21.569> more<00:02:21.750> steady<00:02:22.050> so

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
aim it's gonna be a lot more steady so

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.050 
aim it's gonna be a lot more steady so
if<00:02:23.069> he<00:02:23.160> comes<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:23.459> you're<00:02:23.610> gonna<00:02:23.700> be<00:02:23.849> shooting

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
if he comes out you're gonna be shooting

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.610 
if he comes out you're gonna be shooting
it's<00:02:24.630> not<00:02:24.810> going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.990> go<00:02:25.110> everywhere<00:02:25.230> it's

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it's not going to go everywhere it's

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.030 
it's not going to go everywhere it's
gonna<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:26.069> them<00:02:26.250> 100%<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:27.000> time<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:28.230> if<00:02:28.680> you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
gonna be on them 100% of time so if you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.369

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
effective with the mp5 in case that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.600
