00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.970
 really 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.800
 good the dressing rooms of the joy Slavic with 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.330
 the five boys components of the 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.190
 boyband the anthill 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.840
 the first thing you feel after 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.050
 leave the stage with so many people 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.790
 delivered to the Madrid public 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.840
 an absolute pass, that is when we have 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.970
 left when we finished 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.760
 concert we have entered or we have 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.410
 left the stage and we said that 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.510
 has been this or we have embraced 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.100
 been a rush of adrenaline gives brutal 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.110
 because there was so much energy so much love 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.420
 so many screams so many hands pulling 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.730
 us that the song is not passion and 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.930
 so much love that we have felt 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.820
 super comfortable super comfortable and 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.050
 we would repeat, I think 80 times 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.960
 followed what we have experienced tonight 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.030
 It has been brutal, it is already one, it has been the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.770
 last concert of the year but you have already 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.600
 enough in different cities because 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.910
 I made a mini tour as an appetizer 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.800
 what is to come not yes the truth 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.899
 that are being quite different 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.950
 concerts because I think it depends on 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.390
 city ​​of which you are the people are 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.520
 how in one way or another there are people 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.489
 which is like more more than shouting to jump 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.289
 there are people who are more than give me everything not 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.940
 I swear it is very different 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.530
 public of Spain but we are 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.030
 very grateful and today's welcome 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 been incredible 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 something more than to contribute god that I'm still 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 flipping because it's been the people were 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.360
 so delivered that it was like you are 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 Really liking people was like you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.400
 I keep singing that is ROCKED is 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.400
 One last 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.460
 by twitter we were live was 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.570
 on twitter I did not see myself asking 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.820
 what do you like and the people if that's fine 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.890
 good guys get the time is your 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.170
 last single second second single 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.360
 State makes a very short video clip as 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.550
 it's being the welcome that comments 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.550
 of the people they deprive 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.700
 because the roll we have is more 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.140
 sugar cane that is theoretically expected 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.880
 a boyband and the truth that the video clip 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.740
 it's like a movie is a party 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.350
 wild does not happen a disco os 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.069
 like partying we are not going to deny that we do not 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.069
 like the party 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.960
 and that is still working very well 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.330
 people give themselves a lot we sing in 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.090
 Spanish we sing in English we dance and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.920
 until show that too because if 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.250
 it's a very van that sings dances and you have 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.070
 all 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.870
 or you do everything you go no but to 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.020
 we really like what it is 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.970
 apart from having vocal quality have a 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.320
 a setting very powerful scene 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.900
 visual level because it's really what 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.580
 that's how you'll remember a number that today 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.870
 a show spectacle and that the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.459
 people can stop an entrance and then they 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.010
 see happy home say has paid me 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.660
 to see the WiFi and enjoy them 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.670
 they are happy but I have heard many 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.870
 screams to take off your shirt and that's what 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.590
 you have fulfilled 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.110
 for now we are in negotiation 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.239
 with the followers of the concerts and 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.810
 all that and there is a possibility what happens 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.280
 is that Cristian is also he and I in 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.310
 concrete we are talking about the subject of 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.810
 start the bikini operation already 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.580
 prepared they are very prepared 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.870
 they are the good guys or the group and 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.870
 you too, that is, but I 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.390
 in a certain part yes yes I think they run away 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.850
 then the house would be little by little and 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.410
 also that the thing not well, well, attentive 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.330
 because in future concerts if you go to 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.330
 the best is removed, good, we continue 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.330
 our first single going up was a 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.610
 expression disks to the anthill 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.550
 means how are they already in various 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.690
 radios in mogollón of means that by 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.790
 example go to a store and be 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.860
 sounding today is born the truth is that it is a 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.000
 last because going up full the 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.220
 requirements that we want us to 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.200
 basically explains from the beginning of the 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.150
 casting to this day does not explain 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.530
 how to fulfill a dream how to fight and is 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.480
 a song that we like very much is no longer 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.770
 for the song itself but because it has 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.780
 a meaning or we have met 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.970
 thanks to the song the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.430
 group with the song the 25 guys that 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.990
 we arrived at the final casting was for the 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.700
 same song and you want you do not have a 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.920
 special love and listen to her 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.910
 radio the TV that people take them 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.800
 because in the concert when 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.020
 we approached micro people the djellaba 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.970
 It was like the girl sang, not the 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.040
 sang very well done because the 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.440
 they sang in high pitch let's leave it 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.489
 there already really 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.489
 call him x 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.280
 but I really think it's not a 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.080
 song that we define ourselves a lot as 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.759
 group and I really do not know we have a 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.280
 Special love and to get to know each other 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.630
 a little more defined one by one not 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.180
 yourselves to make it easier 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.720
 a feature that's good then 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.510
 be your highest quality then Jorge 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.490
 it's here in front 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.960
 apart from being the one who dances better than 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.440
 everything has to be said is the most noble of 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.840
 all nobility for hong come hooligan 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.300
 to mark because there is nothing else 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.760
 cristian dad cristian that's the 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.830
 definition for cristian exact 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:08.370
 fabio charisma pure charisma alberto me 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.390
 I would say that a great virtue you have 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.190
 have to listen to many levels 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.620
 When you listen today, yours appears on 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.300
 mine and listen to it today today spoke of your 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.300
 listen because when you talk to Alberto 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.350
 is from seville de sevilla and a word to 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.610
 I have not been allowed to finish in this 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.129
 deck of cards 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.199
 good good we follow what things wait 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:39.759
 soon to wifi some next 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:43.750
 album project because we already have 27 of 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:46.120
 January the first ep comes out with four quotes 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.340
 that you will see are very cool and 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.590
 we also have planned for what 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.090
 April would be approximately the disc 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.159
 complete a disc with the four 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.719
 nations and many more because it is for 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.699
 carlos jean electric nana et cetera 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:59.409
 Etcetera waters of the house is cool 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.879
 weiwei i'm talking about carlos in how 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.979
 is to work with him with the team of 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.840
 anthill because you have joined together 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.900
 it's super little and have that platform 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.879
 I guess it's appreciated to thank and 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.460
 a simile to thank you, not who loves me 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:14.110
 answer yesterday imposes a little the 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.219
 situation at the beginning because you just 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.889
 you get in a car studio 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:20.259
 gym with a lot of equipment a lot of people 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.479
 focused on working with you and you think 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.129
 how will carlos jean be close will be 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.009
 it will not be close and I really believe that 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.020
 we are why six because carlos really is 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.520
 as one more and is very humble above all 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.020
 the good thing is that it counts a lot 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.159
 with everyone's opinion and has a 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.589
 creativity when making music 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:36.400
 incredible that I leave you to also say to 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.490
 you 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.080
 and of course in fact when we get into 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.930
 the studio always tells us look 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.490
 out of phase do whatever you want and that's how it is 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.990
 the way we have then to take out 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.400
 cool new things things 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.889
 in which we are participating 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.389
 the song I do if I bring you happy I do not know 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.600
 if I'm going to say it out of date because 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.600
 you go 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:03.430
 and they gave the radio good to something else 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:04.810
 butterfly theme you can tell us something that 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.180
 I wanted to comment, is that for example 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.189
 I have tried to learn for today the 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.990
 choreography but there's been no way 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:12.639
 because I'm very clumsy is not what you 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.009
 we propose from happy is that you make us 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.080
 a didactic video to learn then 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.150
 with little steps that will gradually 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.219
 It seems to me that it's great, 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.569
 it seems like a very good idea because that's how we 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:24.569
 it comes well to us to review it 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.960
 and what is going to make you look good 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.590
 people who are dancing besides singing 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.470
 man or whatever that would be 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:37.430
 is that I do not have a taco is great because 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.730
 you have to say a good taco is 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.730
 wonderful amazing 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.710
