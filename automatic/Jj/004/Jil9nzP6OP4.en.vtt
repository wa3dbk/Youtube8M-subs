it's<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:32.770> little<00:01:33.070> bit<00:01:33.160> outfit<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:33.850> think<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:34.600> by

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
it's a little bit outfit I think just by

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.290 
it's a little bit outfit I think just by
its<00:01:35.050> nature<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:35.860> makes<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.610> interesting<00:01:36.910> for

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
its nature that makes it interesting for

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.960 
its nature that makes it interesting for
pinball<00:01:37.960> it's<00:01:38.800> an<00:01:38.890> idea<00:01:39.160> that<00:01:39.220> Jorge<00:01:39.550> Gomez

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
pinball it's an idea that Jorge Gomez

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.610 
pinball it's an idea that Jorge Gomez
has<00:01:40.060> had<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:41.020> it's<00:01:41.290> made<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.500> game

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
has had and and it's made the game

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.890 
has had and and it's made the game
harder<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.610> develop<00:01:42.760> right<00:01:43.480> from<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.720> get-go

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
harder to develop right from the get-go

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.250 
harder to develop right from the get-go
I<00:01:44.440> thought<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:46.090> notion<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:46.600> Autobots

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
I thought that the notion of Autobots

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.530 
I thought that the notion of Autobots
and<00:01:47.410> Decepticons<00:01:47.580> was<00:01:48.580> interesting<00:01:49.300> in<00:01:49.420> and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
and Decepticons was interesting in and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.780 
and Decepticons was interesting in and
of<00:01:49.630> itself<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.410> had<00:01:50.530> never<00:01:50.680> really<00:01:51.040> seen<00:01:51.070> a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
of itself and I had never really seen a

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.910 
of itself and I had never really seen a
scenario<00:01:52.600> within<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.290> transformers

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
scenario within the transformers

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.980 
scenario within the transformers
environment<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.700> allowed<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.030> player<00:01:55.540> to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
environment that allowed a player to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.320 
environment that allowed a player to
decide<00:01:56.620> whether<00:01:57.370> he<00:01:57.580> was<00:01:57.730> an<00:01:57.880> Autobot<00:01:58.300> or

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
decide whether he was an Autobot or

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.540 
decide whether he was an Autobot or
Decepticon<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:59.560> choice<00:01:59.830> is<00:02:00.280> going<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.490> be

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
Decepticon the choice is going to be

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.400 
Decepticon the choice is going to be
made<00:02:00.850> as<00:02:01.090> soon<00:02:01.270> as<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.510> point<00:02:01.810> up<00:02:01.960> if<00:02:02.230> you're

than when you're playing the septagon
it's<00:02:07.960> not<00:02:08.080> just<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.380> rule<00:02:08.710> concept<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.520> whole

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
transform and all of these challenges

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.780 
transform and all of these challenges
will<00:02:16.090> be<00:02:16.140> adjusted<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.410> create<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:18.400> scenario

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
will be adjusted to create that scenario

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.610 
will be adjusted to create that scenario

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.150 
lives I kind of drove to the concept
from<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.090> notion<00:02:34.570> of<00:02:34.720> are<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.350> an<00:02:35.470> autobot<00:02:35.890> or

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
from the notion of are you an autobot or

from the notion of are you an autobot or
are<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.520> do<00:02:36.610> something<00:02:37.030> I'm<00:02:37.989> hoping<00:02:38.500> that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
are you to do something I'm hoping that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.280 
are you to do something I'm hoping that
the<00:02:39.340> discovery<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.150> playthrough<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.140> an

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the discovery of playthrough is an

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.010 
the discovery of playthrough is an
autobot<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.860> play<00:02:42.250> through<00:02:42.459> as<00:02:43.020> Decepticon

autobot and play through as Decepticon

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.040 
autobot and play through as Decepticon
is<00:02:44.050> as<00:02:44.830> compelling<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.489> people<00:02:45.520> as<00:02:46.030> as<00:02:46.390> I

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
is as compelling to people as as I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.960 
is as compelling to people as as I
imagined<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.560> concept<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.100> be<00:02:48.250> initially

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
imagined the concept to be initially

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.510 
imagined the concept to be initially
it's<00:02:49.150> going<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.510> be<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.900> split<00:02:50.290> artwork<00:02:50.830> but

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
it's going to be the split artwork but

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.160 
it's going to be the split artwork but
then<00:02:51.640> once<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.940> start<00:02:52.030> playing<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.020> game

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
then once you start playing the game

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.320 
then once you start playing the game
it's<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> fact<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:53.980> you're<00:02:54.220> getting<00:02:54.400> two

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
it's the fact that you're getting two

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.970 
it's the fact that you're getting two
games<00:02:55.570> at<00:02:55.780> one<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.260> been<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.470> while<00:02:56.709> since

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
games at one it's been a while since

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.910 
games at one it's been a while since
I've<00:02:57.220> focused<00:02:57.550> on<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.630> elements<00:02:59.050> of<00:02:59.170> flow<00:02:59.530> in

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
I've focused on the elements of flow in

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.340 
I've focused on the elements of flow in
a<00:03:00.100> pinball<00:03:00.310> machine<00:03:00.489> for<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.330> long<00:03:01.510> time<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.810> made

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
a pinball machine for a long time I made

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.840 
a pinball machine for a long time I made
games<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:03.040> were<00:03:03.220> all<00:03:03.370> about<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
games that were all about the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.340 
games that were all about the
combination<00:03:04.150> shots<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.080> how<00:03:05.170> many

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
combination shots and how many

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.570 
combination shots and how many
combinations<00:03:05.650> could<00:03:06.130> be<00:03:06.250> hooked<00:03:06.459> together

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
combinations could be hooked together

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.790 
combinations could be hooked together
and<00:03:07.209> so<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.420> was<00:03:07.510> kind<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.750> fun<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.170> go<00:03:08.260> back<00:03:08.290> and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
and so it was kind of fun to go back and

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.009 
and so it was kind of fun to go back and
creating<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.400> game<00:03:09.610> though<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:10.180> had<00:03:10.660> some<00:03:10.930> of

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
creating a game though that had some of

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.770 
creating a game though that had some of
that<00:03:11.080> speed<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:11.980> kept<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.910> cannon<00:03:13.390> yes

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
that speed we kept the cannon yes

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.840 
that speed we kept the cannon yes
there's<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.140> rapid<00:03:14.530> fire<00:03:14.709> cannons<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.640> fun

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
there's a rapid fire cannons and so fun

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.490 
there's a rapid fire cannons and so fun

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the effect that this cannon is actually

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.660 
the effect that this cannon is actually
recoiling<00:03:40.540> and<00:03:41.020> shooting<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.740> balls<00:03:41.980> at<00:03:42.460> the
