00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:12.780
 the clearest example of a when a woman 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.609
 let's say have a baby unbuttoned 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 touched children when a woman prick 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.460
 coming home with first born 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.109
 from the hospital she finds all men 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.519
 emergency working ability we are 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.199
 We know an example, that is, they for some reason 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.759
 remember they should work charge 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.899
 family and in fact here in this union 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.059
 mother and child 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.280
 and dad you are a stranger in essence 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.290
 things periodically in the beak there something 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.390
 brings some worms and how 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.440
 it turns out that he will work like 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.180
 or he is not interested to talk with any 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.270
 psychologists who deal with these 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.100
 questions they will say that in fact 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 he disappears at work because he doesn't 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.539
 tolerates competition with small 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.110
 a stranger who appeared in himself 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.100
 one may very well be on the unconscious 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.710
 level worries that this screaming 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 snotty pink lump distracts on 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.119
 all that was previously intended 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.770
 that is how he needs every situation 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.960
 considered in context that is here 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.210
 if we say before were warm 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.869
 relationship and how long was your spouse 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.310
 pregnant he guarded her wore on his hands 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.350
 kisses got these delicious things 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.530
 fulfilled her whim and after 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.549
 there was a little creature that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.689
 delays all love energy 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.210
 and mean 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.560
 husband began to leave dad of this family 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 diners these families here 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.960
 Of course there chu fight with works 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.829
 she sits down and talks but how 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 rule in such situations when young 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.240
 people become moms and dads men 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.119
 of course that's how weaker sex is with my 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.700
 perspectives they react regressively 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.990
 that is, they become 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.740
 psychological age is much younger 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.469
 than their children the other day the context 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.539
 consider situations as well as would be easy 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.310
 just work so that you do not arise 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.200
 it's not like itself, that is, 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.560
 occurs as a symptom of the disease and fight 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.959
 with 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 it is at least ridiculous 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.239
 grab this symptom pull it and 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.910
 looking where it all goes as well as when 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.530
 flu funny let's say there fight with 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.150
 temperature if we understand perfectly 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.060
 what is this temperature really 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.319
 kills massive viruses will fight 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.690
 and instead of one week of sickness you will 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.150
 sick months will kill there 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 immunity so it seems to me that here 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.870
 when does a psychological one arise 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.620
 the problem of the third extra need every 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.080
 case study psychologists 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.180
 there may be loved ones who react 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.430
 adequately on the situation gives advice 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.500
 is that he does not kill 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.160
 symptom not treat symptomatically this 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 the situation does not fight work 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.190
 understand the set of each particular 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.959
 case that is all that is often so 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.459
 you are younger, that is all that is not 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.349
 compete with our son 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.349
 why are you so hurt and
