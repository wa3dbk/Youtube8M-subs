added some water enough water to cover

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.240 
added some water enough water to cover
the<00:03:13.639> beans<00:03:13.810> I'm<00:03:14.810> gonna<00:03:15.079> place<00:03:15.379> these<00:03:15.889> beans

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
the beans I'm gonna place these beans

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.059 
the beans I'm gonna place these beans
into<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.759> blender<00:03:17.299> so<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:17.959> have<00:03:18.169> half<00:03:18.470> my<00:03:18.769> black

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
into the blender so I have half my black

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.699 
into the blender so I have half my black
beans<00:03:19.639> going<00:03:20.030> into<00:03:20.269> the<00:03:20.389> blender<00:03:20.629> and<00:03:21.079> I<00:03:21.470> have

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
beans going into the blender and I have

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.339 
beans going into the blender and I have
other<00:03:22.250> half<00:03:22.609> still<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.359> pan<00:03:23.659> okay<00:03:24.049> you'll

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
other half still in the pan okay you'll

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.849 
other half still in the pan okay you'll
see<00:03:24.409> that<00:03:24.709> later

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
see that later

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.740 
see that later
unfortunately<00:03:27.859> my<00:03:28.250> blender<00:03:28.790> was<00:03:29.150> acting<00:03:29.629> up

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
unfortunately my blender was acting up

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:41.330 
unfortunately my blender was acting up
so<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.019> had<00:03:30.169> to<00:03:30.290> use<00:03:30.409> another<00:03:30.680> blender

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.120 

so<00:03:42.000> as<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.240> can<00:03:42.420> see<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.200> blending<00:03:43.860> nicely

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
so as you can see it is blending nicely

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.059 
so as you can see it is blending nicely
and<00:03:45.260> you're<00:03:46.260> gonna<00:03:46.410> see<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.709> consistency

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
and you're gonna see the consistency

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.090 
and you're gonna see the consistency
that<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:48.120> want<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.690> have<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.080> on<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.980> don't

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
that I want you to have it on you don't

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.010 
that I want you to have it on you don't
want<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.400> too<00:03:50.640> thick<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.360> don't<00:03:51.690> want<00:03:51.930> it

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
want it too thick and you don't want it

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.309 
want it too thick and you don't want it
watery<00:03:52.970> so<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.330> how<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.510> want<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.020> and

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
watery so this is how you want it and

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.110 
watery so this is how you want it and
this<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:55.740> exactly<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.459> reason<00:03:56.550> why<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:56.880> add

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
this is exactly the reason why you add

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:06.650 
this is exactly the reason why you add
water<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:57.989> way<00:03:58.140> it's<00:03:58.350> not<00:03:58.440> thick<00:04:05.239> so<00:04:06.239> now

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
water so that way it's not thick so now

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.110 
water so that way it's not thick so now
we're<00:04:07.410> getting<00:04:07.890> our<00:04:08.130> drain<00:04:08.610> all<00:04:08.790> ready

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120

you gonna have your small trainer you
don't<00:04:11.550> get<00:04:11.760> another<00:04:12.450> trainer<00:04:12.780> with<00:04:13.050> a<00:04:13.080> larger

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
don't get another trainer with a larger

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.380 
don't get another trainer with a larger
hose<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.670> then<00:04:14.760> you're<00:04:14.880> gonna<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.209> your
