about<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> little<00:01:18.420> bit<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.840> give<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> bit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
about to a little bit just to give a bit

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.810 
about to a little bit just to give a bit
more<00:01:19.280> volume<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.930> there's<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.020> big<00:01:22.170> difference

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
more volume but there's a big difference

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.420 
more volume but there's a big difference
is<00:01:22.940> to<00:01:23.150> use<00:01:23.480> heat<00:01:23.690> mechanism<00:01:24.260> operating<00:01:24.590> to

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
is to use heat mechanism operating to

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.770 
is to use heat mechanism operating to
not<00:01:25.700> use<00:01:25.909> them<00:01:26.060> for<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.300> past<00:01:26.510> three<00:01:26.750> months
