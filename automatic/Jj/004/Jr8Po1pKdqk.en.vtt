00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.009
 and there folks of the month linux bsd stock 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.679
 is talking about samsung 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.660
 galaxy s 6 and 25 from the camera part that 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.500
 even talk a little about the part of the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.380
 interface of one and another a certain eu 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.070
 I 'm the one who complains the most 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.720
 interface of samsung on the part of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.510
 cane I like everyone knows I see that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.230
 the interface will have better interface 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.210
 today machine camera gives to you 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.879
 take the photo is motorola 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.469
 I have not even discuss what's here 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.379
 samsung even gave an improved kiyota 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.289
 hiding the icons here at s6 is here 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.309
 There is no way to hide the s5. 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.480
 I did not like the s5 here, we have these 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.420
 here with the information 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.449
 For you to set up, this is what I found 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 very interesting here I think it's cool 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.470
 too much 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.180
 then she comes up with those six ac and puts 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.080
 this white screen I did not like 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.930
 i find it very bad i see so aa 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.020
 information through the images they 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 are better than this way you 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.380
 can find it faster when 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.600
 Are you used to the image you already have? 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.250
 Click on it you do not even have to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.159
 reads sometimes you know is if but you 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.829
 click here and good here you will have to read 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.670
 to understand I've got proof 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.159
 I do not like it here at all. 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.009
 interface on the side here has not changed almost 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.290
 nothing here we have to avoid showing 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.720
 showing that the night mode and the card 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.530
 memory to record machine 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.850
 a mode you want to record 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.470
 automatic beetle the hospital are the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.000
 modes and I can also download the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.840
 here and the preview there in the photo gallery 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.390
 this is the s5 of s 6h leiria rose 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.920
 We have the camcorder to take a photo. 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 to reverse the front camera and 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.500
 rear and a way here that we have 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.360
 now that the rescue mode this 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.780
 It's interesting but the best would be 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.640
 same as s5 you'll see here I 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.610
 I'm filming that way it would be 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.280
 I think this one understood better. 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.170
 This one here you will not get as much attention 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.860
 because you have transparent background there 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.680
 not 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.430
 here you have more attention because he 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.160
 darken here you get to know him 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.780
 is not it cover here the skin you 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.180
 can better define what you want 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.230
 What is going on here? 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.000
 because sometimes you will be on top 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.880
 of a color you will not get 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.700
 read it right then I found it here a little 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.030
 It's cuter just that it's not, I do not think so. 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.430
 how practical the s5 so I can 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.239
 Talk to you the following exists here 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.900
 a mix of improvements and not improvements 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.730
 understood is a nice something that the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.260
 another also has but also the other has 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.650
 something I did not like 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.290
 Right and that's what I had to say 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.120
 I was basically from the cameras, I'm not going 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.430
 to do a test of cameras now was only 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.209
 to show more the interface left 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.209
 here as it left 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:29.820
 basically the same time for it to 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.080
 give focus here is something I wanted 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:35.100
 show you the next I will 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.260
 clicking the camera is the time it took 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.900
 Right now here we are going to click two 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:50.310
 Sometimes in the instant home we'll get 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:54.690
 to turn off the snapshot to get 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:58.380
 on the camera then it has a time of 0 7 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.190
 seconds to activate the camera s6 much 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.660
 fast while in the north 5 for example 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.090
 if I 'm here I have to do 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.730
 this to the time that takes you home from 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.530
 Cane is a great field time compared to 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.989
 to s6 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.820
 if I do not want to squeeze because I came 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.239
 I have to come here later. 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.640
 The time that I already lost right then no 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.060
 has to compete with this certainty 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.060
 It's off 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.139
 So far it has taken a while not one 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.419
 A little more but it 's not like that anymore 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.220
 Fuck that fast, just give the two touches. 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.139
 he already starts it already does the part there of the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.700
 which carry the right personal camera 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.590
 so this is what I hope you 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.230
 Did you like the video? It's a video. 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.240
 quick talk talking from camera 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.970
 layout camera sap employees 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.460
 How did each one get right? 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.940
 Thank you so much and said do not forget the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.940
 joinha ok
