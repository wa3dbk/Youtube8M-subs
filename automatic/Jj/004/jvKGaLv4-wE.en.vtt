00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
active dry or the instant yeast like

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.630 
active dry or the instant yeast like
that<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.949> make<00:00:32.099> sure<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.430> the

that just make sure you know the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.430 
that just make sure you know the
temperature<00:00:33.090> when<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.420> active<00:00:33.899> dry<00:00:34.110> it's

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
temperature when you use active dry it's

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.630 
temperature when you use active dry it's
110<00:00:35.100> degrees

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
110 degrees

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
110 degrees
this<00:00:36.090> one's<00:00:36.300> 120<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.200> I'm<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.440> use<00:00:37.559> this

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
this one's 120 so I'm going to use this

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.270 
this one's 120 so I'm going to use this
one<00:00:37.920> today<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.120> teaspoon<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.750> yeast

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
one today so it's one teaspoon of yeast

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.180 
one today so it's one teaspoon of yeast
it's<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.399> half<00:00:41.550> teaspoon<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> salt<00:00:43.190> two

warm<00:00:48.480> water<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.920> checked<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.550> good<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> use

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
warm water so I checked it's good to use

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
warm water so I checked it's good to use
a<00:00:51.030> instant-read<00:00:51.870> thermometer<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.559> have

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
a instant-read thermometer if you have

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.020 
a instant-read thermometer if you have
one<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.370> make<00:00:53.520> sure<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> water

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
one to make sure that the water

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850 
one to make sure that the water
temperature<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.629> right<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.440> we'll<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.680> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
temperature is right so we'll get this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.830 
temperature is right so we'll get this
going<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> add<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> water

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.189 

and<00:01:01.050> we're<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.649> mix<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.370> for

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
and we're going to mix it like that for

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
and we're going to mix it like that for
one<00:01:04.199> minute<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.769> we'll<00:01:05.580> start<00:01:05.820> shaping<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
one minute and we'll start shaping the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.370 
one minute and we'll start shaping the
bread<00:01:10.369> right<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.869> become

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
bread right as you can see it's become

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.710 
bread right as you can see it's become
kind<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.950> nice<00:01:14.670> little<00:01:14.970> ball<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.509> dough

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
kind of a nice little ball of dough

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.930 
kind of a nice little ball of dough
almost<00:01:16.100> it's<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.640> sticky

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
almost it's going to be a little sticky

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.370 
almost it's going to be a little sticky
but<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.360> good<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.899> we're<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.200> take

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
is to cut this into four this is going

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.050 
is to cut this into four this is going
to<00:02:06.750> make<00:02:06.869> four<00:02:07.140> flat<00:02:07.380> breads<00:02:07.649> okay<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.820> we<00:02:08.910> cut

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
that and each one gets shaped into a

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.810 
that and each one gets shaped into a
ball<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.799> is<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.070> way<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.190> kind<00:02:17.549> of<00:02:17.610> like

ball so this is the way I kind of like

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.300 
ball so this is the way I kind of like
kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> kind<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.200> go<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.950> know<00:02:20.040> there's<00:02:20.220> like

kind of kind of go you know there's like
a<00:02:20.370> drier<00:02:20.730> part<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.329> top<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.840> just<00:02:21.989> kind

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
a drier part on the top so you just kind

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.650 
a drier part on the top so you just kind
of<00:02:22.230> shape<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.590> like<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:24.090> sticky<00:02:24.510> you

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
of shape it like that it's sticky you

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.180 
of shape it like that it's sticky you
just<00:02:25.140> dip<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:25.920> flour<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.690> there<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.350> one

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
just dip it in flour and so there is one

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.970 
just dip it in flour and so there is one
and<00:02:29.370> keep<00:02:29.880> everything<00:02:30.120> floured<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.049> put<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:31.950> on

and keep everything floured so put it on

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.830 
and keep everything floured so put it on
a<00:02:32.040> floured<00:02:32.340> surface<00:02:32.549> there's<00:02:33.150> one<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.630> just

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
a floured surface there's one you just

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.150 
a floured surface there's one you just
want<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.019> get<00:02:34.109> it<00:02:34.230> round<00:02:34.410> enough<00:02:34.739> so<00:02:34.890> we<00:02:34.980> can

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
want to get it round enough so we can

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.390 
want to get it round enough so we can
get<00:02:35.640> rolled<00:02:35.940> into<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.209> ball<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.890> there's<00:02:38.100> four

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
get rolled into a ball so there's four

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.830 
get rolled into a ball so there's four
of<00:02:38.430> them<00:02:38.519> right<00:02:38.730> there<00:02:38.760> now<00:02:39.540> we're<00:02:39.690> going<00:02:39.780> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
of them right there now we're going to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.000 
of them right there now we're going to
flour<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.620> surface<00:02:41.010> really<00:02:41.519> well<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.980> put<00:02:43.980> a

flour this surface really well and put a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.349 
flour this surface really well and put a
little<00:02:44.190> bit<00:02:44.310> over<00:02:44.640> here<00:02:44.880> I'm<00:02:44.970> going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.150> set

get my rolling pin and you just roll

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.610 
get my rolling pin and you just roll
there's<00:02:59.609> no<00:02:59.840> secret<00:03:00.840> way<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.109> roll<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.590> just

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
I'd like to do all of them before we

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.089 
I'd like to do all of them before we
start<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.640> cook<00:03:08.760> because<00:03:09.120> they<00:03:09.239> cook<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.480> fast

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
now you don't roll them quite as thin as

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.080 
now you don't roll them quite as thin as
when<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:22.890> make<00:03:23.040> tortillas<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:23.610> you<00:03:23.819> want<00:03:24.000> to

not sure you can test your pan to make
sure<00:03:29.640> it's<00:03:29.819> hot<00:03:30.120> enough<00:03:30.810> by<00:03:31.290> just<00:03:31.470> putting<00:03:31.709> a

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
sure it's hot enough by just putting a

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.180 
sure it's hot enough by just putting a
few<00:03:32.010> drops<00:03:32.220> of<00:03:32.610> water<00:03:32.790> on<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.010> that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
few drops of water on it you get that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.940 
few drops of water on it you get that
sizzle<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.970> know<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.299> hot<00:03:36.480> enough<00:03:36.720> okay<00:03:37.200> so

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
sizzle you know it's hot enough okay so

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.890 
sizzle you know it's hot enough okay so
now<00:03:38.160> watch<00:03:38.640> how<00:03:38.849> quickly<00:03:39.180> they<00:03:39.420> cook<00:03:39.660> here's

now watch how quickly they cook here's
the<00:03:40.019> first<00:03:40.170> one<00:03:40.470> on<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.730> an<00:03:41.910> ungreased<00:03:42.120> pan

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
the first one on it on an ungreased pan

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.850 
the first one on it on an ungreased pan
right<00:03:44.940> there<00:03:45.000> now<00:03:45.959> you're<00:03:46.440> going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> be<00:03:46.799> able

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
right there now you're going to be able

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.800 
right there now you're going to be able
to<00:03:47.040> flip<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.640> check<00:03:47.849> it<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.450> can<00:03:48.630> use<00:03:48.780> a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
to flip it and check it you can use a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.860 
to flip it and check it you can use a
spatula<00:03:49.140> like<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.890> or<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.880> can<00:03:51.090> use<00:03:51.239> tongs

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
spatula like this or you can use tongs

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.750 
spatula like this or you can use tongs
whichever<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.769> have<00:03:52.799> whichever<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.430> easier

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
whichever you have whichever is easier

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.539 
whichever you have whichever is easier
so<00:03:54.599> if<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:54.930> if<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.349> watch<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.010> starts<00:03:56.400> to

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
so if you if you watch as it starts to

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.970 
so if you if you watch as it starts to
cook<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.329> gets<00:03:57.569> little<00:03:57.840> bubbles<00:03:58.530> like<00:03:58.620> that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
cook it gets little bubbles like that

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.640 
cook it gets little bubbles like that
and<00:03:59.569> the<00:04:00.569> bubbles<00:04:00.900> will<00:04:01.079> get<00:04:01.260> bigger<00:04:01.560> and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
and the bubbles will get bigger and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.050 
and the bubbles will get bigger and
bigger<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.190> you'll<00:04:02.310> start<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.549> puff<00:04:02.819> up<00:04:02.970> a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
bigger and you'll start to puff up a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.430 
bigger and you'll start to puff up a
little<00:04:03.090> bit<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.930> then<00:04:04.049> we're<00:04:04.140> going<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.290> flip

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
little bit and then we're going to flip

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.059 
little bit and then we're going to flip
it<00:04:04.650> over<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:05.340> about<00:04:05.459> one<00:04:05.819> minute<00:04:06.090> per<00:04:06.239> side

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
it over it's about one minute per side

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.650 
it over it's about one minute per side
all<00:04:08.069> right<00:04:08.400> see<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.970> bubbles<00:04:09.269> are<00:04:09.390> starting

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
all right see the bubbles are starting

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.270 
all right see the bubbles are starting
to<00:04:09.750> get<00:04:09.870> bigger<00:04:10.109> it's<00:04:10.319> been<00:04:10.530> about<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:11.069> don't

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
to get bigger it's been about I don't

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.670 
to get bigger it's been about I don't

longer<00:05:05.669> you<00:05:05.820> let<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.389> dough<00:05:06.539> rest<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:07.169> more

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
longer you let the dough rest the more

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.140 
longer you let the dough rest the more
you'll<00:05:07.530> get<00:05:07.830> pockets<00:05:08.310> inside<00:05:08.669> like<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:08.910> and
