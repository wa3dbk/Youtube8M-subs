00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780

since<00:04:01.390> Rio<00:04:01.660> is<00:04:03.210> $47.99<00:04:04.210> with<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.720> black<00:04:04.930> under

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
since Rio is $47.99 with the black under

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.820 
since Rio is $47.99 with the black under
I<00:04:05.650> think<00:04:05.830> my<00:04:06.580> little<00:04:06.940> black<00:04:07.680> edges<00:04:08.680> actually

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
I think my little black edges actually

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.290 
I think my little black edges actually
could<00:04:09.460> go<00:04:09.670> with<00:04:09.820> this<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.880> is<00:04:12.940> what<00:04:13.060> she

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
could go with this so this is what she

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.970 
could go with this so this is what she
looks<00:04:13.480> like<00:04:13.540> what<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.780> headband<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.590> this<00:04:14.830> is

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
looks like what a headband and this is

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.960 
looks like what a headband and this is
before<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.730> did<00:04:16.209> any<00:04:16.420> cutting<00:04:17.609> she's<00:04:18.609> not<00:04:18.730> bad

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
before I did any cutting she's not bad

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.290 
before I did any cutting she's not bad
but<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.269> do<00:04:19.390> think<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:20.230> I'm<00:04:20.700> putting<00:04:21.700> scissors

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
but I do think that I'm putting scissors

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.690 
but I do think that I'm putting scissors
to<00:04:22.540> this<00:04:22.690> would<00:04:22.960> make<00:04:23.170> me<00:04:23.380> more<00:04:23.620> happy<00:04:23.680> so<00:04:24.640> I

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
to this would make me more happy so I

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.740 
to this would make me more happy so I
tried<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.120> look<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:26.560> okay<00:04:26.860> but<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:31.120> this

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
tried this look it's okay but so this

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.330 
tried this look it's okay but so this
exactly<00:04:32.110> what<00:04:32.260> I'm<00:04:32.320> gonna<00:04:32.500> do<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:33.070> I'm<00:04:33.220> gonna

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
saw a few youtubers do it that way with

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.860 
saw a few youtubers do it that way with
their<00:04:39.490> curl<00:04:39.730> units<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.300> always<00:04:40.450> thought<00:04:40.690> it

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
their curl units and I always thought it

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.740 
their curl units and I always thought it
was<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.470> wind<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:42.580> let<00:04:43.030> me<00:04:43.150> go<00:04:43.270> do<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:43.600> and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
was a a wind so let me go do that and

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.310 
was a a wind so let me go do that and

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
I'll be back that's all I got a bang I

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.580 
I'll be back that's all I got a bang I
can<00:04:47.320> say<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.530> did<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.950> best<00:04:48.190> channel<00:04:49.290> but<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.320> cut

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
can say I did the best channel but I cut

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.830 
can say I did the best channel but I cut
her<00:04:50.680> back<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.400> this<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.760> Rio<00:04:52.000> with<00:04:52.450> a<00:04:52.480> little

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
her back so this is Rio with a little

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.940 
her back so this is Rio with a little
bang<00:04:53.220> I<00:04:54.220> guess<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.330> cut<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.720> I<00:04:56.050> thought<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.470> cut<00:04:56.800> it

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
bang I guess I cut it I thought I cut it

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.740 
bang I guess I cut it I thought I cut it
at<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.340> proper<00:04:57.520> length<00:04:57.910> but<00:04:58.210> I<00:04:58.240> guess<00:04:58.540> I

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
at the proper length but I guess I

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.570 
at the proper length but I guess I
didn't<00:04:59.140> but<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.740> good<00:04:59.890> thing<00:04:59.919> about<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.430> being

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
didn't but the good thing about it being

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.630 
didn't but the good thing about it being
curly<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:01.300> that<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.660> know<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:02.560> could<00:05:03.160> just<00:05:03.340> keep

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
curly is that you know I could just keep

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.020 
curly is that you know I could just keep
trying<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.150> tug<00:05:04.450> at<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:05.200> give<00:05:05.350> it<00:05:05.380> some<00:05:05.530> link

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
trying to tug at it to give it some link

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:14.800 
trying to tug at it to give it some link
so

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810

00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:45.999 
if I keep playing with it because I

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.339
