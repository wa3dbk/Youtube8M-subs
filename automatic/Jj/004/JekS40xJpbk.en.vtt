00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.260
 Y 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.800
 or the recreation is worth it and we're going to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.800
 make a macaque 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.130
 coin purse 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:40.770
 Materials cardboard felt zip needle e 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.120
 thread scissors wadding or cotton we are going to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390
 mark two circles 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.850
 carlton 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.739
 and in having already cut the cardboard and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.430
 we did with this measure with this circle 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.580
 let's find a bigger circle 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.000
 to do it in felt in the color that 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.590
 we say 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.590
 we cut the circle 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.960
 let's remember we're going to do two 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.710
 cardboard circles and two circles of 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.080
 felt 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.450
 and now with the needle and let's go 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.380
 well 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 all control 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.899
 let's go pick up a little 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.490
 and we are going to add a 4 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.740
 and what do we put 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.740
 in song and we are going to pull 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.210
 and we end up baking the other time for 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.310
 Do not let go 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.310
 we already say that there are other fields 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 let's clarify the site and put it 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.980
 and the reverse 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.209
 and we are going to measure 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.209
 in this part 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.079
 to half a centimeter 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.670
 let's sew 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.670
 both parts 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.150
 yes 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.150
 very good 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.690
 if we go to the manar 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.450
 in this part and this bad 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.489
 we won a little 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.840
 if we place like this 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.840
 not as we're going, we're already starting to sew 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.910
 this part with the universe 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.050
 and the train is worthwhile for this port 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:39.320
 any channel the top part 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.320
 and we're going to hit a second capital 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.120
 the prince 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.120
 they exist when pricking the two caps stuck 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.569
 and here 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.650
 let's win the smaller circles 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.650
 and we 're going to stick here 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.430
 and you have both stuck we have ready 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.190
 we place cotton 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.280
 and so we would be ready but there will be 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.920
