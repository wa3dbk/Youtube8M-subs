00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:22.010
 when I arrived in Rome at the age of 26 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.160
 I fell early enough 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.010
 almost without realizing it 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.210
 in what could be called the 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:38.749
 whirlwind of worldliness but I didn't want to 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:44.780
 to simply be a mountain I wanted 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:49.809
 become the king of the worldly I do not 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.809
 I just wanted to go to parties 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.510
 I wanted to have the power to make them fail 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.300
 and all settled under the 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:29.990
 chatter and noise, silence 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:35.030
 and feeling, emotion and fear 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:39.810
 the haggard inconstant flashes of 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:43.940
 beauty and then the wretched squalor 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.940
 and the miserable man
