see a new tour just gotten up and
running<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.259> finally<00:00:13.769> he's<00:00:14.040> kind<00:00:14.730> enough<00:00:15.000> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
running here finally he's kind enough to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.150 
running here finally he's kind enough to
include<00:00:15.210> my<00:00:15.599> kernel<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.320> software<00:00:16.590> so

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
include my kernel with this software so
