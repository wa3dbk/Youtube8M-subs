00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
shot you so there are two different

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.969 
shot you so there are two different
things<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.990> well<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.380> got<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.590> use<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.829> to

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
things right well you got to use that to

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.619 
things right well you got to use that to
your<00:02:08.069> advantage<00:02:08.129> right<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.270> works<00:02:09.450> in

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
your advantage right because it works in

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.080 
your advantage right because it works in
both<00:02:09.750> ways<00:02:10.020> what<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> do<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.310> how<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.819> beat

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
both ways what you do and how to beat

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.970 
both ways what you do and how to beat
that<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.140> got<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.349> pick<00:02:13.590> away

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
that is is you got to pick away

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860 
that is is you got to pick away
been<00:02:14.129> that<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.519> kill<00:02:14.700> fast<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
been that you can kill fast with and you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.540 
been that you can kill fast with and you
move<00:02:16.050> around<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.409> map<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.680> lot<00:02:16.980> camping<00:02:17.459> just

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
move around the map a lot camping just

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.949 
move around the map a lot camping just
doesn't<00:02:17.940> work<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.120> well<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.629> this<00:02:18.750> game

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
doesn't work that well in this game

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.500 
doesn't work that well in this game
because<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:19.920> you'll<00:02:20.099> find<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.640> by<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
because what you'll find is that by the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.930 
because what you'll find is that by the
time<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.500> see<00:02:22.830> somebody<00:02:23.159> turn<00:02:23.580> around<00:02:23.879> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
time you see somebody turn around the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.490 
time you see somebody turn around the
corner<00:02:24.239> in<00:02:24.360> front<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.690> you<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.140> try<00:02:25.349> and

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
corner in front of you and you try and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
corner in front of you and you try and
shoot<00:02:25.739> them<00:02:25.860> you're<00:02:26.400> already<00:02:26.640> dead<00:02:26.909> and<00:02:27.180> it's

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
shoot them you're already dead and it's

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.030 
shoot them you're already dead and it's
not<00:02:27.569> because<00:02:27.629> you<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.080> bad<00:02:28.260> reflexes<00:02:28.920> it's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
not because you have bad reflexes it's

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.369 
not because you have bad reflexes it's
because<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:30.060> all<00:02:30.269> happened<00:02:30.780> before<00:02:30.959> you

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
because this all happened before you

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.039 
because this all happened before you
could<00:02:31.560> even<00:02:31.590> react<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.209> it

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
could even react to it it just it

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.869 
could even react to it it just it
happened<00:02:34.430> milliseconds<00:02:35.430> ago<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.819> that's

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
happened milliseconds ago and that's

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.570 
happened milliseconds ago and that's
enough<00:02:36.239> for<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.569> be<00:02:36.750> dead<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.650> that's<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
enough for you to be dead so that's the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.699 
enough for you to be dead so that's the
big<00:02:38.760> tip<00:02:39.030> right<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.540> don't<00:02:39.959> try<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.290> camp<00:02:40.470> in

that's not what I'm talking about here

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.229 
that's not what I'm talking about here
what<00:02:53.010> I'm<00:02:53.099> talking<00:02:53.430> about<00:02:53.489> is<00:02:53.640> trying<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.030> camp

what I'm talking about is trying to camp
inside<00:02:54.660> buildings<00:02:55.260> where<00:02:55.739> people<00:02:55.980> are<00:02:56.040> going

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
inside buildings where people are going

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.920 
inside buildings where people are going
to<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.280> whipping<00:02:56.609> around<00:02:56.700> corners<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.510> you're

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
to be whipping around corners and you're

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.330

trying to pick them off before they can

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.920 
trying to pick them off before they can
get<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.579> you<00:02:59.760> it's<00:03:00.329> just<00:03:00.540> not<00:03:00.690> going<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.870> work

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
get to you it's just not going to work

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.809 
get to you it's just not going to work
without<00:03:01.230> left<00:03:01.680> where<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.099> have<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.549> be<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
without left where you have to be the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.819 
without left where you have to be the
one<00:03:03.030> moving<00:03:03.269> when<00:03:04.140> you're<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.470> one<00:03:04.620> moving

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
one moving when you're the one moving

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.710 
one moving when you're the one moving
you're<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.700> one<00:03:05.879> who's<00:03:06.090> using<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.510> lag

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
you're the one who's using that lag

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.170 
you're the one who's using that lag
compensation<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:07.739> advantage<00:03:08.090> makes<00:03:09.090> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
compensation to your advantage makes a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.050 
compensation to your advantage makes a
big<00:03:09.359> difference<00:03:09.750> okay<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:10.319> another<00:03:10.620> tip<00:03:10.890> is

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
big difference okay so another tip is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.180 
big difference okay so another tip is
use<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> gun<00:03:12.569> that<00:03:12.810> kills<00:03:13.230> facts<00:03:13.560> use<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.859> shotgun

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
use a gun that kills facts use a shotgun

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.800 
use a gun that kills facts use a shotgun
when<00:03:14.549> you're<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.849> when<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.209> get<00:03:15.390> into<00:03:15.540> one<00:03:15.720> of

when you're it when you get into one of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.440 
when you're it when you get into one of
these<00:03:15.870> lobbies<00:03:16.379> that<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:16.739> just<00:03:17.190> awful<00:03:17.730> check

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
these lobbies that is just awful check

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.659

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
a lot more success with that so I got

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.730 
a lot more success with that so I got
another<00:04:32.099> tip<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.789> this<00:04:33.270> one<00:04:33.539> is<00:04:33.749> far<00:04:34.289> less

another tip and this one is far less

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.999 
another tip and this one is far less
reliable<00:04:35.219> this<00:04:35.849> is<00:04:35.999> just<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.770> anecdotal<00:04:37.770> tip
