00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.120
 how are you doing, I'm Carlos, family, because 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.100
 we start a new channel or kitchen today 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.530
 day we want to do and honor the 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.300
 quinoa in its international year today 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.760
 let's make a rich preparation with 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.740
 this cereal that contributes 46 percent 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.029
 of the need for folic acid that your 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.919
 organism needs a day so 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.390
 stay with us and see meatballs 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.390
 of quinoa here in Carlos III 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.590
 The first thing we are going to do is choose 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.239
 one of the machines that I have here 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 I have here more of all colors we are going to 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.950
 choose the white quinoa for this recipe 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.730
 of today and what needs to be done now 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.630
 they always know with quinoa is to wash it 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.300
 important to have it saved with a 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.300
 tight well and we wash it well 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.660
 and when the water becomes transparent 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.250
 you have to stop already the variety I'm going to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.020
 let it stretch a bit and while 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.540
 so much let's now do a little 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.820
 sofrito and for that I'm going to put a 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.640
 little piece of butter let's take a 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.450
 teaspoon of butter perfect a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.450
 small stir-fry 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.410
 and we are going to add onion 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.870
 carrot 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.580
 I'm going to use a seasoning and in this 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.440
 opportunity I will put a little bit of 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.440
 tomato and basil dehydrated ground 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.550
 We bring the quinoa and we add it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200
 ah 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.850
 add now boiling water 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.920
 until it completely covers the corner 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.420
 and we go to destruction until the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.420
 volume increase in double 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.659
 and here it is not cooked and now we are going to 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.579
 extend try that not too cooked 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.860
 quite al dente because we are going to continue 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.039
 Knowing the time in the oven we will water 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.530
 a little coriander parsley too 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.090
 integral until it has a texture 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.800
 well gummy so we can do 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.800
 our meatballs of things 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.560
 I'm going to put a little more flour 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.300
 integral here and in another tray 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.550
 a little water on a tray 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.760
 and now we soak ourselves so lightly 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.760
 hands 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.360
 and a little more 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.590
 and now let's move 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.610
 and are ready to take health a 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.349
 important thing is to leave a space 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.940
 between each one because they tend to 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.110
 grow a little 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.110
 or greater to the oven 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.210
 it is already well cooked 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.360
 there 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.130
 they look with the carrot dots that 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.880
 we put him 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.880
 and I put 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.900
 a leaf of basil 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.470
 I have a little cucumber, we're going to 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.470
 put it like this 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.090
 there is then our meatballs a 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.099
 super full dish considering that 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.870
 we have these quinoa meatballs more 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.420
 a good salad can be a peck 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.219
 a protein background plate of quinoa 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.349
 and what to say about all the energy that we 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:45.189
 give fruits and vegetables if you saw it here 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.189
 in Carlos III
