00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:10.860
 all the good time of the day is me again 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:16.020
 here is my mini review on my scooter 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:22.450
 yarrow stealth had 100 vat 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 as I promised the next video floor already 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.300
 pipe installation overview 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.300
 technician time here she actually 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 installed 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.100
 wonderful evil 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.160
 Goes well, I would say 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.739
 that's how it works and now I'm a little 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.989
 tired 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.300
 talk about the installation and because there is 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.649
 some nuances 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:58.239
 adult engine is being installed 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:02.000
 something like this I set it somewhere for 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.140
 hours and a half leisurely install 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.090
 I'm not rushing 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.560
 because the original pipe is not there well 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.070
 as if not original in the sense 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.899
 techniques to get her up clearly 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.649
 regular places because the scam in regular 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:22.850
 places are these fasteners for the former 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:24.679
 Sachs here it is attached but now I have 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.159
 here is one bolt one bolt 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.380
 enough for the eyes is not enough 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.970
 attach the puck here on that side 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.659
 more ox 2 and everything is fine here but 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.740
 I'll tell you about the nuances that is, how 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.950
 put her 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 if you buy the techniques track for 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.530
 of his 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:53.270
 and growth with rear disc brakes so 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.070
 Here you are removing the old pipe unscrew 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.070
 here here are the bolts and 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.049
 Yes, and this cable from the heap of bodies soon 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.359
 screwed 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:13.250
 there are several pizdets and drill holes 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:15.200
 and attach it twist the wing there 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.459
 so that it does not interfere but you can and in general 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.220
 not really unscrew yes here 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.760
 then start to fit here 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.989
 pipe 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.850
 right now this silencer doesn't cling to 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:35.930
 which will absolutely only interfere 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:41.750
 shorter, first attached gently to drink 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:44.090
 and the cylinder will disturb you naturally 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.260
 something should interfere with the correct and 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.840
 this projection will disturb you 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.950
 see I have here 3-4 millimeters but 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.690
 I'll tell you how to do it. 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.910
 so he will rest against the new quietly 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:04.180
 quietly screwed on the world there 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:07.629
 then take out the cylinder this one 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.510
 bracket drank log in here here 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.550
 tight here exactly the same head here 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.989
 at this place the same head you 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.780
 cut it flush 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.000
 so that the surface was smooth then you 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.760
 calm and set and here here 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.660
 slightly turning down the muffler 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.410
 put here on a standard bolt and all 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.160
 and no problem and he clearly sits down everything 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.310
 rest 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.319
 and here you have a gap 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.500
 3-4 millimeters but it depends on 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.120
 how much will you leave here this 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.060
 roughly flowing i did flush 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.930
 so that less bender ti 3 4 millimeters 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.599
 enough then put a silencer I 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.489
 did not have glass here there 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.590
 prokladochka I am afraid that it could be 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.160
 network but from under it exhaust 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.519
 got out 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.030
 I put on thermo sealant and spun 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.819
 and forgot here then the hoopoe is set 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.829
 bracket standard seat in the muffler 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.090
 and all 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:13.600
 and enjoy gas technics is simple and 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.400
 well and the very first thing is not 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.209
 forget to cut the jammer which 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:24.190
 showed in the previous review which 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:28.060
 suppresses interest probably 40 power not 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.010
 gives you the right options to develop 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.380
 muffler 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:39.810
 so my advice is you cut it 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.810
 so you can start next 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.810
 that's actually the engine work 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.080
 The following review will be devoted to the variator 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.580
 malossi 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.690
 Multicooker to be installed 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:09.820
 again soon i am sorry for 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.860
 verbal bloopers since the review is very 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:21.040
 quick spontaneous but in a hurry to lay out 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:24.090
 and share your muffler installation 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.090
 bye everyone
