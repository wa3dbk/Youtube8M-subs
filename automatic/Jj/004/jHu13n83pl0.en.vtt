 hello everyone i'm michael i'm going to be 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.190
 commenting on another tutorial and this time a 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.950
 tutorial on how to install a text for 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.110
 that in minecraft 1.2 point 5 but it serves 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.070
 for all versions to see what 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.470
 first thing we have to do is 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.119
 download this file called mc patch 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.160
 I'll leave the link to the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.110
 description I already have it downloaded and 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.540
 then you download is the text so that 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.090
 you want and have installed the good 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.739
 you have loaded me the smoke of the krafft vale and 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.800
 well I leave this page has led to 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.230
 minecraft daily where you have then 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.240
 you see many 500 texts bartz maps 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.850
 you have all this and here you can choose 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.560
 the text for you to want is valid and I 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.180
 downloads then what you have to 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.420
 to do is first of all open in the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.690
 raccoon or instead of pachelo as 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:57.790
 call it runs jce then that will open 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:01:00.160
 One thing is worth and you give good 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.730
 is going to analyze our minecraft folder 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.770
 points and when it's worth it if you do not 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.940
 you have everything selected these you put 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.810
 select all this 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.650
 you mark it then again to the fas 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.570
 so what do we have to do to 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.070
 install the text impact what we have 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.520
 what to do is first of all download it 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.710
 and we obviously open it and it will come out 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.240
 all this but you think there's a lot here 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.780
 thing and you do not know where to put it then 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.840
 close you are not going to start percent 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.960
 app data 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.000
 percent you're going to respect a take on 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.300
 cross inside you go to the folder called 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.370
 text pack and drag is the file 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.140
 winrar or say that you have downloaded and 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.290
 then you leave it here then 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.530
 you will do this and put again 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.530
 bach 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.329
 It will take a while 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.450
 and when it is already you will have in principle 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.700
 the nickname installed and the text for 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.540
 installed serres this we open the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.860
 Minecraft 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.070
 and as you will see when entering 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.590
 you will already have the text folder so that 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.660
 they have are also text packs 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.660
 then here you already have it, you see way in 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.330
 that was modern craft you give him then 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.760
 download the text pack and you will go 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.600
 probably what will happen if you do not download 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.180
 the ph ph that you do not go to them will leave 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.200
 some blocks or they will come out we are going to 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.420
 see how it is in follows the text pack to 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.360
 that you see because if you do not download the mc 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.940
 to be as it leaves you do not leave blocks 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.610
 with pieces of fire or very strange things 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.989
 how good is what happens at the beginning 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.810
 when you do not download a text well 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.340
 If he wants, let's see what he does 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.620
 a text to simply change the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.790
 visualization that minecraft studies 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.780
 as you see, pain has changed, everything is 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.920
 very different 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.650
 this is him 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.069
 the kraft modem and well that's how it 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.480
 download bar install a couple text and 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.700
 Well I hope you liked it as 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.170
