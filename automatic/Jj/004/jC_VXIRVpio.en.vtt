00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.849
 message with a sad message 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.679
 because I start with which direction you 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.910
 we ask we start catching 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.400
 the sad message 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.730
 tonight in the best the best five 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.949
 the play down play the tvt content 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 the game is canceled today 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.279
 falls out for everyone involved so you 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.330
 I know I hope you get it 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.429
 in time with me I just got it 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.199
 I am very stupid 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.210
 already very much looking forward to tell me 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.500
 and yes that annoys me now to the very 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 play ahead the re-enacted I know 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.010
 also not noticed 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.180
 I saw my hair cut 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.059
 somehow makes me different 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.870
 maybe a bit shorter and 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.079
 unshaven by that was there I have 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.680
 showing blood in the camera 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 But I know that it always burns like that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.500
 nice at some point but it even makes 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.730
 fun was fallen down that was 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.090
 was only a microphone makes you no 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.990
 to care 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.939
 of which I have several no yes so the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.590
 good news you know it yourself 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 I do not know whether that is so good yes 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.130
 she is beautiful she already good but she 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.860
 does not change the problem 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.960
 you always get it with premium leaks 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.970
 again often every day at the moment 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.380
 So last time is as massive as it is long 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.439
 not and is the whole one 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 Maintenance work and that 's me 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.689
 not baked properly 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.640
 yes and there the esl said okay we 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.659
 Compensate you get five days 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.860
 bonus credited 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.840
 Of course we hope that the problem 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.220
 really solved in a timely manner 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.450
 and finally we are all happy again 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.299
 if I can not promise 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 neither the boys of us are all 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.509
 not happy to say this time so therefore there 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 No one enjoys and I kick 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.759
 every time after the show then with 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.530
 the people at work and the rage 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.780
 Anyway, land and it goes to me 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.490
 it's just like you and we eat 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.540
 they are already dead and hope that everything 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.310
 works that they attacked it in 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.140
 So I 'll get his point 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.969
 you can be sure it will be on everyone 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.860
 so much stress where reported where 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.810
 goes so that they are clearly 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.550
 realize that this is not cool and that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.170
 that never makes fun there goes people 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.869
 meanwhile also with a good mood 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.959
 then 2 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.849
 Well that was I think I have that for 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:23.230
 you I was I was in such a way today 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.700
 secondhand shop caritas caritas recognize 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.190
 These sales stops you have that 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.019
 So we think of things and we have them 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.940
 after katt me looking for coffee 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.260
 the majority of the number of couch becomes 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.430
 because probably always couch already 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.769
 I do not know what 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.000
 otherwise a word is possible and have me 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.470
 so looked at three different there 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.319
 It would not have so much choice 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.549
 can be a little bit more but one has 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.379
 I liked it very much but I found 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.790
 for that this is pretty expensive 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.010
 but for that she was very early 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.390
 In any case, my narrow choice I 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.349
 But honestly I have little there 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.849
 decision violent 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.049
 I'll let my girlfriend with you 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.069
 Maybe I would have decided you 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.690
 perhaps maybe new items 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.769
 run and show you like this 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.909
 looks and then you can with 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.920
 decide here a little bit of fear 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.109
 if I have then made the courage that 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.909
 which is not there after that but good 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.140
 I'm just a bit lucky with something like that 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.519
 Today, however, at least confirm 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.659
 my first internet leads for the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.299
 new apartment get this now 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.220
 I am also doing one hundred percent now 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.720
 writing at my home the second 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.120
 still in the doing that annoys me 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.069
 They say a little more than two weeks 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.930
 until it because I summoned one hundred percent 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.299
 So you do not quite hear the ticking there 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.760
 right with the telekom 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.959
 Well, that's what I'm really 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.730
 I hope we see each other soon 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.260
 again tomorrow with the session 14 o'clock 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.629

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.340
 come up with a nice replay cast 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.530
 and so on and so forth I will 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.930

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.980

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.040

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.720
