00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.949

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.579
 chicken legs we will need 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.250
 oil of course we will need to 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.710
 500 g of flour will need a 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.290
 liter of fermented milk so that's it 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.910
 buttermilk 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.829
 we are going to need a mix of spicy 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.000
 quite substantial since there are eleven 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.370
 in all so I elected you mayors he 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.730
 So it's a teaspoon while 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.300
 the time until then and sophie if we will have 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.640
 two teaspoons of salt and the 2 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.300
 tablespoons of sodium glutamate 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.769
 which is a seasoning spice we 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.650
 found in Chinese stores 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:09.310
 so I show you the coat is mono 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.170
 sodium glutamate super-six zoning on 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.120
 find it a little bit everywhere in the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.640
 grocery stores ethical values 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.860
 so for the spices we are going to have 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.990
 need to add them to the flour 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.170
 we will need a teaspoon 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.670
 marjoram we are going to need a 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.500
 teaspoon of basil 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.620
 we will need a teaspoon 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.050
 of sage a teaspoon from elsewhere 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.110
 powder will also need a 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.230
 teaspoon of chili spoon at 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.630
 coffee of black pepper and pepper 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.170
 white also a teaspoon of 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.850
 paprika a teaspoon of oregano a 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.200
 teaspoon of onions in small 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.000
 pieces including class and pink onion 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.190
 then as I wanted 10 2 spoons to 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.140
 coffee of salt and 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.990
 mono sodium thanet 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.610
 so here we go we'll start everything 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.020
 simply by cooking our chicken 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.940
 is about twenty minutes 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.710
 and then we will put it with a little 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.300
 of salt a little bit of pepper in the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.910
 ribot milk in a salad bowl we're going to 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.220
 let a few hours well soak up 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.860
 milk and then we will not have 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.530
 only to mix our spices in the flour 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.220
 and then pass our chicken in the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.200
 flour 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.730
 and then in the oil and you will see the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.320
 result is bluffing I put the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 cooking chicken so now what I 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.060
 want to do is that I will spend my 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.510
 spices in the blender so as to 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.080
 to have 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.550
 and well really powder 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.280
 so I put it all in the bowl of 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:45.630
 mixer or it does not have character 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.830
 of obligation but after doing 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.430
 several tests I think it's 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.130
 better so that's how I 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.050
 practiced so we'll have a 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.980
 fairly uniform seasoning 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:03.030
 a quick shot of the above eat well the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.110
 mix of tracks that went to 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.110
 mixer with flour 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.410
 I add the two teaspoons of 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.959
 salt as well as two tablespoons 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:22.500
 Seasoning Sodium Glutamate 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.610
 wanted and cooked I cook them 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.600
 in a little bit of salt water during 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.959
 twenty minutes 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.489
 so I 'm going to add him now a 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.700
 little bit of simple a little bit of 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.700
 pepper 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:52.710
 here I see if it's time to 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.840
 add the fermented milk and we will 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.600
 marinate the chicken in this milk 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.780
 fermented a few hours wow I think 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.010
 that two hours it should be enough if 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.350
 you have more time ben you the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.970
 leave it longer will only be 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.860
 better here I'm going to store it at 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.010
 refrigerator before those few hours 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.840
 that our pieces of marine chicken in 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.760
 salt pepper and fermented milk 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.940
 So bah now we will pass 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.870
 in the flour 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.550
 embellished with all the spices and then 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.080
 we will fry them quietly 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.590
 so I'm going to take my clip and we're going 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.490
 to start 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:43.890
 we will start with a thigh him so 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.620
 we're just going to roll it in 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.040
 flour 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.040
 here 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.389
 perfect i'm going to shake her up a bit for 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:01.469
 pietro flour in water in oil 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:04.699
 by you and I'm going to add 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:08.300
 years while that of other markets 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.300
 according to the same process 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.580
 and we will try to let them cook 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.220
 at least fry more exactly because 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.490
 the chicken already cooked to have a nice 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.490
 color 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.710
