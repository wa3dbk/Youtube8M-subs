00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
your piece of fabric folded in half that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.699 
your piece of fabric folded in half that
it<00:02:38.160> stretches<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.629> because<00:02:39.930> sometimes<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
it stretches like so because sometimes I

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.309 
it stretches like so because sometimes I
make<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> mistake<00:02:41.129> where<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.810> fabric

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
make the mistake where the the fabric

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.770 
make the mistake where the the fabric
actually<00:02:43.950> stretches<00:02:44.489> along<00:02:44.640> like<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
actually stretches along like that and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.770 
actually stretches along like that and
we<00:02:46.230> actually<00:02:46.739> try<00:02:47.129> on<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.489> dress<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:48.030> will<00:02:48.540> not

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
we actually try on the dress it will not

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.630 
we actually try on the dress it will not
fit<00:02:49.079> because<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.470> has<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.769> stretch<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:52.640> so

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
fit because it has to stretch like so so

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.849 
fit because it has to stretch like so so
now<00:02:53.819> I'm<00:02:53.970> going<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.120> actually<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.859> measuring

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
now I'm going to actually be measuring

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.640 
now I'm going to actually be measuring
the<00:02:56.670> dress<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.359> see<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.690> these<00:02:57.900> measurements

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the dress to see if these measurements

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.059 
the dress to see if these measurements
that<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.829> have<00:02:59.069> here<00:02:59.870> do<00:03:00.870> correlate<00:03:01.560> with<00:03:01.799> this

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
that I have here do correlate with this

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.870 
that I have here do correlate with this
dress<00:03:02.459> because<00:03:02.849> sometimes<00:03:03.269> your<00:03:03.810> dresses<00:03:04.880> if

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
dress because sometimes your dresses if

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.089 
dress because sometimes your dresses if
you<00:03:06.120> have<00:03:06.510> one<00:03:06.750> that's<00:03:06.870> already<00:03:07.109> store-bought

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
you have one that's already store-bought

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.270 
you have one that's already store-bought
it<00:03:08.430> may<00:03:08.609> not<00:03:08.790> fit<00:03:09.090> according<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:11.130> your

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
it may not fit according to like to your

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.699 
it may not fit according to like to your
current<00:03:11.790> body<00:03:12.030> or<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.049> don't<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.349> how

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
current body or you just don't like how

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.460 
current body or you just don't like how
it<00:03:13.859> fits<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.430> better<00:03:14.700> if<00:03:14.849> you<00:03:14.970> just<00:03:15.470> use

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
it fits so it's better if you just use

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.409 
it fits so it's better if you just use
the<00:03:16.680> measurements<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.280> we<00:03:17.400> previously<00:03:17.849> did

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
the measurements that we previously did

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.140 
the measurements that we previously did
so<00:03:19.260> I'm<00:03:19.349> going<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.650> measuring<00:03:20.099> my<00:03:20.310> chest<00:03:20.730> to

so I'm going to be measuring my chest to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.589 
so I'm going to be measuring my chest to
see<00:03:21.359> if<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.400> show<00:03:23.669> you<00:03:23.730> guys<00:03:24.000> how<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.269> do

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
it so it's gonna be 34 inches right so I

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.830 
it so it's gonna be 34 inches right so I
grab<00:03:28.349> my<00:03:28.380> measuring<00:03:29.190> tape<00:03:29.359> place<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.630> half

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
grab my measuring tape place it in half

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.990 
grab my measuring tape place it in half
and<00:03:32.630> it's<00:03:33.630> gonna<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:34.019> since<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.220> fabric<00:03:35.730> does

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
and it's gonna be since this fabric does

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.110 
and it's gonna be since this fabric does
stretch<00:03:36.359> a<00:03:36.389> lot<00:03:36.799> one<00:03:37.799> inch<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.310> each<00:03:38.579> side<00:03:38.609> is

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
stretch a lot one inch on each side is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.960 
stretch a lot one inch on each side is
fine<00:03:39.620> so<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.739> stretches<00:03:40.980> on<00:03:41.310> my<00:03:41.489> body<00:03:41.669> so

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
that's gonna be fine as long as it's not

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.080 
that's gonna be fine as long as it's not
too<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:45.030> dress<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:45.389> too<00:03:45.419> small

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
too the dress is too small

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.640 
too the dress is too small
that's<00:03:46.269> fine<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.810> then<00:03:47.530> my<00:03:47.560> waist<00:03:49.200> 18<00:03:50.200> inches

down so somewhere right here my waist is
26<00:03:59.260> inches<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.980> that's<00:04:03.099> going<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.280> be<00:04:03.400> perfect

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
26 inches so that's going to be perfect

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.729 
26 inches so that's going to be perfect
it's<00:04:04.150> not<00:04:04.180> going<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.510> be<00:04:04.599> too<00:04:04.870> tight<00:04:05.110> along<00:04:05.500> my

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
it's not going to be too tight along my

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:13.100 
it's not going to be too tight along my
waist<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:09.959> then<00:04:10.959> I'm<00:04:11.110> going<00:04:11.260> to<00:04:11.319> see<00:04:11.920> my<00:04:12.280> butt

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.020 
waist and then I'm going to see my butt
see<00:04:14.110> if<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:15.930> butt<00:04:16.930> is<00:04:17.079> actually<00:04:17.500> fine<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.790> it's

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
see if the butt is actually fine so it's

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
see if the butt is actually fine so it's
going<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.269> be<00:04:19.389> around<00:04:19.630> here<00:04:21.060> my<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.570> but<00:04:22.780> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
going to be around here my the but the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.930 
going to be around here my the but the
circumference<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.800> my<00:04:24.010> butt<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.460> 37<00:04:25.330> inches<00:04:26.940> so

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
circumference of my butt is 37 inches so

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.860 
circumference of my butt is 37 inches so
I<00:04:27.970> just<00:04:28.180> put<00:04:28.419> my<00:04:30.090> measuring<00:04:31.090> tape<00:04:31.180> along<00:04:31.630> there

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
I just put my measuring tape along there

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.350 
I just put my measuring tape along there

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
and to be perfectly fine one inch on

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.219 
and to be perfectly fine one inch on
each<00:04:34.510> side<00:04:34.540> so<00:04:35.169> it's<00:04:35.380> tighter<00:04:35.950> on<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.370> body<00:04:37.229> so

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
each side so it's tighter on the body so

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.690 
each side so it's tighter on the body so
now<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.470> you<00:04:38.680> have<00:04:38.919> checked<00:04:39.490> your
