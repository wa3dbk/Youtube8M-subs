00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.740
 we leave sports and tell them that 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.660
 a malagueÃ±o has invented a method that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.700
 can revolutionize the teaching of 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.800
 dance is a system for 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 record on paper in a kind of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.970
 pentagram the flamenco dance and 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.039
 especially the heels the system will be 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.420
 launched the next course by the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.830
 Conservatory of Alicante in which 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.830
 She teaches its inventor 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.650
 Spanish dance and flamenco are 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.539
 congratulations from now on they count 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.370
 with a musical writing system that 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.680
 for the first time it allows to reflect 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.120
 faithfully the different types of 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.850
 percussions that the feet of the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.670
 bailaores and bailaoras produce as well as 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.860
 its rhythm and intensity for it a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.420
 dance teacher from Malaga has invented 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.090
 a method that is based on two programs 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.370
 one for each foot in which they are collected 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.830
 each one of the sounds of the dance already 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.070
 are made by the tip the heel or 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.629
 the sole of the foot and what I have 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.320
 invented has been a notation system 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.619
 that allows a rigorous registration of 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 Steps 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.570
 with this system you can register the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.590
 dances that could hardly be done before 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.789
 you had to submit a separate video the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.680
 story begins with the documents 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.600
 written 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.520
 the new music writing system 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.140
 will be presented for the first time with 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.050
 reason for the cante festival of the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.180
 mines next day 8 in the union in 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.490
 murcia to which they will come from japan and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.170
 Canada interested in this method of 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.510
 musical writing that among others 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.430
 advantages includes the possibility that 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.440
 Flamenco dancing and Spanish can 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.800
 join the opera and the 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.800
 concerts 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.570
 the sounds of flamenco go beyond 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.580
 the guitar and the voice the heels is a 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.180
 instrument that can be expressed in 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.180
 music sheet 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.920
 the Spanish air and flamenco are 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.750
 Congratulations 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.850
 from now on they have a system 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.850
 of musical writing that for the first time 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.770
 allows to faithfully reflect the different 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.580
 types of percussions that the feet of 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.440
 bailaores and bailaoras produces 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.440
 as well as its rhythm and intensity 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.620
 a dance teacher from Malaga has 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.989
 invented a method that is based on two 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.970
 programs one for each foot in which 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.610
 each of the sounds of the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.970
 dance whether performed by the tip the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.850
 heel or sole 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.580
 what I was inventing if a system of 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.110
 notation that allows a record 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.000
 rigorous steps 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.920
 the new system of musical notation 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.540
 will be presented for the first time with 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.450
 reason for the cante festival of the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.610

 musical writing among other advantages 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.670
 includes the possibility that the dance 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.200
 flamenco and Spanish can be incorporated into 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.200
 the opera and the concerts 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.930
 the sound of flamenco put an end to 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.290
 newscast nothing more thanks and very good 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.290

 for this a dance teacher from Malaga 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.190

 what I was inventing if a system of 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.630
 notation that allows a record 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.310
 rigorous steps 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.230
