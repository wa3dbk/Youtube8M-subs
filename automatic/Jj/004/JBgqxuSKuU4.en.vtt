00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
bonus xp weekend we still had boats but

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.670 
bonus xp weekend we still had boats but
people<00:01:36.479> didn't<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:36.689> notice<00:01:37.020> them<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:37.530> much

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
people didn't really notice them as much

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.499 
people didn't really notice them as much
and<00:01:37.979> people<00:01:38.100> know<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.939> one<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.450> that

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and people know the one thing that

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.200 
and people know the one thing that
really<00:01:39.960> causes<00:01:40.530> price<00:01:41.189> fluctuations<00:01:42.000> is

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
really causes price fluctuations is

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.319 
really causes price fluctuations is
panic<00:01:43.020> players<00:01:43.860> panicking<00:01:44.460> causes<00:01:44.850> massive

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
panic players panicking causes massive

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.359 
panic players panicking causes massive
fluctuations<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> prices<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.280> going

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
fluctuations so if the prices are going

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.620 
fluctuations so if the prices are going
to<00:01:47.549> change<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.180> may<00:01:48.329> change<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
to change I think they may change a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.580 
to change I think they may change a
little<00:01:48.659> bit<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> don't<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.439> they're

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
little bit but I don't think they're

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.929 
little bit but I don't think they're
going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.829> change<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.130> much<00:01:50.430> as<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.700> think

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
going to change that much as I think

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.819 
going to change that much as I think

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.950 
this bonus xp weekend really had a lot
of<00:01:53.040> anticipation<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:54.479> people<00:01:54.659> already

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
of anticipation so people already

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.780 
of anticipation so people already
stocked<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:55.710> they<00:01:55.860> wanted<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.490> I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
stocked up on what they wanted but I

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.789 
stocked up on what they wanted but I
think<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.119> turn<00:01:57.360> some<00:01:57.750> people<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.170> hoarded

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.249 
think in turn some people have hoarded
things<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.250> plan<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.670> sell<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> don't<00:02:01.020> think

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
things to plan to sell so I don't think

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.539 
things to plan to sell so I don't think
I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.649> going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.890> even<00:02:02.189> now<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> don't

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
think there's going to be that many

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.810 
think there's going to be that many
price<00:02:03.960> fluctuations<00:02:04.619> however<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.310> could<00:02:05.430> be

wrong we'll see and obviously the boss
situation<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.310> probably<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.030> worst<00:02:09.060> it's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
was jagged should have really integrated

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.340 
was jagged should have really integrated
something<00:05:45.210> we<00:05:45.300> could<00:05:45.510> do<00:05:45.630> for<00:05:45.660> something<00:05:46.050> so

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
something we could do for something so

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.990 
something we could do for something so
perhaps<00:05:46.560> you<00:05:46.770> would<00:05:46.890> get<00:05:46.979> some<00:05:47.190> burners<00:05:47.460> charm

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
perhaps you would get some burners charm

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.240 
perhaps you would get some burners charm
drops<00:05:48.330> while<00:05:48.570> we're<00:05:48.840> doing<00:05:49.500> Slayer<00:05:49.950> while

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250

we're killing monsters it would be nice
to<00:05:52.169> see<00:05:52.320> perhaps<00:05:52.560> double<00:05:53.070> charm<00:05:53.370> drops<00:05:53.640> for

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
to see perhaps double charm drops for

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.490 
to see perhaps double charm drops for
the<00:05:53.880> first<00:05:54.120> two<00:05:54.330> hours<00:05:54.600> I<00:05:54.750> thought<00:05:55.229> that<00:05:55.410> will

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
the first two hours I thought that will

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.779 
the first two hours I thought that will
be<00:05:55.620> pretty<00:05:55.800> cool<00:05:56.100> but<00:05:56.280> jiggetts<00:05:56.550> didn't

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
be pretty cool but jiggetts didn't

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.460 
be pretty cool but jiggetts didn't
really<00:05:56.970> consider<00:05:57.180> that<00:05:57.570> I<00:05:57.780> think<00:05:58.320> because

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
really consider that I think because

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.140 
really consider that I think because
they<00:05:58.800> really<00:05:59.190> crippled<00:05:59.640> something<00:06:00.030> they

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
they really crippled something they

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.670 
they really crippled something they
should<00:06:00.330> have<00:06:00.419> at<00:06:00.510> least<00:06:00.539> introduce<00:06:01.289> something

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
should have at least introduce something

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.469 
should have at least introduce something
else<00:06:01.979> perhaps<00:06:02.250> like<00:06:02.640> burnished<00:06:03.000> charm<00:06:03.240> drops

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
else perhaps like burnished charm drops

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.510 
else perhaps like burnished charm drops
like<00:06:03.660> I<00:06:03.810> said<00:06:04.080> so<00:06:04.500> yes<00:06:04.710> for<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.039> first<00:06:05.070> ten
