now<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.290> have<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.740> main<00:00:04.920> leg<00:00:05.190> bone<00:00:05.490> exposed<00:00:07.069> we

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
now we have the main leg bone exposed we

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:26.230 
now we have the main leg bone exposed we
can<00:00:08.280> work<00:00:08.460> round<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:09.080> and<00:00:10.080> remove<00:00:10.740> it

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.560

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
any of the underlying muscles at this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.229 
any of the underlying muscles at this
point<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.750> could<00:00:45.930> remove<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:48.899> bone<00:00:50.239> through

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
point we could remove the bone through

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:01.660 
point we could remove the bone through
the<00:00:51.390> natural<00:00:53.270> legions

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.219 

by<00:01:02.670> doing<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.269> we've<00:01:03.780> left<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.500> knee<00:01:04.710> cap<00:01:05.180> on

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229

the leg bone we have one big bone left
on<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:16.290> shank<00:01:17.869> we<00:01:18.869> remove<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.640> again

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
on the shank we remove that again

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.840

pocket of fat remove back edge of the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.910 
pocket of fat remove back edge of the
rind<00:04:35.290> then<00:04:37.000> we're<00:04:38.000> going<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.300> roll<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.590> pork

onto that rind and at this point we may

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:52.150 
onto that rind and at this point we may
need<00:04:44.480> to<00:04:44.540> skewer<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.930> rind<00:04:50.470> around<00:04:51.470> tighter

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
need to skewer the rind around tighter

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:04.830 
need to skewer the rind around tighter
tightly

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.339 

now<00:05:05.840> we<00:05:05.900> can<00:05:06.289> tie<00:05:06.560> up<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.490> boneless<00:05:07.729> leg<00:05:08.349> at

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
now we can tie up the boneless leg at

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:46.400 
now we can tie up the boneless leg at
even<00:05:09.889> intervals

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:56.490

square up the end the joint trimmings go

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.560 
square up the end the joint trimmings go
in<00:05:56.650> for<00:05:56.890> further<00:05:57.180> processing<00:06:00.090> now<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:01.150> joint

in for further processing now the joint

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:11.870 
in for further processing now the joint
can<00:06:02.050> be<00:06:02.170> cut<00:06:02.410> into<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:03.910> required<00:06:04.330> sizes
