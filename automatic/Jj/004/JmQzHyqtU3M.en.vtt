00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 spox if not simon finds your muscle 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.950
 Wake up if I in my inquiry folder 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.720
 look at facebook 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.220
 then I see a lot of inquiries 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.469
 turn around the three blatants 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.230
 training booster around the vbz around the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.870
 dedicated unstoppable and according to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.910
 gm laboratories these three are brewster 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 in any case, glaringly of their effect 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 and two of them, all the time 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 Erdogans about it and the vp iges so far 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.490
 were a few months ago in the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.349
 headlines it went through forums of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 against through youtube that these two 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.289
 booster and even the frendzy being 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.850
 that in my view a pretty 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.059
 bad booster is me too never 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.739
 Yes, selling has been illegal 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.129
 are no longer allowed to be traded 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.809
 because of the fact that d mba in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.399
 this booster was found 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 it is not legal or 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.820
 not legal and forbidden and not 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.980
 forbidden but it concerns the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.780
 question the roadability and exactly 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.940
 that's why it goes without saying that of course 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.860
 whatever it is that laws now 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.140
 actually grab and there is to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
 so you have the eu laws eu-wide 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.949
 at European level then there is the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.170
 Federal laws, so to speak for Germany 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.360
 from Germany and the national laws 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.130
 for example in the country berlin and the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.420
 Implementation of these laws are then incumbent 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.430
 in berlin, for example, again the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.170
 districts so the individual districts are 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.369
 for the implementation of the laws 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 responsible and failing 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.240
 Of course, many of them lie 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.189
 Mills of politics you can very much 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 well imagine the politics in 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.340
 bureaucratic files then really times 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.689
 has established here we have one 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.280
 problem with the booster and we want 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.290
 not that he is sold off 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 Of course a lot of time and in the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.409
 The Netherlands already gave this 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.909
 endeavor the dedicated unstoppable 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.470
 to banish, so to speak 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.180
 And that's exactly what the manufacturer has in common 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.950
 Of course, it has quickly caught on 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.810
 said if in the important market in 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.250
 the eu is so stimulated and 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.409
 has to hike quickly or something like that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.079
 then we'll react quickly 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.479
 we already have the ma on the years ago 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.979
 letters then came d mba and who have 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.270
 already something new in development 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.640
 and research, of course, found out 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.299
 that in production goes to change 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.159
 real quick 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.750
 and until then the politics sometime in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.560
 your bureaucratic trainer files 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.240
 the manufacturers are behind 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.369
 always a nose faster 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.899
 ahead and that's exactly what my view is 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.649
 So my opinion is a cat and 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.880
 mouse game 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.160
 and that is exactly the reason 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.509
 why these booster in our muscle 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.030
 after that shop are still available 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.470
 as long as they are not prohibited 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.510
 We of course sell you the customers 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.739
 they buy are very satisfied so 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.269
 there are no in my view 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.830
 cause not to sell 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.180
 very important of course I have it in 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.590
 the article description personally 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.220
 I'll write it down now 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.900
 once again 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.640
 you do not need a booster to 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.080
 You can also train like that 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 and, of course, very important 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.319
 should have respectfully wust before it to 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.390
 These very strong effects are very strong 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.250
 potent you should not overdose 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.830
 Everything on coffee or of course 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.780
 to meet other things you should 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.580
 So no muscles overdose so what 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.590
 So from that point of view, it just has to be clear 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.239
 that these booster are potent that they 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.069
 also the effect you have them 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.569
 So it decides from therefore decides 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.890
 of course, everyone myself personally 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.390
 find it just cool every now and then 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.410
 to train and let such a day of penance 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.849
 not me any thick either 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.709
 politicians dictate what I do 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.209
 or if that's easy 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.340
 normal things are the same 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.930
 also buy and sell it all clearly 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.220
 I think that's why 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.079
 with us this booster for example in 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.790
 muscle maker shop still available 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.829
 Everyone decides but a thing 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.630
 I do not like motivation 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.070
 Give for training and exercising 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.049
 would still even in this sense 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.540
 we are in the next video I do 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.540
 me now on many kommissare room
