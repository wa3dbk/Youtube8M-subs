00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.500
 and it 's true because of course if we're 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.059
 talking about those killing is that they are 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.620
 rich who endure 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.719
 well then we can freeze and this one 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.940
 raise your hand if you do not have something 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.620
 frozen in the fridge at home are 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.020
 products that are usually easy to 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.340
 if we buy them already made and 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.360
 especially when we do not have time then 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.330
 'not the most we are going to do today is 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.260
 discover how that process is done and 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.720
 they know who has done it 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.470
 I mean we got the test tube at 20 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.470
 degrees below zero 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.150
 for the rhythm of life that we carry each 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.430
 it is more frequent that we consume 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.010
 frozen products why today 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.980
 we want to show you how everything is 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.920
 process from being stored until 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.019
 reaches the consumer 'josÃ© luis' which 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.750
 it's the first step we've seen how it comes 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.699
 the pallet from an area that is 0 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.199
 degrees and quickly passes a camera that 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.629
 we are now at least 20 degrees 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.860
 where all the glasses are going to be prepared 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.610
 that they will have to enter the zone of 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.140
 storage as you have it organized 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.059
 here what it is about we have diverse 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.560
 cameras that are going to arrive from those 0 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.539
 beginning grades at least 40 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.369
 we could reach even 50 degrees 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.240
 centigrade where the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.250
 foods 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.080
 people will notice that 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.119
 we go totally uniformed and it is that 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.399
 I was already saying Jose Luis now 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.530
 We are at least 20 degrees 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.380
 that's why it's so important to be well 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.210
 Sheltered clear and people can not 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.560
 work for a long time with this 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.880
 temperature have to be protected from 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.570
 cold and then take breaks and little 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.420
 weather 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.090
 is the process of freezing the process 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.760
 of freezing what it consists of is 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.620
 catch the water that the food has and 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.970
 that water will be transformed into ice and 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.200
 that ice that is inside the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.760
 food is what you must do it 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.250
 keep for very long periods of time 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.830
 time periods from three months to 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.660
 a year even longer before years not 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.570
 we are seeing man here there are all kinds 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.800
 of products there is from frozen bread there 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.270
 creams 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.700
 today let's say we can 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.930
 find us in frozen almost all 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.030
 products that we can find at 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.910
 level of fresh and with some conditions 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.479
 of very good conservation and from here 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.979
 how do they get to the supermarkets to 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.600
 be able to distribute all these products 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.160
 in supermarkets you have to go back to 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.230
 return always respecting the chain of 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.150
 cold then we should put you 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.130
 these products in a container 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.480
 isothermal and then take us about 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.030
 special vehicles that arrive 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.290
 frozen to the supermarket in this case 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.610
 It is the point of sale for the consumer 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.610
 it is essential not to lose it 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.590
 we are already in the supermarket we brought 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.600
 our fridge with that frozen cream and 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.660
 we will place it in the rest of 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.570
 products joseluis in which we have 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.520
 to fix how we have to choose this 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.560
 type of frozen products is 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.270
 fundamental to choose that the product is 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.940
 free of frost or it has to be 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.860
 all completely dry the container that does not 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.210
 there is no moisture that can 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.920
 distort by that humidity is going to 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.010
 always indicate that the food was 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.440
 frozen re losing the cold 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.209
 frozen products that fresh ones if 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.590
 the frozen products if they have 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.510
 frozen well in origin and a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.100
 industrial-level freezing keep 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.140
 the same properties as a food 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.150
 cool that we can buy in the 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.310
 fishmonger or in the butcher shop but 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.990
 we can also take a 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.820
 fresh product and freeze it to our 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.320
 own is also a mechanism that 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.840
 We can do the freeze products in 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.700
 house we have to monitor what are the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.260
 stars from our freezer it 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.670
 calculate that each star is minus 6 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.709
 degrees to freeze a product 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.209
 we need to get to minus 18 degrees by 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.890
 we both have to have a freezer 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.640
 3 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.680
 66 and how long a product lasts 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.710
 frozen product we will see frozen 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.960
 we can last from 36 months 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.090
 even up to 12 months a product 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.190
 industrial that is already frozen from 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.480
 the industry of origin you have to look at your 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.730
 expiration or consumption date 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.380
 preferential but it has a lot of duration and 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.810
 the most important thing for the people that we 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.630
 is watching from home how we have to 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.850
 thaw that's very 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.920
 important the thawing should be what 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.320
 slowest possible to pass the product 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180
 frozen to refrigeration that is the 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.130
 traditional fridge and leave it there 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.000
 slowly then there is a series of 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.470
 products that can be cooked 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.080
 directly for example everything that 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.060
 we had seen of vegetables can be 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.350
 use directly between hours in 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.480
 boiling water is not necessary 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.370
 thaw them 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.260
 nowadays we can already find 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.290
 let's open to take a look and 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.000
 over here that what we said not for the 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.770
 rhythm of life that we lead if that 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.600
 we consume many frozen products and 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.220
 that we find everything if today in 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.890
 day we can say that at the level of 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.050
 frozen product there are almost as many 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.750
 references as of fresh products already 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.130
 be product already elaborated to the point 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.930
 final where only to warm it in 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.460
 the microwave or a product that we're going to 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.220
 use as raw material for a 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.120
 fish in sauce a chicken in sauce 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.220
 any day we can find everything 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.340
 and it's more comfortable clear and the most 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.290
 important to insist that the flavor goes to 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.390
 be the same if it has been thawed 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.030
 well and if in the beginning it froze well 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.500
 flavor will be practically the same 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.020
 from the supermarket to the freezer 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.020
 our houses and from there to our tables
