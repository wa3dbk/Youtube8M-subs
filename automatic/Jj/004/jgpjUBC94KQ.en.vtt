00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
using it underwater it's really good for

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.959 
using it underwater it's really good for
finding<00:00:41.190> Easter<00:00:41.850> eggs<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:43.489> just<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.610> bunch<00:00:44.820> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
stuff like that but the only problem I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.580 
stuff like that but the only problem I
did<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.510> thought<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
did have with it when I I thought you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.170 
did have with it when I I thought you
could<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.010> tried<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> type<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.850> in<00:00:50.969> more<00:00:51.120> than

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
could I tried to type it in more than

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.990 
could I tried to type it in more than
once<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.100> deactivated<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.250> when<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> was

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
once but it deactivated it when I was

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
once but it deactivated it when I was
underwater<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.680> far<00:00:55.890> under

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
underwater and I was really far under

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.500 
underwater and I was really far under
and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.640> died<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.190> wait

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
and then I died so you have to wait

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.270 
and then I died so you have to wait
until<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.079> time<00:01:01.289> runs<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:01.859> type<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
until the time runs out and then type it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060 
until the time runs out and then type it
in<00:01:02.399> again<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:03.059> else<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.570> will<00:01:03.719> take<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.170> cheat

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
in again or else it will take the cheat

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.429 
in again or else it will take the cheat
off<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.600> deactivate<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:09.080> basically<00:01:10.080> this

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
off and deactivate it so basically this

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.460 
off and deactivate it so basically this
is<00:01:11.390> basically<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.659> can't<00:01:12.930> die<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.290> all

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
is basically you can't die at all

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.249 
is basically you can't die at all
basically<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.580> fun<00:01:14.880> take<00:01:15.420> go<00:01:16.200> to
