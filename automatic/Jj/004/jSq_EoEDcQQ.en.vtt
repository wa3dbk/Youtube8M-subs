 I got to see the ball in the community, but it was okay. 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:35.970
 I had a lot of thought about what I could do in order to do something good this time 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.629
 Here you'll have a chance and an opportunity not to be assessed my skills 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.629
 I would have 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:49.649
 I do not feel nervous, I just do it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.460

 I think I feel a lot like this. So I have not experienced it yet. 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.010
 Thank you for giving me such experiences 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.010

 Danghamyeonseo to be a little different competitions 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.590
 I think I had a lot of development sharing while I was up there. 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.630
 U 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.610

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.100
 What processes are needed when collaborating and what programs are tools 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.930
 Or something necessary and something about the yireongeot 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:25.630
 * It seemed to be a time to be able to make my dreams a great help 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:30.080
 And it seems not to be giving me confidence, so the future 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:35.560
 No matter what quality it is, 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.560
 It is like helping me to proceed without hesitation.

 I think I can not see the end , 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:10.209
 Once again, what you want to do with this difference is to do it to the end 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.209
 I have an idea about what to see. 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:22.510
 I think I will see me one day because it is so narrow. 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.870
