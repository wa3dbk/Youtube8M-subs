trying to do it now this is an
experiment<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> use<00:01:28.590> power<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> force

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
experiment is use power of the force

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.249 
experiment is use power of the force

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
figures kind of like what I did with a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.710

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
power the Force to box this actually

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.840 
power the Force to box this actually
came<00:01:41.070> out<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.310> 97<00:01:41.909> although<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:42.990> new<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.350> me<00:01:43.380> I

came out in 97 although it's new to me I
have<00:01:44.850> two<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.299> lands<00:01:45.630> meters<00:01:47.540> 11<00:01:48.540> it's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
have two of these lands meters 11 it's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.300 
have two of these lands meters 11 it's
going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> keep<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> box<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.130> just

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
going to keep in the box and one is just

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.719 
going to keep in the box and one is just
for<00:01:50.399> display<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> power<00:01:53.579> of

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
for display like this this is a power of

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.389 
for display like this this is a power of
the<00:01:53.820> force<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.329> Luke<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> been<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.590> the

the force to Luke and been in the
landspeeder<00:01:57.860> land<00:01:58.860> speed<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.189> actually

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
landspeeder land speed is actually

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.740 
landspeeder land speed is actually
related<00:01:59.630> to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> original<00:02:01.170> landspeeder<00:02:02.750> from
