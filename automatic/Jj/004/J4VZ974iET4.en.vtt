00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you could help the team and that was the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.029 
you could help the team and that was the
whole<00:00:26.580> focus<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.180> burning<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:28.949> the

Kareem Jabbar the self-centered way he
played<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:38.100> me<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> epitome<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.690> what

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989

you'd expect in the team player here's a

person that could be the greatest scorer

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.549 
person that could be the greatest scorer
I<00:00:44.250> feel<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.539> history<00:00:45.899> he<00:00:46.110> turned<00:00:46.350> out

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
I feel in the history he turned out

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.650 
I feel in the history he turned out
later<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.670> greatest<00:00:48.149> scorer<00:00:48.570> in

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
later on to be the greatest scorer in

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
later on to be the greatest scorer in
the<00:00:48.750> history<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> NBA<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.399> you

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the history of the NBA as some of you

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.580 
the history of the NBA as some of you
probably<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:51.170> but<00:00:52.170> he<00:00:52.320> could<00:00:52.530> have

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
probably know but he could have

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.799 
probably know but he could have
individually<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.699> think<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.210> become<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
individually I think have become the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.600 
individually I think have become the
greatest<00:00:54.930> scorer<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.649> collegiate<00:00:56.309> basketball

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610

was<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> epitome<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.920> team<00:01:28.920> spirit<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.340> with

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
was the epitome of team spirit and with

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.179 
was the epitome of team spirit and with
a<00:01:29.720> superstar<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:31.079> he<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.500> known<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
a superstar like he was known just a

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.940 
a superstar like he was known just a
star<00:01:32.490> he<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> superstar<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.740> made

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
star he was a superstar and that made

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.899 
star he was a superstar and that made
the<00:01:35.130> other<00:01:35.220> players<00:01:35.810> be<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> little<00:01:37.200> more

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
the other players be a little more

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.160 
the other players be a little more
unselfish<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.150> more<00:01:39.360> interested<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
unselfish and more interested in the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
unselfish and more interested in the
team<00:01:40.409> play<00:01:40.680> when<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> superstar<00:01:41.579> sets<00:01:41.880> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
team play when the superstar sets that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
team play when the superstar sets that
example<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.540> pretty<00:01:42.659> hard<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.229> less

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
example is pretty hard for the less

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.910 
example is pretty hard for the less
qualified<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.729> try<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.380> taken<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.500> yourself

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
qualified to try to be taken on yourself

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.880 
qualified to try to be taken on yourself
too<00:01:47.100> much

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.650 

I<00:01:50.920> think<00:01:51.880> team<00:01:52.210> spirit<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.890> merely

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
I think team spirit is merely

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.550 
I think team spirit is merely
consideration<00:01:55.660> for<00:01:55.870> others

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
I think that's team spirit consideration

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.420 
I think that's team spirit consideration
for<00:01:59.890> others

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
for others

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.240 
for others
I<00:02:00.460> heard<00:02:00.970> team<00:02:01.300> spirit<00:02:01.630> defined<00:02:02.260> one<00:02:02.620> time<00:02:02.890> as

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
I heard team spirit defined one time as

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.570 
I heard team spirit defined one time as
a<00:02:03.600> willingness<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.810> lose<00:02:05.290> oneself<00:02:06.250> in<00:02:06.550> the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
a willingness to lose oneself in the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.140 
a willingness to lose oneself in the
group<00:02:06.940> for<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.600> welfare<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.590> group<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.000> I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
group for the welfare of the group and I

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.120 
group for the welfare of the group and I
thought<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.630> was<00:02:10.810> pretty<00:02:11.020> good<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.710> used

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
thought that was pretty good and I used

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.160 
thought that was pretty good and I used
it<00:02:12.250> myself<00:02:12.310> for<00:02:13.030> quite<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.240> while<00:02:13.510> but<00:02:13.840> there<00:02:14.050> is

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
it myself for quite a while but there is

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.650 
it myself for quite a while but there is
something<00:02:14.620> lacking<00:02:14.860> something<00:02:15.490> lacking<00:02:16.150> and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
something lacking something lacking and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.210 
something lacking something lacking and
I<00:02:16.900> couldn't<00:02:17.260> determine<00:02:17.560> what<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.070> was

I couldn't determine what it was
eventually<00:02:19.210> I<00:02:19.780> decided<00:02:20.230> if<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:21.070> change<00:02:21.460> this

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
eventually I decided if I change this

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.030 
eventually I decided if I change this
one<00:02:22.120> word<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.690> would<00:02:22.810> be<00:02:23.020> more<00:02:23.380> what<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.710> would

one word it would be more what I would

like and I dropped the word willingness

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.330 
like and I dropped the word willingness
and<00:02:26.940> inserted<00:02:27.940> eagerness<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.680> became<00:02:30.130> an

and inserted eagerness so it became an
