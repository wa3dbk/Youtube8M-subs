00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.230
 gameplay then review on sequel 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.290
 most popular and beloved by all 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.000
 puzzles called for room so 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.179
 let's see what is for us 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.039
 cooked and the second part 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.800
 pineapple will disappoint or please us 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.779
 find out very soon I went through the first 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.060
 chapter and now on the example of the second chapter 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 together we will see we 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 We will try to understand all 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.170
 puzzles that are here 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.649
 in store and so in the second chapter we 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.230
 We find ourselves in the hold of some old 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.899
 ship most likely pirated and here 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 we will need to solve 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 a whole bunch of different puzzles and so 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.460
 the first thing you need is to read the letter 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.980
 there is no Russian language unfortunately but 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.379
 in principle, he is not needed here because 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.949
 all puzzles are basically built on 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.620
 logic on the actions they are on the text and so 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.390
 after reading the messages let's see 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.420
 maybe some tags here 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.180
 no no no that's why this 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.040
 here the lens we do not need here 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.010
 let's do something with this ship 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.950
 let's see what he has here as 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.710
 I usually start to tap it all for 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.270
 order to find any 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.729
 movable elements here by the way one of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.549
 moving parts so what do we need 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.799
 do here is all right i did and 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.920
 found some key left only 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.189
 find a place where this key can be 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
 apply maybe somewhere here 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.869
 so this is an incomprehensible thing but let's 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.659
 try to add here this one 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.159
 the key will not turn off here will not fit 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.590
 look further maybe somewhere here 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.799
 so there is nothing here so here is something 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.909
 approached most likely here you need 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.899
 move 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.430
 guns I'm already a pretty good player 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.759
 puzzle for the room and basically 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.070
 intuitively enough I find all these 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.259
 here are the elements that can be moved 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.930
 move and solve riddles and here 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.680
 actually well where we will insert 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.360
 this key 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.819
 well now let's talk actually 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.609
 the game itself is the graphics in the game to my 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.790
 Gag a little better became more 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:20.040
 some blur effects blurring 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.200
 I don't know, maybe someone's not 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.900
 like but on the other side you are so 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.450
 you focus more on core 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.340
 objects so we picked up one more 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.139
 some basic key what else here 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.000
 there's some brand new and little note 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:39.150
 we will not read you again because 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.909
 for it makes no sense and probably all 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.079
 nothing else here let's remove 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:48.269
 yourself look at anything else nothing 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.359
 also there is no more 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.949
 do something with this ship of enigma 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:57.620
 also got very uninteresting and 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:03:00.269
 sometimes makes you think enough 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.969
 truth i only went through the first chapter 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.560
 chapter one everything was very easy 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:06.780
 elementary and no difficulties she 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
 absolutely not causing you all there 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.269
 pass quickly and I think 5 minutes will be on 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.470
 the first chapter is enough but from the second 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.509
 I think the head will have a little bit 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.109
 preload and think what's here and how 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.979
 definitely advise you sequel popular 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.909
 puzzles 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:28.919
 Download all just necessarily if you 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.680
 did not play blow up the first part 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.280
 swing first and then immediately grab 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.280
 for 2
