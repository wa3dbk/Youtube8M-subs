00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.190
 Hello dear ladies 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.660
 I am an excellent frequently asked question clock 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.740
 of this 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.650
 if in fact the question is very controversial 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.980
 since you got no 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.160
 messaging so let's consider them 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:27.369
 Department on the idea Nastya already decide for yourself 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.369
 what is better for you steel and titanium 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.130
 so titanium consider yes means plus 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.570
 these dances 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:41.620
 the fact that being light hypoallergenic 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.730
 that is, people prone to allergies may 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:49.480
 feel free to choose these 6 since the captain is not 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:54.460
 causes allergies and tablet tank brazenly 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.880
 give good types of work what is it 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:04.410
 This means that in bread 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:07.070
 body heat for example winter titans 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.070
 one 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 here's the sonata 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.880
 I have everything than steel he 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.930
 wherein 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.150
 Now we now have to approach users in 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.050
 1 x 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:30.850
 plus the fact that steel is given most often our 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:34.480
 time is done and used excuse me 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:40.520
 hypoallergenic is used 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:45.520
 316 ears are also called medical lo 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:51.110
 also become much harder than titanium and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.840
 if titan does nâ€™t scratch easily 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.650
 Of course, you can scratch the problems 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.650
 but much more problematic 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.820
 outwardly, this principle is still possible 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.110
 attributed to the pros have become what they 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:14.560
 heavy many men love to feel 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.560
 watch on hand and prefer thin to become 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.830
 external if they 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.060
 visually, of course, you can distinguish more often 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.810
 Total 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.810
 let's say on the example of synthesis clock 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.710
 show you most often titan he goes and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.710
 so much more 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.740
 get up most often 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.740
 Here is such a glossy shiny 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.020
 such also internal parts for this brand 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.200
 we show by their example 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.010
 and take the third model you can 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.959
 assume that they are combined but 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.670
 in fact there is no this watch completely 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.680
 made of titanium 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.190
 here tomochki canonical floors 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.250
 so 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.130
 visually come in a model which 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.520
 distinguish very hard only in the forest they 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.210
 on 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.310
 It will be much easier to insert 2 models 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.690
 here on this model combined 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.020
 the house was set aside 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.550
 see it at stake polished and 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.630
 visually generally lagged behind not how to distinguish 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.790
 can not only touch 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:44.040
 happens that happens even 100 does 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.140
 a mat so it should be as if 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.310
 refer to specifications 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:54.659
 hours exactly to your feelings 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.610
 choose what quality weekend 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:01.599
 in principle, this is all information 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:05.190
 choose look kidding debris in what 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.190
 what watch is better for you 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.099
 action suddenly you liked our

 subscribe to our channel will still 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:19.910
 much today i would become others 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:24.770
 this is a kiss

 video reviews of various brands as well and 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.900
 talk about the pros cons 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:36.280
 what will be the chair of our channel about the clock here
