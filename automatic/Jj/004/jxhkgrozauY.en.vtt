I've never had this work myself and as I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.919 
I've never had this work myself and as I
say<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.429> usually<00:00:29.609> an<00:00:30.240> electrical<00:00:30.779> error

with the print head now you'll be in in

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.270 
with the print head now you'll be in in
one<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.719> two<00:00:33.840> situations<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.770> either<00:00:35.100> you'll

which makes the error a lot easier to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.229 
which makes the error a lot easier to
resolve<00:00:43.230> or<00:00:43.860> you'll<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> 5<00:00:44.940> Plus

cartridge<00:00:45.660> printer<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:47.070> more

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
cartridge printer which is a little more

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.830 
cartridge printer which is a little more
difficult<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.390> printhead<00:00:48.719> will

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
difficult because the the printhead will

difficult because the the printhead will
be<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.050> inside<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> printer<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
be in inside the printer if this is the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.319 
be in inside the printer if this is the
case<00:00:51.960> I'd<00:00:52.199> recommend<00:00:52.649> contacting<00:00:53.010> Canon<00:00:53.550> if

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
case I'd recommend contacting Canon if

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.299 
case I'd recommend contacting Canon if
however<00:00:54.750> you've<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.949> cartridge

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
however you've got a to cartridge

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.099 
however you've got a to cartridge
machine<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.789> recommend<00:00:57.390> doing<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> following

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
machine I recommend doing the following

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.080 
machine I recommend doing the following
so<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.859> you're<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> latter<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.760> these<00:00:59.850> two

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
so if you're in the latter of these two

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.939 
so if you're in the latter of these two
positions<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.629> you've<00:01:00.719> got<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> two<00:01:01.530> cartridge

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
positions and you've got a two cartridge

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
positions and you've got a two cartridge
scanner<00:01:02.219> machine<00:01:02.629> my<00:01:03.629> first<00:01:03.870> step<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.470> be

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
scanner machine my first step would be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.160 
scanner machine my first step would be
to<00:01:04.650> turn<00:01:04.979> printer<00:01:05.339> off<00:01:05.600> when<00:01:06.600> your<00:01:06.810> printers

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
to turn printer off when your printers

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.840 
to turn printer off when your printers
in<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.439> era<00:01:07.680> state<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.130> won't<00:01:08.369> let<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.670> move

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
in this era state it won't let you move

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.270 
in this era state it won't let you move
the<00:01:09.090> cradle<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> cartridge<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.439> so

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the cradle to get the cartridge out so

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
the cradle to get the cartridge out so
turn<00:01:11.760> off<00:01:13.610> switching<00:01:14.610> back<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.880> again<00:01:15.860> now<00:01:16.860> we

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
turn off switching back on again now we

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.100 
turn off switching back on again now we
just<00:01:17.130> need<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.820> cartridge<00:01:18.720> into<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
just need to get the cartridge into the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.039 
just need to get the cartridge into the
cartridge<00:01:19.560> replacement<00:01:19.680> position<00:01:20.960> it's<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
cartridge replacement position it's a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:32.120

move<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> cradle<00:01:41.009> over<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.790> if

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
move the cradle over to get it out if

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.719 
move the cradle over to get it out if
that's<00:01:42.270> an<00:01:42.390> issue<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.070> now<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> which

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that's an issue for you now as to which

that's an issue for you now as to which

cartridge is causing the problem you'll
probably<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> rough<00:01:47.579> idea<00:01:47.759> based<00:01:48.210> on

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
probably have a rough idea based on

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.319 
probably have a rough idea based on
which<00:01:48.780> cartridge<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.320> changed<00:01:49.649> last<00:01:50.329> or

which cartridge you changed last or

which cartridge you changed last or
something<00:01:51.720> along<00:01:51.840> those<00:01:51.899> lines<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.909> I'm

something along those lines and I'm

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.190 
something along those lines and I'm
going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> replace<00:01:54.659> both<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.110> these

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
and that should be all we need to do

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.010 
and that should be all we need to do
with<00:02:09.229> any<00:02:09.350> luck<00:02:09.560> now<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.880> most<00:02:11.180> instances<00:02:11.600> and

with any luck now in most instances and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.660 
with any luck now in most instances and
the<00:02:12.260> b200<00:02:12.560> error<00:02:12.980> will<00:02:13.190> have<00:02:13.340> occurred

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
the b200 error will have occurred

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.120 
the b200 error will have occurred
immediately<00:02:14.330> after<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.989> trying<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.440> print<00:02:15.890> or

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
immediately after you trying to print or

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.370 
immediately after you trying to print or
do<00:02:16.850> a<00:02:16.880> cleaning<00:02:17.330> cycle<00:02:17.510> something<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.200> those

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
do a cleaning cycle something on those

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.870 
do a cleaning cycle something on those
lines<00:02:18.440> because<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.100> from<00:02:19.610> my<00:02:19.730> rough

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
lines because it from my rough

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.640 
lines because it from my rough
understanding<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.660> means<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.110> printhead<00:02:21.530> is

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
understanding it means the printhead is

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.900 
understanding it means the printhead is
overheating<00:02:22.190> or<00:02:22.370> causing<00:02:22.730> an<00:02:22.819> electrical

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
overheating or causing an electrical

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.490 
overheating or causing an electrical
issue<00:02:23.330> which<00:02:23.660> generally<00:02:23.900> happens<00:02:24.200> when<00:02:24.410> you

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
issue which generally happens when you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.600 
issue which generally happens when you
actively<00:02:24.980> try<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.400> use<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.510> just<00:02:26.930> to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
actively try and use it so just to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.800 
actively try and use it so just to
emulate<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.790> we'll<00:02:29.239> go<00:02:29.390> into<00:02:29.570> maintenance

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
emulate this we'll go into maintenance

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.050 
emulate this we'll go into maintenance
and<00:02:30.440> I'd<00:02:30.590> recommend<00:02:30.739> doing<00:02:31.160> something<00:02:31.610> like<00:02:31.640> a

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
and I'd recommend doing something like a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.900 
and I'd recommend doing something like a
cleaning<00:02:32.570> cycle<00:02:33.019> or<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:34.100> nozzle<00:02:34.790> check

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
cleaning cycle or a nozzle check

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.460 
cleaning cycle or a nozzle check
something<00:02:35.330> on<00:02:35.450> those<00:02:35.660> lines<00:02:35.989> just<00:02:36.140> something

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
something on those lines just something

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.440 
something on those lines just something
quick<00:02:36.560> if<00:02:36.769> your<00:02:36.890> printers<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.310> do<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:38.209> should

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
quick if your printers to do that should

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.590 
quick if your printers to do that should
see<00:02:38.930> if<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.110> air<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.260> fixed<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.600> hopefully

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
see if the air is fixed so hopefully

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.180 
see if the air is fixed so hopefully
that's<00:02:41.780> worked<00:02:41.989> for<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.500> you're<00:02:42.920> now<00:02:43.010> up

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
that's worked for you and you're now up

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.310 
that's worked for you and you're now up
and<00:02:43.340> printing<00:02:43.730> if<00:02:44.000> however<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.840> continue<00:02:45.230> to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
and printing if however you continue to

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.870 
and printing if however you continue to
have<00:02:45.380> problems<00:02:45.440> I'd<00:02:45.950> recommend<00:02:46.519> getting<00:02:46.670> in

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
have problems I'd recommend getting in

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.790 
have problems I'd recommend getting in

avoid<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.550> online<00:02:49.910> stuff<00:02:50.239> because<00:02:51.010> they<00:02:52.010> very

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
avoid the online stuff because they very

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.710 
avoid the online stuff because they very
much<00:02:52.370> go<00:02:52.550> down<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.060> route<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.510> the
