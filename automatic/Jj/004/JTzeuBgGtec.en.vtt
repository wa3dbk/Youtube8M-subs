 time to return to the guiness book of 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.470
 records since this challenge does not exist 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.429
 so especially the challenges that exist on 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.310
 know that at ten o'clock you can not 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.690
 So we try to create here we are 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.310
 attempt when it can swallow these 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.729
 overs in less than ten minutes to 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.350
 Things 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.060

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.220
 to have at least his name on a page or 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.190
 then he will return to the man section 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.539
 leave my blue card christina she 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.039

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.140
 yeah you did very well that we have 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.790
 negotiated rates no no all that the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.820
 goal 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.830
 the plate one euro piece can it hold 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.900

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.590
 content clips for not cases it's 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.640
 that you can go the ranks according to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.290

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.179

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.560
