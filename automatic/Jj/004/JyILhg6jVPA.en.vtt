Sweets Tales

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Today's tale is of the original Japanese snack food,
the insatiable roasted soybeans.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.500
Long ago,the first bridge was built over the Sumida River in Senju,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.300
a town along the main road heading North from Tokyo.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.400
Famous poet Matsuo Basho left for his travels from this town.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:44.000
Travellers like Basho would keep roasted soybeans tucked away in their clothes for snacking.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.600
Even today there are small shops that continue this tradition.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.800
Akihisa Kato has been waking up at 7 am to roast beans for 60 years.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.800
These black beans from Hokkaido become richer in flavor the more they are roasted. 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.300
We don't use additives so there's nothing to hide the flavor of the beans.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.000
With the quality determined by the season and weather,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.600
the beans are soaked again and again over several days until they are plump with moisture.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.200
Then, using the same machine is father once used,
Akihisa slowly roasts the beans.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.400
A true artisan, he tests the beans to ensure they're cooked right; 
not too hard, not too soft.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.400
With nothing added, everything depends on the natural flavor of the beans.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.000
Customers come from far away in pursuit of that very flavor.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.000
I simply like the plain, old-fashioned flavor.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.200
But the younger generation...

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.900
They only eat softer foods, right?
That's why their jaws don't develop.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.800
It's good to eat hard foods,
it provides stimulation for your jaw.
Your teeth line up better...

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Plain and unflavored roasted beans.
The natural sweetness is something to chew on!
