00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.680
 print defects other problems in your hybrid printer 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.580
 these problems may be related to the presence of static electricity in 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.269
 your substrate 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.159
 or machines 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:18.880
 this substrate made of corrugated plastic comes from a supplier who 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.880
 contain at the beginning of each electrostatic 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.249
 articulated parts in the machine can also increase the load levels 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.899
 electrostatic 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:33.450
 this may cause the machine to stop working or other complications 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.940
 this electrostatic mediator also in the more than 25 thousand volts in this substrate 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.660
 observe the basil particles moving on the substrate 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.540
 this occurs from the presence of an electrostatic charge 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.650
 this motion mimics how the title particles move on the surface of the 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.210
 substrate is the sixth it causes of most printing defects 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.390
 the solution is the serious electrostatic cord 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.300
 most effective and economically affordable electrostatic eliminator 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.050
 simply stretch the electrostatic cord from side to side of the 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.250
 mark on the modes of transport under the substrate 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.180
 the cordon is logical should stay centrally the past Indians 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.860
 just below the surface of the substrate 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 allowing the substrate to pass over 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.870
 fasten the cord in the machine using a mustache 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870
 as demonstrated 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.000
 most substrates will be neutralized with a single placement 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.290
 under the family 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.480
 some thicker substrates may require the electrostatic cord 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.480
 hope so 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.430
 an end is placed on all sides of the substrate both above and below 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.450
