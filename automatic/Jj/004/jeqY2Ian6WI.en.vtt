it<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.549> then<00:01:48.180> we've<00:01:48.329> got<00:01:48.360> our

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it in not in then we've got our

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
it in not in then we've got our
connection<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.890> were<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.100> be<00:01:50.189> changing<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
connection if we were to be changing the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.790 
connection if we were to be changing the
ta's<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.420> easy

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
ta's it would be this easy

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.720 
ta's it would be this easy
here<00:01:53.010> we<00:01:53.070> go<00:01:53.190> got<00:01:53.430> sound<00:01:53.730> or<00:01:53.910> any<00:01:54.740> did<00:01:55.740> there's

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
here we go got sound or any did there's

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.450 
here we go got sound or any did there's
no<00:01:56.880> annoying<00:01:57.210> pop<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:58.230> I<00:01:58.380> kill<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> guitar

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.330 

it's<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.640> quiet<00:02:02.910> as<00:02:03.180> opposed<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:05.160> hear

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it's all quiet as opposed to you hear

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.940 
it's all quiet as opposed to you hear
that<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.240> noise<00:02:06.480> like<00:02:09.500> nice<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.740> quiet

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that you get noise like nice and quiet

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.340 
that you get noise like nice and quiet
so<00:02:11.400> much<00:02:11.550> easier<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:14.300> quite<00:02:15.300> fancy<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.840> item<00:02:16.200> I

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
so much easier I quite fancy this item I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.040 
so much easier I quite fancy this item I
think<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:17.250> could<00:02:18.060> make<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.780> could

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
think I could make do with it I could

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.230 
think I could make do with it I could
use<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.380> quite<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.620> bit<00:02:19.880> especially<00:02:20.880> because<00:02:21.060> I

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
use it quite a bit especially because I

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.440 
use it quite a bit especially because I
change<00:02:21.510> guitars<00:02:21.930> not<00:02:22.200> too<00:02:22.530> often<00:02:22.740> but<00:02:23.450> you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
change guitars not too often but you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.750 
change guitars not too often but you
know<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:24.690> step<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:24.990> string<00:02:25.320> which<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.040> don't

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
know in your step a string which I don't

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.110 
know in your step a string which I don't
do<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:29.040> know<00:02:29.160> it's<00:02:29.400> nice<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.820> quick<00:02:30.000> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
do it you know it's nice and quick to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.870 
do it you know it's nice and quick to
change<00:02:30.270> guitars<00:02:30.660> they<00:02:31.020> do<00:02:31.080> come<00:02:31.410> with<00:02:31.590> the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
change guitars they do come with the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.670 
change guitars they do come with the
with<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.030> perpendicular<00:02:33.690> angle<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.440> can

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
with the perpendicular angle you can

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.350 
with the perpendicular angle you can
bother<00:02:34.890> head<00:02:35.190> separately<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:35.940> have<00:02:36.150> more

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
bother head separately so you have more

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360 
bother head separately so you have more
I'm<00:02:37.020> really<00:02:37.410> looking<00:02:37.800> forward<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.100> getting<00:02:38.220> my

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I'm really looking forward to getting my

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.430 
I'm really looking forward to getting my
hands<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> hybrid<00:02:39.390> kits<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:40.080> check<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
hands on the hybrid kits to check that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.810 
hands on the hybrid kits to check that
out<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:40.800> what<00:02:41.130> they<00:02:41.280> have<00:02:41.400> instead<00:02:41.700> of

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
out because what they have instead of

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.650 
out because what they have instead of
having<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.270> jack<00:02:42.960> you<00:02:43.290> have<00:02:44.120> XLR<00:02:45.120> inputs<00:02:45.510> you

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
having one jack you have XLR inputs you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.050 
having one jack you have XLR inputs you
have<00:02:45.750> RCA<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.980> quite<00:02:47.280> impressive<00:02:47.550> I'm

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
have RCA it's quite impressive I'm

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.540 
have RCA it's quite impressive I'm
looking<00:02:48.510> forward<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.840> seeing<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.350> as<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.460> the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
looking forward to seeing it as for the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.600 
looking forward to seeing it as for the
cable<00:02:50.790> itself<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:52.080> can't<00:02:52.950> come<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.280> too<00:02:53.430> much

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
cable itself I can't come in too much

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.560 
cable itself I can't come in too much
because<00:02:53.910> it's<00:02:54.810> pretty<00:02:55.380> good<00:02:55.590> cable<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.640> only

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
because it's pretty good cable I only

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.650 
because it's pretty good cable I only
really<00:02:58.080> use<00:02:58.110> high<00:02:58.560> quality<00:02:58.590> cable<00:02:59.660> because

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
really use high quality cable because

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.690 
really use high quality cable because
once<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.050> go<00:03:01.200> keep<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.680> cable<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.070> really

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
once you go keep a cable that really

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.280 
once you go keep a cable that really
starts<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.060> suck<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> laugh<00:03:03.630> at<00:03:03.810> your<00:03:03.989> guitars

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290

easily yeah I look forward to getting

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.020 
easily yeah I look forward to getting
more<00:03:24.180> getting<00:03:24.480> my<00:03:24.989> whole<00:03:25.110> ring<00:03:25.320> set<00:03:25.530> up<00:03:26.030> but

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
more getting my whole ring set up but

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.479 
more getting my whole ring set up but
snap<00:03:27.330> Jack<00:03:27.540> if<00:03:27.690> you're<00:03:27.840> watching<00:03:27.989> if<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.310> can

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
snap Jack if you're watching if you can

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.560 
snap Jack if you're watching if you can
make<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:30.120> patch<00:03:30.630> cable<00:03:31.170> for<00:03:32.070> connecting<00:03:32.580> pedals

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
make a patch cable for connecting pedals

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.150 
make a patch cable for connecting pedals
and<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:34.140> doesn't<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.620> be<00:03:34.650> much<00:03:34.860> you<00:03:35.010> can

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
and it doesn't have to be much you can

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.530 
and it doesn't have to be much you can
probably<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.580> be<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.880> head<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.239> connect

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
probably just be the head to connect

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.600 
probably just be the head to connect
your<00:03:36.630> pedals<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.890> guys<00:03:38.070> can<00:03:38.310> change

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
your pedals so that guys can change

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.000 
your pedals so that guys can change
pedals<00:03:39.120> quickie<00:03:39.540> then<00:03:39.780> you're<00:03:40.650> hitting<00:03:40.890> with

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
pedals quickie then you're hitting with

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:54.660 
pedals quickie then you're hitting with
a<00:03:41.070> winner<00:03:41.270> but<00:03:42.270> otherwise<00:03:42.770> what<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.800> cool<00:03:44.010> idea

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.730 

you
