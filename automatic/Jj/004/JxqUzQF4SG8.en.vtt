00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 very good today we are going to teach you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.950
 make a papyrus paper butterfly 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.370
 flexia 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.610
 to start we need a piece of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.849
 completely square paper 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.910
 and we started let's start doubling well 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.330
 in this way joining these two 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.330
 corners 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.660
 and the same thing but for the other side 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.719
 now let's catch 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.910
 from each corner and we're going to bring it to the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.050
 center 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.050
 that is to say so 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.810
 Now what we have to do is give the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.469
 turn and bend the same thing that we have done 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.740
 before but upside down bend the corners 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.740
 A) Yes 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.090
 A) Yes 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.330
 A) Yes 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.630
 and so 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.039
 now let's open 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.740
 and we are going to fold like this 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.560
 from the part of this folio to the center of 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.159
 this same 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.369
 the same and we double 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.090
 so something we have to do is catch 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.090
 A) Yes 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:04.780
 and fold it 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:07.460
 on this other side like that and we doubled it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.979
 I'm going to repeat it on this side 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.979
 we bring you twice as well 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.060
 and this other one here we doubled 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.870
 and automatically we will understand 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.870
 this figure 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.599
 we always bend the folds and 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.349
 let's go around and let's turn 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.349
 well in half 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.490
 we will have something like that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.850
 now let's take this we doubled it 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.640
 for here 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.480
 and this other one we are going to talk also to 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.480
 here 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.130
 Now we have to 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.130
 to talk about this a bit like that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.879
 our same with the other side 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.879
 so that 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.770
 will give you something more or less like that we have it 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.770
 what to do now is to go around 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.080
 to talk like that 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.080
 in this way 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.080
 Now let's fold a little bit like that 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.960
 we are going to open 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.180
 We will not have 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.290
 our 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.549
 butterfly 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.549
 of paper 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.340
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.340
 and a gretting
