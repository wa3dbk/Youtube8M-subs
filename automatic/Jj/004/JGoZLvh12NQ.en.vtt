00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:33.630
 2005 2009 after we got here from one 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.820
 that's very sporty talking vehicle 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.610
 a topic that has been natural to us 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.300
 the aerodynamic buoyancy forces the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.040
 adequately shape the vehicle 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.960
 you at higher speeds in 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 the driving stability as well as in the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.129
 comfort behavior of the vehicle on the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.780
 the other side we want with one 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.329
 special efficient vehicle 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.520
 Of course, the lowest possible 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.079
 generate drag that was the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.510
 second big challenge 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.329
 both in the combination is here 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.670
 very well done and we reach 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:41.549
 with this vehicle in this class the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:43.009
 low aerodynamic drag 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.909
 process accompanies one 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.990
 vehicle development over the entire 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.509
 development time 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.600
 It starts in the early phase 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.240
 first ideas with package concepts and 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.009
 The aerodynamic process is also only 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 with the last prototype and with the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.260
 last details on in the early phase 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.200
 we need 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.110
 a tool where we proportions where we 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.030
 surfaces or details on the model 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.790
 we can therefore design one 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.430
 material that is customizable and has here 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.260
 In recent years, the clay or 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.110
 the german word industrie plastilin 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.180
 as a very, very good material 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.190
 proven because it is on the one hand for 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.480
 The models are customizable and on the 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.280
 on the other hand also the aerodynamics 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.280
 loads can endure very well 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.800
 in cooperation is very much 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.720
 professional 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.890
 she is very much each other 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.600
 it is very intense and fruitful 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.620
 often arises from the individual 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.930
 positions of the two groups 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.750
 better overall picture and i believe 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.450
 Also that the designer aerodynamics 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.350
 have recognized as something where they are very good 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.930
 their contribution to the reduction of co2 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.519
 output or fuel consumption 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.170
 can and thus they employ 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.300
 also very strong with these 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.040
 and we notice that in our daily life 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.670
 cooperation as I said very much 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.670
 is intense 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:22.040
 As I said before was under construction 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.900
 the wind tunnel our vision the road 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.820
 into the lab and that's it 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.070
 so that a vehicle is up 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.580
 The street is moving with rotating wheels 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.060
 emotional 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.300
 It is so in the area of ​​the wheels 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.620
 and the city ​​councils about 25 to 30 percent 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.050
 aerodynamic resistance arise 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.040
 if you are the wrong one here 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.169
 generate flow simulation thereby 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.450
 that you do not have spinning wheels 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.280
 then you can at this potential too 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.560
 do not approach and open it up 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.039
 or maybe even worse 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.460
 would 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.510
 they would be any at this point 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.190
 Design proposals are made 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.110
 But then not on the street 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.669
 to adjust 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.410
 insofar the simulation is the 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.820
 spinning wheels for the right one 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.640
 flow falls and thus for that 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.640
 right product and the right solution 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.640
 essential 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.259
 really need for speed
