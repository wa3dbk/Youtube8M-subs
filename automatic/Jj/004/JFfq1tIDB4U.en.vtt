00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
off make sure to hold it so that the

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.979 
off make sure to hold it so that the
boxes<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.329> go<00:00:39.570> down<00:00:39.780> i<00:00:40.879> am<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.210> roll

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
boxes and go down i am going to roll

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.850 
boxes and go down i am going to roll
down<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:44.370> sides<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> bag<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.530> air

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
down the sides of the bag so the air

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
down the sides of the bag so the air
gathers<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:52.699> then<00:00:53.699> i'm<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
gathers there and then i'm going to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.959 
gathers there and then i'm going to
slowly<00:00:55.110> introduce<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.399> tank<00:00:56.699> water

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
slowly introduce some of my tank water

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.470 
slowly introduce some of my tank water
in<00:00:58.430> with<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> water<00:00:59.760> that's<00:00:59.940> already<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
in with the water that's already in the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.520 
in with the water that's already in the
bag<00:01:02.090> now<00:01:03.090> since<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.690> rolled<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> sleeves

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
bag now since we rolled up the sleeves

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.060 
bag now since we rolled up the sleeves
of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> bag<00:01:05.510> there's<00:01:06.510> air<00:01:06.780> trapped<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
of the bag there's air trapped so you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.940 
of the bag there's air trapped so you
can<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.430> let<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.570> float

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
can just let it and it's going to float

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.929 
can just let it and it's going to float
then<00:01:10.950> slowly<00:01:11.460> add<00:01:12.170> some<00:01:13.170> more<00:01:13.380> water<00:01:13.549> add<00:01:14.549> some

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
then slowly add some more water add some

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.690 
then slowly add some more water add some
more<00:01:15.090> water<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:18.560> leave<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.220> leave

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
more water and leave it for a bit leave

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.050 
more water and leave it for a bit leave
the<00:01:20.939> fish<00:01:21.119> per<00:01:21.360> bit<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.960> adjust<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.830> maybe<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the fish per bit to adjust to maybe the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.810 
the fish per bit to adjust to maybe the
slight<00:01:24.330> changes<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.960> PA<00:01:25.259> cage<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
slight changes of PA cage and the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.590 
slight changes of PA cage and the
differences<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> water<00:01:28.549> now<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.329> chick

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
differences in the water now the chick

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.080 
differences in the water now the chick
with<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.619> never<00:01:31.920> put<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.579> pitch<00:01:32.850> up

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
with this is to never put the pitch up

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.850 
with this is to never put the pitch up
water<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.530> your<00:01:34.740> aquarium<00:01:35.070> water<00:01:36.860> now

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
water in with your aquarium water now

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.310 
water in with your aquarium water now
now<00:01:38.460> let<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> fish<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.119> adjusted<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
now let the fish is adjusted to the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.010 
now let the fish is adjusted to the
water<00:01:40.560> conditions<00:01:43.009> I'm<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.700> cut<00:01:45.689> up<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
water conditions I'm going to cut up the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
water conditions I'm going to cut up the
side<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> bit<00:01:46.470> more

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040

after the fishes in to make sure that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.620 
after the fishes in to make sure that
there's<00:02:24.470> no<00:02:24.590> aggressive<00:02:24.920> behavior<00:02:25.670> between

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
before okay guys I don't know if you've

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.130 
before okay guys I don't know if you've
noticed<00:02:36.230> but<00:02:36.950> I've<00:02:37.670> react<00:02:38.209> escaped<00:02:38.750> my

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
noticed but I've react escaped my

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.910 
noticed but I've react escaped my
aquarium<00:02:40.240> I've<00:02:41.240> done<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.870> because<00:02:42.650> it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
aquarium I've done this because it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.070 
aquarium I've done this because it
promotes<00:02:43.190> breeding<00:02:44.030> behavior<00:02:44.150> between<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
promotes breeding behavior between the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.500 
promotes breeding behavior between the
African<00:02:45.590> cichlids<00:02:46.070> so<00:02:47.000> if<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.360> have

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
African cichlids so if you have

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.840 
African cichlids so if you have
infrequent<00:02:47.990> cichlids<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:49.580> want<00:02:49.760> to

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
infrequent cichlids and you want to

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.290 
infrequent cichlids and you want to
promote<00:02:50.090> breeding<00:02:50.959> behavior<00:02:51.340> then<00:02:52.340> there's

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
promote breeding behavior then there's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.509 
promote breeding behavior then there's
many<00:02:53.540> ways<00:02:53.750> but<00:02:54.170> one<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.470> them<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:55.130> react

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
many ways but one of them is to react

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.550 
many ways but one of them is to react
escape<00:02:55.910> your<00:02:56.030> tank<00:02:56.980> here's<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.100> new<00:02:58.250> fish

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
escape your tank here's the new fish

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.800 
escape your tank here's the new fish
