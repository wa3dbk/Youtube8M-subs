much<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.680> difference<00:03:23.040> on<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.790> game<00:03:24.030> too

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
much of a difference on this game too

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.020 
much of a difference on this game too
like<00:03:25.230> they<00:03:25.380> got<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.620> right<00:03:25.799> sitrep<00:03:26.280> pro<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.850> a

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
like they got this right sitrep pro is a

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.349 
like they got this right sitrep pro is a
perk<00:03:27.359> which<00:03:28.130> enhances<00:03:29.130> enemy<00:03:29.730> footsteps<00:03:29.940> and

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
perk which enhances enemy footsteps and

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.539 
perk which enhances enemy footsteps and
quiet<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.140> down<00:03:31.350> yours<00:03:31.620> which<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.280> what

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
quiet and down yours which is what

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.580 
quiet and down yours which is what
awareness<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.299> supposed<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.660> do<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.989> inverted

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
awareness is supposed to do in inverted

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.140 
awareness is supposed to do in inverted
commas but<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.100> doesn't<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.579> so<00:03:36.000> yeah

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
commas but it doesn't do that so yeah

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.220 
commas but it doesn't do that so yeah
coming<00:03:36.329> back<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.840> was<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.959> bit<00:03:37.079> weird

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
coming back to this it was a bit weird

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.740 
coming back to this it was a bit weird
like<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.530> but<00:03:37.980> really<00:03:38.519> really<00:03:38.850> enjoyable

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
like that but really really enjoyable

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.569 
like that but really really enjoyable
the<00:03:40.320> fact<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.590> they've<00:03:40.799> got<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.130> right<00:03:41.310> and

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
the fact that they've got that right and

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.370 
the fact that they've got that right and
getting<00:03:42.060> Moab's<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.600> something<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.989> go<00:03:43.109> for

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
getting Moab's is something to go for

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.349 
getting Moab's is something to go for
it's<00:03:44.070> amazing<00:03:44.519> i<00:03:44.609> think<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.880> perks<00:03:45.090> on<00:03:45.239> this

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359
