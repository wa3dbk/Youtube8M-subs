00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.160
 already connected to that already we could 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.390
 talk to people we could talk to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.739

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.410
 and now to want to know how to put 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:52.410

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.880

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.010
 these options appear we are going to 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.950

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.900

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.220
 audio as you can see or better said 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.430
 No sound heard on TV by 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.150
 more forest I give, nothing comes out 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.010
 the sound would happen to be here next to 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.190
 the people that I'm not talking through 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.580
 of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.159

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.640
 egg sound and 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.670
 and the sound of your friends who are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.880

 Headphone volume control 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.020

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.939
 volume to the sound that is right now 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.930
