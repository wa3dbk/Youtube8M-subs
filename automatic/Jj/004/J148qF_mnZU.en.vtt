00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
as I'm just used to doing normal keys

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.790 
as I'm just used to doing normal keys
and<00:03:28.860> it's<00:03:29.670> really<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.540> know<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:31.200> has<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> lot<00:03:31.770> of

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
and it's really you know it has a lot of

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.210 
and it's really you know it has a lot of
different<00:03:31.920> keys<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.960> so<00:03:33.960> are<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.890> chorus

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
different keys in it so are the chorus

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.860 
different keys in it so are the chorus
bit<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:36.660> starts<00:03:36.960> off<00:03:37.050> with<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.290> G<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.910> use<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
bit it starts off with a G and I use the

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.050 
bit it starts off with a G and I use the
day<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.530> doesn't<00:03:40.920> have<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.370> two<00:03:41.640> fingers<00:03:41.970> at

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
day that doesn't have the two fingers at

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.730 
day that doesn't have the two fingers at
the<00:03:42.090> bottom<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:42.720> you've<00:03:42.840> just<00:03:43.020> got<00:03:43.170> one<00:03:43.410> finger

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
the bottom so you've just got one finger

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.460 
the bottom so you've just got one finger
on<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.760> bottom<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.510> third<00:03:45.720> fret<00:03:46.020> not<00:03:46.200> too

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
on the bottom then a third fret not too

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:58.670 
on the bottom then a third fret not too
and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:10.440 

so<00:03:59.680> J<00:04:03.090> safe

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.980 

you

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.070
