00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
my face this foundation lasts me the

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.920 
my face this foundation lasts me the
whole<00:02:20.370> time<00:02:20.580> I'm<00:02:20.790> at<00:02:20.940> work<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.569> normally

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
whole time I'm at work and I normally

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.199 
whole time I'm at work and I normally
work<00:02:22.110> an<00:02:22.319> eight<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.980> half<00:02:23.010> hour<00:02:23.370> shift<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.180> I

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
work an eight and a half hour shift so I

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.420 
work an eight and a half hour shift so I
think<00:02:24.330> that's<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.720> pretty<00:02:24.900> good<00:02:25.340> amount<00:02:26.340> of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
think that's a pretty good amount of
