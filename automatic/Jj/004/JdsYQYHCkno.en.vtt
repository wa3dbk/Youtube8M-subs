00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
that is definitely right they were

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.840 
that is definitely right they were
breaking<00:02:37.640> all<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.300> up<00:02:38.510> there<00:02:38.720> no<00:02:39.820> no<00:02:40.820> I

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.760 
the real champion I think that once the
public<00:03:59.700> gets<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.790> know<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:02.020> know<00:04:02.230> then

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
public gets to know you you know then

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.230 
public gets to know you you know then
that's<00:04:02.950> where<00:04:03.250> your<00:04:03.400> fame<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:03.910> everything

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
that's where your fame and everything

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.690 
that's where your fame and everything
starts<00:04:04.690> but<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.590> way<00:04:05.770> how<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.100> fighters<00:04:06.520> are

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
starts but the way how the fighters are

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.360 
starts but the way how the fighters are

one<00:06:14.670> no<00:06:15.670> arguments<00:06:16.270> it<00:06:16.420> again<00:06:17.230> what<00:06:17.470> I<00:06:17.590> said<00:06:17.860> is

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.190 
one no arguments it again what I said is
I'm<00:06:18.880> thinking<00:06:19.240> about<00:06:19.330> the<00:06:19.600> future

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
I'm thinking about the future

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.740 
I'm thinking about the future
you<00:06:20.470> keep<00:06:20.950> moving<00:06:21.490> forward<00:06:21.940> and<00:06:22.060> not<00:06:22.360> looking

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
you keep moving forward and not looking

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.620 
you keep moving forward and not looking
backwards<00:06:23.260> so<00:06:23.850> that's<00:06:24.850> what<00:06:25.030> I'm<00:06:25.150> looking<00:06:25.420> for

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
backwards so that's what I'm looking for

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.500 
backwards so that's what I'm looking for
and<00:06:26.260> what<00:06:26.560> one<00:06:26.770> of<00:06:26.890> you<00:06:27.040> fights<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:28.090> last<00:06:28.300> one

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
and what one of you fights the last one

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.960 
and what one of you fights the last one
against<00:06:29.080> Lyon<00:06:29.350> our<00:06:29.470> team<00:06:29.770> is<00:06:29.920> still<00:06:30.370> inside

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
against Lyon our team is still inside

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.540 
against Lyon our team is still inside
you<00:06:31.140> know<00:06:32.140> I<00:06:32.170> think<00:06:32.410> cuz<00:06:32.800> that's<00:06:33.040> in<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.310> past

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
you know I think cuz that's in the past

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.120 
you know I think cuz that's in the past
and<00:06:34.330> again<00:06:34.810> I<00:06:35.020> have<00:06:35.170> to<00:06:35.320> look<00:06:35.440> for<00:06:35.650> the<00:06:35.710> future

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
and again I have to look for the future

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.540
