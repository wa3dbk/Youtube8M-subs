00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.280
 launched this great success vehicle 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.530
 national 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.930
 then came to the sports version 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 called x is now the turn of the sedan 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.770
 to win the streets 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.750
 a segment disputed by a series of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.520
 vehicles that actually have many 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.510
 positive characteristics for the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.840
 consumer 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.390
 the new prism etios voyage great scene 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.940
 market is heated and the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.850
 function of the hb 20s will be to find your 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.800
 space in the category that represents 24% 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.210
 of total marketed cars 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.480
 in Brazil and that in 2012 plate or more 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.480
 580 thousand units 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.090
 modernity and technology is made by hp 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.560
 20 inspired this new car design the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.450
 great car strong point 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.920
 is being so with the hatch version is 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.230
 being thus with the xp version cross version 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.240
 and I have no doubt about the training being 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.620
 that certainly this lack I think the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.360
 celso is going to be very big 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.310
 it's a very careless market 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.450
 Very emotional ecodesign 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.280
 so I think this can be a big 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.850
 sales appeal of the mountain road as well 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.860
 doubt is no help because it is 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.840
 another is a sequence of 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.520
 hp 21 family 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.290
 then we certainly understand 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.600
 that the hatch he lends a little to the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.700
 sedan but we must consider that are 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.110
 different segments cycles a little 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.400
 different though within the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.400
 segment that we call well 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.440
 O 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.260
 the great bet of the kidney to deliver a 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.300
 vehicle exceeds the limits of the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.239
 rationality of purchase and 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.440
 consumer for its modernity and 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.720
 we have identified a Brazilian customer 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.270
 is that today he is very well attended 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.800
 in the segment of compact sedans in that 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.770
 which are the national values ​​of good 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.360
 inside the trunk but today the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.980
 customer he wants a little more he who is 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.780
 the captain a good design the car is 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.440
 modern is because it is a car 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.750
 family 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.280
 who also have a modern visual look 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.280
 more sensual body 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.790
 the itaipu hydroelectric plant is born here 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.340
 a large part of Brazil's energy and 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.410
 still found on hb 20 its great 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.120
 force when it was launched the company had 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.140
 only 2.5 percent of the market 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.410
 Brazilian 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.830
 today after 22 thousand units sold 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.020
 already reaches 5.6 and this model sedan should 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.000
 these sales even more 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.890
 who decides this is the consumer who 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.810
 consumer has been increasingly looking for 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.030
 innovative products in terms of 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.260
 design we have technology and I think it is 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.970
 In this the campaign has been positioned 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.330
 Very well in Brazil, so we believe. 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.040
 that we will be one of the great players of this 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.040
 market where it is very competitive 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.599

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.120
 hdms engines are the same as 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.750
