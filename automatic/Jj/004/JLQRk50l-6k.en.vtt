 expensive since good would end a lot 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.930
 sooner because it's something that I use 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.170

 and I like for a daily makeup 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.010
 to start with the first product I 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.370
 I use this cream 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.830
 This brand cream dior jeans 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.370

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.890
 face what will help us to give a 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.080
 separate effect that has sunscreen 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.300
 something very important and that we can not 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.240
 leave home to give one more effect 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.980
 healthy more radiant then I 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.590
 I use this cream serves fit if it serves my 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.380
 point of view is served with the weeks 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.300
 I 've realized that well I do not have 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.850
 need to use a lot of base 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.840
 Make-up is more if it's for daily already 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.270
 that my face grabs that tone more 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.270
 tan I use it daily and more in 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.460
 this and more in this hot weather that 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.070
 between less makeup much more very 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.580
 important to use correct and more if 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.260
 the girls who have eye bags lately 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.620
 well I do not in the way of not sleeping 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.660
 well do not rest as it should be 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.360
 Well, I'm getting out and you want 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.450
 right now I do not know if you notice I do not know events 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.040
 It is very important to use 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:17.170
 a good corrector efe 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.780
 and it's from the benefit brand I'm going to apply it 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.390
 in the area of ​​the eyes with little touches and 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.430
 well we delicately put our 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.480
 makeup base lately I'm 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:33.129
 using this revlon the one that says 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:36.040
 forum way to sight and I do not think it's 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.290
 Full coverage created depends 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.209
 also how many layers of the base you 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.000
 apply in the coverage that you are going to have 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.239
 but in my case well good to do 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.489
 some of the newspaper only used a 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.909
 little of this base on the brush and what 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.859
 I apply a tone throughout the face 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:58.269
 lighter very light not very loaded it 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.659
 I give to this base 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.879
 let's say a 7 I like it because he does not 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.889
 helped the face help me to match in 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.799
 tone of my face but I do not think it's 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.780
 with full height after each base 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.510
 of makeup is very important to use 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.200
 your compact powders 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:21.099
 ok is going to help you seal your makeup 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.879
 to give a softer effect I'm 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.519
 using this fit me the number 310 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:30.579
 in the mark of the mind but when 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:34.049
 garonne tone darker on base something that 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.940
 me powder is lighter so that for 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.450
 match color when combined the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.670
 bronzer combined it with my blush 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.159
 this time I'm using a next 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.530
 for me very cheap but it's worth it 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:52.799
 it is l colors the number 396 important 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.750
 is that depending on the tone of your skin 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:58.209
 look for the perfect blush and that's the 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.629
 way you're going to look healthier 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.500
 since the blush gives us that effect 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.670
 you and more healthy chips the 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.959
 orange 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.520
 this orange tone of truth that I tell you 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.340
 gives this effect that I have right now 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.269
 between tanning and more combining these 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.590
 two tones gives a much better effect 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:29.230
 eyes a very natural light outline and 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:32.860
 they fix anything loaded in combining two 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.669
 types of designers I'm using 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.370
 this in brown tone use two types of 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.380
 eyeliner is for this reason and the pencil 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.229
 the liquid not because I already say no 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.840
 I want it to be something more laborious and 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.750
 applied some eyeliner on the part 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.210
 only in the line of the tabs in 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.360
 the top part and this and so that 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.050
 it look so tan marked aligner with 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.930
 this finger applied and I start to blur 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.850
 with my fingers that area like the line of 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.020
 water on top 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.940
 that gives us an effect of a lash and 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.639
 big fat men then slaves a 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.240
 effect that we have 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:20.430
 according to more lashes and thick for that 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.700
 effect in a little secret that I would tell them 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:27.020
 is 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.990
 when you are going to use a mix one 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.830
 waterproof mascara sometimes that is 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.470
 very difficult and to the is makeup and more than 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.570
 if you do not completely remove the rhythm of 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.240
 the eyes the next day look like eyes 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.620
 from raccoon this 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.710
 use good mainly for 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.740
 help moisturize my lashes a good 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.980
 rhythm I'm using this brand 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.840
 in mascara with oil 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.660
 mamey bone or like this is not a 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.700
 waterproof then it 's easier to 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.120
 to withdraw it at the moment of 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:07.250
 make-up uses two layers used 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.200
 first the one that is not waterproof 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.670
 mainly if media used that of or 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.340
 to dry 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.130
 after that good market I was made 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.960
 each one completely because if it does not go 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:24.180
 to be the same effect the second more than 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.060
 then after this that there applied 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.900
 for me it's one of my favorites and it's from 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.920
 the brand to the blacks returning to the 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.410
 lips is something very natural I would say 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.289
 - If I'm not mistaken no more than you have 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:44.969
 the brand 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:48.180
 but this is aliens in this lipstick 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:50.490
 it naturally helps to not only 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.229
 see the lips and as parties the 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:58.460
 moisturizes a light uniform layer 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.460
 the name bar ok 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.710
 and delineate my lips with an eyeliner 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:10.440
 to talk about something very close to 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.440
 to the natural delineation of our lips 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.199
 at the end of this video what purpose 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.990
 apart from teaching them how to apply 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:41.050
