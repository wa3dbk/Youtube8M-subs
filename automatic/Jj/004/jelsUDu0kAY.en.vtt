00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
there she jumps the opposite direction

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.640 
there she jumps the opposite direction
that's<00:04:58.660> why<00:04:58.780> it<00:04:58.840> might<00:04:59.020> look<00:04:59.139> a<00:04:59.259> little<00:04:59.289> bit

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
that's why it might look a little bit

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.700 
that's why it might look a little bit
different<00:05:00.039> great<00:05:00.699> height<00:05:01.030> just<00:05:01.710> absolutely
