00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.959
 what we wanted to show here in the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.350
 port of Barcelona was that slope 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:12.809
 artistic of skateboarding not collaborating with 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.099
 with artists that come from coming 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.610
 of the world of skateboarding but that have 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.410
 developed this artistic side and 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.820
 just keep doing a little 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.009
 what we have always done is not go out to the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.869
 street and play with the elements that we 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:29.419
 We found there and give a little 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.419
 shape and skate it and enjoy it 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.830
 but it's also what you want that 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.410
 I guess that's what you want 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.090
 that is then there are skaters that skate 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.400
 and then they are painting a few hours 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.050
 they are painting a mural or one that is 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.200
 painting mural then he is recording video 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.150
 or is even playing music where 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.220
 people make their spots here that is 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.870
 all the roll a little underground 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.870
 fruit trees you have to be a little 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.130
 if it were an outdoor study 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 as there are lots of freedom people 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.120
 come here and start to develop in 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.230
 true because there are artists painting the 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.180
 there are people who come to try the 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.640
 ramps that are creating the pints in 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.550
 the street with a port in this case with 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.710
 a container 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.370
 they generate things that experiences that do not 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.370
 that you had not had 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.290
 that we have all created from one place 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.270
 that was in disuse 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.270
 a space of companions of you
