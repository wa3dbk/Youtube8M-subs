00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.450
 the contention system serves as its 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.740
 name indicated to contain the animals of 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.570
 to endanger neither 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.100
 the breeder nor his animals in most 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.990
 cases it's a barrier game 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.150
 arranged in a certain way and a 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.590
 way of blocking the contention and of 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.840
 the operator in paris the claws of the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.430
 cattle to sort the animals care for them 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.960
 weighed where the curly streets for example 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.079
 but also to load or the 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.870
 unload the principle of the system of 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.360
 contention it's a channel of the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.660
 movement of animals to a place where 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.110
 we can block them so everything is about 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.390
 arrange the barriers so 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.820
 we can intervene at the level of 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.250
 animals is also able to escape 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.300
 in case for the work to be done 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.860
 in the best conditions and the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.390
 as soon as possible 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.559
 seven employees of the coop vial council 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.239
 the farmer in the choice of his 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.129
 installations during the assembly of the project 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.810
 he orients in the choice of building and 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.610
 contention system at the same time 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.770
 to optimize circulation in 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.570
 the building explains the advantages of such 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.549
 or such material and returns to the site 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.340
 once this one completed to see if 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.020
 some elements need to be modified 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.020
 so there the guillotine she introduces herself 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.280
 of a is composed of a basket that allows 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.240
 of canton the farm and let forward 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.830
 the animal without them being able to save themselves 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.780
 to close both panels of 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.140
 guillotine on both sides for 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.049
 block the head of the bovine is so if 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.900
 we want to intervene in front of the animal 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.570
 can open the cart while the 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.000
 cattle is stuck between the two 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.710
 guillotine panels in the frame 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.420
 of its mission of prevention the c3 to 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.009
 also accompanies the breeder in the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.810
 choice of work tools and for 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.850
 encourage him invest she puts to her 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.140
 provision of financial aid for 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.710
 qualify for financial assistance 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.659
 of the crate accident three things all 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.590
 just the first one is a copy 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.590
 the bill paid 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.450
 the second is a rib and the third 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.489
 it's this form that has to be 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.960
 completed and to be returned to the 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.280
 farm accident insurance fund 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.840
 then these amounts can be 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.380
 different whether it's a cage of 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.570
 contention 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.830
 so it's 40% of the amount excluding taxes 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.930
 with a maximum amount of aid 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.360
 up to 1000 euros or an installation 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.010
 of contention so here it's always 40% 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.920
 the amount excluding taxes with the amount 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.420
 maximum of aid up to 1500 euros 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.370
 was the ibis co-manager of the gaec from the top 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.260
 sundgau in linsdorf benefited from this 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.090
 financial assistance three years ago when 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
 the purchase of a restraint cage for the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.230
 trimming of the brand's hooves 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.480
 Austrian rosenstein r the price was 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.370
 of 7000 euros and we have a subsidy of 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.550
 1500 euros from the cassation 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.360
 years ago accessing agricultural he also pushed 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.310
 really to invest because it's a 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.240
 something we always do before 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.150
 the drying up of cows 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.620
 and then all the more lame cows 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.190
 look happy we take them back into 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.480
 lactation course and we did some big 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.980
 progress on security level on it 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.500
 because and but also to see happen 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.970
 of art an accident or two years a year 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.980
 cows before than another helmet 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.170
 was not good enough any 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.550
 just what does it average on average 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.350
 there are about a hundred accidents 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.060
 related to cattle breeding that range from 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.350
 conclusion to the broken arm at the anc 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.300
 ornaments or even up 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.770
 amputation or death the taking into 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.390
 expenses of these accidents or 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.740
 occupational diseases is also 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.080
 insured by the accident fund 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.820
 generally security is synonymous with 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.670
 constraints 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:34.910
 the idea is indeed the opposite 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.500
 security is on the one hand to avoid 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.690
 accidents but not only 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.490
 to have a material that allows you to 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.620
 to get the most animals 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.990
 quickly possible so a form of 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.360
 time saving productivity gain but 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.140
 also a gain in hardness 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.230
 work 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.170
 when working without installation of 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.860
 contention it sometimes needs to be 2 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.840
 to 3 people to weigh an animal when 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.820
 we have a station of comfort a station 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.180
 of contention if it is well thought out 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.470
 we can possibly do it alone 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.150
 does not even need to 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.460
 get close to the animal to touch it 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.100
 to be in the back of the animal suddenly 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.170
 it is also a form of pain in 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.850
 less the cashier also offers in 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.500
 parallel training sessions to 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.419
 destination of breeders within the same 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.040
 to review the basics of 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.430
 cattle behavior and techniques 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.810
 approached immobilization 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.030
 apart from having the handling of the animals 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.650
 the big problem is the lack of 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.230
 positive relationships between man and 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.420
 the animal to reinstall relationships 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.280
 with these animals must still there 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.780
 spent a little bit of time there are 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.570
 periods of the animal's life that are 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.400
 particularly privileged 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.630
 the withdrawal 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.670
 so there are a few things to do at this 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.620
 moment there to be able to work 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.570
 correctly after healing a beast 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.850
 do everything that will sort and 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.560
 it's a training session it's 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.120
 precisely took place in the gaec du 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.830
 high sundgau the observation and the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.690
 constant vigilance was the ideas 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.220
 mistresses of these two days a reminder 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.570
 welcome to this breeder who has already 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.920
 suffered the consequences of a brief 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.940
 inattention during a boxing mulch 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.380
 it was not during the contention of a 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.270
 animal simply I made myself 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.070
 surprise by art is an animal that 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.480
 tend heat that climb me on the back 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.280
 just that I have a settlement 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.760
 vertebrae at level 2 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.350
 of the base of the neck is good it was not 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.460
 dramatic but for a month I was 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.370
 still a work stoppage 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.820
 habits rectifies turn it takes 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.870
 already want to change 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.090
 to be passionate about animals 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.740
 of course that the breeders 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.060
 breeders are there the passionate about 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.130
 animals then after there are a few small 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.220
 stuff to settle and who makes us arrive 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.660
 to have a docile flock and one gets 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.660
 pleasure to work among others
