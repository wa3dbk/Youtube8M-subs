 happens first if you try to 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.460

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:24.450

 show you another thing in three of you 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.640
 you know that windows 8.1 has brought 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:17.159
 internet explorer 11 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.910
 unfortunately as you see I have already finned 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.140
 on my 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.500
 start bar the battlelog as you see me 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.760
 notifies a new update 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.130
 unfortunately if you try to do it 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.310
 update this does not happen too 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.800
 forcing you look at it we install the blog 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.260
 download and install the plugin for 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.970
 go back to the battlelog but not this one 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.440
 it will start despite installing it 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.790
 the change and update will remain e 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.580
 as you can see it absolutely does not happen 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.770
 nothing and not having updated it 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.630
 plugin in the battlelog I do not do 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.560
 seeing the games will make the chat work 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.260
 and all the rest 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.800
 so for the moment I'm using 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.810
 I'm using it on firefox 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.150
 as you see here it works all chat 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.570
 friends everything works 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.930
 so just go back to multiplayer 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:15.900
 select our filters search well 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.630

 loading and come into play 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.800
 obviously origin must be updated 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.940
 otherwise the exits to play and for 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.270
