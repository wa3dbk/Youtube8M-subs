00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:18.000
 the group at our best 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:22.980
 Yes we did, it's a beauty, as soon as 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.310
 here with you are still just fans leaving the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.170
 playstation 4 1080p if interested 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.030
 it's not only 30 pence but guys are bringing 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.370
 this video today for you with 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 continued for some time now the pavarotti 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.969
 skype leaked here leaves you worried beauty 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.989
 well continuing with you in this series 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.770
 people have a half sad warning and a 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.379
 more or less cool, I'm canceling 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.750
 the guys this series is kind of mean 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.940
 I think it does the first time for 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 actually cancel a series, right? 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420
 I think sometimes I leave it open 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.210
 thus ending up after a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.390
 Time there but this series here guys I 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.970
 to stop her because she had dinner and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.159
 Rolling a lot to record, right? 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.460
 playing a lot of multiplayer in others 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.979
 games and feedback from this series as well 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.259
 It's very good, very bad, right? 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.470
 up because it is a series that has brought in 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.710
 youtube channel she does not give all that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.750
 graphic difference that I'm seeing 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.920
 unfortunately already those who say a quality 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.799
 very high and the file gets huge delay 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.610
 Holy crap to render it on 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.200
 process 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.020
 after editing and then people are so 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.520
 with several other series there type gt 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.700
 the online trove of own fans online 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.210
 also and other games there that I am 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.020
 bringing me as an if and want to bring to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.390
 you continue the series of east alte 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.000
 so I'm just going to change the schematics and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.829
 bring the outlet more often and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.250
 I want to start another surprise series. 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.860
 process of an old game that I played 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.530
 many years ago and a version comes out 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.870
 new the time ago also the game of 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.360
 pc also came out for consoles but I will 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.010
 play the mass pc version to 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.770
 damn and then guys here have total 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.460
 in order to play the game again in fact 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.860
 I would even play it if I did not record it 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.500
 just to finish the game, and the feedback 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.650
 really, it's very, very bad 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.110
 the channel of more than 130 thousand subscribers 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.970
 reach the 200 click on the video is that the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.440
 Shit is ugly, my nÃ© 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.330
 this has happened with some other 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.060
 only series that I'm not going to cancel 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.770
 other series because they are new series 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.730
 This is not the one I've done on playstation. 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.810
 3 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.880
 so I do not see why continuing with 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.970
 This one here is just the way it looks. 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.770
 but a cool news is that it was there 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.739
 around another I think it will come back again 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.959
 new series that will surprise but it is 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.230
 A group of old people will enjoy it. 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.260
 speaks that it is an fps or sorry style 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.380
 pretty crazy old of frantic I 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.110
 I really liked to play and that 's it. 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.459
 version so I guess it's a late year 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.680
 maybe someone will guess what I am 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.890
 talking and I did not play this version that 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.290
 I want to play with you in this version. 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.239
 use of pc and other news as well 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.780
 important thing was that I finally created the 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.430
 extension of the procon channel that it is 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.799
 piriri or app 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.610
 google chrome shows that the match 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.220
 multiplayer on earth is an application 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.260
 for you guys 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.450
 installed in the browser is your 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.519
 is warning goes out when video is 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.489
 a lot of people have already told me to do 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.530
 this application because it does not 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.830
 the videos in the box is this app 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.140
 help the guys a lot, I'll go then 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.610
 leave the link in the description that 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.090
 application and from now on 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.310
 the videos will leave the link in the description 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.060
 beauty and then if you like the channel 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.950
 want to receive all the videos and pom then 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.100
 install the application and I'm going to stop 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.410
 then unfortunately the series of the last 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.180
 of playstation 4 more multiplayer 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.099
 continues frantic because multiplayer 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.690
 pretty fuck and if you come back, you already have 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.720
 quite a gameplay 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.300
 always betting one per day 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.880
 then rural forces remain a target of 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.370
 an 'upgrade' here continues rural strength 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.530
 11 anp if it's already near the end you'll see 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.010
 a series of another game in place in the 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.240
 your lane in the morning 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.620
 so let me see that the campaign 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:54.870
 impressive relapse lie pass 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:04.860
 Recharge rains I'll keep playing 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:14.000

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:30.750

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.960
 I was following the series on 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.700

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.490
