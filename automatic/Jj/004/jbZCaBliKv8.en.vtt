everything obviously give us an idea a

everything obviously give us an idea a
little<00:00:04.740> bit<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.130> it<00:00:05.279> well<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:06.089> know<00:00:06.180> what<00:00:06.390> what

takes place with what you do to help
these<00:00:09.809> guys<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.920> I'm<00:00:11.010> guessing<00:00:11.340> girls<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.820> do

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
these guys and I'm guessing girls to do

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.289 
these guys and I'm guessing girls to do
an<00:00:12.090> increase<00:00:12.660> their<00:00:12.840> vertical<00:00:14.120> one<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
an increase their vertical one of the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.970 
an increase their vertical one of the
first<00:00:15.540> things<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.960> an<00:00:16.379> accent<00:00:16.740> need<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
first things that an accent need to

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.189 
first things that an accent need to
think<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.850> training<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.779> be<00:00:18.930> an

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
think about is that training to be an

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.480 
think about is that training to be an
explosive<00:00:19.800> athlete<00:00:20.189> it's<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
explosive athlete it's a

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.759 
explosive athlete it's a
counterintuitive<00:00:21.240> because<00:00:21.990> most<00:00:22.350> athletes

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
counterintuitive because most athletes

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.590 
counterintuitive because most athletes
go<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.430> they<00:00:23.550> run<00:00:23.730> stairs<00:00:24.180> for

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
go out there and they run stairs for

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.509 
go out there and they run stairs for
hours<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.320> drills<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.010> hours<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
hours or they do drills for hours and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.700 
hours or they do drills for hours and
afterwards<00:00:27.000> are<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.539> tired<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.289> covered<00:00:28.619> in

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
afterwards are so tired with covered in

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
afterwards are so tired with covered in
sweat<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.279> think<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.640> themselves<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
sweat and they think to themselves you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170 
sweat and they think to themselves you
know<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.529> have<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.520> made<00:00:32.700> some<00:00:32.940> games

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
know what I have to have made some games

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
know what I have to have made some games
on<00:00:33.360> my<00:00:33.450> vertical<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.170> workout<00:00:34.500> because

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
on my vertical from that workout because

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.250 
on my vertical from that workout because
it<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:35.040> killing<00:00:35.329> but<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.690> need<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.110> be

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it was killing but really you need to be

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.639 
it was killing but really you need to be
focusing<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:39.690> maximum<00:00:40.170> amount<00:00:40.410> of

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
focusing on the maximum amount of

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.380 
focusing on the maximum amount of
explosion<00:00:41.399> during<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.790> workouts<00:00:42.149> as

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
explosion during your workouts as

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.410 
explosion during your workouts as
possible<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.110> definitely<00:00:44.000> quality<00:00:45.000> over

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
possible it's definitely quality over

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
possible it's definitely quality over
quantity<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> that's<00:00:47.100> probably<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> biggest

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
quantity so that's probably the biggest

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.270 
quantity so that's probably the biggest
thing<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.940> kids<00:00:48.329> need<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> do<00:00:48.809> more<00:00:49.649> high

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
thing that kids need to do more high

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.750 
thing that kids need to do more high
intensity<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.270> less<00:00:51.539> repetitive<00:00:52.579> don't<00:00:53.579> take

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
intensity and less repetitive don't take

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.880 
intensity and less repetitive don't take
what<00:00:53.969> they're<00:00:54.120> doing<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.890> defective

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
what they're doing is a defective

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.380 
what they're doing is a defective
training<00:00:56.250> itself<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.699> jump<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.149> certain

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
training itself to jump at a certain

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
training itself to jump at a certain
height<00:00:57.989> which<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.890> their<00:00:59.100> maximum<00:00:59.550> height

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
height which is not their maximum height

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.680 
height which is not their maximum height
more<00:01:00.949> at<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> repetitive<00:01:02.609> nature's<00:01:03.480> though

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
more at a repetitive nature's though

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.420 
more at a repetitive nature's though
they're<00:01:03.899> training<00:01:04.290> more<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:04.769> an<00:01:04.949> endurance

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
they're training more like an endurance

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490 
they're training more like an endurance
athletes<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.540> they<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:06.780> an<00:01:06.869> explosive

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
athletes and they are an explosive

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.310 
athletes and they are an explosive
athlete<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.240> drills<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:09.960> guessing

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
athlete so there are drills I'm guessing

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.250 
athlete so there are drills I'm guessing
in<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.590> manual<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.729> help<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
in your manual that help with the the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.039 
in your manual that help with the the
quality<00:01:13.799> over<00:01:14.369> quantity<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.270> explosive

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
quality over quantity the more explosive

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859 
quality over quantity the more explosive
stuff<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.710> create<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> muscle<00:01:18.210> memory<00:01:18.450> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
stuff to create the muscle memory and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.130 
stuff to create the muscle memory and
increase<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> vertical<00:01:20.390> right<00:01:21.390> no<00:01:22.020> matter

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
increase the vertical right no matter

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.690 
increase the vertical right no matter
how<00:01:22.350> many<00:01:22.500> times<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.979> drill<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.369> into<00:01:23.430> an

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
how many times you drill that into an

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
how many times you drill that into an
athlete<00:01:24.030> said<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.360> always<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.140> they

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
athlete said they always think that they

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.140 
athlete said they always think that they
can<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.710> more<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.549> end<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.820> doing

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
can do more and what they end up doing

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.990 
can do more and what they end up doing
is<00:01:27.210> putting<00:01:27.540> more<00:01:27.810> ready<00:01:28.610> undermine<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is putting more ready undermine the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.810 
is putting more ready undermine the
intensity<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.689> each<00:01:30.840> repetition<00:01:31.820> because

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
intensity of each repetition because

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.719 
intensity of each repetition because
that's<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.570> eat<00:01:33.689> good<00:01:34.229> go<00:01:34.829> ahead<00:01:34.979> I'm

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that's going to eat good go ahead I'm

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.760 
that's going to eat good go ahead I'm
gonna<00:01:35.970> say<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.390> don't<00:01:36.689> keep<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.380> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
gonna say you don't keep you up if you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
gonna say you don't keep you up if you
run<00:01:37.920> 100<00:01:38.369> meter<00:01:38.579> you're<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> train

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
run 100 meter you're not going to train

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.039 
run 100 meter you're not going to train
by<00:01:40.579> running<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.670> 800<00:01:42.210> meter<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.810> mile

by running the 800 meter or the mile

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.139 
by running the 800 meter or the mile
because<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> train<00:01:44.310> them<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
because it's going to train them up to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.819 
because it's going to train them up to
do<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> different<00:01:45.570> type<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> activity<00:01:46.500> right

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
do a different type of activity right

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.700 
do a different type of activity right
just<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.869> maximum<00:01:48.869> efforts<00:01:49.290> effort

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
just as a maximum efforts effort

it's<00:01:50.920> completely<00:01:51.549> different<00:01:51.850> saying<00:01:52.119> been<00:01:52.570> a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
it's completely different saying been a

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.139 
it's completely different saying been a
submaximal<00:01:53.290> that's<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.920> vertical<00:01:54.369> jump<00:01:54.579> so

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
submaximal that's a vertical jump so

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.539 
submaximal that's a vertical jump so
kids<00:01:55.390> are<00:01:55.479> trained<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.259> jump<00:01:57.009> at<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.189> lower

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
kids are trained to jump at a lower

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.550 
kids are trained to jump at a lower
level<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.299> just<00:01:58.570> be<00:01:58.720> able<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:59.020> do<00:01:59.110> that<00:01:59.289> more

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
level and just be able to do that more

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.460 
level and just be able to do that more
amount<00:01:59.890> of<00:01:59.979> time<00:02:00.750> interesting<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.110> somebody

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
amount of time interesting and somebody

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.899 
amount of time interesting and somebody
told<00:02:02.710> me<00:02:02.799> this<00:02:02.979> maybe<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.399> can<00:02:03.520> back<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.850> up

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
told me this maybe you can back it up

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.969 
told me this maybe you can back it up

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
info on all this James somebody told me

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.910 
info on all this James somebody told me
that<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:16.360> mentioned<00:02:16.750> explosiveness<00:02:17.410> before

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
that you mentioned explosiveness before

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.729 
that you mentioned explosiveness before
that<00:02:18.910> Bo<00:02:19.120> Jackson<00:02:19.660> maybe<00:02:19.989> was<00:02:20.290> one<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
that Bo Jackson maybe was one of the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.870 
that Bo Jackson maybe was one of the
most<00:02:20.920> explosive<00:02:21.550> athletes<00:02:22.420> ever<00:02:22.959> fastest<00:02:23.920> to

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
most explosive athletes ever fastest to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.460 
most explosive athletes ever fastest to
jump<00:02:25.269> through<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.660> roof<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.110> everything

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
jump through the roof and everything

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.300 
jump through the roof and everything
because<00:02:26.970> his<00:02:27.970> explosiveness<00:02:28.870> was<00:02:29.680> off<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
because his explosiveness was off the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.580 
because his explosiveness was off the
charts<00:02:30.730> because<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> amount<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:32.319> guess

charts because of the amount of I guess
a<00:02:33.000> pressure<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.450> torque<00:02:35.349> whatever<00:02:36.099> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
a pressure or torque whatever the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.120 
a pressure or torque whatever the
correct<00:02:36.970> term<00:02:37.239> is<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.080> put<00:02:38.349> into<00:02:38.590> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
correct term is that you put into the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.190 
correct term is that you put into the
ground<00:02:39.400> you're<00:02:40.150> supposed<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.630> get<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.930> back

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
ground you're supposed to get that back

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.110 
ground you're supposed to get that back
up<00:02:41.470> out<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.040> ground<00:02:42.190> as<00:02:42.430> you're<00:02:42.940> running

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
up out of the ground as you're running

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.530 
up out of the ground as you're running
or<00:02:43.450> jumping<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.470> accurate<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:46.450> right

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
or jumping it is that accurate all right

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.390 
or jumping it is that accurate all right
that's<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> physics<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.530> vertical<00:02:48.010> jump<00:02:48.250> you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
that's the physics of vertical jump you

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.430 
that's the physics of vertical jump you
press<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.599> put<00:02:49.780> pressure<00:02:49.989> into<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
press and you put pressure into the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.140 
press and you put pressure into the
ground<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.010> forces<00:02:51.400> return<00:02:51.880> through

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
ground and that forces return through

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.720 
ground and that forces return through
your<00:02:52.269> legs<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.920> more<00:02:54.160> amount<00:02:54.430> of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
your legs and so the more amount of

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.449 
your legs and so the more amount of
force<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.870> can<00:02:55.900> place<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> ground<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
force you can place to the ground in the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.670 
force you can place to the ground in the
minimum<00:02:58.000> amount<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.420> time<00:02:58.720> is<00:02:59.350> going<00:02:59.590> to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
minimum amount of the time is going to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.740 
minimum amount of the time is going to
determine<00:02:59.829> how<00:03:00.489> explosive<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.269> movement<00:03:01.660> is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
determine how explosive the movement is

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.810 
determine how explosive the movement is
so<00:03:01.989> there<00:03:02.380> you<00:03:02.470> see<00:03:02.620> strong<00:03:02.980> people<00:03:03.400> out<00:03:03.549> there

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
so there you see strong people out there

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.759 
so there you see strong people out there
and<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.570> know<00:03:04.630> they<00:03:04.720> can<00:03:04.750> squat<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.230> thousand

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
and you know they can squat a thousand

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.130 
and you know they can squat a thousand
pounds<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.250> how<00:03:06.430> quickly<00:03:06.880> can<00:03:07.780> they<00:03:07.840> do<00:03:08.109> that

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
pounds to how quickly can they do that

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.460 
pounds to how quickly can they do that
and<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.970> person<00:03:10.329> who<00:03:10.450> has<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.720> best

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
and so it's the person who has the best

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.650 
and so it's the person who has the best
combination<00:03:11.799> of<00:03:12.400> strength<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.630> ability

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
combination of strength and the ability

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.050 
combination of strength and the ability
to<00:03:14.170> produce<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.829> strength<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.640> short

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
to produce that strength in short

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.880 
to produce that strength in short
amounts<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.390> time<00:03:16.510> that's<00:03:17.380> going<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.680> be<00:03:17.739> an

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
amounts of time that's going to be an

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.520 
amounts of time that's going to be an
explosive<00:03:18.459> athlete<00:03:18.850> so<00:03:19.239> your<00:03:19.450> program<00:03:20.019> Jacob

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
explosive athlete so your program Jacob

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.520 
explosive athlete so your program Jacob
is<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:21.130> one-dimensional<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:22.239> it

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
is it one-dimensional is it

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.550 
is it one-dimensional is it
multi-dimensional<00:03:23.880> give<00:03:24.880> us<00:03:25.000> an<00:03:25.120> idea<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.720> you

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
multi-dimensional give us an idea of you

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.460 
multi-dimensional give us an idea of you
know<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:26.920> way<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:27.730> go<00:03:28.090> about

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
know the the way you go about

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.840 
know the the way you go about
approaching<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.160> have<00:03:30.310> players<00:03:30.579> to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
approaching this to have players to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.349 
approaching this to have players to
increase<00:03:31.180> their<00:03:31.359> vertical<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.180> take<00:03:34.299> a

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
increase their vertical I like to take a

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.240 
increase their vertical I like to take a
multi-faceted<00:03:35.079> approach<00:03:35.410> because<00:03:35.980> you'd<00:03:36.130> be

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
multi-faceted approach because you'd be

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.890 
multi-faceted approach because you'd be
surprised<00:03:36.700> at<00:03:36.850> how<00:03:36.910> many<00:03:37.090> different<00:03:37.690> ways

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
surprised at how many different ways

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.740 
surprised at how many different ways
there<00:03:38.590> are<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:39.459> gain<00:03:40.030> an<00:03:40.180> advantage<00:03:40.299> on

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
there are to gain an advantage on

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.930 
there are to gain an advantage on
vertical<00:03:41.230> on<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.410> first<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.709> all<00:03:41.859> for<00:03:42.519> Malone

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
vertical on it first of all for Malone

I played in high school and a couple

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.640 
I played in high school and a couple
years<00:03:56.860> in<00:03:57.040> college<00:03:57.220> division<00:03:58.230> 31<00:03:59.230> real<00:03:59.470> good

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
years in college division 31 real good

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.310 
years in college division 31 real good

get the ball jump what do you mean by
four<00:04:04.320> well<00:04:05.320> think<00:04:05.740> about<00:04:05.800> this<00:04:06.070> are<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.280> left

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
four well think about this are you left

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.940 
four well think about this are you left
with<00:04:06.730> a<00:04:06.820> jumper<00:04:07.210> or<00:04:07.270> a<00:04:07.330> right-footed<00:04:07.690> jumper<00:04:08.080> I

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
with a jumper or a right-footed jumper I

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.760 
with a jumper or a right-footed jumper I
would<00:04:09.520> jump<00:04:09.820> higher<00:04:10.090> off<00:04:10.450> my<00:04:10.690> left<00:04:10.870> foot<00:04:11.140> if

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
would jump higher off my left foot if

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.950 
would jump higher off my left foot if
you<00:04:12.610> tried<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.880> jump<00:04:13.180> off<00:04:13.390> your<00:04:13.540> right<00:04:13.720> foot

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
you tried to jump off your right foot

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.450 
you tried to jump off your right foot
you<00:04:14.080> probably<00:04:14.410> couldn't<00:04:14.740> get<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:14.980> here<00:04:15.160> time

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
you probably couldn't get in here time

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.390 
you probably couldn't get in here time
exactly<00:04:16.350> but<00:04:17.350> your<00:04:17.470> right<00:04:17.620> foot<00:04:17.860> was<00:04:18.010> probably

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
exactly but your right foot was probably

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.290 
exactly but your right foot was probably
just<00:04:18.580> as<00:04:18.850> strong<00:04:19.180> as<00:04:19.390> your<00:04:19.540> left<00:04:19.810> foot<00:04:20.049> okay

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
just as strong as your left foot okay

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.610 
just as strong as your left foot okay
but<00:04:22.300> what's<00:04:22.570> going<00:04:22.840> on<00:04:22.960> is<00:04:23.140> you're<00:04:23.170> your

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
but what's going on is you're your

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.620 
but what's going on is you're your
ability<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.490> use<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:25.090> strength<00:04:25.450> that<00:04:25.510> you

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
ability to use the strength that you

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.900 
ability to use the strength that you
have<00:04:25.960> is<00:04:26.320> inhibited<00:04:27.190> because<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.670> don't<00:04:27.880> have

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
have is inhibited because you don't have

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.270 
have is inhibited because you don't have
proper<00:04:28.240> form<00:04:28.630> and<00:04:28.810> form<00:04:29.410> is<00:04:29.560> not<00:04:29.590> only<00:04:29.740> how<00:04:30.250> you

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
proper form and form is not only how you

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.880 
proper form and form is not only how you
jump<00:04:30.730> with<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.000> how<00:04:31.510> your<00:04:31.810> body<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.290> able<00:04:32.590> to

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
jump with it how your body is able to

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.890 
jump with it how your body is able to
use<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.280> strength<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:33.640> already<00:04:34.000> had<00:04:34.210> see

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
use the strength that already had see

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.520 
use the strength that already had see
the<00:04:35.050> more<00:04:35.290> you<00:04:35.440> do<00:04:35.770> a<00:04:36.760> certain<00:04:37.330> activity<00:04:37.600> the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
the more you do a certain activity the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.710 
the more you do a certain activity the
correct<00:04:39.010> way<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.730> more<00:04:39.910> your<00:04:40.060> body<00:04:40.270> knows<00:04:40.510> how

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
correct way the more your body knows how

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.990 
correct way the more your body knows how
to<00:04:40.780> use<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.290> power<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.920> strength<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.730> already

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
to use the power and strength it already

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.320 
to use the power and strength it already
has<00:04:43.210> during<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.810> movement<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.090> first

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
has during that movement so the first

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.330 
has during that movement so the first
thing<00:04:46.420> some<00:04:46.840> people<00:04:47.170> don't<00:04:47.320> better<00:04:47.890> jumpers

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
thing some people don't better jumpers
