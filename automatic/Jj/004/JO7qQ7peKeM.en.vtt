00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:00.587
There is something in
Your shaky voice and face

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:06.161

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:12.161
I think I'm possessed by
The strange smell on you

00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.191

00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:14.529
I think I know
what you're up to

00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:16.348

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:18.309
I tell you that
And you're surprised

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.136
Why do you go back
And forth like that

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:23.408

00:01:23.408 --> 00:01:24.182
I think I know
what you're up to

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.120

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.101
I tell you that
And you're surprised

00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:27.490

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.690
Why are you scared

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:29.328

00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:32.308
Let me go
Don't fool me

00:01:32.308 --> 00:01:32.959

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.444
Only I didn't
know something

00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:36.895

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:39.361
I really can feel it
Must be something

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.925

00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:43.658
Your clear lies
Stop it now

00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:46.295

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:50.655
Nothing, it's something
stop it~ no uh~

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:53.256

00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:56.522
The sad piano that
Cries in the cloudy sky rainbow

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:01.935

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:07.935
I think I'm possessed by
The strange smell on you

00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:09.656

00:02:09.656 --> 00:02:11.722
I think I know
what you're up to

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:12.265

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.165
I tell you that
And you're surprised

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:14.575

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:17.041
Why do you go back
And forth like that

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:18.685

00:02:18.685 --> 00:02:20.751
I think I know
what you're up to

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:21.085

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:22.734
I tell you that
And you're surprised

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:23.045

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:24.245
Why are you scared

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:25.085

00:02:25.085 --> 00:02:27.575
Let me go
Don't fool me

00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:27.825

00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:31.385
Only I didn't
know something

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:32.265

00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:34.731
I really can feel it
Must be something

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.435

00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:39.168
Your clear lies
Stop it now

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:41.715

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:46.035
Nothing, it's something
stop it~ no uh~

00:02:46.035 --> 00:02:46.736

00:02:46.736 --> 00:02:51.905
Don't try to get
My love so easily

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:52.295

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:56.355
Don't regret
The you who lie

00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:56.605

00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:58.471
And make me cry
Is until here

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:01.644

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:02.644
bye bye bye out

00:03:03.844 --> 00:03:04.204

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.924
Only I didn't
know something

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:07.443

00:03:07.443 --> 00:03:09.909
I really can feel it
Must be something

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:11.964

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:13.697
Your clear lies
Stop it now

00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:21.607

00:03:21.607 --> 00:03:24.207
Is my love funny
Are you sick of my love

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.270

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.410
I don't want to show
You my tears

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.820

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.420
Is my love funny
Are you sick of my love

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.830

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.630
Is this the end of us
Is this the end of us

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.500
