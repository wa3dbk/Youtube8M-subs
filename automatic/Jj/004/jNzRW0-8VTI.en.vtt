00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.250 
it's the and no matter that break in
there<00:00:45.850> now<00:00:46.850> that's<00:00:47.510> fun<00:00:47.780> with<00:00:47.930> like<00:00:48.020> I<00:00:48.110> said

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
there now that's fun with like I said

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.200

because it's really adds excitement to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.549 
because it's really adds excitement to
the<00:00:50.300> tune<00:00:50.480> right<00:00:50.720> off<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.050> top<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:51.380> I<00:00:51.410> think

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
the tune right off the top so I think

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.260 
the tune right off the top so I think
it's<00:00:51.649> a<00:00:51.710> great<00:00:51.860> choice<00:00:52.220> and<00:00:52.760> I<00:00:52.820> really<00:00:53.090> like

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
it's a great choice and I really like

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.060 
it's a great choice and I really like
that<00:00:53.300> little<00:00:53.570> break<00:00:53.780> he<00:00:53.870> does<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.559> let<00:00:54.950> the

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
that little break he does and let the

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.569 
that little break he does and let the
band<00:00:55.309> them<00:00:59.649> now<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.710> give<00:01:01.040> an<00:01:01.160> answer<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.489> that

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
band them now to give an answer to that

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.899 
band them now to give an answer to that
we<00:01:02.540> go<00:01:02.690> down<00:01:02.870> low<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.170> magic<00:01:04.159> four<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:04.850> that's

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
we go down low to magic four and that's

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.620 
we go down low to magic four and that's
the<00:01:05.089> lid<00:01:05.210> for<00:01:05.360> our<00:01:05.449> four<00:01:05.630> chord<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:10.670> then

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
the lid for our four chord and then

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.389 
the lid for our four chord and then
right<00:01:11.840> back<00:01:12.020> into<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.319> one<00:01:12.590> look<00:01:12.740> again<00:01:15.399> now

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
right back into that one look again now

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.010 
right back into that one look again now
I<00:01:16.429> like<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.729> for<00:01:17.119> because<00:01:17.539> it's<00:01:17.719> really

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
I like that for because it's really

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.379 
I like that for because it's really
sparse<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.649> it<00:01:19.159> lets<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.490> tune<00:01:19.670> breathe<00:01:20.029> and

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:20.389 
sparse and it lets the tune breathe and

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:22.149 
sparse and it lets the tune breathe and
it<00:01:20.899> certainly<00:01:21.139> gives<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:21.529> plenty<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.920> room<00:01:22.009> to

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
it certainly gives you plenty of room to

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.029 
it certainly gives you plenty of room to
grow<00:01:22.549> for<00:01:23.389> your<00:01:23.509> next<00:01:23.810> solo<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.709> gives<00:01:24.950> you

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
grow for your next solo it gives you

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.319 
grow for your next solo it gives you
some<00:01:25.219> sort<00:01:25.369> of<00:01:25.490> space<00:01:25.729> as<00:01:25.969> you<00:01:26.060> started

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
some sort of space as you started

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.340 
some sort of space as you started
filling<00:01:26.509> in<00:01:26.659> all<00:01:26.749> those<00:01:26.899> notes<00:01:27.139> at<00:01:27.289> the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
filling in all those notes at the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.109 
filling in all those notes at the
beginning<00:01:27.649> of<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:27.770> tune<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.670> know<00:01:28.700> you're

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
beginning of the tune you know you're

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.300 
beginning of the tune you know you're
kind<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.329> left<00:01:29.659> not<00:01:30.380> having<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:30.709> lot<00:01:30.829> of<00:01:30.859> place

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
kind of left not having a lot of place

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.879 
kind of left not having a lot of place
to<00:01:31.340> go<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:31.819> after<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.409> now<00:01:33.409> for<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.679> five

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.319 
to go so after that now for the five
it's<00:01:34.130> pretty<00:01:34.399> simple<00:01:34.729> he<00:01:34.819> just<00:01:34.969> goes<00:01:35.090> up<00:01:35.240> to

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
it's pretty simple he just goes up to

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.739 
it's pretty simple he just goes up to
the<00:01:35.389> b7<00:01:35.929> and<00:01:36.049> this<00:01:36.859> is<00:01:36.950> Magic<00:01:37.340> five<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:38.630> then
