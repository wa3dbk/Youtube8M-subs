 architects architects and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.670
 constructors of the architects 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.889
 architects and built comfrey 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.330
 architects architects and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.890
 builders 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.710
 I am Nicolas Guillot I am 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.140
 architects architects and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 builders 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.619
 we work for many 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.050
 luxury brands for years and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.680
 also for private homes of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.060
 their leaders 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.599
 in fact we do a lot of apartments 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.599
 high-end 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.720
 when we prepared this contest there we 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.820
 had maybe a month to do it and 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.739
 we spent fifteen days writing 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.150
 words to brainstorming reflections 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.100
 on the marketing part 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.420
 it's one of the top brands 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.520
 luggage storage 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.570
 What makes that we will be making 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.060
 the suitcases had to make them dream 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.460
 these products had to be 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.080
 presented exclusively 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.210
 they had to be shown as 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.040
 sculptures as unique products 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.400
 for it to become products of 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.740
 luxury 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.460
 so we chose to frame them 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.810
 as works of art but 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.630
 it also had to be able to 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.490
 time evolved using the same frame 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.560
 that is, we have a fake that is 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.390
 him a strong image of travel that can 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.550
 change according to the times and then 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.260
 also by going lockers that takes off 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.670
 and then that they have but replaced by 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.970
 other 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.920
 other lockers so other products 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.420
 this extremely lightweight honeycomb and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.360
 we have developed with manufacturers 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.200
 in order to have the vendors who 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.910
 can disassemble wall niches without 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.790
 the help of professionals is very very 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 light we did not want to create a 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.190
 movement atmosphere so two mothers 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.750
 we have a little bit of this idea of 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.170
 things that move so we have all these 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.450
 niches that are never really anything to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.100
 does align this and it evolves but also 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.130
 in the furniture on which we are going 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.870
 present on the ground suitcases or bags 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.670
 who are always at heights 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.290
 different that allow to give a 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.030
 motion picture so of travel one has 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.010
 wanted to play with light there is a 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.720
 french artist called pierre 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.000
 relieves who did tables all 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.350
 black specifically with lights 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.480
 in that is to say that when we pass 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.430
 in front of the table, a lot of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.150
 things and so we chose materials 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.860
 who plays with light and while 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.170
 being black or white since the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.630
 shop the white and black and so 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.700
 reflects and evolves 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.270
 when we go past we have a kind of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.270
 vibration 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.659
 one of the other elements that we advocated 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.840
 so this is the material that is a 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.879
 truck tire recycling which is re 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.190
 assemble and that was used for 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.440
 floor and for the top of the counters 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.540
 crates we get the impression that this 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.560
 vast room you are so with the concept 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.420
 the concept of travel and peaks 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.599
 the impression that it is a road wherever 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.579
 it's a huge airport runway 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.319
 advantage also is that it costs 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.290
 absolutely nothing at all we give it 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.940
 it was so very cheap 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.410
 ecological because we recover 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.069
 materials that instead of finishing in the 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.349
 nature are have a new life in 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.379
 entering the shop with our 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.930
 materials and its movements there is a 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.560
 real vibrations that skies secret and that 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.420
 given 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.700
 something is happening that makes you want 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.700
 to buy it makes you want to travel 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.990
 right here
