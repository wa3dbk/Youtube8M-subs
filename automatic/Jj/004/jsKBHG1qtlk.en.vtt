00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
however within this system within this

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.209 
however within this system within this
range<00:00:43.000> they're<00:00:43.719> making<00:00:44.109> lenses<00:00:44.469> specifically

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
range they're making lenses specifically

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.270 
range they're making lenses specifically
for<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:45.760> GM<00:00:46.239> series<00:00:46.899> that<00:00:47.440> preserve<00:00:48.249> the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
for the GM series that preserve the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.819 
for the GM series that preserve the
style<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.120> compactness<00:00:49.660> of<00:00:49.929> this<00:00:50.109> GM<00:00:50.530> line

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
style and compactness of this GM line

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.229 
style and compactness of this GM line
making<00:00:51.760> for<00:00:51.999> a<00:00:52.030> very<00:00:52.300> miniature<00:00:52.719> kit

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.819 

so<00:00:58.239> essentially<00:00:58.720> you<00:00:59.110> could<00:00:59.230> have<00:00:59.440> with<00:00:59.620> you

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
so essentially you could have with you

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.100 
so essentially you could have with you
as<00:00:59.980> standard<00:01:00.579> zoom<00:01:00.760> lens<00:01:01.060> and<00:01:01.360> medium

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
as standard zoom lens and medium

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.219 
as standard zoom lens and medium
telephoto<00:01:02.470> lens<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.479> also<00:01:04.479> a<00:01:04.510> fast<00:01:04.870> prime

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
telephoto lens and also a fast prime

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.680 
telephoto lens and also a fast prime
lens<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:05.800> that<00:01:06.490> would<00:01:06.610> fit<00:01:06.910> in<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.180> very<00:01:07.510> very

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
lens and that would fit in a very very

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.219 
lens and that would fit in a very very
small<00:01:08.080> compact<00:01:08.530> bag<00:01:09.100> or<00:01:09.640> even<00:01:09.700> using<00:01:10.600> only<00:01:10.990> the

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
small compact bag or even using only the

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.530 
small compact bag or even using only the
pockets<00:01:11.650> in<00:01:11.800> your<00:01:11.860> jacket<00:01:12.340> it's<00:01:13.210> just<00:01:13.450> a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
pockets in your jacket it's just a

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.270 
pockets in your jacket it's just a
fraction<00:01:14.050> of<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.350> size<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.830> weight<00:01:14.979> of<00:01:15.010> a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
fraction of the size and weight of a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.660 
fraction of the size and weight of a
comparable<00:01:15.790> DSLR<00:01:16.570> system

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.100 

so<00:01:22.670> let's<00:01:22.820> have<00:01:22.939> a<00:01:23.000> closer<00:01:23.330> look<00:01:23.540> at<00:01:23.900> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
so let's have a closer look at the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.460 
so let's have a closer look at the
lenses<00:01:24.530> designed<00:01:24.979> for<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.430> GM<00:01:25.729> series<00:01:26.470> when

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
lenses designed for the GM series when

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.590 
lenses designed for the GM series when
you<00:01:27.650> purchase<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.189> GM<00:01:28.460> v<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:29.240> will<00:01:29.450> actually

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
you purchase a GM v it will actually

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.289 
you purchase a GM v it will actually
come<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.530> 12<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.979> 32<00:01:31.310> millimeter<00:01:32.000> lens

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
come with the 12 to 32 millimeter lens

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.570 
come with the 12 to 32 millimeter lens
that<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.750> see<00:01:32.960> here<00:01:33.380> it's<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:34.009> compact<00:01:34.430> and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
that you see here it's a compact and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.429 
that you see here it's a compact and
retractable<00:01:35.119> design<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:35.899> it<00:01:35.960> gets<00:01:36.140> really

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
retractable design so it gets really

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.649 
retractable design so it gets really
small<00:01:36.710> when<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.070> pop<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.340> out<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:38.270> focal

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
small when you pop it out the focal

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.889 
small when you pop it out the focal
length<00:01:38.690> goes<00:01:39.140> from<00:01:39.380> 12<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.979> 32<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.390> 24

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
length goes from 12 to 32 which is a 24

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.590 
length goes from 12 to 32 which is a 24
to<00:01:42.020> 64<00:01:42.619> in<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:42.920> old<00:01:43.100> speak<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:44.210> it's<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.450> nice

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
to 64 in the old speak so it's a nice

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.480 
to 64 in the old speak so it's a nice
wide<00:01:44.990> angle<00:01:45.020> great<00:01:45.770> for<00:01:45.950> capturing<00:01:46.310> in

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
wide angle great for capturing in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.539 
wide angle great for capturing in
buildings<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.180> streetscapes<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.649> 64

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
buildings and streetscapes and the 64

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.550 
buildings and streetscapes and the 64
millimeter<00:01:50.119> end<00:01:50.270> of<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.539> is<00:01:50.690> also<00:01:51.320> quite

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
millimeter end of it is also quite

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.080 
millimeter end of it is also quite
useful<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.670> lens<00:01:52.909> you'll

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
useful so this is the lens you'll

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.149 
useful so this is the lens you'll
probably<00:01:53.330> use<00:01:53.539> majority<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.679> time<00:01:54.920> on

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
probably use majority of the time on

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.260 
probably use majority of the time on
your<00:01:55.460> camera<00:01:56.080> then<00:01:57.080> we<00:01:57.289> have<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:58.069> 35<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.789> 100

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
your camera then we have the 35 to 100

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.499 
your camera then we have the 35 to 100
millimeter<00:01:59.690> so<00:01:59.990> this<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.380> 70<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.979> 200<00:02:01.509> in

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
millimeter so this is a 70 to 200 in

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.930 
millimeter so this is a 70 to 200 in
terms<00:02:02.840> of<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.200> old<00:02:03.350> speak<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.580> is<00:02:04.700> great

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
terms of the old speak so this is great

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.760 
terms of the old speak so this is great
for<00:02:04.970> isolating<00:02:05.690> subjects<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.350> distance

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
for isolating subjects in the distance

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.500 
for isolating subjects in the distance
or<00:02:06.950> forgetting<00:02:07.729> some<00:02:07.940> portrait<00:02:08.450> style<00:02:08.690> shots

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
or forgetting some portrait style shots

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.690 
or forgetting some portrait style shots
we<00:02:11.510> also<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.959> here<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.319> 15<00:02:12.739> millimeter<00:02:12.980> F<00:02:13.430> 1

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
we also have here the 15 millimeter F 1

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.720 
we also have here the 15 millimeter F 1
point<00:02:13.940> 7<00:02:14.239> Leica<00:02:14.989> lens<00:02:15.380> this<00:02:16.010> one<00:02:16.280> here<00:02:16.610> is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
point 7 Leica lens this one here is

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.240
