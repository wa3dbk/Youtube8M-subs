on<00:00:17.820> earth<00:00:18.090> are<00:00:18.360> we<00:00:18.450> doing<00:00:18.720> out<00:00:18.870> fishing<00:00:19.260> in

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
on earth are we doing out fishing in

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.800 
on earth are we doing out fishing in
these<00:00:20.430> conditions<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.210> freezing<00:00:21.780> cold

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
these conditions it's freezing cold

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.930 
these conditions it's freezing cold
there's<00:00:22.560> actually<00:00:22.830> freezing<00:00:23.310> fog<00:00:23.580> and

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 
there's actually freezing fog and

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.250 
there's actually freezing fog and
overnight<00:00:24.210> temperatures<00:00:24.690> have<00:00:24.810> been<00:00:24.840> down<00:00:25.110> to

overnight temperatures have been down to
about<00:00:25.410> minus<00:00:25.470> 4<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:27.330> water<00:00:27.540> isn't<00:00:27.780> frozen<00:00:28.160> so

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
about minus 4 the water isn't frozen so

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.569 
about minus 4 the water isn't frozen so
we<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.370> still<00:00:29.550> get<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.730> rig<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:31.309> but<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.460> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
we can still get a rig in but what is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.799 
we can still get a rig in but what is
tougher<00:00:32.879> this<00:00:32.969> time<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.329> year<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> actually

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
tougher this time of year is actually

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.400 
tougher this time of year is actually
getting<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> bite<00:00:35.329> now<00:00:36.329> I'll<00:00:36.690> fish<00:00:36.960> these<00:00:37.170> big

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
getting a bite now I'll fish these big

reservoir<00:00:37.740> waters<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.280> many<00:00:38.430> years<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:40.110> I've

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
reservoir waters for many years and I've

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.479 
reservoir waters for many years and I've
often<00:00:40.410> found<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> method<00:00:41.280> feeder

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
often found that a method feeder

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.340 
often found that a method feeder
approach<00:00:41.880> is<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> best<00:00:43.140> ways<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
approach is one of the best ways to

is<00:00:53.220> nice<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.000> hopefully<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> carp<00:00:54.720> will

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
is nice and hopefully the carp will

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.170 
is nice and hopefully the carp will

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
that what we're doing is actually

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.920 
that what we're doing is actually
working<00:01:35.970> no<00:01:36.970> smoke<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:37.540> mirrors<00:01:37.780> here

working no smoke and mirrors here

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.190 
working no smoke and mirrors here
certainly<00:01:40.930> lively<00:01:41.940> so<00:01:42.940> there<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.149> go<00:01:43.180> just<00:01:43.540> see

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.790 
realistic 4-inch hook length nothing out
of<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.880> ordinary<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:53.259> let's<00:01:53.380> have<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.590> look<00:01:53.619> at

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
of the ordinary but let's have a look at

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.960 
of the ordinary but let's have a look at
the<00:01:53.890> baked<00:01:54.040> is<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.490> something<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.880> little

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
the baked is that is something a little

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:04.130 
the baked is that is something a little
bit<00:01:55.210> special<00:01:55.560> put<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.679> one<00:01:56.890> in<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.070> key<00:01:57.190> net

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.169 

so<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.179> simple<00:02:07.539> setup<00:02:07.800> but<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
so it's a simple setup but this is the

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.430 
so it's a simple setup but this is the
real<00:02:10.330> crux<00:02:10.570> what<00:02:10.840> we're<00:02:10.959> doing<00:02:11.200> see<00:02:11.380> how

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
real crux what we're doing see how

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.710 
real crux what we're doing see how
visual<00:02:11.769> that<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:13.590> no<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.769> is<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.190> solar<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
visual that is no that is a solar the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.220 
visual that is no that is a solar the
secret<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.350> actually<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.739> fruit<00:02:18.010> blend<00:02:19.230> frozen

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
secret is actually a fruit blend frozen

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.140 
secret is actually a fruit blend frozen
boilie<00:02:20.580> now<00:02:21.580> what<00:02:21.760> I've<00:02:21.850> done<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.120> just

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
boilie now what I've done is just

chromed it up in a nut grounder and it
goes<00:02:24.640> around<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.940> feed<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.150> perfect<00:02:25.750> so
