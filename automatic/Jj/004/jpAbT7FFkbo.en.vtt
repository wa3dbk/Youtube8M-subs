00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.840
 the jobless rate is close today you talk is beyond it 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.260
 but what is it that the successor of the 3g and 3gs and so of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:07.770
 after 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.869
 so he would have taken note of the phone so the capcir 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.419
 on my right the 3g on my left so to show you a little near all 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.230
 the differences so in terms of the size of a product substantially 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.589
 identical in screen size itself% in terms 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.480
 of congestion so on the same thing the screen to the same thing 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.510
 the only big difference is that the cac was more square than the same 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.150
 project 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.399
 so we see 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.649
 the the same 3g rounded rear surface while the case of him 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.390
 it's really scary 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.990
 the difference between the two products ended since Cajun dishes 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.979
 disgrace their report on the interface between the court since 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.969
 we will be able to which I changed the screen before I can 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.870
 use video telephony we will be able to redo directories finally 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 we also see 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.310
 6% a lot of things have filtered 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.400
 so I show you that the basic features so we have 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.580
 always the settings menu 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.670
 this is the act 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.100
 we can change the wallpaper 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.560
 it's a screen at least I missed his screen so we die higher 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 that the condoms that the wallpapers of August 4th they make big groups 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.079
 JuppÃ© phone itself 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.749
 so our selection no longer recognize in correspondence of 

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.100
 chains 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.790
 and ultimately 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.040
 and believe that we can put on the lock screen the home screen 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.960
 me my tours of size 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.830
 so I implemented a little stone 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 and here we are a little whole microcosm 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.550
 more than eight months polling oppo also emit a picture shows phelps has not 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.340
 all over 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.460
 following the side of the troops in Cairo for directories so that as the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.640
 gabon the utility astronauts 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.820
 in the utility that allows us to store see for this balloon does roll 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.539
 that all be 4 me 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.539
 we can do that very easy with any phone to make 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.069
 four rounds alan the tile to be applied until the blow of 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.209
 inch he's no longer the icon on the second icon not he's back 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.910
 we even find if we wish 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.760
 for me the priority 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.610
 when we finish 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.080
 error just so there we just created a subdirectory that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.829
 is called ps that until then 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.919
 we can change the world without any problem anymore and remove it 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.599
 we make him a rugby critic 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.379
 while we want it 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.450
 not yet 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.529
 one again 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.839
 a strong act that he 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.229
 the subdirectory 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.239
 it has so far very simply 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.539
 and what are we doing differently for someone and we have seen 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:33.909
 video telephony 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.310
 finally the videophone lawyer talks to me so it's very simple 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.299
 for that right next door everything is said so far 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.579
 who has it gone from a motel and new phone 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.639
 so the camera mod but the driver can no longer titrated simply 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.169
 not necessarily showing me I have nothing to do as a highlight 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.810
 so when we go into the middle mode much more to the foot the photo sensor 5 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.270
 mpixels kneel it changes a little bit an autofocus to 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.519
 at 6 pm Sunday 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.560
 if not for the rest it is substantially the same product as in others 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.240
 actually we leave a little more 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.309
 CHF 8 million 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:12.349
 it is at the level of use for now I did not want a world 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.259
 of difference 

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:17.559
 all close contacts i'm going to do that sugar with 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:19.280
 1 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.669
 a camera but with a phone 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.479
 in the paddocks 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.669
 underneath with a swelling effect 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.349
 so it's very simple 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.930
 then among the quotes that 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.160
 multitasking is a double double tap on the shoulder and for once all 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.969
 the tasks that are active below so we will close but in any case not 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.039
 on the water but not all active tasks 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:43.189
 for those who allow you to reckon no 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.899
 the pro b software 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:50.169
 so it's very strong so we can close 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.669
 on the other hand I do not know how you do not buy or simply noted 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:55.449
 amount on it 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:56.330
 in fact 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.389
 no entry 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.939
 to kill the task to the West Indians so that frees up memory for this 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.219
 who is very nice approached in touch in the morning and so here 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.129
 really multitasking so we'll throw two three things there then 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.309
 so pressing a button can produce a classic and a bit like 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:13.079
 on the old 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.979
 it puts in touch a little more 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.309
 decryption 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.400
 free time for it to move 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.639
 cransac end of the month 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.819
 we listened to product subsidies for a product that is rather pretty 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.080
 actually well finished we encountered several problems at the level of 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.199
 the network stop 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.509
 for right-handed people typret their phone in the left hand 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.479
 attention also of the crisis so here we put it in the palm of the hand to 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.680
 some borrowers the network very easily you see there I already 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.840
 not many networks 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.900
 even better than the risk of losing the network very quickly 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.090
 it's a trick to know how to count on the lands of moubarak 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.270
 so for 100 euros before the point of not holding long since 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.969
 actually you will lose your priests very easily 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.339
 what else to say in this tournament we kept a rather sober design with 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.620
 gold buttons this monday this time rather square 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.830
 for the next button it was precisely 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.199
 we kept our job 3 against 5 me cost-peyre which obliges all the eu 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.770
 and then nothing else if the sim card alone and on the right side in view of the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.669
 above 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.239
 we keep the connection rate we two stereo speakers for the iphone 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.930
 as much as I think I quickly went around the canvas the other 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.010
 the heads were opposed like his father enormously for me I was passing 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.460
 under the elbow on twitter which seems to me more important 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.699
 So it's up to you to make your choice at iphone 3g android nokia ovi 

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:37.439
 good luck in the press and then pakistan
