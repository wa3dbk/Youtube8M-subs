click on the link if you need to make

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.080 
click on the link if you need to make
the<00:00:29.169> ice<00:00:29.290> staff<00:00:29.649> once<00:00:30.369> you<00:00:30.520> have<00:00:30.700> the<00:00:30.910> ice

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
the ice staff once you have the ice

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.360 
the ice staff once you have the ice
staff<00:00:31.419> then<00:00:31.869> you<00:00:32.079> go<00:00:32.230> into<00:00:32.559> the<00:00:32.680> crazy<00:00:32.980> place

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
staff then you go into the crazy place

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.299 
staff then you go into the crazy place
and<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:33.910> have<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.239> solve<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.720> riddle<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:36.160> go

have<00:00:42.490> to<00:00:42.550> shoot<00:00:42.970> with<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.600> ice<00:00:43.780> staff<00:00:44.170> and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
have to shoot with the ice staff and

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.040 
have to shoot with the ice staff and
you'll<00:00:45.040> see<00:00:45.310> your<00:00:45.520> code<00:00:45.820> right<00:00:46.570> there<00:00:46.630> on<00:00:47.020> your

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
wall in the code that's on the wall is

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.980 
wall in the code that's on the wall is
gonna<00:00:50.380> match<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:51.130> what<00:00:51.490> ice<00:00:52.030> lab<00:00:52.450> you<00:00:52.720> have<00:00:52.840> to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
gonna match to what ice lab you have to

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.220 
gonna match to what ice lab you have to
hit<00:00:53.200> up<00:00:53.500> on<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.430> ceiling<00:00:54.880> area<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.750> I'm<00:00:56.079> going

hit up on the ceiling area and I'm going

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.660 
hit up on the ceiling area and I'm going
to<00:00:56.260> go<00:00:56.380> ahead<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.740> put<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.070> code<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:57.550> the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
to go ahead and put the code on the

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.880 
to go ahead and put the code on the
screen<00:00:57.970> for<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.420> right<00:00:58.630> now<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:59.170> I<00:00:59.590> did

screen for you right now and I did

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.580 
screen for you right now and I did
personally<00:01:00.220> make<00:01:01.060> this<00:01:01.300> code<00:01:01.570> myself<00:01:02.170> so<00:01:02.530> you

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
personally make this code myself so you

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.009 
personally make this code myself so you
won't<00:01:02.920> find<00:01:03.160> this<00:01:03.340> code<00:01:03.579> anywhere<00:01:04.570> else<00:01:04.750> on

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
won't find this code anywhere else on

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
things you need to do in called your

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.469 
things you need to do in called your
design<00:01:17.440> base<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.070> how<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.430> works<00:01:18.490> is<00:01:19.000> you

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
design base so how this works is you

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.480 
design base so how this works is you
take<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.750> look<00:01:20.020> at<00:01:20.260> your<00:01:20.470> code<00:01:20.710> that's<00:01:21.070> over<00:01:21.370> on

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
take a look at your code that's over on

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.390 
take a look at your code that's over on
the<00:01:21.640> wall<00:01:21.880> you'll<00:01:22.540> see<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.020> dots<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.830> right

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
the wall you'll see the dots and right

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.969 
the wall you'll see the dots and right
here<00:01:24.580> for<00:01:24.820> example<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.600> see<00:01:25.750> three<00:01:26.440> dots<00:01:26.740> in

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
here for example you see three dots in

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.670 
here for example you see three dots in
the<00:01:27.130> shape<00:01:27.400> of<00:01:27.760> a<00:01:27.880> triangle<00:01:28.180> so<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.020> go<00:01:29.530> back

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
the shape of a triangle so you go back

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.950 
the shape of a triangle so you go back
to<00:01:29.920> the<00:01:30.100> video<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.909> code<00:01:31.150> that<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.450> provided

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
to the video the code that I provided

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.380 
to the video the code that I provided
for<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:33.340> see<00:01:33.549> on<00:01:33.700> there<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.120> three

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
for you and you see on there the three

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.380 
for you and you see on there the three
triangles<00:01:35.080> in<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.070> code<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:37.030> code<00:01:37.360> right

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
triangles in the code that code right

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.149 
triangles in the code that code right
there<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:38.200> what<00:01:38.530> you're<00:01:38.650> going<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.830> have<00:01:39.010> to

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
there is what you're going to have to

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.640 
there is what you're going to have to
shoot<00:01:39.460> with<00:01:40.180> your<00:01:40.390> ice<00:01:40.540> staff<00:01:40.869> if<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.440> have

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
shoot with your ice staff if you have

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.469 
shoot with your ice staff if you have
somebody<00:01:41.920> else<00:01:42.100> watching<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> zombies<00:01:43.240> while

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
somebody else watching the zombies while

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.090 
somebody else watching the zombies while
you<00:01:43.720> do<00:01:43.840> this<00:01:43.960> process<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.680> helps<00:01:44.950> out<00:01:45.070> so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
you do this process that helps out so

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.430 
you do this process that helps out so
much<00:01:45.580> or<00:01:46.030> if<00:01:46.420> you're<00:01:46.540> by<00:01:46.690> yourself<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.350> you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
much or if you're by yourself and you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.109 
much or if you're by yourself and you
get<00:01:47.560> zombie<00:01:48.070> blood<00:01:48.340> makes<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.880> lot<00:01:49.060> easier

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
get zombie blood makes it a lot easier

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.990 
get zombie blood makes it a lot easier
for<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.960> but<00:01:50.440> you<00:01:50.619> find<00:01:50.890> your<00:01:51.070> code<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.700> shoot

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
for you but you find your code you shoot

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.270 
for you but you find your code you shoot
it<00:01:52.150> with<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.299> ice<00:01:52.570> staff<00:01:52.900> it'll<00:01:53.619> turn<00:01:53.830> over

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
it with the ice staff it'll turn over

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.370 
it with the ice staff it'll turn over
and<00:01:54.580> then<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.000> go<00:01:55.119> check<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.780> see<00:01:56.049> what<00:01:56.229> your

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
and then you go check and see what your

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.320 
and then you go check and see what your
next<00:01:56.619> code<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:56.979> going<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.220> be<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.150> just

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
next code is going to be so you just

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.030 
next code is going to be so you just
keep<00:01:58.510> doing<00:01:58.720> this<00:01:59.020> until<00:01:59.260> all<00:01:59.590> your<00:01:59.710> stones

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
keep doing this until all your stones

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.370 
keep doing this until all your stones
are<00:02:00.430> completely<00:02:01.000> flipped<00:02:01.299> over<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.960> then

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
are completely flipped over and then

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.679 
are completely flipped over and then
you'll<00:02:02.560> hear<00:02:02.799> Samantha<00:02:03.430> start<00:02:04.000> talking<00:02:04.509> and

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
you'll hear Samantha start talking and

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.050 
you'll hear Samantha start talking and
you<00:02:04.750> know<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.470> are<00:02:05.740> done<00:02:06.130> with<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.460> step<00:02:06.820> is

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
you know you are done with that step is

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.660 
you know you are done with that step is
you<00:02:07.150> can<00:02:07.330> move<00:02:07.479> on<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.930> next<00:02:08.229> step<00:02:08.560> now<00:02:09.369> for

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
you can move on to the next step now for

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.250 
you can move on to the next step now for
the<00:02:09.759> next<00:02:09.970> step<00:02:10.330> there<00:02:10.599> will<00:02:10.810> be<00:02:10.840> three

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
the next step there will be three

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.289 
the next step there will be three
tombstones<00:02:11.890> around<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.489> map<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.150> have

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
tombstones around the map that you have

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.229 
tombstones around the map that you have
to<00:02:13.450> shoot<00:02:13.780> with<00:02:14.530> your<00:02:14.799> ice<00:02:14.950> staff<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
to shoot with your ice staff and the

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.709 
to shoot with your ice staff and the
first<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:17.109> right<00:02:17.409> over<00:02:17.709> by<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:18.719 
first one is right over by the

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.640 
first one is right over by the
excavation<00:02:19.719> site<00:02:20.129> make<00:02:21.129> sure<00:02:21.159> that

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
excavation site make sure that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.500 
excavation site make sure that
is<00:02:21.709> stepped<00:02:22.129> on<00:02:22.310> by<00:02:22.489> giant<00:02:22.939> robots<00:02:23.299> here<00:02:23.659> and

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
is stepped on by giant robots here and

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.330 
is stepped on by giant robots here and
you'll<00:02:26.510> see<00:02:26.599> these<00:02:26.900> tombstones<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.920> hit<00:02:28.159> them

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
you'll see these tombstones you hit them

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.030 
you'll see these tombstones you hit them
with<00:02:28.549> your<00:02:28.909> eyes<00:02:29.030> staff<00:02:29.590> then<00:02:30.590> they'll<00:02:30.739> freeze

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
with your eyes staff then they'll freeze

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.550 
with your eyes staff then they'll freeze
up<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.519> switch<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.000> other<00:02:32.120> weapon<00:02:32.629> and<00:02:33.049> shoot

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
up you switch the other weapon and shoot

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.890 
up you switch the other weapon and shoot
it<00:02:33.769> now<00:02:34.610> what's<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.030> first<00:02:35.269> one<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.840> said

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
it now what's the first one like I said

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.349 
it now what's the first one like I said
it's<00:02:36.140> over<00:02:36.260> by<00:02:36.379> excavation<00:02:37.040> site<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.909> second

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
it's over by excavation site the second

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.300 
it's over by excavation site the second
one<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.079> other<00:02:39.170> side<00:02:39.439> of<00:02:39.620> jug<00:02:39.890> where

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
one is on the other side of jug where

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.030 
one is on the other side of jug where
you<00:02:40.400> buy<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.609> mp40<00:02:41.299> where<00:02:42.290> they're<00:02:42.470> shoot<00:02:42.950> it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
you buy the mp40 where they're shoot it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.089 
you buy the mp40 where they're shoot it
with<00:02:43.189> the<00:02:43.310> ice<00:02:43.430> f<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:44.180> freezes<00:02:44.720> up<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.170> shoot

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
with the ice f it freezes up and shoot

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.539 
with the ice f it freezes up and shoot
it<00:02:46.220> with<00:02:46.340> your<00:02:46.519> other<00:02:46.640> weapon<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:49.069> busts

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
it with your other weapon and it busts

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.300 
it with your other weapon and it busts
and<00:02:49.700> shatters<00:02:50.319> there's<00:02:51.319> one<00:02:51.709> more<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.670 
and shatters there's one more and the
third<00:02:52.579> one<00:02:52.849> is<00:02:53.180> over<00:02:54.079> by<00:02:54.639> generator<00:02:55.639> to<00:02:56.680> where

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
third one is over by generator to where

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.509 
third one is over by generator to where
the<00:02:58.040> tank

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
the tank

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.460 
the tank
station<00:02:59.239> is<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.629> the<00:02:59.659> other<00:02:59.840> side<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.230> tank

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
station is on the other side of the tank

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.479 
station is on the other side of the tank
station<00:03:00.980> go<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.849> generator<00:03:02.599> number<00:03:02.989> two<00:03:03.489> go

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
other side of the tank station you see a

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.379 
other side of the tank station you see a
giant<00:03:11.480> robot<00:03:12.049> hand<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.859> that's<00:03:13.730> kind<00:03:14.060> of<00:03:14.180> your

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
giant robot hand and that's kind of your

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.179 
giant robot hand and that's kind of your
your<00:03:14.720> sign<00:03:15.079> where<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.709> look<00:03:15.889> for<00:03:16.099> the

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
your sign where to look for the

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.640 
your sign where to look for the
tombstone<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.060> you'll<00:03:17.750> see<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.049> tombstone

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
tombstone and you'll see the tombstone

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.869 
tombstone and you'll see the tombstone
right<00:03:19.010> there<00:03:19.450> shoot<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.599> with<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.900> ice<00:03:21.049> staff

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
right there shoot it with the ice staff

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.309 
right there shoot it with the ice staff
switched<00:03:22.879> your<00:03:23.060> other<00:03:23.209> weapon<00:03:23.720> shoot<00:03:24.170> it

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
switched your other weapon shoot it

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.789 
switched your other weapon shoot it
again<00:03:24.379> break<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:26.329> of<00:03:27.169> course<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.650> like

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
again break it and of course just like

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.039 
again break it and of course just like
all<00:03:27.980> step<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.489> here<00:03:28.699> Samantha<00:03:29.090> say<00:03:29.510> something

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
all step so here Samantha say something

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.500 
all step so here Samantha say something
and<00:03:30.290> then<00:03:30.919> you're<00:03:31.160> ready<00:03:31.459> for<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.910> next<00:03:32.150> step

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
and then you're ready for the next step

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.869 
and then you're ready for the next step
now<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.530> complete<00:03:33.949> the<00:03:33.980> next<00:03:34.430> step<00:03:34.639> you<00:03:34.849> have

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
now to complete the next step you have

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.720 
now to complete the next step you have
to<00:03:35.030> go<00:03:35.239> back<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.870> excavation<00:03:36.560> site<00:03:36.590> go<00:03:37.549> all

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
to go back to the excavation site go all

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.240 
to go back to the excavation site go all
the<00:03:37.819> way<00:03:37.879> downstairs<00:03:38.349> go<00:03:39.349> all<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.650> way<00:03:39.769> down

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
the way downstairs go all the way down

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.879 
the way downstairs go all the way down
the<00:03:40.489> spiral<00:03:40.879> staircase<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:42.620> have<00:03:42.739> to

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
the spiral staircase and you have to

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.420 
the spiral staircase and you have to
line<00:03:43.129> up<00:03:43.370> for<00:03:43.639> disk<00:03:44.440> with<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.470> gym<00:03:45.919> to<00:03:46.220> your

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
line up for disk with the gym to your

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.309 
line up for disk with the gym to your
correct<00:03:46.790> color<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.690> you're<00:03:47.840> doing<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.169> ice

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
correct color so you're doing the ice
