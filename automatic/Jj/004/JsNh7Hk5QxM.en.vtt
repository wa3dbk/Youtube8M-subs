00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.330
 renault alpine 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.200
 when I was 17 years old 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.070
 my father gives me a renault 8 in the 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.439
 71 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.590
 to go to school to go to the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.590
 college 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.270
 back then these cars all the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.790
 brand renault had in mexico 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.470
 practically then the model renault 8 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.560
 Reindeer model 10 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.740
 there was already this car the pink end that 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.570
 it was the crown of the land all the 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.260
 final pins started maker here the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.600
 vallejo 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.969
 a very small plant and then we 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.089
 they took to the second city in pachuca 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.089
 gentleman 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.300
 like the caribbean 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.560
 but 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.010
 I want to tell you now about the story 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.820
 of this car 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:41.180
 I currently have him 14 years old 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.900
 how I got the good car was 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.810
 just because a friend of mine 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.270
 he and I have many to know each other and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.700
 Our vision for this brand them 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.880
 We decided to see how to buy what 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.300
 we make a car and finally we 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:05.310
 We took on the task of looking for different 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.550
 clubs in different healy newspapers and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.959
 for me it was an interesting station 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.630
 because I found it via newspaper this is 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.810
 an announcement I went to see down the street 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.480
 tlalpan 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.080
 and the car was very very 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.510
 original 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.160
 it was in an original state quite 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.160
 pretty good the car 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.880
 where obviously the tank is the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.950
 gas tank and where is the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.480
 small casserole where practically what 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.080
 The only thing that fits is the rim of the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.080
 repair 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.210
 but never 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.850
 these cars in this particular is 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:10.130
 a model 71 in Mexico came out from the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.080
 year 65 the 65 until the year 71 72 and with 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.870
 those commented because they were manufactured from 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.130
 very manual way they came out with two headlights 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.620
 from 70 and final 71 and 72 up 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.620
 74 and they came out with four headlights 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.890
 something something interesting about these cars is 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:44.410
 the theme of the wheels for example the 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.230
 wheels we say are 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.080
 they are not the originals but they are a 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.770
 exact replica in mexico or left until 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:58.510
 the 2300 that is you are seeing 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:02.230
 right here in france there was a motor of 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.510
 1,600 cubic centimeters that were the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.510
 prepared for the race 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.630
 the important points is that 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:21.820
 the so-called lighthouses rooms had two 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.000
 models a few rounds and some squares 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.350
 these squares that came out from 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.120
 of the year 68 because they really are not ports 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:38.050
 Directional are are rooms for 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.050
 to the snow 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.629
 worried the talk
