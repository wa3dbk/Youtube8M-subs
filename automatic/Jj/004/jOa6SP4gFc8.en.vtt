00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 following david who also went from 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.600
 the other side of the mirror 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.400
 I totally changed my diet 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.929
 for two days the ideal tvh and I 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.940
 have to say that I feel lighter more 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.370
 of fluidity more openness of the mind 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.480
 and more energy sensitivity this 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.580
 which puts great front in the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 practice of care by magnetism my 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.320
 question is about the buses the flours 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 by not the bubble the flours I 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
 stopped all cereals containing 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.019
 gluten but as good as I am 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.029
 set to prepare to eat every day 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.619
 my family i want to make concessions 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.969
 use chestnut flour 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.070
 roasted from the middle 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.180
 but here I have eaten yesterday 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.410
 pancakes or fake and with vegetables to the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.820
 chestnut flour plus rice flour 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.770
 and today I feel like a magnifying glass 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.940
 an hour of slow digestion of 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 bloating an emotional state 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 rigidify brief hope legs 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.039
 and then I tell myself that there is surely a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.270
 message to be conveyed regarding 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.879
 flours found in many 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.270
 preparation there is a message to be made 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.350
 to pass is that the flours the only 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 job that I know who is a 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.980
 little bit suitable for flours 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.510
 it's mixing them with highs 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.879
 to glue wallpaper here 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 flour is tapestry glue 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.970
 so what does it do for 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 the organization to manage that glue to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.869
 tapestry whatever it is and well 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.260
 this tapestry glue they are 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.960
 deposit along the walls of the colon and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.049
 intestines performing a crust crust 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.790
 which prevents the proper assimilation and 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.159
 good use of the nutrients that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.009
 we are supposed to absorb secondly 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.479
 this left favors a whole flora 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.150
 and a crazy one especially of 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.920
 mushrooms called candidates 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.979
 that will proliferate just for 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 resorb all this layer there by a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.400
 deposit layer but there are beautiful 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.290
 little agents doing a job they 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.790
 come and he cleans all that flames 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.560
 who thought he was really making her 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.350
 video about viruses bacteria and 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.909
 microbes 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.380
 I think I think about it tonight or tomorrow or 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.689
 after tomorrow or anyway soon 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.119
 I will make it simple 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.969
 So here here is the first the first 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.549
 aspect puts cereals and pseudo 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.299
 cereals their accurate by action she is 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.000
 on the whole intestinal part 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.970
 economic and that's what will make that 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.920
 these are the ones that happened there that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.080
 have the greatest influence on the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.300
 nervous system you talk about it and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.620
 nuns stiffen it is right 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.849
 to write the article for the next 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.140
 choubra who would be called what this 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.069
 world is cooked within a fortnight 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.950
 shows how far is ultimately the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.900
 grain culture to condition our 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.940
 society our civilization as it 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.860
 is yes really we are a 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.170
 cereal civilization and a think 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.390
 with a cereal thought link this is to 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.400
 to say a thought that is constantly 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.709
 nervous system that constantly in 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.390
 excitability that does not work like 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.489
 it should work and what for what 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.410
 because if this sphere there is 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.680
 congested you know there is a 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.920
 charter link the canopy there is a 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.209
 link between mr collomb 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.069
 there too citizens if we change 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.299
 English name bad name but we see 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.230
 a little bit all the links 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.840
 between the sheds 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.560
 there is a very close connection between mr 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.630
 collomb and this sphere the the sphere the 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.590
 cerebral sphere in which there is 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.049
 the pituitary 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.760
 alas pineal two acorns of major of the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.680
 system the profits being the gland 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.630
 mistresses who secretes just about all 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.519
 the waves that will be used in return 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.100
 by the other tassels it's really the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.620
 conductor of the siceco system 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.850
 managementi it does not work there 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.829
 ai migraines I already told you it's 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.019
 congested there but on the reverse 6 is 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.850
 congested there and well the whole system 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.230
 nervous all the thought system that 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.880
 is not sure that cervical but 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.519
 which is still strongly cortical 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.299
 and well and all this system the valve or 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.549
 van van hool is not going to be able 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.660
 operate at its full potential 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.670
 like he can not work at his 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.950
 full potential and well actually 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.030
 emotional state meant and besides 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.590
 you said this morning we talk a lot 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.140
 hyperactivity children talk 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.799
 never hyperactivity adults 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.299
 go out watch the extent violence 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.130
 aggressiveness of this world and ask yourself 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.670
 the question is what all this is 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.799
 normal 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.420
 is it precisely that it is necessary 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.950
 to see is that when people come to 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.420
 an internship of one week and that during 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.609
 a week they experiment everything to 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.410
 do something else 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.660
 most racing but that's the life 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.670
 but yeah that's what life is 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.590
 that's not this madness all that we 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.819
 told you life is fake life 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.810
 it's not this madness life it's not 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.609
 row against the current 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.380
 life did not advance in the 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.630
 blizzard little curved in two in ten years 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.320
 I held the ag of the used life 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.660
 it is quiet calm in the sun this 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.510
 carry by the flow of the current we listen 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.750
 we pray we listen and we let ourselves be carried 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.270
 by the campfire it's just that and the 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.310
 play contributes enormously to us 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.930
 we go back on ourselves to put 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.060
 the nervous system in italy father 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.860
 acceptability and ensure that 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.230
 finally we do everything ourselves 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.220
 and we fight we fight constantly and we 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.010
 is in the violence this is in 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.290
 aggression causes number one 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.720
 with the dairy products of all 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.160
 sentry problems empowered and 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.930
 emotional because someone has some 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.740
 t he problems and irritability or 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.540
 emotional problems 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.800
 we will cut the gluten we will cut the 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.270
 dairy products is immediately 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.470
 this person will change at all 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.450
 if you have someone in your 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.740
 entourage for a lot of the team's 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.420
 dairy products of booty say you 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.010
 since it's a cup and if that person 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.790
 agrees to do the experiment for three 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.350
 weeks a month 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.890
 and well you will discover a whole 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.690
 other person so yes yes david them 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.460
 flours are collars on the map 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.070
 physiological it's a disaster years 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.620
 it's particularly acidifying and on 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.240
 the psychotic picot neurological plane 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.070
 emotional it's a disaster too 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.660
 and that creates a lot of the 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.520
 violence of this word makes the expert in 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.390
 only three weeks without gluten 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.500
 you will see you are going 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.070
 wake up or three weeks you 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.070
 will not recognize
