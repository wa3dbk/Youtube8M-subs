division is not improving
which<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.860> thought<00:02:14.040> would<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.360> Nikki<00:02:16.049> Bella

which I thought would do so Nikki Bella
retain<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.730> seems<00:02:18.030> likely<00:02:19.189> just<00:02:20.189> so<00:02:20.400> they

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
retain it it seems likely just so they

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.990 
retain it it seems likely just so they
kind<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:21.260> overtake<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.470> TLS<00:02:23.010> rain<00:02:23.310> maybe

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
kind of a overtake a TLS rain maybe

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.970
