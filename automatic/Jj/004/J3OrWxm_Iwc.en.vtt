not<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> thought<00:00:58.520> I'd

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
not that it's just that I thought I'd

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.029 
not that it's just that I thought I'd
such<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> long<00:01:00.120> wait<00:01:00.420> before<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.920> got<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.980> chance

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
such a long wait before I got a chance

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.260 
such a long wait before I got a chance
to<00:01:02.399> do<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> film<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.059> you

to do a film with you
so<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.600> thought<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> should<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.170> appropriate

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so I thought it should be appropriate

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
so I thought it should be appropriate
that<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.250> know<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.400> also<00:01:05.640> wait<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.270> few<00:01:06.750> months
