00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 knows when it comes to that moment that the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.790
 People stop and think as soon as I go 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.980
 make of my life is friends 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.690
 This moment has come for me. 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.780
 Time we need to take a lot. 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.210
 decisions at the same time and there the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.460
 things are tightening in such a way that the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 people are dying for fear of 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.300
 wrong choice 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.039
 so that's why I'm doing this 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 video here you must be thinking the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.460
 next but that video is this 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.130
 in the repetitive video tutorial that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.969
 Strange but that's where you fool me. 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.890
 Dear colleague 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.190
 I'm really philosophizing here just to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.500
 put the future of the channel in the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.149
 because it draws more attention and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 sure this video title was type 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.469
 vlogs update you will give corn with 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.719
 This is what you hope to convince. 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.579
 Congratulations and it was duly worked out but 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.620
 peraí peraí peraí peraí fame it closes the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.600
 video not because I have a lot of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 important thing to tell you and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 legal news also I'm here today 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.610
 to do what I've been doing 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.049
 other Mondays this year 2015 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.090
 answer questions some questions 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.130
 What are you doing, like, more? 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 these last days and then I felt 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.960
 so in the obligation to bring a video 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.320
 for you explaining what you want 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.320
 to know is armadillo was almost this 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.150
 but for example I know that you want 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.150
 know about it here 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.939
 I had to make a break and notebooks 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.740
 netbooks this month because of some 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.539
 leaps that appeared to make as 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.149
 you should imagine the kind of picture 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.030
 which gives more work both to write 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.819
 how to record how much to edit and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.100
 still the file gets gigantic and 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.100
 time this medium was too short 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.640
 strange faculties that I spoke one 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.590
 lots of other commitments 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.990
 And that's when I got organized. 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.730
 and I ran out of time to record but it speaks 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.800
 seriously gave to compensate with that series 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.930
 Freecom brought you to it, huh? 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.580

 also want to know is it about here is 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.709
 good 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.270
 another type of this month in a workshop 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.100
 people there Mr. Gambuggi said that the 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.450
 bring the title in which besides not 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.820
 really brought sorry guys 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.370
 because it was a mistake, my truth 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.739
 but do not worry tout puissant there not 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.470
 It will eventually be up to me to continue 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:10.080
 with this life every month there beauty for only 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.700
 this month even if they do not leave it 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.910
 enjoy and talk about it here 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.910
 also 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.969
 this is where the good news of this video is 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.340
 vegas and premier tutorial galley 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:27.959
 will not miss the channel at all 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.060
 I want to get enough too. 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.159
 heavy on the channel and 20 movies and even 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.750
 a contract with the guys there I have to 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.019
 To fulfill I have to bring video to 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.609
 You were thinking the following to 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.459
 people have four software to 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:46.409
 work the channel and we have the type 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.819
 sure it's seven days a week 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.980
 It's just that we get discounts on Sunday 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.299
 because it is to render video you already 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.709
 I'm more or less understanding where I 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.090
 I want to get here 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.700
 that's right if I start bringing 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.950
 daily tutorials here on day type channel 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.169
 vegas on the 1st of the movie after the agent 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.970
 and the type of articles on Monday 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.129
 So I ask you, it's the next 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.620
 It might be a good idea to bring 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.599
 videos every day here by the channel tell me 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.040
 in the comments what you think 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.879
 It will be very important for me to 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.590
 truth 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.900
 another question that could only cause 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.070
 This is for me, and I will give 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.690
 account to bring video every day no more 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.090
 would be something that I would be very willing 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.770
 to do and even fight for it to 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.159
 that I can bring video every day 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.229
 on here 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.789
 It is logical for you to hear the 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.320
 to watch the videos is 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.180
 otherwise it's no use 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.760
 So, please, guys, join us there. 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.659
 comments from you that will 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.460
 be very important for the canal's future 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.500
 they want to follow the nursery tutorials 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.080

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.800
 the future of the channel and that's what I wanted 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.470
 to bring to you today is if you 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.300
 they liked him and did not like it 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.550
 and why did not you like it at the time of year? 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.199
 lax concerned does not then apply 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.030
 to not lose the things I 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.710
