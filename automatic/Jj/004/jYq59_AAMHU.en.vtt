 nice all guys here just matt and i am 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:14.000
 here in my second video in a 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:18.320
 short tutorial on how to import on 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.040
 ps3 a game save of 5 percent for 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.509
 hundred and in addition to having the story to the 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.349
 hundred percent 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:30.320
 you also have also modified cars 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.969
 and almost a billion dollars then 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.370
 just insert it if you don't 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:40.910
 you want to do the whole story 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:44.120
 and then you first go upstairs 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.129
 link that I put you in the description 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.070
 and as soon as you click on the link vi 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.070
 you will find water on this page 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 ok let's see if it loads because the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.760
 connection not so fast 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.329
 ok perfect you just do it up 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.509
 download and it will download it in a moment 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.100
 because it weighs only 283 k bytes which like 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.220
 see too that the slow connection 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 it was very fast and inside this 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:23.399
 rar archive you will find this folder 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.000
 you the scope and on the desktop and and then 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.050
 now 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.060
 insert the key in the PCI and after 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.310
 having inserted the cavity in the pci gone 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.179
 on your computer it went on yours 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:41.590
 key is imported into yours 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:47.229
 key the perfect ps3 folder 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.920
 and now after doing this there 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.560
 let's see on ps3 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.829
 here we are on ps3 after doing i 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.229
 first steps on the computer 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.890
 insert the sun key and note 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.750

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.869
 I have already done and you go immediately to 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.399
 italy the data saved ps3 select the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.640
 your usb stick 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.370
 in this case this is mine and inside 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.630
 you will find the rescue there 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.880
 imported into the computer 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:24.099
 in this case it will be enough to crush 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.510
 triangle and pair up and that's why 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.709
