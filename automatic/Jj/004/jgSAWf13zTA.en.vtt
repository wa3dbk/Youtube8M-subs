00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.960

 France and to be attacked here with this 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.730
 new title in my pocket I'm in 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.219
 confidence of course but it's not won 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.570

 how much will go on it's going to have to 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.010
 I start to put a little bit of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.180
 foot to the buttocks to fetch all 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.180
 Mondays 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.240
 and here we are at the heart of the 3 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.460
 valleys 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.290
 this American ski area is a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.490
 station that remained more than very very 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.140
 long years a very pressure 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.530
 sporty she took her great notoriety 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.970
 with the 1992 Olympics where 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.550
 all the women's events had 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.440
 place on this iron rock track where 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.090
 we are now finally twenty 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.810
 years later for a new test of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.520
 world Cup 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.560

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.390
 end up in meribel after bread 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.520
 beautiful record that we had during the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.930
 chaplains of the world of schladming 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.560
 come back to mingle with the public and the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.560
 girls are delighted 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.860
 it respects the spirit of the 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.170
 descent with a track that crisscross 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.080
 and that naturally follows a little the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.030
 mountain profile to a very beautiful 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.070

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:24.280
