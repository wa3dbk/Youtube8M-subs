arteries<00:02:28.560> very<00:02:29.030> well<00:02:30.030> knowing<00:02:30.540> how<00:02:30.810> Nellie<00:02:31.080> is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290

she'll<00:02:32.010> probably<00:02:32.160> be<00:02:32.370> kidding<00:02:32.640> within<00:02:32.880> about

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
she'll probably be kidding within about

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.660 
she'll probably be kidding within about
24<00:02:33.570> hours<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:36.420> hope<00:02:38.300> no<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.959> go<00:02:40.080> inside<00:02:40.489> they<00:02:41.489> get

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
24 hours I hope no to go inside they get

00:02:41.670 --> 00:03:14.119 
24 hours I hope no to go inside they get
a<00:02:41.700> nice<00:02:41.910> cup<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.239> coffee

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:21.300 

well<00:03:15.129> it's<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.550> little<00:03:15.640> past<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:20.310> guess

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
well it's now a little past and I guess

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:30.229 
well it's now a little past and I guess
that's<00:03:21.819> some<00:03:22.090> hot<00:03:22.300> yes

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.119 

so<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.330> can<00:03:31.480> see<00:03:31.720> her<00:03:31.900> at<00:03:32.049> her<00:03:32.080> is<00:03:32.290> very<00:03:32.319> round

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
so you can see her at her is very round

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:45.830 
so you can see her at her is very round
and<00:03:33.459> tight<00:03:40.590> her<00:03:41.590> ligaments<00:03:42.129> are<00:03:43.950> gone<00:03:44.950> I

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
and tight her ligaments are gone I

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.150 
and tight her ligaments are gone I
really<00:03:46.840> searched<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.319> could<00:03:47.500> still<00:03:47.739> feel<00:03:47.769> them

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
really searched I could still feel them

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.449 
really searched I could still feel them
but<00:03:48.519> it's<00:03:49.150> not<00:03:49.390> easy<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.590> vessels<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.160> skin

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
but it's not easy the vessels and skin

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.190 
but it's not easy the vessels and skin
have<00:03:54.640> really<00:03:54.940> loosened<00:03:55.090> up<00:03:55.360> around<00:03:55.599> kale<00:03:55.989> hat

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
have really loosened up around kale hat
