00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.439 

I<00:00:00.179> wanted<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.230> show<00:00:01.560> you<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:03.240> math

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
I wanted to show you today the math

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.600 
I wanted to show you today the math
equivalent<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.520> device<00:00:05.879> manager<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.779> I

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
equivalent to the device manager and I

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.299 
equivalent to the device manager and I
think<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.910> gives<00:00:09.150> more<00:00:09.559> at<00:00:10.559> least<00:00:10.920> out<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
think it gives more at least out of the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.189 
think it gives more at least out of the
gate<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.000> what<00:00:12.179> your<00:00:12.420> hardware<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.019> and

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
gate as to what your hardware is and

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.279 
gate as to what your hardware is and
this<00:00:16.199> could<00:00:16.470> be<00:00:16.500> accessed<00:00:17.220> by<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
this could be accessed by going to

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.070 
this could be accessed by going to
spotlight<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.520> doing<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> search<00:00:21.779> for

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
spotlight and just doing the search for

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.519 
spotlight and just doing the search for
a<00:00:22.580> system<00:00:27.439> system<00:00:29.539> and<00:00:30.539> then<00:00:30.750> clicking<00:00:31.170> system

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
a system system and then clicking system

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.150 
a system system and then clicking system
profiler<00:00:32.870> system<00:00:33.870> profiler<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.649> basically

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
profiler system profiler is basically

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.740 
profiler system profiler is basically
the<00:00:35.430> device<00:00:35.730> money<00:00:36.739> to<00:00:37.739> windows<00:00:38.160> user<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the device money to windows user and it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
the device money to windows user and it
tells<00:00:40.020> me<00:00:40.170> all<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:41.399> doing<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:44.399> audio

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
tells me all about doing like the audio

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.709 
tells me all about doing like the audio
and<00:00:46.010> what<00:00:47.010> things<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.329> motherboard

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and what things have on the motherboard

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.529 
and what things have on the motherboard
go<00:00:49.430> down<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.640> what<00:00:50.820> software<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.879> here's<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.080 

hit<00:00:57.539> total<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.379> PCI<00:00:59.280> cards<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.940> have

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
hit total up PCI cards that have

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.810 
hit total up PCI cards that have
installed<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:01.320> obviously<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
installed which obviously this is a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.450 
installed which obviously this is a
notebook<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.989> don't<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:05.040> any<00:01:05.930> please<00:01:06.930> see

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
notebook so I don't have any please see

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.830 
notebook so I don't have any please see
my<00:01:08.460> cards<00:01:10.820> but<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.210> thing<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.600> found

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
my cards but the one thing I found

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.890 
my cards but the one thing I found
interesting<00:01:13.760> was<00:01:14.760> looking<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
interesting was looking at the and

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.380 
interesting was looking at the and
things<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.740> my<00:01:19.890> hard<00:01:20.220> drive<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
things for my hard drive so I have a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.920 
things for my hard drive so I have a
Fujitsu<00:01:24.390> M<00:01:24.710> whatever<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.689> see

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Fujitsu M whatever that is and I can see

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
Fujitsu M whatever that is and I can see
my<00:01:28.939> hard<00:01:29.939> drive<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.380> also<00:01:31.939> look<00:01:32.939> at<00:01:33.090> my

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
my hard drive and I can also look at my

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
my hard drive and I can also look at my
font<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.159> basically<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.820> equivalent

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
font so this is basically the equivalent

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.200 
font so this is basically the equivalent
to<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> device<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.680> year<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.159> Windows<00:01:38.939> but

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
to the device one year in Windows but

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.590 
to the device one year in Windows but
there's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.020> lot<00:01:40.229> more<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.560> depth<00:01:40.850> so<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.090> just

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
there's a lot more in depth so I just

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600 
there's a lot more in depth so I just
wanted<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.110> show<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.430> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
wanted to show you now all you have to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.840 
wanted to show you now all you have to
do<00:01:44.759> go<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.479> spotlight<00:01:46.079> typing<00:01:46.649> system<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
do go to spotlight typing system and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.630 
do go to spotlight typing system and
then<00:01:48.000> put<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.450> system<00:01:48.810> profiler<00:01:49.530> or<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
then put on the system profiler or you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.240 
then put on the system profiler or you
can<00:01:50.939> go<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.869> Apple<00:01:52.200> menu<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.979> about

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
can go to the Apple menu and then about

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.690 
can go to the Apple menu and then about
with<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.750> click<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.380> info<00:01:56.100> if

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
with that and then click more info if

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.600 
with that and then click more info if
you<00:01:56.850> wish<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.979> anyway<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> end<00:01:59.399> of
