 the saucer I hope you love the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.530
 video and good basically it's like 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 you are seeing it here is chicken 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.800
 the griddle with broccoli just what 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.429
 Let's prepare with 100 to 150 grams 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.980
 of chicken 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.620
 obviously chicken breast well cleaned 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.569
 what we are going to use is bread or 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.910
 canola oil obviously so that 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:02.310
 have less fat 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.559
 it is very important we are going to prepare the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.990
 broccoli with a little bit of soy sauce 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.300
 and then we're going to find pepper like 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.080
 are watching the video pepper 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.430
 taste why are we going to eat this food 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.640
 when we should eat this food is very 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.580
 simple this food we should eat it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.350
 obviously especially at night 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.750
 after having trained already when you have 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.830
 done all your daily activity and about 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.020
 everything you are going to do in the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 night is to stay at home is not going to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 do no physical activity but 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.930
 rest because it's ideal ideal because 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.280
 has a lot of protein obviously the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.340
 chicken protein is good and also 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.440
 provides a few extra grams of protein and 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.869
 especially because it is a low food in 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.080
 calories and low in carbohydrates the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.560
 broccoli in turn contributes quantity of 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.840
 antioxidants and is therefore an opening that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.730
 it is anti-cancer because many people 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.100
 they consume it because it has 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.110
 thousands of anti-inflammatory benefits and 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.790
 anticarcinogenic because of the great 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.820
 amount of antioxidants that it has 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.650
 then friends that's all a recipe 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.960
 delicious chicken hydro coli with a 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.180
 little bit of pepper then you know 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.950
 friends to eat enough chicken obviously 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.500
 in many other grams of protein there are 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.730
 few calories and also from broccoli 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.340
 I hope you liked this video 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.990
 to lower the way to prepare it and 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.180
 I hope you eat it and enjoy it 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.700
 If you have any doubt, obviously leave us 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.520
 they wrote a comment or have 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.100
 some doubt or concern you know friends 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.530
 As always, I like to share a 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.360
 hug this was all from foosball and 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.580
 see you the next video for now 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.040
 good and basically for this dish 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.200
 we need are 100 grams of chicken 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.720
 later to my liking and I really like the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.530
 mustard then is the way to prepare 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.120
 NATO 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.790
 obviously the chicken this is breast 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.620
 European lean and what we do is that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.900
 good to taste is a mustard 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.850
 some people we mustard milk 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.330
 some people just the only thing 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.890
 what they do is that 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.319
 they leave her like that, he's in a little bit of 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.650
 Salt 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.650
 and well some people do not even 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.290
 even obviously I use the bread 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.120
 for 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.799
 to do all my food to the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.409
 iron what is the chicken to the 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.329
 iron are the vegetables also what 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.370
 I always use this one is very important 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.370
 Cinnamon is it today then 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.900
 very good especially because it is very but 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.790
 very little the amount of fat that has 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.830
 then obviously in another video 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.510
 we will talk about this specific product 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.460
 but this time is not to talk about 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.550
 anyway and it's important to tell you that 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:38.270
 I use this bread for everything that is 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.010
 make grilled meals for this 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.030
 cymbal we obviously need the chicken 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.580
 as we had mentioned 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.130
 previously and we need of course 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.050
 europol and the way we prepare 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.180
 the broccoli is very simple obviously 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.520
 first we cut the broccoli I'm not going to 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.650
 show step by step because it is god 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.030
 It's very long and there are so many things 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.310
 simple ones that you should already know 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.770
 we really wash the opening really well 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.360
 the broccoli was very well what 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.610
 we do is that after we proceed to 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.740
 cut them and obviously we put them in 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.440
 hot water always have you a 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.660
 little bit so we obviously lose 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.330
 all the bacteria that it always contains 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.000
 the plant 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.010
 then the way to prepare them equally 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.870
 let's do in a pan what I 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.410
 I do is divide them in a pan 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.790
 I have the chicken and 174 forest lawn and what 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.600
 only thing I'm going to throw is the 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.360
 propose a little bit of soy sauce 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.160
 and that's the only thing I'm going to do to 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.160
 the iron obviously also uses the 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.490
 pama here and what I do is that good what 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.040
 Cooked obviously about 3 to 5 minutes 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.590
 and what he proceeded after basically 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.710
 is to cut them and prepare them as if 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.390
 was a salad because you already 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.430
 they saw in the saucer good friends of the 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.200
 way to prepare them I hope that they 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.200
 I liked the video a hug
