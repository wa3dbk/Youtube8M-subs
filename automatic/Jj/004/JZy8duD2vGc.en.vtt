line over here

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.190 
line over here
and<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:33.760> machine<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.180> basically<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.080> the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
and this machine is basically like the

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.659 
and this machine is basically like the
other<00:04:35.350> machine<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.740> was<00:04:36.010> making<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.460> melt
