00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
seems to me that my trapezius muscles in

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.260 
seems to me that my trapezius muscles in
my<00:00:37.590> shoulders<00:00:38.100> get<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.640> jammed<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.149> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
really tight and it doesn't feel good

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.100 
really tight and it doesn't feel good
but<00:00:41.760> these<00:00:41.910> are<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.239> sort<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.600> mini<00:00:42.809> arm

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
but these are like sort of mini arm

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
contracting again that's another subtle

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.580 
contracting again that's another subtle
hint<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.940> want<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.989> feel<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.230> shoulder

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
contract and then I come down if you've

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.440 
contract and then I come down if you've
got<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.880> guts<00:02:58.010> hold<00:02:59.010> them

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.089 

at<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.630> point<00:03:02.870> in<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.080> exercise<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.980> might

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
at this point in the exercise you might

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.820 
at this point in the exercise you might
not<00:03:04.280> be<00:03:04.370> able<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.610> hold<00:03:04.760> them<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.440> can<00:03:06.440> barely<00:03:06.620> do

not be able to hold them I can barely do

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.920

that<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.270> certainly<00:03:08.480> something<00:03:08.690> to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
that but it's certainly something to

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.660 
that but it's certainly something to
work<00:03:09.080> toward<00:03:09.459> okay

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670
