oh there it is already i was wondering
how<00:01:58.979> wasn't<00:01:59.219> shooting<00:01:59.520> me<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:01.079> because

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
how wasn't shooting me and it's because

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.170 
how wasn't shooting me and it's because
i<00:02:01.439> didn't<00:02:01.710> realize<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.310> had<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.670> class<00:02:02.939> on

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
i didn't realize that I had my class on

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.840 
i didn't realize that I had my class on
cold<00:02:03.509> blooded<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.439> sure<00:02:05.280> enough<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.579> would

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
cold blooded and sure enough that would

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.069 
cold blooded and sure enough that would
make<00:02:06.000> complete<00:02:06.119> sense<00:02:06.659> why<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> wasn't

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079

yet<00:02:33.220> wasteland<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:34.200> wasteland<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.379> a<00:02:35.409> map<00:02:35.709> um<00:02:36.040> I

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
yet wasteland a wasteland is a map um I

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.220 
yet wasteland a wasteland is a map um I
think<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.599> probably<00:02:37.840> one<00:02:38.049> of<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.200> easiest

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
think it's probably one of the easiest

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.729 
think it's probably one of the easiest
maps<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:39.010> get<00:02:39.129> a<00:02:39.159> new<00:02:39.310> gun<00:02:39.549> if<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.739> especially

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
maps to get a new gun if you especially

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.140 
maps to get a new gun if you especially
plane<00:02:42.129> domination<00:02:42.670> if<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.819> can<00:02:42.940> have<00:02:43.030> your

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
plane domination if you can have your

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.289 
plane domination if you can have your
team<00:02:43.329> kind<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.629> control<00:02:44.220> two<00:02:45.220> bases<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:46.150> other

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
team kind of control two bases the other

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.479 
team kind of control two bases the other
team<00:02:46.510> just<00:02:46.540> spawns<00:02:46.989> at<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.859> other<00:02:47.980> base<00:02:48.220> and

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
team just spawns at the other base and

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.309 
team just spawns at the other base and
it's<00:02:48.849> such<00:02:49.030> an<00:02:49.180> open<00:02:49.510> map<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.930> once<00:02:50.079> you<00:02:50.200> get

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
it's such an open map that once you get

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.349 
it's such an open map that once you get
to<00:02:50.349> harriers<00:02:50.859> you<00:02:51.489> just<00:02:51.670> have<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> get<00:02:52.000> seven

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
to harriers you just have to get seven

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.059 
to harriers you just have to get seven
kills<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:53.200> basically<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.859> a<00:02:53.890> new

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
kills and you basically have a new

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.740 
kills and you basically have a new
plague<00:02:54.370> that's<00:02:54.819> kind<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.030> how<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.299> on<00:02:55.390> most

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
plague that's kind of how it is on most

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.869 
plague that's kind of how it is on most
maps<00:02:56.019> but<00:02:56.349> this<00:02:56.620> map<00:02:56.829> especially<00:02:57.430> it's<00:02:57.579> so

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
maps but this map especially it's so

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.430 
maps but this map especially it's so
open<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.420> there's<00:02:58.750> not<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.049> any<00:02:59.230> place

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
open that there's not really any place

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.300 
open that there's not really any place
to<00:02:59.470> hide<00:02:59.799> but<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:01.590> mean<00:03:02.590> obviously<00:03:02.980> if<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.159> get

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
to hide but I mean obviously if you get

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.710 
to hide but I mean obviously if you get
into<00:03:03.400> around<00:03:03.700> where<00:03:03.909> kids<00:03:04.299> are<00:03:04.420> cold-blooded

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
into around where kids are cold-blooded

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.789 
into around where kids are cold-blooded
and<00:03:05.200> they're<00:03:05.709> using<00:03:07.230> their<00:03:08.230> using<00:03:08.500> stuff<00:03:08.709> to

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
and they're using their using stuff to

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.259 
and they're using their using stuff to
shoot<00:03:08.980> your<00:03:09.099> air<00:03:09.459> support<00:03:09.819> down<00:03:09.970> then<00:03:10.150> it's

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
shoot your air support down then it's

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.720 
shoot your air support down then it's
going<00:03:10.359> to<00:03:10.420> make<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.629> a<00:03:10.690> little<00:03:10.780> bit<00:03:10.959> harder<00:03:11.200> but

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
going to make it a little bit harder but

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.970 
going to make it a little bit harder but
yeah<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.120> would<00:03:13.629> have<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:14.260> say<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.500> quick

um<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:34.079> think<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.410> one<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.650> most<00:03:36.120> annoying

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
um I think that one of the most annoying

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.900 
um I think that one of the most annoying
things<00:03:37.629> is<00:03:37.900> when<00:03:38.139> here<00:03:38.379> in<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.560> game<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:39.040> people

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
things is when here in a game and people

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.309 
things is when here in a game and people
use<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.239> lot<00:03:40.389> now<00:03:40.569> because<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.870> lot<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.079> kids

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
use it a lot now because a lot of kids

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.300 
use it a lot now because a lot of kids
have<00:03:41.440> modded<00:03:41.799> controllers<00:03:42.310> but<00:03:43.109> m21<00:03:44.310> silence

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
have modded controllers but m21 silence

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.150 
have modded controllers but m21 silence
cold-blooded<00:03:46.120> like<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.019> don't<00:03:47.410> know<00:03:47.650> what

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
cold-blooded like I don't know what

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.339 
cold-blooded like I don't know what
people<00:03:48.400> are<00:03:48.669> thinking<00:03:48.730> like<00:03:49.329> why<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:49.989> would

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
people are thinking like why you would

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.170 
people are thinking like why you would
want<00:03:50.379> to<00:03:50.620> snipe<00:03:50.919> with<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.579> gun<00:03:51.849> because<00:03:52.060> you

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
want to snipe with that gun because you

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.330 
want to snipe with that gun because you
have<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.389> shoot<00:03:52.510> people<00:03:52.690> like<00:03:52.930> five<00:03:53.260> times<00:03:53.739> for

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
have to shoot people like five times for

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.520 
have to shoot people like five times for
them<00:03:54.459> to<00:03:54.579> die<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:55.000> ridiculous<00:03:55.569> but<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:56.290> guess

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
them to die it's ridiculous but I guess

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.550 
them to die it's ridiculous but I guess
a<00:03:56.769> lot<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.519> them<00:03:57.730> have<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:58.230> modded<00:03:59.230> controller

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
a lot of them have a modded controller

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.520 
a lot of them have a modded controller
so<00:03:59.829> they're<00:03:59.949> just<00:04:00.129> like<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.930> ridiculous

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
so they're just like that's ridiculous

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.280 
so they're just like that's ridiculous
but<00:04:02.790> anyways<00:04:03.790> yeah<00:04:03.940> oh<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.690> is<00:04:04.840> where<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.139> was

bit<00:04:15.400> of<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.669> dumb<00:04:16.150> moment

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.650 

anyways<00:04:19.560> yet<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.160> basically<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.390> round

anyways yet so basically this this round

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.660 
anyways yet so basically this this round
I<00:04:21.900> kind<00:04:22.110> of<00:04:22.170> just<00:04:22.350> camped<00:04:22.920> around<00:04:22.980> the<00:04:23.280> cars

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
I kind of just camped around the cars

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.970 
I kind of just camped around the cars
and<00:04:24.030> kind<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.630> controlled<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.260> sea<00:04:25.740> bass<00:04:25.950> and

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
and kind of controlled that sea bass and

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.440 
and kind of controlled that sea bass and
that's<00:04:26.580> kind<00:04:26.790> of<00:04:26.820> what<00:04:26.910> you're<00:04:27.030> supposed<00:04:27.060> to

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
that's kind of what you're supposed to

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.200 
that's kind of what you're supposed to
do<00:04:27.690> just<00:04:28.350> control<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.130> side<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.700> map<00:04:29.880> and

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
do just control the side of the map and

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.800 
do just control the side of the map and
make<00:04:30.840> sure<00:04:31.020> that<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:31.650> can<00:04:31.800> watch<00:04:31.950> each<00:04:32.220> side

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
make sure that you can watch each side

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.390 
make sure that you can watch each side
if<00:04:33.810> you're<00:04:34.410> really<00:04:34.530> honestly<00:04:34.920> going<00:04:35.130> for<00:04:35.370> a

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
if you're really honestly going for a

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.310 
if you're really honestly going for a
nuke<00:04:35.550> probably<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> best<00:04:36.270> two<00:04:36.780> bases<00:04:37.200> to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
nuke probably the best two bases to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.590 
nuke probably the best two bases to
control<00:04:37.650> on<00:04:37.770> this<00:04:38.010> side<00:04:38.220> on<00:04:38.790> this<00:04:39.090> map<00:04:39.360> would

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
control on this side on this map would

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.460 
control on this side on this map would
be<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.200> B<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:41.220> would<00:04:42.030> say<00:04:42.210> that<00:04:42.240> spawn<00:04:42.720> E&amp;C<00:04:42.990> is

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
be a and B I would say that spawn E&amp;C is

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.840 
be a and B I would say that spawn E&amp;C is
a<00:04:43.860> pretty<00:04:44.280> terrible<00:04:44.760> place<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.030> spawn<00:04:45.440> I<00:04:46.850> guess

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
a pretty terrible place to spawn I guess

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.670 
a pretty terrible place to spawn I guess
actually<00:04:48.360> controlling<00:04:48.750> bna<00:04:49.290> is<00:04:49.470> pretty

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
actually controlling bna is pretty

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.840 
actually controlling bna is pretty
pretty<00:04:51.080> pretty<00:04:52.080> good<00:04:52.290> too<00:04:52.500> wait<00:04:53.400> is<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.610> what

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
I just said it is what I just said if

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.910 
I just said it is what I just said if
you<00:04:56.640> can<00:04:56.820> control<00:04:57.120> BNC<00:04:57.630> like<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:58.110> is<00:04:58.680> pretty

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
you can control BNC like a is pretty

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.980 
you can control BNC like a is pretty
open<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.760> if<00:04:59.850> you<00:04:59.970> get<00:05:00.090> 27<00:05:00.240> kills<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.900> your

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
team has B and C then them spawning to a

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.300 
team has B and C then them spawning to a
like<00:05:04.140> it's<00:05:04.290> going<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.470> spawn<00:05:04.740> around<00:05:05.100> by<00:05:05.250> the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
like it's going to spawn around by the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.800 
like it's going to spawn around by the
church<00:05:05.640> and<00:05:05.850> it's<00:05:05.970> pretty<00:05:06.120> open<00:05:06.480> over<00:05:06.690> there

church and it's pretty open over there
by<00:05:07.050> over<00:05:07.760> anyways<00:05:08.760> right<00:05:08.940> here<00:05:09.120> look<00:05:09.300> how<00:05:09.450> fast

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
by over anyways right here look how fast

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.290 
by over anyways right here look how fast
i<00:05:10.050> get<00:05:10.200> the<00:05:10.380> big<00:05:10.800> ten<00:05:11.100> pills<00:05:11.370> i'm<00:05:11.610> at<00:05:11.760> 15<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.120> 0

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
i get the big ten pills i'm at 15 and 0

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.700 
i get the big ten pills i'm at 15 and 0
right<00:05:12.510> now<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:12.930> i<00:05:14.720> get<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.810> 25<00:05:16.230> and<00:05:16.380> 0<00:05:16.410> in<00:05:16.530> about

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
right now and i get to 25 and 0 in about

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.890 
right now and i get to 25 and 0 in about
10<00:05:16.919> seconds

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.210 

it<00:05:20.900> is<00:05:21.050> just<00:05:21.170> ridiculous<00:05:21.680> like<00:05:21.830> right<00:05:22.010> here<00:05:22.190> I

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
it is just ridiculous like right here I

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:29.410 
it is just ridiculous like right here I
turn<00:05:22.460> around<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.940> just<00:05:23.140> multi-kill<00:05:28.330> that<00:05:29.330> is

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
turn around and just multi-kill that is

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.210 
turn around and just multi-kill that is
just<00:05:29.690> item<00:05:30.140> I<00:05:30.320> think<00:05:30.560> that's<00:05:30.710> pretty<00:05:30.920> fast

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
just item I think that's pretty fast

they shot me down pretty quick but
that's<00:05:44.750> kind<00:05:44.990> of<00:05:45.050> it<00:05:45.230> you<00:05:45.560> can<00:05:45.710> control<00:05:46.100> the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
that's kind of it you can control the

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.360 
that's kind of it you can control the
cars<00:05:46.580> if<00:05:46.910> you're<00:05:47.090> spawning<00:05:47.480> at<00:05:47.720> sea<00:05:48.100> wow<00:05:49.100> that

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
cars if you're spawning at sea wow that

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.930 
cars if you're spawning at sea wow that
was<00:05:49.490> a<00:05:49.520> bad<00:05:49.730> sniper<00:05:50.060> back<00:05:50.330> then<00:05:51.340> or<00:05:52.340> I<00:05:52.400> mean<00:05:52.820> you

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
was a bad sniper back then or I mean you

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.060 
was a bad sniper back then or I mean you
can<00:05:53.120> you<00:05:53.390> can<00:05:53.600> control<00:05:53.960> and<00:05:54.230> you<00:05:54.710> can<00:05:54.860> sit<00:05:55.040> on

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
can you can control and you can sit on

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.700 
can you can control and you can sit on
east<00:05:55.430> side<00:05:55.610> by<00:05:55.850> the<00:05:55.910> houses<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:56.600> you<00:05:57.410> can<00:05:57.530> just

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
east side by the houses and you can just

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.860 
east side by the houses and you can just
camp<00:05:57.980> but<00:05:58.370> in<00:05:58.850> my<00:05:59.030> opinion<00:05:59.150> like<00:05:59.570> if<00:05:59.780> you're

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
camp but in my opinion like if you're

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.710 
camp but in my opinion like if you're
going<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.050> go<00:06:00.140> for<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.380> new<00:06:01.660> sniping<00:06:02.660> is

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
going to go for a new sniping is

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.090 
going to go for a new sniping is
probably<00:06:02.930> one<00:06:03.050> of<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.200> hardest<00:06:03.500> things<00:06:03.770> like

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
probably one of the hardest things like

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.160 
probably one of the hardest things like
if<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.430> use<00:06:04.610> a<00:06:04.640> machine<00:06:05.060> gun<00:06:05.330> and<00:06:05.540> you<00:06:05.990> can

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
if you use a machine gun and you can

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.530 
if you use a machine gun and you can
control<00:06:06.560> just<00:06:06.920> a<00:06:07.070> side<00:06:07.250> of<00:06:07.280> a<00:06:07.460> map<00:06:07.670> then<00:06:08.030> that's

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
control just a side of a map then that's

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.510 
control just a side of a map then that's
going<00:06:08.690> to<00:06:08.780> be<00:06:08.870> a<00:06:08.900> lot<00:06:09.050> easier<00:06:09.110> for<00:06:09.620> you<00:06:09.770> live<00:06:09.980> on

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
going to be a lot easier for you live on

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.100 
going to be a lot easier for you live on
a<00:06:10.580> big<00:06:10.760> open<00:06:11.060> map<00:06:11.180> like<00:06:11.390> this<00:06:11.420> cold-blooded
