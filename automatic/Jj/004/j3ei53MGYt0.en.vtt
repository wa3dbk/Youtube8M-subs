00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.330
 hello friends I am daisy del canal eco days 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.930
 inn thank you for being with me again 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.150
 and now I want to show you how to power 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.630
 whitening teeth without having to go 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.029
 the dentist is as always something 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.689
 practically free and totally 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 natural 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.940
 Well now I'm going to explain what 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.000
 try this is a treatment that I have 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.650
 been using for several months 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.900
 I'm going to show you my teeth 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.230
 these above will be much more white 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.790
 because it's a bridge but those below me 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.790
 I had pretty yellow 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.090
 and with this I am super happy because 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.360
 they have clarified me and then I'm going to 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.460
 show this picture of how they looked before 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.610
 and before I had not clarified them because the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.500
 bridge that I had was pretty yellow and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.439
 was bleached these then he was going to 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.890
 Noticing is going to be a very old bridge and 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:34.369
 Now that I 've changed, if I know 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.469
 I noticed at the bottom here a little 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.299
 more yellow and with this treatment 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.520
 I'm super happy because one day I 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.899
 My husband says there is white 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.299
 see the teeth 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.049
 now I show you what it is about 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.929
 what are we going to do with one more banana 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.329
 well the peel of a banana we are going to 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.380
 take a piece of the whole banana 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.060
 I do not know so mature that is still to be 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.500
 see a little green he cited here because I 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.520
 I have realized that it is when it gives better 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.149
 result we are going to take a bit and with 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.810
 the inner part of the banana we are going to 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.810
 do this 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.580
 We can do this several times to 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.370
 day but especially on the night before 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.430
 go to sleep as I said with my teeth 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.640
 very clean and it is not necessary to wash 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.650
 teeth after putting on the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.650
 banana peel because that's how 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.940
 is going to take effect and also here 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.239
 I'm going to leave another advice but this 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:06.330
 treatment is only to do it 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.489
 once a week or every ten days 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.880
 because it is not advisable to do it very 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.930
 followed now I explain to you how it is done and 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.000
 what are we going to use 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.849
 for this recipe what we are going to use 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.090
 is oxygenated water from the one they sell in 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.680
 pharmacy and baking soda yo 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.590
 I always have the bicarbonate in a 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.500
 jar because I use it for everything then 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.920
 we will be able 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.540
 enrique carbÃ³ I do not have a bottle 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.490
 because that way we can leave prepared 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.010
 this to continue using it 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.370
 we throw a quantity that you 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.370
 want 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.640
 and then we're going to add and the oxygenated 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.640
 but for a little 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.080
 to make a paste 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.920
 we throw and we will have one more pasta or 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.019
 less like this I get liquid with the 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.019
 which are we going to brush our teeth 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:22.970
 now let's catch some of the pasta 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.540
 that we have prepared we put in the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.540
 brush 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.140
 and we proceed to brush the teeth 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.330
 or not 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.000
 good friends I hope these tips 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.310

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.340
 a radiant smile 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.560
