00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
the same thing on xbox 360 but I think

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.850 
the same thing on xbox 360 but I think
that<00:04:45.160> does<00:04:45.580> new<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.850> new<00:04:46.570> interactive<00:04:47.229> wall

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
that does new a new interactive wall

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.010 
that does new a new interactive wall
it's<00:04:48.400> really<00:04:48.639> cool<00:04:48.910> because<00:04:48.970> basically<00:04:49.570> every

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
it's really cool because basically every

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.750 
it's really cool because basically every
time<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.380> you're<00:04:50.560> playing<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.800> game<00:04:50.979> it<00:04:51.190> tells

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
time that you're playing a game it tells

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.790 
time that you're playing a game it tells
you<00:04:52.030> like<00:04:52.389> what<00:04:52.750> you've<00:04:52.900> done<00:04:53.139> and<00:04:53.470> what<00:04:53.530> your

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
you like what you've done and what your

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.140 
you like what you've done and what your
friends<00:04:54.040> are<00:04:54.130> playing<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.700> how<00:04:54.790> many<00:04:54.910> times

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
friends are playing and how many times

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.060 
friends are playing and how many times
the<00:04:55.360> play<00:04:55.510> things<00:04:55.870> like<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:56.710> think<00:04:56.740> it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
the play things like that and I think it

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.890 
the play things like that and I think it
also<00:04:57.160> has<00:04:57.490> has<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.060> feature<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.630> turning

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
also has has the feature of you turning

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.680 
also has has the feature of you turning
that<00:04:59.080> off<00:04:59.139> but<00:04:59.590> I<00:04:59.800> think<00:05:00.190> that's<00:05:00.310> pretty<00:05:00.430> cool

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
that off but I think that's pretty cool

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.480 
that off but I think that's pretty cool
beyond<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:02.350> console<00:05:02.800> itself<00:05:02.889> is<00:05:03.220> really

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
beyond that the console itself is really

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.120 
beyond that the console itself is really
nice<00:05:04.240> like<00:05:04.510> it<00:05:04.720> has<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:04.960> sleek<00:05:05.530> look<00:05:05.919> it's

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
nice like it has a sleek look it's

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.159 
nice like it has a sleek look it's
pretty<00:05:06.729> modern<00:05:07.240> looking<00:05:07.570> as<00:05:07.750> well<00:05:07.990> the

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
pretty modern looking as well the

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.960 
pretty modern looking as well the
controls<00:05:08.530> are<00:05:08.680> amazing<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.610> only<00:05:09.760> thing<00:05:09.910> I

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
controls are amazing the only thing I

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.600 
controls are amazing the only thing I
like<00:05:10.120> about<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.419> controller<00:05:10.780> is<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.430> I

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
like about the controller is that it I

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.659 
like about the controller is that it I
just<00:05:13.389> it<00:05:14.020> doesn't<00:05:14.169> stay<00:05:14.650> charged<00:05:15.100> very<00:05:15.460> long

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
just it doesn't stay charged very long

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.340 
just it doesn't stay charged very long
you<00:05:15.880> have<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.120> keep<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.510> charged<00:05:16.720> quite<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.050> bit

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
you have to keep it charged quite a bit

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.110 
you have to keep it charged quite a bit
because<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.889> that<00:05:18.310> little<00:05:18.550> blue<00:05:18.789> light<00:05:19.090> that

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
because of that little blue light that

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.409 
because of that little blue light that
it<00:05:19.419> has<00:05:19.770> right<00:05:20.770> there<00:05:20.979> by<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.160> mother<00:05:22.120> but

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
it has right there by the mother but

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.469 
it has right there by the mother but
very<00:05:23.080> front<00:05:23.650> of<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:23.830> controller<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.850> that's

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
very front of the controller and that's

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.580 
very front of the controller and that's
what<00:05:25.630> I've<00:05:25.690> been<00:05:25.720> noticing<00:05:26.050> lately<00:05:26.320> it<00:05:26.560> just

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
what I've been noticing lately it just

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.710 
what I've been noticing lately it just
hasn't<00:05:27.039> been<00:05:27.220> how<00:05:27.789> I<00:05:27.820> been<00:05:27.970> wanting<00:05:28.479> but

getting used to call of duty ghosts is

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.120 
getting used to call of duty ghosts is
pretty<00:05:31.690> easier<00:05:32.200> for<00:05:32.440> me<00:05:32.530> I'm<00:05:32.830> actually

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
pretty easier for me I'm actually

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.890 
pretty easier for me I'm actually
enjoying<00:05:33.400> playing<00:05:33.880> call<00:05:34.360> of<00:05:34.389> duty<00:05:34.510> ghosts

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
enjoying playing call of duty ghosts

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.469 
enjoying playing call of duty ghosts
here<00:05:35.530> on<00:05:35.770> on<00:05:36.310> the<00:05:36.490> new<00:05:36.610> consulate<00:05:37.210> I'm<00:05:37.330> just
