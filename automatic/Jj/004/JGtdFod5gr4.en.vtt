00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 oh my god hey people, you know that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.910
 School is no better advice 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.830
 I'm sorry, I 'm sorry 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.540
 Almost my high school diploma and never has 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.219
 go back to school and there 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.960
 I noticed there are so many things 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.500
 I learned during my school days 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.550
 have this so unnecessary and meaningless 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.050
 the world for the rest of my life 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.240
 no longer broken and there is simply 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.680
 so many things that are so old at the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.330
 school with which I am gods now 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.369
 thanks no longer has to beat around but 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 many of you probably and anticipated 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.980
 said in our society today 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.780
 you need a good school diploma 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.880
 to achieve anything at all 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.530
 So people stay in school no matter how 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.180
 mertens she is that means for a student 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.770
 a year-long print and later good 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120
 to get grades and accordingly 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.800
 also to be successful in life 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.570
 Of course you can also blablabla one 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.340
 nice life without a high school diploma or 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.660
 have training but that comes in the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.039
 Most certainly not in question 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 in the end, we spend students 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.370
 for years with any things in it 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
 our head to hermann we directly 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 after the test or a job again 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.350
 to forget 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.910
 that is sad but true in the clear 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.260
 elementary school and also at the beginning in the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.239
 secondary school is still being taught 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.580
 Important things like reading 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.290
 to write calculating cooking baking crochet 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.970
 sew how to use a computer and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.100
 Much more for everyday life 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.720
 so school is not important 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.760
 it is also unnecessary for me to realize that school 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.380
 try on the biggest possible rock 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.240
 general knowledge to cover the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.400
 alumni later, many doors are open 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 thank you for school you are anyway 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.369
 sister to those from the ninth or 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.619
 tenth grade you only learn things 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.990
 where i ask myself where is the relevance 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.759
 it has remained that way for a lifetime 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 bullshit you learn because you still fall 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.130
 more things that are very unnatural in the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.759
 then they write me in the school 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.900
 Comments 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.040
 if you like the video you know 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.700
 what you can do and now a lot 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.700
 fun with the video 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.540
 first duty subjects such as music art 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.009
 or religion these are all things 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.780
 are interests or faith dependent 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.880
 why do not you do such things 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.380
 voluntary if I do not paint an elephant 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.909
 can or between the atomic pentatonics 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.280
 and can distinguish chromatic is that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.259
 no doomsday why not do it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.479
 Politics history and media literacy 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.460
 to diverge things that are relevant 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.229
 are for everyday life for the future 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.700
 It is always important to know what 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.320
 At the start we live it is important too 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.390
 know how we got there and 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.009
 It is important how technology works 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.049
 how social media works is it 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.190
 important what can I do that and all 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.470
 that's what you want to fool me 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.670
 Secondly, school reading 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.739
 Do not get me wrong books 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.420
 great and important and it is important too 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.190
 Themes based on contemporary 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.049
 all things correct to understand everything 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.700
 right but there are no worse ones 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.680
 Book selection as that of my teachers 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.440
 During my school days only holds teachers 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.760
 many of you are not cool off a lot 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.140
 In my entire schooling there was 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.510
 maybe two or three books to me 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.349
 have fallen from about 20 books 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.450
 which I had to read why third 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.280
 Matt still has something to do with it 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.760
 say of course , is important for 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.769
 things like bwl electronics informatics vwl 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.170
 and so on, but I am very sorry 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.030
 I have been able to do well since the tenth 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.930
 nothing more to do with it so people 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.890
 now come a few things 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.140
 probably only at my school 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.070
 stupid are those with you are not so 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.329
 but you can also visit me in the 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.450
 comments ask if this is synonymous with you 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.220
 so thank you fourth foreign language i am 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.140
 someone who speaks rather better than 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.970
 in mathematical subjects is why can 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.950
 I only french and or 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.040
 dutch waves thanks for this 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.420
 of course, if not more 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.040
 I also want to learn languages 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.290
 another school we go more 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.730
 offers languages â€‹â€‹that is unfortunately only 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.109
 one and a half already deposited and there must 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.700
 I have one instead of three minutes 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.370
 one and a half hours to go to school 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.450
 Okay, okay, I'm doing fifth physics 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.459
 chemistry and biology 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.109
 These three subjects are very important to you 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.120
 to understand how our world is at all 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.220
 some people are working very well 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.769
 in these subjects and some not 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.760
 like me and I stand by and that 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.739
 Do not be bad because you can not 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.430
 everything can and still be interesting 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.750
 me these subjects 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.340
 why can i only do one of three waves 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.680
 For example, I had one year 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.389
 biology in the eighth grade or something 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.040
 the only thing we did all year long 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.719
 once in one 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.030
 cosco to look like that 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:59.010
 works at all and after that babies 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.900
 colorfully painted thank you mr 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.969
 Now I know how the world works 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.170
 People There are so many things left 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.400
 I could all of you now then with you 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.569
 but the video will be too long so 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.280
 Write me the comments if you 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.629
 a second part volt rates this 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.799
 video if you liked writes 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.629
