00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 for me fernandão was the greatest player 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.150
 of the history of inter is not what 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.529
 represented as a player and for what 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.529
 represented as a person 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.780
 by the leadership he had for 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.130
 its action at decisive moments in 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:24.680
 great of these great games in the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.029
 liberators before knowing exactly the 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.099
 that it was necessary 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.840
 mobilizing their peers 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.480
 his companions 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.160
 at the same time he charged the same 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.780
 time was one of them at the same time he 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.620
 leadership but at the same time was 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.620
 participatory and did not help the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.410
 I was at home sleeping, and mine. 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.339
 phone was set to silent 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.239
 but the team has a little noise is that 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.850
 that I leave for something happened 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.580
 I have the ability to answer yesterday 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.990
 1st to coordinate with this small noise 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.600
 noise the phone is and resistance 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.270
 existence itself was five in the morning in a 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.270
 understanding will go well because it started 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.190
 to enter by a torpedo there connection 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.640
 phone by pedro solved 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.240
 understand and there is the first torpedo that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.530
 It was the Hadrian's not our job 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.780
 you into a person who has a 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.000
 very very big connection with fernandão 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.539
 and he put me simply fernando 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.539
 died 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.859
 looks represents a lot to the club not 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.469
 to the club by what it meant 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.170
 for what he presented within the field 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.490
 for which he represented as a person 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.670
 especially for me is because in my 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.469
 I like I always highlight 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.810
 the people who helped me to help me 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:57.599
 in my management and was not any 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.189
 has helped a lot since November 2004 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.130
 when he arrived until the time when 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.759
 I leave because I left before not only in 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.319
 2006 divided I was very familiar with the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.039
 things despite being a player the 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:13.829
 captain of the year team I shared with him is 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.390
 a lucid person and because he was a 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:20.510
 conditions to discuss things high 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.250
 level so hiring strategies 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.860
 strategy interview strategies 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.910
 interview for the fans 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.910
 attended not attended not going 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.500
 accept if this or that is often 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.500
 discuss with him this strategy 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:40.879
 I do not even remember to remember that in the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.040
 Eve gave I learned this in 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.170
 world did not know in the world 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.159
 I did not know before even though they 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.159
 They talked to each other and determined 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:55.720
 one of the eight years and seven 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:58.549
 being taken by the businessman and 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.400
 on arriving in Europe all the promises 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.069
 that were made have occurred 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.560
 were civil ied frustrated 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.950
 suddenly without money suddenly without 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.609
 destination suddenly in a situation is not 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.409
 totally doubtful for its sequel 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.040
 on the European continent 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:22.010
 and he's not was in Italy country 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.980
 I was in Italy and there was a 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.430
 information is almost already in the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.680
 despair that there was a Brazilian 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.739
 player to play in the goiás who played in the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.540
 olympique de marseille and that he was a 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.870
 good person who could help that 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.510
 influential person and asked for some 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.780
 a kind of transportation went to 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.000
 marcelo and there button button went to the club 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.560
 called fernando told the sad story 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.530
 of fernandão took home again and 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.810
 started helping help him 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.329
 financially helped him to 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.669
 started to have the first few days or even 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.879
 I was destined for a passage 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:07.879
 company to come back and then we do not 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.889
 we knew this and there at the end in the 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.829
 the eve of the game where 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:15.409
 solidarity fellowship in action 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.079
 joint with the evandro mota has taken 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.060
 knowledge of this passage and then he 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.680
 set the tone that he says that he 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.710
 always played at that time the players 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.659
 on this episode and he told 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.970
 she's the names, right? 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:31.840
 and it was exciting at that moment was 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.840
 exciting from here 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.839
 remembering the last time at the party 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.999
 International's birthday was 

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:41.919
 first was on the fish later on the day of the 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:44.649
 I play the day of the party itself 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.959
 said that we were not together 

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:49.509
 I met him at the exit was 

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:51.459
 leaving and leaving in a bid without wanting without 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.099
 matching the matches at the exit is 

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:56.079
 entering the van and into the car and 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.489

00:04:57.489 --> 00:05:04.179
 a barbecue and that was working together 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.669
 and then we do not even make a movie 

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:08.679
 because I then had to travel 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.209
 I did not call until there to say no 

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:15.279

00:05:13.209 --> 00:05:17.319
 last our last meeting was the 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.669
 loss of feeling Birth loss 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.459
 a partner of a friend of a person 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.229
