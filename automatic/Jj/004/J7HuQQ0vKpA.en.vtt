an<00:00:48.899> internet<00:00:49.410> connection<00:00:49.969> requires<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.390> 30

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
an internet connection requires about 30

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.600 
an internet connection requires about 30
megabytes<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.620> hard<00:00:53.149> drive<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.920> works<00:00:56.250> on

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
megabytes of hard drive and it works on

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.389 
megabytes of hard drive and it works on
with<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.690> high-definition<00:00:58.620> TV<00:00:59.039> supports

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
with the high-definition TV supports

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
with the high-definition TV supports
480p<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.890> 720p<00:01:02.960> instructions<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> back

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
480p and 720p instructions on the back

are in English and Spanish

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.020 
are in English and Spanish
so<00:01:07.260> probably<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> game<00:01:08.010> will<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.460> Spanish

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
