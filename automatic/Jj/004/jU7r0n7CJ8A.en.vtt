00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and then you have a Muslim group that

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.030 
and then you have a Muslim group that
says<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.899> Jesus<00:00:34.230> Christ<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.739> all<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
people who follow him are a bunch of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
people who follow him are a bunch of
infidels<00:00:36.660> who<00:00:36.750> should<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.170> essentially

understanding<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> mean<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> church<00:00:41.010> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
understanding that I mean if a church is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920 
understanding that I mean if a church is
nothing<00:00:41.489> more<00:00:41.670> than<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.239> facility<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
then should the church being rented out

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.709 
then should the church being rented out
to<00:00:49.230> show<00:00:49.379> adult<00:00:49.680> movies<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> weekend<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
mean where where does this end how far

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
mean where where does this end how far
does<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> church<00:00:54.899> facility

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
