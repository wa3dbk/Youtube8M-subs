once i hit 300 i'm always going to be

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.050 
once i hit 300 i'm always going to be
pushing<00:03:03.940> 300<00:03:04.629> on<00:03:04.750> all<00:03:05.079> three<00:03:05.379> lifts<00:03:05.769> okay<00:03:06.489> so

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
pushing 300 on all three lifts okay so

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.940 
pushing 300 on all three lifts okay so
that's<00:03:07.450> basically<00:03:07.659> what<00:03:07.989> i<00:03:08.079> mean<00:03:08.260> by<00:03:08.379> 300

going to be like I think that maybe the
series<00:03:13.090> what<00:03:13.569> role<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.959> 300<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:14.889> like<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> name

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
series what role to 300 just like a name

to something creative kind of creative
some<00:03:17.799> my<00:03:17.889> creative<00:03:18.310> instead<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.849> just<00:03:19.000> putting

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
some my creative instead of just putting

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.940 
that was like I think that was what 55
pounds<00:03:34.690> then<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.680> went<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:35.949> 60

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
pounds then I went to 60

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
then I went to 65 I think I stayed there
