00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.400
 great we are in a new video of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.929
 assassin's creed 4 black click on which 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.759
 As it is the title I will explain to you how 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.049
 basically have infinite money in 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.639
 this video game the truth guys the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 money is pretty pretty enough 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.490
 expendable in this video game both 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.650
 how to advance in campaign mode 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.789
 as to basically pass something well 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.500
 because you are going to have to improve yours 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.880
 barto oil and so on so good 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.220
 guys are you going to come to this location 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.619
 of the map that is basically west 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.210
 west west of the whole map are you going to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.099
 measure to this location where I am 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.149
 exactly and you are assured that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.920
 you have say that the displacement 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.989
 fast enabled on this vantage point and you 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.850
 I say I am right now in the west in the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.290
 western maximum basically from the map and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 you are going to pull the watchtower towards 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.770
 water is worth following my steps because it is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.050
 very essential that you follow the steps 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.579
 that I show you in the video so good 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.260
 you are going to hide between the branches and look 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.039
 how a jaguar appears and you are going to kill the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.039
 jaguar is worth 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.360
 You guarantee that each and basically 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.430
 each of the ribs of the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.170
 you watch in the branches os 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.969
 camouflage and kill the jaguar because 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.739
 every jaguar skin you have and for 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.750
 every bone and because you have 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.949
 give a pretty important pasta so 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 what good guys are you going to follow 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.830
 the route 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.979
 see how I had been regenerated 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.659
 jaguar completely randomly 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.909
 in front of faces and that will try us 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.740
 attack you complete the sequence 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.030
 of buttons and then let's say it will give 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.770
 back this just made makes 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.780
 moment so it will let you say that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 complete another sequence of buttons that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.350
 will be completed correctly and that 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.030
 it's not hard enough to do it 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.890
 you can say that after leaving the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.970
 animal carry the skin of the water 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.890
 then you are going to activate the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 rapid displacement watchtower you come back 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.190
 to throw and so you can do 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.229
 all the times you want practically 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.880
 then you said it put between the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.940
 branches now you are going to see how another appears 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.470
 jaguar you kill him of course and then 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.369
 you are going to follow the same path as 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.350
 we have done previously 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.360
 once you follow the tour of what has been said 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.610
 wait for today that we say it comes out 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.649
 jaguar out there hanging around 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.240
 random the truth there are times it takes 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.500
 more to go out and there are other times that comes out 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.270
 suppose this idea fixes here as 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.070
 I appear here in the area where I should 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.720
 to leave and I stay there on the plane and it's 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 where is the jaguar but good guys 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.640
 I'm telling you, stuck around here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.229
 in this area so to speak and I 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.240
 will come out of nowhere and I tell you it 's a 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.500
 clichÃ© that the truth is that not apart 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.930
 I do not think they're going to patch these 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.300
 heights so simply taken advantage of 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.950
 of this situation so to speak and nothing 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.900
 more notice as here the jaguar returns to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.370
 make your round and now complete the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.440
 sequence of buttons correctly and 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.030
 could you say that skin another 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.370
 once to the jaguar so to speak mom 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.930
 then guys if you do it is for 5 or 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.880
 10 minutes or you can make a pasta 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.440
 incredible because now it's just going 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.150
 towards a reality to seduce him 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.520
 even in the development inventory 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.280
 You can sell jaguar skin and fixed 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.900
 like me for 35 jaguar skins me go 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.580
 to give 7 thousand reais and then also 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.140
 we can also sell the bones of 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.240
 jaguar that is all a chocolate, let's say 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.040
 they are not so much that we say so much 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.080
 but let's say that everything is adding not by 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.390
 what the more money the better and nothing 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.980
 more guys I say do not tell you that the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.570
 things in assassin's creed 4 black clan 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.610
 they are not truly excessive in 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.470
 how much does it cost so the 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.850
 While great truth is that this trick and 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.080
 nothing more guys and I tell you if you like 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.250
 the video I would love to vote it if it is 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.440
 that is simply clicking on the button 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.090
 I like it and it takes a moment of nothing and 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.530
 if you are not subscribed, it is not zero for 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.570
 do not lose in another video tricks neither 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.040
 no other life in general and see you 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.990
 in the next video of what else you 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.430
 like the channel go and nothing else 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.090
 this infinite and more 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.090
 we were
