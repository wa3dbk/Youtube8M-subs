00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.490
 we had a very intense start with 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.340
 many parties in a few days and the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.280
 true that 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.500
 Thank you for a few days of rest 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.100
 also to be able to train 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.470
 all together and well we also had 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.910
 some injured players who have 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.300
 take this time to recover 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.750
 and we are more available so that 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.390
 It is also a good one if it is good 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.270
 we have started the first block good 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.340
 this we've had the matches before 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.900
 of the break we have 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 It has been been 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.130
 we can make a satisfactory balance 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.200
 of the first matches 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.520
 achieve the classification that was 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.180
 important to the club for 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.810
 amateurs and for the team too 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.579
 and well let's say started well we can 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.409
 have started better 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.439
 but well we have not started we have not 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.649
 started badly and does not work will serve us 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.649
 nothing to have started well if we do not follow 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.009
 in the same line especially in the league 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.990
 which is the championship that we most 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.310
 it matters the same because it is the one that 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.140
 comes and what 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.829
 good the one that marks a little what goes to 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.990
 be the season because in the end if 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.250
 we are where we are and we can 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.680
 enjoy a competition like 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.600
 champions this year because it will be for the 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.729
 league that we did last year had 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.049
 very high expectations and I have to say 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.979
 that has now been fulfilled in terms of 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.380
 the whole club the people the teams the 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.520
 peers the human level and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.710
 soccer of the wardrobe 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.770
 my own sensations within the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.810
 field and out then the expectations be 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.149
 very high and I want to say that those have 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.490
 fulfilled so much so in that 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.219
 I can not be happier 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.920
 good some party better and others I've 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.819
 stepped out 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.730
 I have left the second part is is something 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.610
 normal here there is competition just like in 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.530
 All sites 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.750
 and I am a player who fights to play 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.910
 same as the rest of my colleagues and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.890
 then the coach choose the best 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.900
 team I always think that when 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.240
 games because he has earned it and when 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.180
 I do not play is because I earned it 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.450
 also so that's not a problem what 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.710
 important is to be prepared I think that 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.750
 there have been times that he has not played the 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.250
 beginning and ending is not a part of 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.930
 done a good paper and that's also 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.470
 It is also important that the players 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.470
 what 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.320
 that comes out of the second part in the 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.510
 maximum of those who also start 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.540
 we have not given 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.069
 so arrogant as to think that by 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.640
 have played on a team like the real 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.459
 madrid I have to have here a 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.190
 special status let alone here the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.930
 footballers are of great quality 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.280
 also human football are a group 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:12.319
 very good I come here with him to 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.440
 try to help contribute my maximum already 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.240
 when the coach tells me to leave 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.630
 to play with all the deserved desires 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.450
 this club good are the two things are is 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.670
 a good team that are already had 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.580
 some changes but that is 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.890
 historically because of very few 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.650
 changes and a team very well 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.900
 empathic and very brave and there that 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.900
 It is also not very comfortable 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.470
 my personal experience has always been 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.670
 complicated to play there I have not always 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.060
 obtained good results like the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.720
 society in that sense but but good 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.360
 each match is different are 90 minutes 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.620
 and we are in a moment we have recovered 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.080
 players and I think the team is with 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.150
 force with confidence to for doing 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.600
 our game get a good 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.960
 result but it 's clear that it's going 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.140
 it's going to be difficult 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.580
 and we will try it to the maximum but 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.950
 well there either in what is always 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.130
 always complicated good football made 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.140
 accept all the smart footballer 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.490
 makes everyone accept what the 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.470
 coach who is the one who knows 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.760
 how you have to manage the group and what 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.730
 what do you have to do 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.800
 obviously they are necessary is necessary 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.230
 a good template to face a 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.880
 season with three competitions if 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.000
 you intend to compete in the three that is what 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.270
 what do we want and then 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.680
 the coach is the manager of this 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.139
 template that I think we have a 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.439
 full template and 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.389
 and fortunately with players in 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:57.800
 all the positions and players that 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.099
 can play in various positions what 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.409
 which makes possible the 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.879
 rotations the player obviously 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.020
 he wants to play whenever he's good 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.939
 conditions but the coach be that 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.249
 knows how to manage that and the player is 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:15.279
 for when when I put you in the field 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:19.000
 to do it as well as possible and little else 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:21.370
 Well, let's face it 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.890
 in a professional manner we know that now 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.730
 well in many games you have to be careful 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.730
 especially since 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.890
 you have to take a break from each 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:37.249
 party and good I'll be like a good 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:41.089
 professional that is normal 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:42.859
 and then at the mental level, because the step 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:45.739
 step we know we have many matches 

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:48.030
 but we know that we have the levante and 

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:50.160
 That is the first thing 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.810
 but that we are going to occupy and then already 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.210
 starting on Sunday we will start 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.670
 think about the next and so step by step 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.830
 let's look 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.290
 let's look first at what is near 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.100
 and then we'll go to the next thing in the 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.070
 group 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.600
 well champions league any group that 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.330
 would have touched us was going to be difficult and 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.900
 this then is difficult and at the same time 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.090
 exciting but as I tell you that was 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.730
 there we live the raffle we analyze it 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.270
 and now we leave it a bit apart 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.530
 why 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.210
 as repeated many times because that 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.230
 we have the league and not just the league 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.350
 it is the most important competition 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:35.689
 and we are going to try to add three points and 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:39.439
 then we will start thinking 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:40.580
 in the shakhtar party we are going to go to 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.739
 pick up that sure is going to be difficult 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.749
 how we got a little distracted 

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:46.099
 we will have to go wrong good 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:49.220
 focus it from the point of view 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:52.870
 positive for us a 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.870
 an illusion to see people 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:07:01.169
 is so excited about this party of 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:03.729
 cup as for europe and good is a 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:08.330
 direction that we have generated 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:13.000
 I can tell you that inside we can not 

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.000
 we can not measure ourselves 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.490
 with the illusion that they are having 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.330
 them right now because we 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:23.360
 we are in another in something else we are not 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:26.090
 still thinking about the Champions that 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.730
 It will come if we are not thinking of a 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.270
 party that we have on Saturday against a 

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.550
 team 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.770
 and 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.710
 difficult especially playing in his field and 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.130
 good 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.450
 I think we have three points there 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:45.020
 they can be very important to us 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.790
 and we have to go for them then 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:50.760
 Well , nice for people 

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.710
 I'm not going to say no but but good 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.420
 from inside the door wardrobe 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.140
 for inside we are rather in 

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.140
 something else still
