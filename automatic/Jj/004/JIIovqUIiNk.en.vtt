00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
goes for it all the time I mean really

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.320 
goes for it all the time I mean really
pushing<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.410> in<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.490> way<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.670> vocal<00:02:03.120> cords

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
pushing it in a way that vocal cords

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.730 
pushing it in a way that vocal cords
possibly<00:02:03.690> weren't<00:02:03.870> even<00:02:04.050> really<00:02:04.170> made<00:02:04.470> for

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
possibly weren't even really made for

possibly weren't even really made for
can<00:02:05.370> she<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.670> doing<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:07.710> actually

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
can she go on doing that I actually

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.059 
can she go on doing that I actually
think<00:02:08.640> she<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.929> would<00:02:10.439> venture<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.890> guess

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
think she can I I would venture to guess

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.149 
think she can I I would venture to guess
a<00:02:11.280> lot<00:02:11.609> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:12.060> things<00:02:12.329> that<00:02:12.659> occur<00:02:13.200> are<00:02:13.499> the

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
a lot of the things that occur are the

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.990 
a lot of the things that occur are the
performance<00:02:14.790> couple<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.450> all<00:02:15.599> the

performance couple to all the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.690 
performance couple to all the
activities<00:02:16.480> during<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> day<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.620> we<00:02:18.400> live<00:02:18.580> in

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
activities during the day and we live in

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.810 
activities during the day and we live in
a<00:02:18.790> society<00:02:19.180> now<00:02:19.510> where<00:02:20.110> people<00:02:20.710> are<00:02:21.490> doing

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
a society now where people are doing

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.940 
a society now where people are doing
that<00:02:22.240> much<00:02:22.450> more<00:02:22.750> even<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.260> they're<00:02:23.440> emailing

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that much more even if they're emailing

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.850 
that much more even if they're emailing
those<00:02:24.310> hundred<00:02:25.210> emails<00:02:25.450> result<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.440> extra

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
those hundred emails result in extra

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.640 
those hundred emails result in extra
phone<00:02:27.040> conversations<00:02:27.940> we<00:02:28.480> live<00:02:28.960> in<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.230> time

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
phone conversations we live in a time

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.070 
phone conversations we live in a time
where<00:02:30.010> we<00:02:30.610> do<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.820> tremendous<00:02:31.150> amount<00:02:31.570> with<00:02:31.840> our

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
where we do a tremendous amount with our

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.350 
where we do a tremendous amount with our
voice<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.680> it's<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.980> very<00:02:33.220> frenetic<00:02:33.670> type<00:02:34.120> of

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
voice and it's a very frenetic type of

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.900 
voice and it's a very frenetic type of
increased<00:02:34.780> pace<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.380> then<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.640> have<00:02:36.790> to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
increased pace and then you have to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.480 
increased pace and then you have to
perform<00:02:37.060> at<00:02:37.360> night<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.830> know<00:02:38.950> when<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.250> was

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
perform at night you know when I was

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.580 
perform at night you know when I was
younger<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:39.940> used<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.390> see<00:02:40.570> shows<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.350> shows

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
younger and used to see shows the shows

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.440 
younger and used to see shows the shows
were<00:02:41.770> actually<00:02:42.130> much<00:02:42.310> longer<00:02:42.760> than<00:02:42.940> but<00:02:43.420> I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
were actually much longer than but I

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.300 
were actually much longer than but I
don't<00:02:43.720> think<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.170> pace<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.830> human

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
don't think the pace of human

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.160 
don't think the pace of human
communication<00:02:45.490> was<00:02:46.270> anything<00:02:46.600> like<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.050> is

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
communication was anything like it is

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.740 
communication was anything like it is
today<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:48.010> might<00:02:48.250> think<00:02:48.520> this<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.700> all<00:02:49.030> you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
today you might think this is all you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.260 
today you might think this is all you
mentioned<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.170> technology<00:02:50.830> if<00:02:51.640> you'd<00:02:52.060> been

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
mentioned the technology if you'd been

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.500 
mentioned the technology if you'd been
performing<00:02:52.810> this<00:02:52.900> operation<00:02:53.130> 23<00:02:54.130> years<00:02:54.400> ago

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
performing this operation 23 years ago

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.979 
performing this operation 23 years ago
could<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.600> have<00:02:55.720> had<00:02:55.870> as<00:02:55.989> good<00:02:56.080> results<00:02:57.989> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
could you have had as good results the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.479 
could you have had as good results the
answer<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.560> probably<00:03:00.280> yes<00:03:01.380> except<00:03:02.380> much<00:03:03.190> more

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
answer is probably yes except much more

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.500 
answer is probably yes except much more
difficult<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.209> do<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.860> would<00:03:06.430> say<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:07.330> would

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
difficult to do so I would say it would

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.570 
difficult to do so I would say it would
have<00:03:07.570> taken<00:03:07.840> much<00:03:08.260> longer<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.040> would<00:03:09.370> been

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
have taken much longer and would been

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.150 
have taken much longer and would been
much<00:03:09.790> more<00:03:10.030> technically<00:03:10.630> difficult<00:03:11.160> but

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
much more technically difficult but

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.760 
much more technically difficult but
achievable<00:03:13.080> there<00:03:14.080> are<00:03:14.230> certain<00:03:14.560> things

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
achievable there are certain things

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.920 
achievable there are certain things
about<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.340> technology<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.060> have<00:03:16.450> just<00:03:16.690> made

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
about the technology that have just made

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.190 
about the technology that have just made
it<00:03:17.080> very<00:03:17.770> very<00:03:18.100> straightforward<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.870> a

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
it very very straightforward and in a

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.770 
it very very straightforward and in a
word<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:20.860> mean<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.640> don't<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.630> don't

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
word you I mean you don't you don't

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.300 
word you I mean you don't you don't
expect<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.230> be<00:03:23.260> seeing<00:03:23.560> her<00:03:23.709> again<00:03:23.860> at<00:03:24.190> all

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
expect to be seeing her again at all

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.100 
expect to be seeing her again at all
soon<00:03:25.410> well<00:03:26.410> just<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:26.830> checks<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.390> think

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
soon well just for checks but I I think

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.600 
soon well just for checks but I I think
what<00:03:29.230> you're<00:03:29.350> asking<00:03:29.380> do<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:29.950> expect<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.580> be

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
what you're asking do I expect to be

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.330 
what you're asking do I expect to be
operating<00:03:31.330> here<00:03:31.450> again<00:03:31.720> operating<00:03:32.650> on<00:03:33.070> her

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
operating here again operating on her

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.130 
operating here again operating on her
again<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.120> near<00:03:34.390> future<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.900> answer

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
again in the near future and the answer

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.699 
again in the near future and the answer
is<00:03:35.260> no<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> think<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:36.190> in<00:03:36.910> fact<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:38.530> my

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
is no I think that in fact to my

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.830 
is no I think that in fact to my
assessment<00:03:39.310> she<00:03:39.459> sounds<00:03:39.820> smoother<00:03:40.209> now<00:03:40.390> then

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
assessment she sounds smoother now then

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.320 
assessment she sounds smoother now then
than<00:03:41.260> before<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.950> her<00:03:42.400> vocal<00:03:42.760> folds<00:03:43.090> are<00:03:43.209> in

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
than before and her vocal folds are in

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.600 
than before and her vocal folds are in
excellent<00:03:43.810> condition<00:03:44.010> doctors<00:03:45.010> equals<00:03:45.340> in

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
excellent condition doctors equals in
