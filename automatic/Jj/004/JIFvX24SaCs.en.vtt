and<00:01:34.640> keep<00:01:34.819> that<00:01:35.060> from<00:01:35.329> spinning<00:01:35.780> or<00:01:35.929> make<00:01:36.140> a

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
and keep that from spinning or make a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.319 
and keep that from spinning or make a
different<00:01:36.590> button<00:01:36.799> or<00:01:37.069> something<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.119> that's

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
different button or something so that's

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.020 
different button or something so that's
what<00:01:38.450> I'm<00:01:38.509> drawing<00:01:38.719> my<00:01:38.810> attention<00:01:38.929> today<00:01:39.610> and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500

I'm<00:01:48.229> going<00:01:48.319> to<00:01:48.380> take<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.649> apart<00:01:48.860> open<00:01:49.220> it<00:01:49.280> up

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
I'm going to take it apart open it up

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.620 
I'm going to take it apart open it up
and<00:01:49.579> look<00:01:49.700> at<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:49.909> inside<00:01:50.000> see<00:01:50.420> if<00:01:50.450> there's

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
and look at the inside see if there's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.089 
and look at the inside see if there's
something<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:50.840> can<00:01:50.929> do<00:01:51.140> from<00:01:51.289> inside<00:01:51.860> because<00:01:52.039> I

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
something I can do from inside because I

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.550 
something I can do from inside because I
don't<00:01:52.369> want<00:01:52.549> it<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.670> fall<00:01:52.880> off<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.420> don't<00:01:54.049> like

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
don't want it to fall off I don't like

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.050 
don't want it to fall off I don't like
that<00:01:54.709> screw<00:01:55.099> right<00:01:55.340> there<00:01:55.399> because<00:01:55.849> I<00:01:55.909> don't

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
that screw right there because I don't

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.789 
that screw right there because I don't
trust<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:56.720> think<00:01:56.899> it'll<00:01:57.020> fall<00:01:57.259> off<00:01:57.289> out<00:01:57.679> in

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
trust it I think it'll fall off out in

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.479 
trust it I think it'll fall off out in
the<00:01:57.860> field<00:01:58.270> anyway<00:01:59.270> that's<00:01:59.599> where<00:01:59.780> we're<00:01:59.899> at

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
the field anyway that's where we're at

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:06.609 
the field anyway that's where we're at
I'll<00:02:01.489> keep<00:02:01.640> tip<00:02:01.849> speed<00:02:04.390> alright<00:02:05.390> guys<00:02:05.619> here's

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
I'll keep tip speed alright guys here's

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.959 
I'll keep tip speed alright guys here's
what<00:02:06.679> that<00:02:06.860> switch<00:02:07.099> looks<00:02:07.340> like<00:02:07.579> when<00:02:07.909> you

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
what that switch looks like when you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.979 
what that switch looks like when you
take<00:02:08.119> it<00:02:08.209> apart<00:02:09.519> there's<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.819> little<00:02:11.750> cover

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
take it apart there's a little cover

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.150 
take it apart there's a little cover
that<00:02:12.170> fits<00:02:12.319> in<00:02:12.530> there<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:14.920> covers<00:02:15.920> everything

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
that fits in there and covers everything

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.910 
that fits in there and covers everything
up<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:17.120> there<00:02:17.269> goes<00:02:17.389> like<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.810> let's<00:02:18.650> screw

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
up so there goes like that let's screw

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.490 
up so there goes like that let's screw
in<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.329> anyway<00:02:20.329> the<00:02:20.720> actual<00:02:21.019> kill<00:02:21.200> switch

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
in it anyway the actual kill switch

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.069 
in it anyway the actual kill switch
itself<00:02:22.450> my<00:02:23.450> hands<00:02:23.690> out<00:02:23.900> son<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:26.540> just<00:02:26.840> this

light right you can see there's a hole

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.559 
light right you can see there's a hole
goes<00:02:33.680> all<00:02:33.799> way<00:02:33.920> through<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.250> which<00:02:35.180> will<00:02:35.359> allow

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
goes all way through it which will allow

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.839 
me to put a screw through there which is
good<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:39.380> can<00:02:39.530> see<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.799> hole<00:02:41.560> has<00:02:42.560> got<00:02:42.799> a

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
good and you can see the hole has got a

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.449 
good and you can see the hole has got a
cutout<00:02:43.849> in<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.859> well<00:02:45.859> then<00:02:45.980> so<00:02:46.160> what<00:02:46.340> I've

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
cutout in it well then so what I've

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.809 
cutout in it well then so what I've
decided<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:47.030> do<00:02:47.889> is<00:02:48.889> put<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> screw<00:02:49.579> through

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
decided to do is put a screw through

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.350 
decided to do is put a screw through
there

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.140 

and<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:55.350> took<00:02:55.410> some<00:02:55.590> hard<00:02:56.040> plastic<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.850> had

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
and I took some hard plastic that I had

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.430 
and I took some hard plastic that I had
and<00:02:58.220> took<00:02:59.220> my<00:02:59.370> dremel<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.230> dribbled<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.290> down

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
and took my dremel and dribbled it down

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.960 
and took my dremel and dribbled it down
to<00:03:01.590> make<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:01.980> makeshift<00:03:02.460> button<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:04.970> it's

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
to make this makeshift button and it's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.490 
to make this makeshift button and it's
hard<00:03:06.180> enough<00:03:06.270> plastic<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.020> could<00:03:07.230> drill<00:03:07.470> a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
hard enough plastic that I could drill a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.520 
hard enough plastic that I could drill a
hole<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.100> actually<00:03:08.580> self<00:03:09.180> tap<00:03:09.450> us<00:03:09.690> allen<00:03:10.440> head

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
hole and actually self tap us allen head

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.760 
hole and actually self tap us allen head
screw<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:13.110> problem<00:03:13.410> with<00:03:13.500> this<00:03:13.590> is

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
screw in it and a problem with this is

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.790 
screw in it and a problem with this is
it's<00:03:13.950> still<00:03:14.160> going<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.310> want<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.520> pivot<00:03:14.700> right

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
it's still going to want to pivot right

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.580 
it's still going to want to pivot right
so<00:03:16.800> what<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:16.980> did<00:03:17.100> with<00:03:17.340> about<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.380> took

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so what I did with about that is I took

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.560 
so what I did with about that is I took
a<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:19.920> piece<00:03:22.850> banding<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.000> comes<00:03:24.330> from

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
a little piece banding that comes from

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.360 
a little piece banding that comes from
in<00:03:25.080> your<00:03:25.260> factories<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:25.920> know<00:03:26.040> when<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.280> get

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
in your factories you know when you get

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.710 
in your factories you know when you get
a<00:03:26.430> shipment<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.850> something<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.240> on<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.360> pallet

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
a shipment of something in on a pallet

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.970 
a shipment of something in on a pallet
it<00:03:27.780> might<00:03:27.930> be<00:03:28.050> banded<00:03:28.470> with<00:03:28.560> his<00:03:28.740> metal

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
it might be banded with his metal

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.530 
it might be banded with his metal
banding<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:30.030> took<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.050> little<00:03:31.260> piece<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:32.540> my

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
banding I took a little piece of this my

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.800 
banding I took a little piece of this my
dremel<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:37.520> I<00:03:38.520> finessed<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.450> little

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
dremel and I finessed this little

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.530 
dremel and I finessed this little
watchmakers<00:03:40.620> nightmare<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:42.680> little<00:03:43.680> clip

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
watchmakers nightmare of a little clip

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.699 
watchmakers nightmare of a little clip
and<00:03:45.540> I'm<00:03:45.630> going<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.840> try<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.050> hold<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.620> you

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
and I'm going to try to hold it so you

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.790 
and I'm going to try to hold it so you
can<00:03:46.800> see<00:03:47.300> how<00:03:48.300> I've<00:03:48.450> done<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.930> anyway<00:03:49.500> it's

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
can see how I've done that anyway it's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.510 
can see how I've done that anyway it's
got<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> bend<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.310> it

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
got a bend in it

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.330 
got a bend in it
this<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.570> narrow<00:03:51.810> enough<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.470> fit<00:03:52.980> down<00:03:53.130> in

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
this is narrow enough to fit down in

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.870 
this is narrow enough to fit down in
that<00:03:53.490> lower<00:03:53.670> slot<00:03:54.120> there<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:56.730> got<00:03:56.850> a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
that lower slot there and it's got a

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.940 
that lower slot there and it's got a
ridge<00:03:57.150> on<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.630> will<00:03:57.750> hold<00:03:57.930> up<00:03:59.150> and<00:04:00.950> the

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
ridge on it that will hold up and the

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.790 
ridge on it that will hold up and the
button<00:04:03.470> will<00:04:04.470> slide<00:04:04.709> back<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.160> forth<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:05.550> that

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
button will slide back and forth on that

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.560 
button will slide back and forth on that
preventing<00:04:07.800> it<00:04:07.920> from<00:04:07.950> being<00:04:08.280> able<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.640> twist

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.150 

okay<00:04:12.570> come<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.350> bit<00:04:13.530> together<00:04:13.800> see<00:04:14.040> if<00:04:14.070> it

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
okay come on bit together see if it

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.599 
okay come on bit together see if it
actually<00:04:14.280> works<00:04:18.919> okay<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.160> got<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.459> thing

actually works okay so I got that thing
working

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:30.520 

and<00:04:28.909> the<00:04:29.509> way<00:04:29.599> the<00:04:29.659> light<00:04:29.840> sitting<00:04:30.199> that<00:04:30.349> is

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
and the way the light sitting that is

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.879 
and the way the light sitting that is
probably<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.639> Blair<00:04:32.090> here<00:04:32.419> but<00:04:32.749> I<00:04:32.960> ended<00:04:33.830> up

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
probably a Blair here but I ended up

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.179 
probably a Blair here but I ended up
having<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.159> remake<00:04:34.520> it<00:04:34.580> out<00:04:34.909> of<00:04:34.999> a<00:04:35.060> piece<00:04:35.240> of

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:36.189 
having to remake it out of a piece of

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.850 
having to remake it out of a piece of
aluminum<00:04:37.189> window<00:04:37.460> channel<00:04:38.560> just<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.740> could

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
aluminum window channel just so I could

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.850 
aluminum window channel just so I could
get<00:04:40.039> more<00:04:40.279> length<00:04:40.610> out<00:04:40.819> of<00:04:40.999> it<00:04:41.289> and<00:04:42.289> it

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
get more length out of it and it

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.670 
get more length out of it and it
actually<00:04:43.069> functions<00:04:44.259> so<00:04:45.259> I'm<00:04:45.349> going<00:04:45.499> to<00:04:45.560> show

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
actually functions so I'm going to show

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:56.760 
actually functions so I'm going to show
you<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:50.810> uh<00:04:51.669> alright<00:04:52.749> so<00:04:53.889> I'm<00:04:54.889> done<00:04:55.099> with<00:04:55.159> that

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
you it uh alright so I'm done with that

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.740 
you it uh alright so I'm done with that
it's<00:04:57.770> better<00:04:58.069> spending<00:04:58.580> 50<00:04:59.090> bucks<00:04:59.330> for<00:04:59.569> a<00:04:59.599> new

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
it's better spending 50 bucks for a new

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.610 
it's better spending 50 bucks for a new
switch<00:05:00.199> if<00:05:00.500> you<00:05:00.590> can<00:05:00.710> find<00:05:00.949> one<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.870> there<00:05:03.469> you

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
switch if you can find one so there you

00:05:03.620 --> 00:06:17.980 
switch if you can find one so there you
go

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:30.470
