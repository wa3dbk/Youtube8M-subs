00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:09.880
 good morning my name is arming thin 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.980
 I 'm at work for your tours and in 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.860
 this case well I'm the one let's say the 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.640
 in charge of the productive part in what 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.380
 which is totals 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:25.099
 Here in this case specifically vats 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.470
 we are according to the parish in Spanish 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.440
 we know him 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.790
 this is a red globe variety 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.940
 Good advertising variety for the 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.500
 Export the plants are inserted 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.630
 in a pattern that is the mst 101 point 14 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:46.720
 and this stop here can be your 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.310
 first crop that has the year are going 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.620
 more or less us the first year 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.830
 we are leaving more or less a burden 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:58.240
 on average about 15 to 15 bunches per 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:00.040
 plant not that more or less we are well 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.380
 waiting 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.900
 10 12 tons per hectare for the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.810
 first harvest in the second harvest 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.870
 because we increase we went from 15 to 20 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.970
 in the third we pass to 30 and finally 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.210
 we establish ourselves with a more range or 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.160
 less than between 4 and 6 bunches per meter 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.720
 square and depending on the 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.360
 licensing does not that mean a 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.880
 plant three by two are six meters 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.870
 square by area we're talking about 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.000
 36 clusters at most 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.340
 and from there in that we already say what 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.300
 we manage more or less here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 we think we should give one a 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.340
 life of the plant more or less 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.190
 between 20 and 25 years old keeping one 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240
 course we arrived in the best way 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.300
 we here manage a watering 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.620
 unconventional traditional we do not have 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.780
 water problems we also have 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.580
 problems of excess water you have 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.560
 seen here the farmer who have passed and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.110
 not the problem we have with water 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.330
 not the problem that we are surrounded by 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.530
 rice farmers in all the rice farmers when 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.410
 no longer have water they encourage the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.030
 drains and trains are falling 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.940
 those below are hurting us 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.920
 that we make a gap here of 50 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.330
 centimeters we have boom 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.420
 then we do not have any problem with 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.700
 water only us only when 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.360
 as it is said to dissolve a bolus nothing 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.450
 plus 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.760
 if the rest we have water and that is a 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.040
 problem because because we here 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.080
 we are in a tropical climate 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.760
 then the grape constantly is that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.700
 sprout and bruno tiberti with another sprout 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.440
 The plant never stops growing here 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.840
 that's why we have to be 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.970
 please back down we do not have here 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.890
 we are making two power models of 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.810
 our ceso one like the one you 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.739
 come here in front 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.060
 and others that we're going to see down there in 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.750
 this case we are leaving 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.480
 Pythons of 2 3 2 3 buds only 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.090
 let's say to recover arm or charger 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.599
 it's true more or less we plan to leave 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.540
 about 20 thousand porters with white and the 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.340
 from below we will recover arms and 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.590
 make chargers 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.590
 likewise leave 2024 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.950
 this part we are reviewing to have 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.950
 to 2025 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.090
 a pause of 20 simulated solitaires 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.340
 good is what we do here but without 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.400
 But here there are no producers that 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.260
 they handle differently than they do 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.150
 end their harvest they stop hunting 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.310
 plants two months and again pruning and 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.430
 again in another cycle not then 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.710
 they more or less on average have 1.5 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.660
 to 1.7 harvests per year we 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.060
 we only manage one harvest per year 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.710
 now the handling that we do of cluster 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.490
 we are not here for the moment 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.600
 exporting us but not if 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.140
 we sell for example to ecuador and 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.780
 Colombia say why because no 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.850
 we have a lot of price difference for 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.530
 Ecuador example and with Colombian rhj 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.030
 they pay 2.5 2.5 and we have a thinning of 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.460
 cluster that we quietly 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.890
 We can integrate clusters of 1.2 to 1.5 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.650
 kilos 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.180
 export does not allow us that 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.850
 export we have that is from 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.650
 shadow school if you are from here not 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.930
 there are bunches of scola 2 all have their 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.450
 tail we do not do to put a relay or soft 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.080
 It does not allow us information 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.730
 Export us production down 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.830
 but if the price goes up 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.490
 us in exchange for the colombia and 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.560
 Ecuador we upload quantity and weight of 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.650
 pressure this option finally let's say 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.810
 we are part of this part what 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.340
 yes, let's finally say 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.169
 we are taking the juice that's why those 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.250
 markets but finally we 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.250
 we have to point the export 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.510
 we are going to this 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.640
 in the next month pretty much a new 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.860
 area here all when we have 3 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.020
 hectares then we already have a volume 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.000
 let's say adequate to export not all 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.689
 there we will talk about an adequate handling for 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.149
 export 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:09.599
 good in what now also we 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:12.490
 we use this as a didactic part 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.530
 we have students 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.380
 This variety of arrangement in Spanish 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.419
 where you have turned around is a 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.520
 dual t 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.800
 and that is a water this alfonso light 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.310
 here at the front, we have a 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.729
 mud in Spanish we have our ours 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.860
 emergent seedbed in the background not here 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.050
 we have installed some grapes this mittal and 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.789
 it breaks that I was just coming 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.139
 making the engineer that this appointment 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.750
 these breaks that we have here are 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:45.569
 it breaks from the area not and that here in 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.310
 older at the time of when I'm 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:49.440
 doing this was a following one 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.259
 farm where grapes were planted by 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.660
 60 years or so and a wine was removed 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.340
 very good 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.350
 we are trying to recover 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.670
 that variety of breaks because 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.250
 we brought a broken chile 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.980
 but it does not have very good forgiveness of ica 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.750
 but it does not have very good results here 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.610
 the weather seems to affect you and not 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.890
 we have very good productions and it is more 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.210
 very low professions then we are 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.550
 trying to recover that we have 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.470
 planted in the mgc let's make a 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.930
 espalier there and then well then 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.750
 we think we have everything not for a 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.670
 espanyol back the double and the aie of 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.890
 california to swim to the bottom not then 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.060
 those is also for didactic purposes 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:28.660
 so that the boys can learn 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.800
 this because the crop that is pretty 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.020
 it's being pretty important almost 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.900
 the boys here have to go out 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.060
 let's say managing this distributive 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.760
 above all what are formations by 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.639
 actors 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.139
 I do not know if you have a question 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:50.979
 because specifically the mtc 101 and 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:53.349
 others of 99 110 if what happens is that 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.819
 we here have a freehold 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:56.919
 gritty 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:59.620
 and with problems to some extent 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.659
 tracing problems and then this one sees 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.120
 this pattern is well adapted not without 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:06.350
 But in the upper part there is a floor 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.590
 harder more clayey 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.940
 it did not adapt well this and not only 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.150
 be here is also using the harmony 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.310
 and freedom and also brought so 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.740
 four because it was believed but there was not 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.630
 compatibility with the arrangement then 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.640
 of the mst the cold of harmon is also 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.770
 they are working well for this is 

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.080
 this area below and in the zone of 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.750
 up is working well the r99 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.160
 lr 110 and wright 2 are not 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.300
 working perfectly because it has 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.930
 roots so thick to the new and hard 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.850
 perfect that you will have the opportunity 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.410
 to go to that area a hard enough soil 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.760
 then there it is working well 

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.760
 those baseness those patterns 

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:49.240
 the wife said short of three hits and 

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.240
 let's see the two
