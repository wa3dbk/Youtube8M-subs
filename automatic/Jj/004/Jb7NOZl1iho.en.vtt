00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello to all of you will give 13 and today 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.710
 video on tank leopard-1 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.800
 pretty recently on our server 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.869
 It turned out as a test update and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.199
 any player could go to the test server 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.769
 try new tanks namely v 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.970
 the Germans out a new pawn line 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.969
 the crown which is leopard 1 and here 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.040
 I also went after my friend 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.469
 on the server you have decided to try it 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 what is this tank and in this video I want 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.360
 tell you your first impressions 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.100
 about this tank and maybe say how 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.000
 advise something in general or say 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.680
 you need not to swing it and so generally fight 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.550
 will be held on the pass card is my 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.199
 the very first fight on this tank 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.340
 as we see from the place of the tank is excellent 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.410
 accelerates at all I noticed that many 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.090
 Well waterkeep say so compare it 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.119
 more with batchato I want in my 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.430
 video draw a line between him and potkin 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.010
 undertone third dummy 10 americans 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.040
 Why precisely with him and because me he 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.950
 just like the gameplay on about the atom 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.700
 rather than the battats firstly compared 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.159
 we have no drum right 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.100
 Now turn down the sound a little bit sorry 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.490
 Firstly we don't have a drum, but with 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.619
 patton we have just the most 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.399
 more similar features such as 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.229
 we have excellent vertical angles 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.640
 pickups ie guns in principle 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.819
 pretty not bad loiter 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.649
 let's say the same 250 m cannon 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.579
 hardly leaning over maybe 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.649
 degree roughly speaking here we are in 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:58.450
 principle the same structure as decay 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.950
 a bit like everything let's say so on if 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.899
 we take a look at the road gun 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.670
 just agree wonderful to us 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.649
 great speed people recently 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.709
 good recharge by the way recharge 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.420
 very similar to reloading 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.470
 pattona that is there roughly 7 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.129
 seconds with small also if we 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.480
 look at the gun who is she now 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.660
 really represents a very 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.730
 such as say on hepatitis with guns 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.550
 either tarski could be such a gun in 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.170
 Generally with which players are now the first 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.970
 time will really be rand 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.220
 bend in principle as always happens 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.020
 on those tanks that they are introduced 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.930
 little period well you are we then i think 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.000
 anyway leopard a little checking also 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.390
 as it was with patton third first 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.720
 everyone was just 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.340
 dedicated to patton's gun 3 then his 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.910
 ponerfili now he's gone for a second 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.040
 plan 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.780
 Naturally I thought with the note of the leopard 1 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.490
 potal about a third who do a lot of 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.890
 will forget it will still be less than you 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.380
 user oh so she is quiet naturally 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.440
 better to take a leopard and more bright 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.690
 which is more accurate gun well there still 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.740
 a number of its features by the way what else 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.880
 wanted to say with us on leopard 1 review 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:16.970
 410 if we look at mth paton 3 then 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.770
 there review 420 agree that there is also no 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.440
 Some of the difficulties are that they have 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.970
 biggest review on the tenth level with 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.200
 we will take all sorts of other stitches there 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.459
 let's say 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.890
 E50m or they just 400 meters here 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.810
 now probably let's talk about 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.590
 Is it worth pumping this tank ? 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.540
 this tank personally when I played on it is not 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.360
 found and some zest special in 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.070
 this tank, in principle, if 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.810
 this fight is now held us potter i 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.989
 I think I would have achieved exactly the same 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.269
 results well of course then let the gun 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.540
 a little more to sites or something else 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.370
 then but in general, in principle, to play on the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.120
 not as comfortable as a leopard 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.280
 first but he also does not have his 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.380
 raisins in terms of what is permissible E50m 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.640
 he is great for our sake 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.380
 t-62 he 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.079
 he has great gun prizes 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.680
 recharges for 5 seconds so I think 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.959
 all the same well, some kind of mass to pump it 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.489
 but the tank will not be the same as 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.019
 stay 2 which is now 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.640
 principle is considered imbo from st10 as 157 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.260
 heavy which are also very nagiborskie 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.800
 so that in general, I think that the tank 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.990
 This one will pump but personally 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.720
 and to take on his pumping is likely 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.840
 I will not be possible if it is still 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.210
 there will redo this test so to speak 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.099
 because the test usually passes at least 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.710
 two stages now we just have the first 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.360
 general test maybe he 'll get something else 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.789
 maybe something to lower and then already 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.960
 let's take a clearer look at this 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.280
 But now I think that 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.400
 pump and will not, I have a 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.860
 then the tracks are basically the same car 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.690
 very similar at least a little 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.490
 Of course slower patent 3 but in general 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.830
 the same from the hill, he is also excellent 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.610
 accelerates has a good principle 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:13.659
 dynamics further also on the test server 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:17.919
 I ride on the t-62a I do not really 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:19.930
 server, so I decided to ride on the test 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.030
 Naturally bought everything bought 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.909
 one hundred percent crew as the easiest 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.889
 First there would be no no what modules 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:30.669
 Well, I went in the first year of the first battle 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:33.610
 I had about 4,000 homes and beyond 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.919
 probably in the next two too 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.090
 It had four on a magic sight though 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.440
 completely without tension and despite the fact that 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.509
 the tool would seem to damage a lot 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.900
 less there is an alpha strike less 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:50.919
 but in general, it turns out great 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:54.340
 damage due to recharge and yet 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.139
 t-62 not so much as it suffers from 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.389
 the fact that he has no armor 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.029
 Armor had though what that is with him 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.069
 great tower we have the same leopard-1 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.590
 breaks right mask guns we 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.930
 tested with a friend and really here 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.729
 straight even I shot just tula here 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.259
 straight through and natural and she just 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.770
 I flew that is even the birthplace of Crete 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:14.909
 vale 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.779
 just breaking through with damage 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.750
 agree that they are very nice 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:21.849
 picture, too , your whole cat can at least 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.759
 withstand even damage probably paton and 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:27.429
 mask guns even a little bit thicker and she 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:30.399
 still and all makes its way in general 

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:33.599
 leopard 1 has a place to be really 

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:36.369
 not a bad tank in principle if 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:40.569
 some possibility you can deflate 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:42.699
 and cascade ride on it to play 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:45.309
 it’s necessary to support him 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:48.999
 should you can take two leopards 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:53.589
 first and t-62 and will be such here I think 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:54.699
 have a good win rate in the battles here on this 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:59.679
 seems to be all i wanted to tell you 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:02.080
 and here the battle comes to an end we see that 

00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:04.599
 Leopard 1 was left targeting the press and in 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.179
 rink i'm by the way if someone watched 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:11.229
 fight they listened then I very well 

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:14.259
 I give the damage again and now 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:15.819
 I made his mistake I drove up as it were, 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:17.169
 I wanted to target him I thought that 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:21.610
 obustraivanie muscles 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:24.580
 and see the motherland rolled away from the leopard 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:28.180
 guns quickly so here it was my 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:30.669
 first leopard fight first basically 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.649
 I didn't like the tank very often 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.029
 I repeat now the word basically in 

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:36.189
 previous video repeated a lot 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:40.089
 words okay okay sorry for mine 

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:42.430
 such speech errors are all there 

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:44.229
 now you view the results of this fight not 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.089
 I will comment because just 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:48.279
 I wanted to share with you my impression 

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:52.360
 this tank and tips 

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:54.789
 but in general, the tank has a place for me to be 

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.649
 me on this all subscribe to my 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:59.259
 youtube channel put your finger up under 

00:07:56.649 --> 00:08:02.169
 video watch stream incidentally this 

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:05.759
 the battle took place on the stirrup that's all for everyone 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:05.759
 successful hebe and all for now
