action<00:01:18.509> fighting<00:01:19.080> game<00:01:20.000> main<00:01:21.000> difference<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
action fighting game main difference I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.789 
action fighting game main difference I
think<00:01:21.509> between<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.930> fighter<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> brawler<00:01:22.619> is

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
think between a fighter and a brawler is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.490 
think between a fighter and a brawler is
a<00:01:22.830> fighter<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> one-on-one<00:01:23.820> situation<00:01:24.509> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
a fighter is a one-on-one situation so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
a fighter is a one-on-one situation so
it's<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.920> player<00:01:26.130> versus<00:01:27.030> their<00:01:27.210> opponent

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it's just a player versus their opponent

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
it's just a player versus their opponent
and<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> brawler<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.140> more<00:01:28.829> than<00:01:28.979> one-on-one

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and a brawler is more than one-on-one

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.980 
and a brawler is more than one-on-one
like<00:01:29.670> two<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:29.970> two<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.329> example<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> lot

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
like two one two for example with a lot

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.520 
like two one two for example with a lot
of<00:01:31.079> things<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> background

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.020 

me<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.100> brawler<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:36.850> more<00:01:37.450> arcadey<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.020> fun<00:01:39.030> he

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
me a brawler is more arcadey and fun he

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.210 
me a brawler is more arcadey and fun he
threw<00:01:40.240> in<00:01:40.390> like<00:01:40.630> ninja<00:01:41.020> powers<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.920> kind<00:01:42.160> of
