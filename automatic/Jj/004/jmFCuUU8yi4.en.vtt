00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.480
 I'm putting out a little chart now but that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:15.240
 This extreme is waiting but that 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.960
 Balance and Well price of futures in New York even though the red one is I'm movement of the price 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.060
 Even if you look at that rock, it's Kano futures Long 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.849
 I am the sound balance of Rogue 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.189
 I think I've been reduced now pillboxes is I do not have so much money Long Come soon Little 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:35.530
 Everyone in that last December 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.059
 I really somehow cash out earlier that the selling has You're Fund Ghat awake 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.079
 Long balance has decreased 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:48.949
 Investor Long This max highest Sendai vs it 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:53.940
 It is a comex i-kun up to 1000 ton long, but that 's what it sounds like 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.390
 You went to 500 and the village at the end of last year when you started investing 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.000
 Then 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:03.930
 It is very light as a live factor of the market 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.800
 'M a person who thinks and say what is to say that cash-out impossible when the fall after all 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.000
 That's why 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.340
 Long got to have know it by myself and Long everyone cache Nde say this Na dangerous 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 But it is not lowered significantly hit 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.990
 Also say Well to market another saturation state when Datte is Antoki N Oh likely lowering of September 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.490
 It 's about fighting and it's long. 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.240
 2 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.460
 So we still have everyone long have everyone Well then and say, voice Avai Na' 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.450
 It 's about doing something huge when you say it's a dangerous giraffe 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.860
 And everyone 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.409
 I say so-called jampon vinegar band wagon, but everyone begins to sell with turns 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 Even though is a pattern I headed to the Ga' 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.250
 Ho N' 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.970
 Well I think such internal factors are very big, but now that's not there v 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:53.159
 Came up at the I'm I'm decreased time enough now 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:59.249
 It has increased to around 800 degrees, but this Umematsu year from January to February 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:03.270
 This price has also entered What gradually it is coming up everyone still now a sense of security Rogue 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:09.269
 It has been increasing a little now, but it is not such a heavy situation yet 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:13.180
 Until such a place as to reduce greatly by the position of the market itself to such 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:20.410
 Because this has not come yet, only long through this comex is positive 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:26.140
 Yeah It is so far the rule of thumb is to Tteyuu a little careful you come to around become salted pork 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:30.220
 The fact that it is temporarily imminent is, however, broken by the Greek news 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.470
 Let's get together early of God The risk starts version Dish 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.630
 Or when are faced with another corrupted attachments by fund 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:42.120
 Funds that require changes that investors do not want to take risks 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.849
 Well then cash in and pick a monkey to refund it 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:53.760
 There is a good chance that this cycle will remain 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:57.780
 Credit crunch several jet crunch because there is a possibility that the market price seen last year may be again this year 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.430
 Jitter Kranz Ne This is also the house of many that can not be predicted yet that of ecb 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.110
 It is not a big game behavior 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.800
 At first it is good though 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:13.870
 But if the crisis really gets worse then it will be credit crunch in the final situation 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:17.220
 It also says that banks also get money from banks 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.750
 Well this situation is also conceivable 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.170
 So again once wonder if such far the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.670
 I will 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.700
 If not 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.830
 I on the contrary it 's such a do not go above Bokune 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.990
 It's scary if you stay here 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.790
 Once such 6 o'clock barely adjustment without any car 2000 cracked down That's what made bubble 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.030
 I feel like I might not 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.500
 This may also have different opinions from the group but I am 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.100
 I want to feel it, but 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.660
 Well because I lowered it last year 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:55.730
 You Did lowered last year's Tteyuu corresponding last year 2011 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:58.190
 That was the year that the highest gold ever moved in history. 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.260
 I have a flower of 1920 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:08.880
 End out down to 1300 dollars probably Choi 1,700 US dollars 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.390
 It has never been this for me to have moved this year and this year 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:16.359
 So far 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:19.420
 Very If I'm calm So good I like you say that was the wing that 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:23.360
 The Ya of course such a risk because there may be something still 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:28.440
 I think it feels natural and I think it is natural but this year 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:33.639
 From Ietsuki 4 days up to the present 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:35.110
 But it is not so much you also have to move you But too think that I weapon 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:41.950
 very 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:43.720
 It's quiet to come to a little rise mind stable creeping in Maa and which way or say Rutte is 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.940
 Imager line 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:52.630
 Then I talked about that speculative money flow now, but now I am 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:58.540
 I think I want a little heard the story of the people of muscle 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:00.990
 What is the trend in China or in this price range? 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:06.540
 After all the story of China 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:11.820
 That Well I in the place that does not get in the previous its gold diapers 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:15.870
 I think it is strong, but the biggest example is this key side, though 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:22.370
 I think the black structure is still the largest 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:25.750
 The other I still the presence of countries say China in the next as gold unique factors 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:30.280
 I mean 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.550
 It's really intense here, right here is the book today 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.630
 that 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.860
 A country that is not the only producer country in the world 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:45.170
 I export a lot of gold, so this is really only Japan 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:51.569
 I Toka want Well and for the most part still Southeast Asia gold coming from the Japanese language 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:53.750
 Southeast Asia and Japan After depending on the Well view that we go is more and more drawn more and more to China 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:57.230
 When it is before about 20 years 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.740
 I did not come to die in the 80's and 90's 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:04.010
 My work and the island's work at the time 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.040
 It was a job to import gold and wholesale it 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:10.490
 Sho-san also did, and so did the Swiss bank 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:15.470
 I have not bought money from Switzerland when there is an investigation 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:22.630
 I it was the selling in full well who wonder if going through the metal floor and the general public but is now 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:24.020
 That is a breath of it that will export all I answer to come hit is quite the opposite everyone 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.030
 After all 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.440
 Doraji There it is to say that there is in China 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.460
 Hmm 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.580
 Only the absolute of 900 it is that I Toko selling before 500 tons is buy 400 tons 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.349
 you know 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:40.490
 This is true of 900 tons in the market of 2800 tons production 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:43.150
 The landscape of the market changes, there are 19 landscapes 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:48.670
 So this is I think the really big 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.120
 Then after all it is another one of the gold of this one that is a cautionary material, but that buy back 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.760
 Ne 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.150
 recycling 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:58.560
 This picture is what a gold buyer is doing in that Athens now 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:02.940
 Such recycling shops are already the same in all three major Japanese 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:06.210
 Even if you enter the school, there will always be a purchase shop for gold 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:10.780
 It is progressing in the form of say NiÃ±o worldwide this 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:16.360
 I Chinami is also in Athens had said that very few growth industries 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:18.250
 Annual 1,600 tons in is this because it is Yeah purchase Gane of roots gold the mountain if Susumere tangling expulsion 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:24.660
 Because there is 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:28.470
 If this happens to be $ 2000, these things will increase more and more 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:32.100
 So I think that I will go up from that 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.910
 Just say a bit that there is also a factor to put a brake on it 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:37.080
 I wanted 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:42.830
 Well it 's gold this cause disappears if it burns 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:44.889
 In other words, there is no recycling , so if you start over, it will start to come up really fast 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:50.620
 But money is 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:51.249
 Because it doesn't corrode, it always remains on the surface, and it's over when it says new high price renewal 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:56.169
 Come out 

00:07:51.249 --> 00:08:00.279
 That is money that crude oil and play money not to apply the brake to apply the brake is applied 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:02.460
 It is not necessary to keep this difference in mind for the same commodity sector . 

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:02.460
 Hey
