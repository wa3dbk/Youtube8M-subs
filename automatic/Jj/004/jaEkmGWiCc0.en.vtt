00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
first thing we're going to do is get our

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.910 
first thing we're going to do is get our
boning<00:00:44.600> knife<00:00:44.720> which<00:00:44.930> I<00:00:45.050> had<00:00:45.200> conveniently

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
boning knife which I had conveniently

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.140 
boning knife which I had conveniently
placed<00:00:46.100> in<00:00:46.460> our<00:00:46.670> little<00:00:47.420> box<00:00:47.600> here<00:00:49.030> now<00:00:50.030> this

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
placed in our little box here now this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.670 
placed in our little box here now this
is<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.420> different<00:00:50.840> style<00:00:50.960> boning<00:00:51.350> knife<00:00:51.470> than

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
is a different style boning knife than

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.280 
is a different style boning knife than
most<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.040> you<00:00:52.160> wil<00:00:52.310> have<00:00:52.900> but<00:00:53.900> you<00:00:54.020> can<00:00:54.050> also

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
most of you wil have but you can also

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.530 
most of you wil have but you can also
use<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.530> chef's<00:00:54.830> knife<00:00:55.040> as<00:00:55.250> well<00:00:55.310> it<00:00:55.940> all<00:00:56.120> works

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
use a chef's knife as well it all works

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.360 
use a chef's knife as well it all works
so<00:00:57.530> now<00:00:57.650> a<00:00:57.700> balantine<00:00:58.700> is<00:00:58.970> essentially<00:00:59.480> a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
so now a balantine is essentially a

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.190 
so now a balantine is essentially a
deboned<00:01:01.370> chicken<00:01:01.760> leg<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:02.630> we<00:01:02.720> take<00:01:02.870> out<00:01:03.020> all

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
deboned chicken leg so we take out all

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.980 
deboned chicken leg so we take out all
the<00:01:03.320> bones<00:01:03.560> and<00:01:03.830> then<00:01:04.670> we<00:01:04.820> stuff<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.390> with<00:01:05.660> our

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
the bones and then we stuff it with our

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.140 
the bones and then we stuff it with our
filling

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
filling

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.940 
filling
so<00:01:08.150> just<00:01:08.510> stretch<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:11.750> now<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:11.990> break<00:01:12.320> down<00:01:12.530> a

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
so just stretch so now to break down a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.180 
so just stretch so now to break down a
chicken<00:01:13.280> leg<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.450> take<00:01:15.230> our<00:01:15.410> knife<00:01:15.590> we<00:01:15.950> find

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
chicken leg and take our knife we find

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.070 
chicken leg and take our knife we find
our<00:01:16.340> bone<00:01:17.050> and<00:01:18.050> we<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:19.120> cut<00:01:20.120> right<00:01:20.570> along<00:01:20.750> the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
our bone and we just cut right along the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.050 
our bone and we just cut right along the
bone<00:01:21.260> from<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.560> knee<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.220> our<00:01:22.460> knees<00:01:22.610> right<00:01:22.910> up

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
bone from the knee so our knees right up

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.620 
bone from the knee so our knees right up
here<00:01:23.590> we<00:01:24.590> just<00:01:24.800> want<00:01:24.980> to<00:01:25.220> follow<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.420> bone

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
here we just want to follow this bone

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.460 
here we just want to follow this bone
just<00:01:27.470> pull<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.830> right<00:01:27.980> up<00:01:29.050> you'll<00:01:30.050> need<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.320> get

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
just pull it right up you'll need to get

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.780 
just pull it right up you'll need to get
your<00:01:30.590> knife<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:31.159> just<00:01:31.340> made<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.490> hole

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
your knife we just made a hole

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.940 
your knife we just made a hole
underneath<00:01:32.120> here<00:01:32.510> but<00:01:33.380> by<00:01:33.590> using<00:01:33.740> your

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
underneath here but by using your

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.530 
underneath here but by using your
fingers<00:01:34.370> and<00:01:34.580> now<00:01:35.030> we're<00:01:35.150> going<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.360> put<00:01:35.450> our

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
fingers and now we're going to put our

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.930 
fingers and now we're going to put our
knife<00:01:35.690> in<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:35.870> hole<00:01:36.310> just<00:01:37.310> follow<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.760> bone

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940

knife in that hole just follow the bone
just<00:01:38.300> to<00:01:38.420> separate<00:01:38.900> it<00:01:39.050> right<00:01:39.200> there<00:01:39.940> now<00:01:40.940> this

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
just to separate it right there now this

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.750 
just to separate it right there now this
part<00:01:41.420> is<00:01:41.690> just<00:01:42.409> essentially<00:01:42.950> scraping<00:01:43.640> the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
part is just essentially scraping the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.810 
part is just essentially scraping the
meat<00:01:43.909> down<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.780> knee<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.620> we<00:01:48.680> just<00:01:48.860> scrape

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
meat down to the knee so we just scrape

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.460 
meat down to the knee so we just scrape
it<00:01:49.850> down

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.260 

this<00:01:54.130> is<00:01:54.310> something<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.700> will<00:01:54.790> take<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.940> few

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
this is something that will take a few

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.260 
this is something that will take a few
tries<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.900> get<00:01:56.050> good<00:01:56.260> at<00:01:56.410> but<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.740> can<00:01:56.890> usually

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
tries to get good at but you can usually

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.140 
tries to get good at but you can usually
usually<00:01:58.270> get<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.660> on<00:01:58.750> your<00:01:58.870> first<00:01:59.020> try<00:02:00.000> now<00:02:01.000> all

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
usually get it on your first try now all

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.880 
usually get it on your first try now all
I<00:02:01.180> want<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.450> do<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.870> cut<00:02:02.170> around<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:04.890> joint

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.190 
I want to do is cut around the joint
here<00:02:06.220> because<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.150> can't<00:02:07.330> just<00:02:07.570> go<00:02:07.900> around<00:02:07.930> the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
here because we can't just go around the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.200 
here because we can't just go around the
joint<00:02:08.410> because<00:02:08.590> there's<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.369> patella<00:02:09.910> here

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
joint because there's the patella here

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.820 
joint because there's the patella here
which<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.479> just<00:02:10.509> like<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.840> thick<00:02:11.200> cap<00:02:11.650> of

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
which is just like a thick cap of

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.580 
which is just like a thick cap of
cartilage<00:02:12.180> which<00:02:13.180> are<00:02:13.630> nice<00:02:13.870> should<00:02:14.380> be<00:02:14.530> able

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
cartilage which are nice should be able

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.220 
cartilage which are nice should be able
to<00:02:14.710> cut<00:02:14.830> through<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.220> Sherriff<00:02:15.490> enough<00:02:16.230> we

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
to cut through the Sherriff enough we

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.750 
to cut through the Sherriff enough we
need<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.500> avoid<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.160> all<00:02:18.310> we<00:02:18.400> do<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:18.730> just

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
need to avoid that so all we do is just

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.850 
need to avoid that so all we do is just
make<00:02:19.060> small<00:02:19.420> little<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.870> chizz<00:02:20.080> incisions

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
make small little and chizz incisions

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.970 
make small little and chizz incisions
all<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.190> way<00:02:21.280> around<00:02:21.550> just<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:23.740> can<00:02:23.860> get

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
all the way around just so we can get

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.070 
all the way around just so we can get
past<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.970> will<00:02:28.150> take<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> few<00:02:28.420> tries<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
past it this will take a few tries to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.660 
past it this will take a few tries to
figure<00:02:29.350> out<00:02:29.470> where<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:29.890> want<00:02:30.130> your<00:02:30.310> knife<00:02:30.520> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
figure out where you want your knife to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.970 
figure out where you want your knife to
be<00:02:30.990> but<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.080> will<00:02:32.230> get<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.440> hang<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.830> after

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
be but you will get the hang of it after

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.670 
be but you will get the hang of it after
a<00:02:33.130> few<00:02:33.400> few<00:02:33.940> legs<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:36.100> we<00:02:36.280> are<00:02:36.340> now<00:02:36.900> almost<00:02:37.900> past

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
a few few legs so we are now almost past

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.350 
a few few legs so we are now almost past
the<00:02:39.690> patella<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:42.610> have<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.790> pastor<00:02:43.180> knee
