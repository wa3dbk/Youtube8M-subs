00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.210

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.390
 that is to play without barriers that jumping is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.810
 love friendship and they will not determine that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.599
 be afraid that makes us laugh that no 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.610
 I want to get wet if I love tomorrow 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.920
 that way 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.460
 which is the same as there who where when 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.320
 how is the big question 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.320

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.090
 wish 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.020
 do not 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.870
 hello hugo hello hugo because I can not 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:56.809
 have everything I want 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:01:00.070
 I do not know what you want a monkey that I need 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.070
 one why 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:11.619
 because he has one I need one for the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.619
 school and who reads stories to me 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.409
 but you already do all those things without monkey 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.409
 none needed one 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.740
 only one little one well I do not have anything 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.229
 of what I need 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.130
 it sounds like you want a monkey but in 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.229
 actually you do not need one there was but which one 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.590
 is the difference between needing and 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.590
 want 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:52.219
 the things you want are things that you 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.219
 would like to have as toys 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.039
 and the things you need are things that 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.830
 you have to have to be healthy 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:13.150
 as food 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.130
 and heat there is a place where you can 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.630

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.520
 and vegetables, you need some if 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.010
 you want to be big and strong but what 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.200
 happens if you're not like then you stay 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.390
 little one forever 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.520

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.520
