00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and how this works okay so I'm looking

and how this works okay so I'm looking
at<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.750> set<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.500> commands<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.130> before<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
at this set of commands and before you

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
at this set of commands and before you
start<00:01:24.240> judging<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.080> seems<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.440> it's<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
start judging that it seems like it's a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.120 
start judging that it seems like it's a
lot<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.950> commands<00:01:26.340> for<00:01:26.700> such<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> simple<00:01:27.690> trick

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
lot of commands for such a simple trick

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.500 
lot of commands for such a simple trick
well<00:01:29.130> there's<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.700> couple<00:01:29.850> things<00:01:30.120> I<00:01:30.300> need<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.260 
well there's a couple things I need to
go<00:01:30.630> into<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:32.520> two<00:01:33.090> different

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
go into it I have two different

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.840 
go into it I have two different
scoreboards<00:01:34.080> I<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.770> called<00:01:35.009> bobber<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
scoreboards I have one called bobber and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.840 
scoreboards I have one called bobber and
one<00:01:36.479> called<00:01:36.750> bobber<00:01:37.050> hit<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:39.060> bobber<00:01:39.680> um

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
one called bobber hit so the bobber um

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.980 
one called bobber hit so the bobber um
let<00:01:41.850> me<00:01:41.910> just<00:01:42.150> set<00:01:42.300> that<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.570> sign<00:01:42.840> we're

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
let me just set that on the sign we're

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.219 
let me just set that on the sign we're
scoreboard<00:01:43.850> which<00:01:44.850> induce<00:01:45.270> at<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.750> place

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
scoreboard which induce at this place

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.050 
scoreboard which induce at this place
sidebar<00:01:46.650> bobber<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:49.619> bobber<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.430> decides

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
sidebar bobber the bobber just decides

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.160 
sidebar bobber the bobber just decides
whether<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.880> am<00:01:53.880> bobber<00:01:54.780> in

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
whether or not there is a am bobber in

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.650 
whether or not there is a am bobber in
the<00:01:55.619> world<00:01:55.800> so<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.940> on<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> side

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
the world so you can see it on the side

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.620 
the world so you can see it on the side
it<00:01:58.410> sets<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.800> score<00:01:59.250> into<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.910> and<00:02:00.210> that's<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it sets the score into one and that's a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.330 
it sets the score into one and that's a
random<00:02:01.399> UUID<00:02:02.840> decided<00:02:03.840> by<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> game<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.250> you

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
random UUID decided by the game so you

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.520 
random UUID decided by the game so you
can<00:02:05.460> see<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.759> gets<00:02:05.940> set<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.179> 1<00:02:06.539> whenever<00:02:07.259> you

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
can see it gets set to 1 whenever you

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.850 
can see it gets set to 1 whenever you
cast<00:02:07.860> your<00:02:08.520> inline<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.560> bobber

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
cast your inline and that is the bobber

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.010 
cast your inline and that is the bobber
and<00:02:11.450> we<00:02:12.450> also<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.900> one<00:02:13.140> called<00:02:13.170> bobber<00:02:13.860> hit

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
and we also have one called bobber hit

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.260 
and we also have one called bobber hit
which<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.290> saw<00:02:16.740> briefly<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:18.030> hit<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
which you saw briefly as I hit the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.500 
which you saw briefly as I hit the
ground<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.959> if<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.230> shoot

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
ground so if I shoot

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.720 
ground so if I shoot
barbar<00:02:21.510> hit<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.870> now<00:02:22.410> set<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.830> zero<00:02:23.069> so<00:02:23.400> while

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
barbar hit is now set to zero so while

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.660 
barbar hit is now set to zero so while
it's<00:02:23.940> Ania<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.630> set<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.020> 1<00:02:25.260> when<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.310> lands

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
it's Ania it is set to 1 when it lands

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.380 
it's Ania it is set to 1 when it lands
it<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.270> set<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.540> 0<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.530> am<00:02:28.560> teleported<00:02:29.390> so

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it is set to 0 and I am teleported so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.089 
it is set to 0 and I am teleported so
that<00:02:31.020> is<00:02:31.230> basically<00:02:32.100> how<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.819> works<00:02:32.850> um

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
that is basically how it works um

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.429 
that is basically how it works um
in<00:02:35.280> fact<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:36.329> don't<00:02:36.900> want<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.110> go<00:02:37.200> all<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.349> way

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
in fact I don't want to go all the way

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.080 
in fact I don't want to go all the way
over<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:37.769> for<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.069> stupid<00:02:38.519> cow<00:02:38.730> me<00:02:39.000> to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
over there for that stupid cow me to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.429 
over there for that stupid cow me to
make<00:02:39.269> my<00:02:39.450> own<00:02:39.480> counter<00:02:39.989> here<00:02:40.349> we<00:02:41.010> can<00:02:41.189> also

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
make my own counter here we can also

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.880 
make my own counter here we can also
right-click<00:02:43.439> on<00:02:43.859> cows<00:02:44.219> and<00:02:45.170> start<00:02:46.170> riding

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
right-click on cows and start riding

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.559 
right-click on cows and start riding
them<00:02:47.250> around<00:02:48.140> um<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.549> is<00:02:50.609> simply

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
them around um and this is simply

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.500 
them around um and this is simply
because<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.950> bobber<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.970> being<00:02:54.209> deleted

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
because the bobber is not being deleted

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.190 
because the bobber is not being deleted
I<00:02:55.340> have<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.519> set<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.930> player

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
I have it set so that if the player

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.429 
I have it set so that if the player
right<00:02:58.920> clicks<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.609> when<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.720> get<00:03:00.900> teleported

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
right clicks and when you get teleported

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.140 
right clicks and when you get teleported
to<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> bobber<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.159> it<00:03:02.639> detects<00:03:03.030> that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
to the bobber and it detects that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.729 
to the bobber and it detects that
there's<00:03:03.389> a<00:03:03.480> bobber<00:03:03.659> right<00:03:03.989> next<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:04.500> in

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
there's a bobber right next to you in

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.839 
there's a bobber right next to you in
zero<00:03:05.489> radius<00:03:06.799> it<00:03:07.799> basically<00:03:08.310> kills<00:03:08.609> the

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
zero radius it basically kills the

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.940 
zero radius it basically kills the
bobber<00:03:09.090> now<00:03:09.930> there's<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.290> chance<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.680> this

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
bobber now there's a chance that this

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.589 
bobber now there's a chance that this
will<00:03:11.189> happen<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.030> will<00:03:12.150> get<00:03:12.329> stuck

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
will happen that it will get stuck

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.869 
will happen that it will get stuck
inside<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.349> entity<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.980> there's<00:03:14.189> no<00:03:14.400> way<00:03:14.579> for

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
inside the entity and there's no way for

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.960 
inside the entity and there's no way for
you<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:16.590> entity<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.189> the<00:03:17.489> bobber<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.879> be

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
you and the entity and the bobber to be

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.809 
you and the entity and the bobber to be
in<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.150> same<00:03:18.359> block<00:03:18.659> so<00:03:19.139> it<00:03:19.889> kind<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.310> flips

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
in the same block so it kind of flips

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.390 
in the same block so it kind of flips
out<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.060> teleports<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.930> wherever<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.889> the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
out and teleports you wherever and the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.330 
out and teleports you wherever and the
cow<00:03:23.639> just<00:03:23.909> kind<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.209> runs<00:03:24.389> around<00:03:24.540> like<00:03:24.870> crazy

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
cow just kind of runs around like crazy

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.770 
cow just kind of runs around like crazy
it's<00:03:26.340> awesome<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:27.060> can't<00:03:27.299> look<00:03:27.419> around

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
it's awesome you can't look around

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.970 
it's awesome you can't look around
though<00:03:27.959> because<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.439> constantly

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
though because it's constantly

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.890 
though because it's constantly
teleporting<00:03:29.639> you<00:03:29.760> but<00:03:30.389> you<00:03:30.569> can<00:03:30.750> just

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
teleporting you but you can just

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.319 
teleporting you but you can just
right-click<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.500> get<00:03:31.620> off<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.010> cow<00:03:32.549> he'll

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
right-click and get off the cow he'll

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.640 
right-click and get off the cow he'll
calm<00:03:33.599> down<00:03:34.159> I<00:03:35.930> can<00:03:36.930> go<00:03:37.079> over<00:03:37.109> some<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.560> these

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
calm down I can go over some of these

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.039 
calm down I can go over some of these
commands<00:03:38.069> for<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.459> suppose<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:39.629> this<00:03:39.900> is

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
commands for you I suppose so this is

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.580 
commands for you I suppose so this is
just<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.849> score<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:42.060> testing<00:03:42.540> or<00:03:42.780> setting

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
just the score and testing or setting

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.469 
just the score and testing or setting
the<00:03:43.620> score<00:03:43.979> of<00:03:44.159> any<00:03:44.489> entity<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.239> not<00:03:45.269> a

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
the score of any entity that is not a

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.780 
the score of any entity that is not a
player<00:03:45.750> within<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.169> radius<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.560> one<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:47.400> Babur

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
player within the radius of one to Babur

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.479 
player within the radius of one to Babur
one<00:03:48.379> now<00:03:49.379> you're<00:03:49.590> thinking<00:03:49.979> wait<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.129> second

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
one now you're thinking wait a second

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.670 
one now you're thinking wait a second
what<00:03:50.819> did<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:50.970> mean<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:52.169> cow<00:03:52.440> would

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
what did that mean that that cow would

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.119 
what did that mean that that cow would
be<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.859> bobber<00:03:53.159> and<00:03:53.609> a<00:03:53.819> pig<00:03:54.389> and<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:55.079> sheep<00:03:55.889> and

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
be a bobber and a pig and a sheep and

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.869 
be a bobber and a pig and a sheep and
anything<00:03:56.489> would<00:03:57.150> have<00:03:57.359> that<00:03:57.599> score<00:03:58.489> yeah<00:03:59.489> that

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
anything would have that score yeah that

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.539 
anything would have that score yeah that
is<00:04:00.090> why<00:04:00.419> I<00:04:00.449> do<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:01.319> scoreboard<00:04:02.310> players

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
is why I do this scoreboard players

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.259 
is why I do this scoreboard players
reset<00:04:03.000> at<00:04:03.150> eat<00:04:03.389> type<00:04:03.659> equals<00:04:04.109> cow<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.909> this

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
reset at eat type equals cow so in this

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.280 
reset at eat type equals cow so in this
case<00:04:06.659> I'm<00:04:07.019> doing<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:08.190> for<00:04:08.400> all<00:04:08.669> the<00:04:09.359> are<00:04:09.750> most

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
case I'm doing it for all the are most

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.909 
case I'm doing it for all the are most
of<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.909> common<00:04:11.909> mobs<00:04:12.349> none<00:04:13.349> of<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.560> hostile

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
of the common mobs none of the hostile

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.599 
of the common mobs none of the hostile
mobs<00:04:14.129> but<00:04:14.909> um<00:04:15.299> basically<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:16.579> am<00:04:17.579> just

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
mobs but um basically I am just

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.610 
mobs but um basically I am just
resetting<00:04:18.329> their<00:04:18.599> scores<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.199> we<00:04:19.349> don't<00:04:19.500> have

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
resetting their scores so we don't have

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.500 
resetting their scores so we don't have
to<00:04:19.739> worry<00:04:19.979> about<00:04:20.190> them<00:04:20.639> being<00:04:20.909> considered

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
to worry about them being considered

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.379 
to worry about them being considered
bombers<00:04:22.019> anymore<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.860> if<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.550> wanted<00:04:23.849> to<00:04:24.060> have

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
bombers anymore and if I wanted to have

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.000 
bombers anymore and if I wanted to have
a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
a

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.350 
a
happened<00:04:25.250> with<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.370> bunch<00:04:25.640> of<00:04:25.730> different<00:04:25.880> mobs

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
happened with a bunch of different mobs

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.390 
happened with a bunch of different mobs
and<00:04:26.720> monsters<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:27.680> would<00:04:27.830> have<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.070> do<00:04:28.220> this

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
and monsters and I would have to do this

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.310 
and monsters and I would have to do this
for<00:04:28.760> every<00:04:28.970> mob<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.600> would<00:04:29.750> be<00:04:29.900> in<00:04:30.110> that

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
for every mob that would be in that

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.160 
for every mob that would be in that
world<00:04:30.620> so<00:04:31.550> not<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:31.940> big<00:04:32.120> deal<00:04:32.180> but<00:04:32.690> it's

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
world so not a big deal but it's

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.040 
world so not a big deal but it's
something<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.560> keep<00:04:33.830> in<00:04:34.130> mind<00:04:35.740> now<00:04:36.740> up<00:04:37.040> here<00:04:38.050> we

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
something to keep in mind now up here we

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.970 
something to keep in mind now up here we
have<00:04:39.230> an<00:04:39.410> execute<00:04:39.970> @e<00:04:40.970> who's<00:04:41.870> basically<00:04:42.620> the

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
have an execute @e who's basically the

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.970 
have an execute @e who's basically the
bobber<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.610> detects<00:04:44.000> if<00:04:44.270> there's<00:04:44.510> air

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
bobber and it detects if there's air

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.310 
bobber and it detects if there's air
below<00:04:45.980> it<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.430> then<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.480> sets<00:04:47.720> its<00:04:47.930> score

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
below it and then it sets its score

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.890 
below it and then it sets its score
bobber<00:04:48.680> hit<00:04:49.100> -<00:04:49.730> -<00:04:50.980> so<00:04:52.510> when<00:04:53.510> it's<00:04:53.630> in<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.870> air

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
bobber hit - - so when it's in the air

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.960 
bobber hit - - so when it's in the air
we<00:04:54.320> see<00:04:54.530> Barbara<00:04:54.860> hit<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.130> set<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.460> one<00:04:55.700> and

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
we see Barbara hit is set to one and

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
we see Barbara hit is set to one and
that<00:04:56.090> is<00:04:56.300> because<00:04:56.780> we<00:04:57.620> are<00:04:57.650> constantly<00:04:58.990> is

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
that is because we are constantly is

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.770 
that is because we are constantly is
that<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.620> no<00:05:00.800> that's<00:05:01.070> not<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.720> set<00:05:02.720> it

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
that it no that's not it set it

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.390 
that it no that's not it set it
yes<00:05:04.380> we<00:05:05.040> are<00:05:05.160> constantly<00:05:05.670> removing<00:05:06.240> them<00:05:07.400> one

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
yes we are constantly removing them one

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.450 
yes we are constantly removing them one
from<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.180> score<00:05:09.450> bobber<00:05:09.780> hits<00:05:10.170> on<00:05:10.410> all<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.310> the

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
from the score bobber hits on all of the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.290 
from the score bobber hits on all of the
Bombers<00:05:11.850> I'm<00:05:12.540> saying<00:05:12.870> bobber<00:05:13.140> a<00:05:13.320> lot<00:05:13.590> in<00:05:13.800> this

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
Bombers I'm saying bobber a lot in this

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.560 
Bombers I'm saying bobber a lot in this
video<00:05:15.300> and<00:05:15.780> it's<00:05:15.960> starting<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:16.650> sound<00:05:16.860> weird

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
video and it's starting to sound weird

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.170 
video and it's starting to sound weird
so<00:05:18.980> we're<00:05:19.980> removing<00:05:20.130> one<00:05:20.610> from<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:20.910> score

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
so we're removing one from the score

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.570 
so we're removing one from the score
constantly<00:05:21.810> so<00:05:22.020> if<00:05:22.140> it<00:05:22.320> sets<00:05:22.590> us<00:05:22.740> set<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.430> two

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
constantly so if it sets us set to two

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.640 
constantly so if it sets us set to two
it<00:05:23.820> will<00:05:24.060> at<00:05:24.240> least<00:05:24.270> be<00:05:24.600> one<00:05:25.050> always<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.990> then

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
it will at least be one always and then

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.140 
it will at least be one always and then
once<00:05:28.890> there<00:05:29.310> is<00:05:29.490> no<00:05:29.730> air<00:05:30.030> below<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:31.260> bobber<00:05:31.530> it

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
once there is no air below the bobber it

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.330 
once there is no air below the bobber it
allows<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.450> to<00:05:33.480> set<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.290> score<00:05:34.560> 2-0<00:05:34.710> which

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
allows it to set the score 2-0 which

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.250 
allows it to set the score 2-0 which
then<00:05:36.980> teleports<00:05:37.980> the<00:05:38.130> player<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.930> entity

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
then teleports the player to the entity

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.800 
then teleports the player to the entity
whose<00:05:40.500> bomber<00:05:40.800> hit<00:05:41.040> is<00:05:41.190> equal<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.610> zero<00:05:41.880> once

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
whose bomber hit is equal to zero once

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.030 
whose bomber hit is equal to zero once
the<00:05:43.169> player<00:05:43.470> is<00:05:43.890> in<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:45.540> same<00:05:45.870> radius<00:05:46.470> or<00:05:46.710> same

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
the player is in the same radius or same

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.020 
the player is in the same radius or same
block<00:05:47.490> as<00:05:47.760> bobber<00:05:48.570> hit<00:05:48.960> zero<00:05:49.590> then<00:05:50.580> it

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
block as bobber hit zero then it

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.130 
block as bobber hit zero then it
basically<00:05:51.390> just<00:05:51.930> kills<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.320> entity<00:05:52.770> so<00:05:53.550> uh<00:05:54.140> no

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
basically just kills the entity so uh no

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.490 
basically just kills the entity so uh no
more<00:05:55.169> having<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.740> worry<00:05:56.100> about<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.610> bomber<00:05:57.500> so

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
more having to worry about the bomber so

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.750 
more having to worry about the bomber so
as<00:05:58.620> you<00:05:58.740> can<00:05:58.860> see<00:05:59.100> I<00:05:59.130> don't<00:05:59.250> have<00:05:59.490> to<00:05:59.610> like

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
as you can see I don't have to like

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.180 
as you can see I don't have to like
right-click<00:06:00.240> again<00:06:00.419> after<00:06:01.050> I<00:06:01.080> land<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.980> pick

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
right-click again after I land to pick

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.370 
right-click again after I land to pick
it<00:06:02.310> up<00:06:02.460> it<00:06:02.580> just<00:06:02.730> does<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.120> for<00:06:03.330> me

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
it up it just does it for me

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.470 
it up it just does it for me
the<00:06:04.590> downside<00:06:05.070> to<00:06:05.100> this<00:06:05.280> is<00:06:05.430> it<00:06:05.820> kind<00:06:06.120> of<00:06:06.180> turns

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
the downside to this is it kind of turns

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.409 
the downside to this is it kind of turns
you<00:06:06.630> around<00:06:07.760> most<00:06:08.760> of<00:06:08.880> the<00:06:08.940> time<00:06:09.090> it's

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
you around most of the time it's

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.390 
you around most of the time it's
directly<00:06:10.080> behind<00:06:10.320> you<00:06:10.680> sometimes<00:06:11.160> it's<00:06:11.340> a

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
directly behind you sometimes it's a

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.820 
directly behind you sometimes it's a
little<00:06:11.520> up<00:06:11.760> sometimes<00:06:12.390> it's<00:06:12.570> down<00:06:12.870> it's

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
little up sometimes it's down it's

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.110 
little up sometimes it's down it's
pretty<00:06:14.460> weird

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
pretty weird

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.640 
pretty weird
yeah<00:06:15.630> there's<00:06:15.840> no<00:06:15.990> way<00:06:16.140> to<00:06:16.200> just<00:06:16.500> like

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
yeah there's no way to just like

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.860 
yeah there's no way to just like
right-click<00:06:17.610> on<00:06:17.760> the<00:06:17.880> floor<00:06:18.210> anything

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
right-click on the floor anything

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.159 
right-click on the floor anything
because<00:06:19.200> it<00:06:19.320> doesn't<00:06:19.350> let<00:06:19.770> you<00:06:20.330> face<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.780> same

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
because it doesn't let you face the same

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:25.129 
because it doesn't let you face the same
direction<00:06:22.460> unfortunately

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
direction unfortunately

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.839 
direction unfortunately
um<00:06:25.860> it<00:06:26.400> would<00:06:26.580> be<00:06:26.639> nice<00:06:26.999> if<00:06:28.580> okay<00:06:29.580> this<00:06:29.729> is

um it would be nice if okay this is

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.959 
um it would be nice if okay this is
