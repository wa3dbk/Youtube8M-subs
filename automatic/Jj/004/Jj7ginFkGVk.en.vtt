00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
 Good morning, people asked me to show. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.040
 how to clean the propeller 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.050
 air circulator 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.090
 so I 'll show you how to step 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.179
 step to will have to leave it well 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:27.390
 dirty and I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:30.960
 to take from them all that I am 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.270
 doing here before removing the s 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.540
 was shown is explained in government 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.540
 previous 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.930
 That's why I'm not talking here just 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.930
 shown 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.829
 this is how you remove this propeller and 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.549
 ready makes it easier to wash 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:47.859
 When you wash that part here. 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.829
 be very careful not to get wet 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.390
 this part of the electrical wiring there is 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.000
 no problem 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.790
 so he knows that part of the circus here 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.700
 flying is the part as you will have to 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.879
 wash with much more care with much 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.690
 more pink attention of this part here only 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.989
 that 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:13.209
 and this part here also logical is later 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:20.049
 clean replace him put 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:23.290
 here and then put the 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.030
 donut and then just put the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.349
 remaining as shown in the video 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.720
 previous 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.269
 these are not two parts and our 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.329
 You're forgetting the name you give it. 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.329
 on here 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:45.669
 This one is very cool. 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.620
 to put it if there is a fit and 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.799
 we have to find this fit for 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.209
 can put the little pieces because the 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.030
 back to back 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:04:03.609
 so I'll try to put it right 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:06.129
 hence a dog you should try 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.409
 completely fit you will realize 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:13.870
 when it fits totally or not in the year 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:16.630
 to put these little pieces here because there 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.489
 She does not go there in the background and the little pig. 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.560
 will not fit right will not go 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.190
 get fit then you go 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.740
 to see if it 's arrived in cash or not 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.570
 when it arrived in cash difference that 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.599
 try to put a little bit is all this 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.120
 here if not get a socket it these 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:36.520
 Why then, what about you? 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.320
 can not get much better on the tip either 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.840
 to say that I can suddenly see you 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.810
 and you can not fit this 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.530
 Blessed little here then when 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:52.160
 I was this pile of space outta 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.790
 You fit a little bit into the good without 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.790
 no problem 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.139
 Of course this is not the right part. 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.990
 for you to push but I'll do with 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.770
 that 's what I have on hand for 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.770
 help me 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:45.720
 been placed for years 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:06:01.620
 the same way I took it, that's me 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:06:06.290
 I find this and then tighten the 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:11.300
 corners in the life you shot 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.300
 It's just a question of how close it is to 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.790
 put these two species that you 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.790
 took the first 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:58.169
 put a screw that the two 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:58.169
 screws that you took the first 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:26.009
 Your circulator is ready to be reassembled 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:34.840
 working perfectly, certainly not 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:41.440
 only it will totally clean young people 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:42.190
 dry land points from the outlet to 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.780
 to win 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:49.120
