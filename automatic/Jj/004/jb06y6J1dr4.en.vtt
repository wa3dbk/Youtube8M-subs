00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
the side to give you just more space and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.950 
the side to give you just more space and
more<00:01:55.100> options<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.179> put<00:01:56.390> fits<00:01:56.659> over

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
more options so you can put fits over

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.139 
more options so you can put fits over
here<00:01:57.319> additional<00:01:58.250> parts<00:01:58.549> over<00:01:58.670> there<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.000> can

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
here additional parts over there you can

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.210 
here additional parts over there you can
really<00:01:59.329> use<00:01:59.539> every<00:01:59.960> single<00:02:00.259> part<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:00.740> while

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
really use every single part of it while

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.620 
really use every single part of it while
still<00:02:01.460> getting<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:01.909> visibility<00:02:02.539> of

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
still getting the visibility of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.370 
still getting the visibility of
everything<00:02:03.110> inside<00:02:04.209> also<00:02:05.209> when<00:02:05.959> you<00:02:06.080> move<00:02:06.259> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
everything inside also when you move the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.870 
everything inside also when you move the
compartments<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.009> have<00:02:07.069> additional<00:02:07.670> layer

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
compartments you have additional layer

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.539 
compartments you have additional layer
of<00:02:08.030> storage<00:02:08.569> underneath<00:02:09.019> so<00:02:09.920> instead<00:02:10.489> of

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
of storage underneath so instead of

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.449 
of storage underneath so instead of
having<00:02:10.849> just<00:02:11.180> X<00:02:12.049> amount<00:02:12.349> of<00:02:12.560> storage<00:02:12.920> space<00:02:13.099> if

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
having just X amount of storage space if

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.809 
having just X amount of storage space if
you<00:02:13.489> want<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:14.440> more<00:02:15.440> options<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.220> different

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
you want more more options but different

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.520 
you want more more options but different
so<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.060> doesn't<00:02:17.360> say<00:02:17.510> if<00:02:18.019> you<00:02:18.260> want<00:02:18.440> to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
so it doesn't say if you want to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.870 
so it doesn't say if you want to
separate<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.040> top<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.400> bottle<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.670> can

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
separate the top of the bottle you can

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.059 
separate the top of the bottle you can
do<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.239> while<00:02:20.450> still<00:02:20.720> filling<00:02:21.069> everything

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
do that while still filling everything

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.630 
do that while still filling everything
inside<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.790> just<00:02:23.269> do<00:02:23.690> an<00:02:23.810> additional<00:02:24.319> layer

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
inside and just do an additional layer

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.729 
inside and just do an additional layer
but<00:02:25.640> if<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.420> choose<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.690> do<00:02:27.019> maybe<00:02:27.349> a

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
but if you choose to do maybe a

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.370 
but if you choose to do maybe a
power-tool<00:02:28.700> inside<00:02:29.150> or<00:02:29.510> bunch<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.870> Pentos<00:02:30.200> and

power-tool inside or bunch of Pentos and

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.809 
power-tool inside or bunch of Pentos and
you<00:02:30.440> don't<00:02:30.650> want<00:02:30.860> small<00:02:31.069> parts<00:02:31.370> but<00:02:31.549> you<00:02:31.670> do

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
you don't want small parts but you do

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.240 
you don't want small parts but you do
want<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> visibility<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.440> fact<00:02:33.829> all<00:02:34.069> these

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
want the visibility in fact all these

a to a new card
with<00:02:58.220> one<00:02:58.520> card<00:02:58.790> which<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.180> more<00:02:59.360> basic

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
with one card which is a more basic

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.910 
with one card which is a more basic
version<00:02:59.959> 3<00:03:00.890> n<00:03:00.950> %<00:03:01.459> swiveling<00:03:02.000> wheels<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.920> they

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
version 3 n % swiveling wheels and they

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.330 
version 3 n % swiveling wheels and they
can<00:03:04.100> also<00:03:04.280> be<00:03:04.550> loved

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.610 

and<00:03:12.790> down<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.690> way<00:03:14.020> it<00:03:14.080> controls<00:03:14.500> the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
and down so that way it controls the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.470 
and down so that way it controls the
movements<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.220> case<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.580> actually<00:03:15.940> do<00:03:16.120> on<00:03:16.330> it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
movements in case you actually do on it

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.500 
movements in case you actually do on it
sit<00:03:17.140> down<00:03:17.349> maybe<00:03:17.770> work<00:03:18.120> underneath<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.270> steel

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
sit down maybe work underneath the steel

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.960 
sit down maybe work underneath the steel
cord<00:03:19.870> level<00:03:20.319> yourself<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.610> be<00:03:21.760> locked

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
cord level yourself so it can be locked

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.400 
cord level yourself so it can be locked
