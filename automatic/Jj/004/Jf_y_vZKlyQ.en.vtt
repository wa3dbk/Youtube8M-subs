00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.140
 two 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.930
 in the world there are junkyards 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.270
 all kinds of cars 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.270
 motorcycles including bicycles but 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.279
 one of planes in the middle of mexico city 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.279
 let me tell you 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.349
 are three boeing 737 aircraft were 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.900
 moved here so that 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.300
 continue flying yes but now from 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.430
 because here they will be given a second 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.980
 utility I have seen that children 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.769
 young people including adults 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.089
 like to get on a plane and there it was 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.220
 where it occurred to me to put an airplane 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.540
 In my business, the company sells you 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.800
 the plane without the instruments 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.809
 electronic 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.829
 neither the landing gear much 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.409
 less the engines 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.149
 military sergio already retired account that 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.399
 to move them from the airport to 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.289
 here they had to leave each one in 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.640
 four parts that you have to start what 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.009
 load it with cranes put it on 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.399
 platforms and move it to the place where 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.649
 you want to take it and there again cranes and 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.950
 again accommodate the wings go in another 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.659
 platform the tail goes on another platform 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.729
 minimum are three platforms to be able 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.820
 have the plane and each transfer has a 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.780
 average cost of 300 thousand pesos and is that 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.959
 a single plane of these weighs 30 tons 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.049
 It measures 30 meters long and 30 wide 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:32.319
 this side the cabin and this all 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.569
 seats where they once traveled 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:38.840
 150 passengers has a central aisle 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.640
 it was a plane that had a speed or 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.890
 reached at speeds of 850 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.390
 kilometers per hour these aircraft are 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.260
 planes which are already low in lines 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.220
 aerial 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.740
 then they make the offer to publish a 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.960
 public auction and sell it by kilo 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.420
 because they are waste planes these 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.520
 airplanes could become houses in 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.230
 bars or in libraries but sergio says 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.930
 who will use them for 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.340
 exclusively entertainment or 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.600
 calasancias in the images edgar
