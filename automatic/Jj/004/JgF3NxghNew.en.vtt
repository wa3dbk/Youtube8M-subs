well<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.170> followers<00:00:13.500> are<00:00:13.559> very<00:00:13.830> comfortable

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
well the followers are very comfortable

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.849 
well the followers are very comfortable
in<00:00:14.340> practice<00:00:14.759> which<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.870> nice<00:00:16.230> sign

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
in practice which is a nice sign

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.130 
in practice which is a nice sign
I<00:00:16.890> think<00:00:17.609> they've<00:00:18.119> played<00:00:18.359> many<00:00:18.570> times<00:00:18.690> on

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
I think they've played many times on

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.090 
I think they've played many times on
short<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.430> they<00:00:20.880> feel<00:00:21.410> fairly<00:00:22.410> comfortable<00:00:22.680> on

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
short so they feel fairly comfortable on

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.370 
short so they feel fairly comfortable on
the<00:00:23.220> short<00:00:23.460> pattern<00:00:23.869> even<00:00:24.869> though<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> short

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the short pattern even though the short

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.259 
the short pattern even though the short
pattern<00:00:25.560> changes<00:00:26.220> from<00:00:26.640> tournament<00:00:27.060> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
pattern changes from tournament to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.939 
pattern changes from tournament to
tournament<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> last<00:00:28.170> few<00:00:28.470> years<00:00:28.529> that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
tournament over the last few years that

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.410 
tournament over the last few years that
put<00:00:29.099> more<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.340> more<00:00:29.519> volume<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> pattern

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
put more and more volume in the pattern

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.630 
put more and more volume in the pattern
but<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.349> they're<00:00:31.590> they're<00:00:32.040> feeling

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
but I think they're they're feeling

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
but I think they're they're feeling
fairly<00:00:32.850> comfortable<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.930> medium<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
fairly comfortable the medium is the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.530 
fairly comfortable the medium is the
tricky<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.940> haven't<00:00:36.120> played<00:00:36.390> on

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
tricky one because we haven't played on

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.720 
tricky one because we haven't played on
medium<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.110> much<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.129> last<00:00:38.340> time<00:00:38.579> they

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
medium very much and the last time they

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.510 
medium very much and the last time they
played<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.120> medium<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.750> their<00:00:40.140> Germany<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:41.399> do

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
played on medium is their Germany can do

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.100 
played on medium is their Germany can do
very<00:00:41.760> well<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.239> didn't<00:00:42.600> feel<00:00:42.719> very<00:00:42.930> comfortable

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
very well I didn't feel very comfortable

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.069 
very well I didn't feel very comfortable
at<00:00:43.469> all<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.980> we've<00:00:44.940> been<00:00:45.180> more<00:00:45.390> practicing<00:00:45.960> on

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
at all so we've been more practicing on

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
at all so we've been more practicing on
that<00:00:46.489> working<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:47.940> we're

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
that working on that and now we're

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
that working on that and now we're
concentrating<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> medium<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:49.320> for

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
concentrating on the medium more for

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.459 
concentrating on the medium more for
sure<00:00:49.770> well<00:00:50.329> we've<00:00:51.329> got<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.379> bit

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
sure well we've got it's a little bit

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.660 
sure well we've got it's a little bit
different<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.890> us<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.219> we've<00:00:53.520> got<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
different for us because we've got a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.029 
different for us because we've got a
couple<00:00:53.940> more<00:00:54.180> older<00:00:54.989> bowls<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> team

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
couple more older bowls of the team

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.090 
couple more older bowls of the team
and<00:00:56.160> they<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.520> guys<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> we've<00:00:58.680> gone<00:00:58.859> back<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
and they use guys so we've gone back to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
and they use guys so we've gone back to
rely<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> stalwarts<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
rely on one of the stalwarts of the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.150 
rely on one of the stalwarts of the
seaming

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
seaming

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.690 
seaming
ten<00:01:02.730> years<00:01:02.940> ago<00:01:03.180> fatherless<00:01:03.719> Aoi<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:05.129> think

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
ten years ago fatherless Aoi and I think

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.179 
ten years ago fatherless Aoi and I think
he<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:05.939> brings<00:01:06.180> he<00:01:06.630> bring<00:01:06.900> someone<00:01:07.380> someone

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
he just brings he bring someone someone

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
he just brings he bring someone someone
that<00:01:08.250> gets<00:01:08.939> everyone<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.450> relax<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.930> got

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that gets everyone to relax it's got

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
that gets everyone to relax it's got
very<00:01:10.439> good<00:01:10.560> experience<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.850> think

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
very good experience but I think

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.149 
very good experience but I think
Muhammad<00:01:12.420> receiver<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.990> still<00:01:13.229> playing<00:01:13.560> very

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
Muhammad receiver is still playing very

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.480 
Muhammad receiver is still playing very
well<00:01:14.369> since<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> Asian<00:01:15.360> Games<00:01:16.369> especially<00:01:17.369> on

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
well since the Asian Games especially on

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490 
well since the Asian Games especially on
the<00:01:17.580> short<00:01:17.820> pattern<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:19.049> he<00:01:19.110> feels<00:01:19.320> very

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the short pattern I think he feels very

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.490 
the short pattern I think he feels very
comfortable<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.960> different<00:01:21.960> I've<00:01:22.320> seen

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
comfortable I think different I've seen

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.649 
comfortable I think different I've seen
the<00:01:22.560> difference<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> colour<00:01:23.340> dubium<00:01:23.909> he's

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the difference in the colour dubium he's

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.260 
the difference in the colour dubium he's
worked<00:01:25.200> very<00:01:25.350> hard

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.039 

a<00:01:29.850> little<00:01:30.850> early<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.299> think<00:01:31.539> between<00:01:31.719> real

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
a little early I think between real

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.630 
a little early I think between real
actors<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.560> what's<00:01:32.679> for<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.189> rest<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.549> the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
actors and what's for to the rest of the

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.469 
actors and what's for to the rest of the
week<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:35.380> competition<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.280> could<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:37.119> hope

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
week in this competition I could I hope

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.209 
week in this competition I could I hope
would<00:01:37.630> say<00:01:37.929> it's<00:01:38.170> a<00:01:38.259> little<00:01:38.439> bit<00:01:38.560> Eames<00:01:38.979> or<00:01:39.189> a

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
would say it's a little bit Eames or a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.830 
would say it's a little bit Eames or a
little<00:01:39.490> weaker<00:01:39.850> we<00:01:40.210> can<00:01:40.360> be<00:01:40.450> honest<00:01:40.719> about

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
little weaker we can be honest about

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.929 
little weaker we can be honest about
that<00:01:41.170> some<00:01:41.530> teams<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.920> sensitive<00:01:42.429> all<00:01:42.700> youth

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
that some teams of sensitive all youth

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.749 
that some teams of sensitive all youth
violence<00:01:43.210> then<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:46.240> Asian<00:01:46.539> Games<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.890> the

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
violence then and the Asian Games so the

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.279 
violence then and the Asian Games so the
Korean<00:01:49.030> team<00:01:49.209> obviously<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.899> best<00:01:50.020> team

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
Korean team obviously is the best team

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.740 
Korean team obviously is the best team
by<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.920> long<00:01:51.189> way<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.610> you<00:01:52.119> would<00:01:52.240> expect<00:01:52.600> them

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
by a long way and you would expect them

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.319 
by a long way and you would expect them
to<00:01:52.780> be<00:01:53.229> up<00:01:53.500> there<00:01:53.679> every<00:01:53.979> time<00:01:54.159> but<00:01:54.789> I<00:01:55.179> think

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
to be up there every time but I think

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.690 
to be up there every time but I think
that<00:01:55.600> only<00:01:55.750> gets<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.350> guys<00:01:56.530> more<00:01:57.100> fired<00:01:57.369> up<00:01:57.549> to

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
that only gets the guys more fired up to

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.569 
that only gets the guys more fired up to
try<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:57.909> get<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.479> medal<00:01:58.689> so<00:01:58.990> for<00:01:59.380> me<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.530> think<00:01:59.770> I

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
try and get a medal so for me I think I

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.059 
try and get a medal so for me I think I
look<00:02:01.329> at<00:02:01.479> more<00:02:01.659> being<00:02:01.929> in<00:02:02.079> contention<00:02:02.530> in<00:02:02.920> each

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
look at more being in contention in each

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.279 
look at more being in contention in each
event<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.970> if<00:02:04.090> you're<00:02:04.239> in<00:02:04.360> contention<00:02:04.750> going

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
event so if you're in contention going

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.109 
event so if you're in contention going
into<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.530> last<00:02:05.679> game<00:02:05.950> with<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.189> chance<00:02:06.520> then<00:02:06.819> I

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
into the last game with a chance then I

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.270 
into the last game with a chance then I
think<00:02:07.509> we've<00:02:07.689> achieved<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.170> goals<00:02:08.410> if<00:02:09.130> it

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
think we've achieved the goals if it

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.889 
think we've achieved the goals if it
works<00:02:09.459> out<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.700> works<00:02:09.819> out<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.269> doesn't<00:02:10.539> roll

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
works out it works out it doesn't roll

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.650 
works out it works out it doesn't roll
back<00:02:11.470> there
