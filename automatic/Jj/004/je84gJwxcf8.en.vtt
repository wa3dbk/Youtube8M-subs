00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 perform it andrÃ©s palop torch 10 and the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.930
 today I bring you something a little 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.420
 different is the unboxing and the monitor 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.969
 emilia's official is from the brand bng 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.000
 is the best monitor for gaming by a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.730
 low price this monitor is 1080p is 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.130
 24 inches and how interesting this 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.230
 monitor is the delay it has is only 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.180
 of a millisecond which is great for 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 first person shooters or games 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.560
 require a rapid response from 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.410
 millisecond image sounds like something 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.390
 exaggerated but in that kind of games is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 necessary monitor with a very responsive 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.190
 quick as regards the resolution of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.020
 monitor for games is very good and if you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.700
 you decide to use as a monitor 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.879
 computer or something like that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.379
 the definition is pretty decent inside 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.780
 from the box we will find the manuals of 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.320
 use together with the drivers the cable uve and 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.180
 the vga cable and the base will also be 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.789
 that was very useful to me since it 's something 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.930
 long and the design is also interesting 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.000
 unfortunately it does not integrate an HDMI cable 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.859
 and I think that should integrate 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.409
 practically all the consoles use it 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.830
 well when it does not include the hdmi cable but 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.480
 in 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.790
 is not that high price so what 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.980
 let's buy separately the monitor has 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.460
 Integrated speakers are not the best 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.230
 quality but they do well with work 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.030
 and something that I really like about this 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.130
 monitor is going to serve as an interface 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.080
 that is, you can put any type 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 of hearing aids to listen to your games 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.570
 you need some headsets of a brand 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.340
 so prestigious for example if any 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.680
 Once you bought yourself some expensive hearing aids 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.940
 some beats or anything and you like them 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.280
 you will be able to use them a lot 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.810
 you simply connect them to the monitor and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.060
 well you will be able to listen to the game in 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.460
 with new and very good quality the price 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.050
 of this monitor is very economical I 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.810
 I found in amazon for less than 200 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.880
 dollars has a big discount and what 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 I recommend that you buy it there is here 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.530
 in Mexico it goes out approximately by 4000 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.330
 pesos and we buy it in amazon and believe me 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.369
 that they will not find anything for a 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.960
 best price in the description I'm going to 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.850
 leave the amazon link and if you want 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.280

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.840
 or some other option alike links 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.280

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.160
 zombies 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.630
