00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
wanted to try it out and I went into

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.780 
wanted to try it out and I went into
online<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.800> did<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.070> little<00:02:23.280> Easter<00:02:23.610> not

Fort<00:03:25.530> Zancudo<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.160> air<00:03:26.310> traffic<00:03:26.700> control

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
Fort Zancudo the air traffic control

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.490 
Fort Zancudo the air traffic control
tower<00:03:27.210> whatever<00:03:27.810> it's<00:03:27.960> called<00:03:28.140> that<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.380> can

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
tower whatever it's called that you can

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.380 
tower whatever it's called that you can
go<00:03:28.620> into<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.580> there's<00:03:29.730> an<00:03:29.850> elevator<00:03:30.180> that

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
go into but there's an elevator that

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.000 
go into but there's an elevator that
opens<00:03:30.780> up<00:03:30.930> when<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.140> walk<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.740> and<00:03:31.920> it

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
opens up when you walk to it and it

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.560 
opens up when you walk to it and it
closes<00:03:32.430> when<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.640> get<00:03:32.760> inside<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.240> but

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
closes when you get inside of it but

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.880 
closes when you get inside of it but
there's<00:03:33.750> nothing<00:03:33.900> inside<00:03:34.200> of<00:03:34.500> it<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.680> doesn't

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
there's nothing inside of it it doesn't

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.340 
there's nothing inside of it it doesn't
move<00:03:35.130> or<00:03:35.250> anything<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:35.910> why<00:03:36.750> would<00:03:36.960> they<00:03:37.080> have

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
move or anything so why would they have

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.650 
move or anything so why would they have
this<00:03:37.590> there<00:03:37.890> if<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.340> didn't<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:39.000> anything<00:03:39.300> it

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
this there if it didn't do anything it

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.630 
this there if it didn't do anything it
just<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.260> makes<00:03:40.650> me<00:03:40.830> wonder<00:03:40.980> what's<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.490> point

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
just it makes me wonder what's the point

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.090 
just it makes me wonder what's the point
of<00:03:41.820> this<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.290> now<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.350> we<00:03:43.530> know<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.860> these

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
of this so now that we know that these

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.860 
of this so now that we know that these
elevators<00:03:44.580> or<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.060> elevator<00:03:45.450> has<00:03:45.690> an

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
elevators or this elevator has an

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.960 
elevators or this elevator has an
opening<00:03:46.170> animation<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.950> think<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.940> just

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
opening animation I think that is just

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.910 
opening animation I think that is just
another<00:03:48.450> step<00:03:48.780> into<00:03:49.020> figuring<00:03:49.500> out<00:03:49.710> this

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
another step into figuring out this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.800 
another step into figuring out this
whole<00:03:49.980> jetpack<00:03:50.610> Easter<00:03:51.000> Egger<00:03:51.180> there<00:03:51.540> being

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
whole jetpack Easter Egger there being

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.290 
whole jetpack Easter Egger there being
something<00:03:52.080> underneath<00:03:52.380> fort<00:03:52.770> Zancudo<00:03:53.300> this

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
something underneath fort Zancudo this

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.510 
something underneath fort Zancudo this
also<00:03:54.660> leads<00:03:55.290> me<00:03:55.440> back<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.650> san<00:03:55.980> andreas'

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
also leads me back to san andreas'

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.130 
also leads me back to san andreas'
because<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.000> san<00:03:57.180> andreas<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.900> get<00:03:58.020> the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
because in san andreas to get the

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.480 
because in san andreas to get the
jetpack<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.710> was<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.830> mission<00:03:59.160> where<00:03:59.310> CJ

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
jetpack there was a mission where CJ

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.970 
jetpack there was a mission where CJ
went<00:03:59.880> into<00:04:00.150> area<00:04:00.480> 69<00:04:00.930> as<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.560> was<00:04:01.650> called<00:04:01.830> in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
went into area 69 as it was called in

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.460 
went into area 69 as it was called in
that<00:04:02.100> game<00:04:02.420> but<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.480> believe<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.960> was<00:04:04.050> located

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
that game but I believe it was located

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.770 
that game but I believe it was located
the<00:04:04.740> jetpack<00:04:05.130> underground<00:04:05.910> meaning<00:04:06.660> that

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the jetpack underground meaning that

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.450 
the jetpack underground meaning that
Rockstar<00:04:07.320> has<00:04:07.440> done<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.800> before<00:04:07.980> in

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
Rockstar has done this before in
