 how much information do you 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.510
 the fifth place since the middle of orchestra the conquest of baby's life 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.829
 as yours is extended or not 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.919
 if this is an activity the community is based 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.539
 and that was a great social impact because they thought that because of the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.130
 community 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.859
 and good of the community 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.859
 we can not speculate we have to do as it is sold at affordable prices 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.490
 solidarity prices without stopping doing business 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.730

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 A) Yes 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.980
 viedma 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
 then that sense of all that sense 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.480
 let's go percent 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.150
 all 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.290
 you have to conjugate it shows a point 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.780
 from here to the sea 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.280
 klitschko 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.690
 econó believes that the population has welcomed this nursery a hundred 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.810
 well so far it has only been very good 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.780
 little that is supplied 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.190
 all product sold to the field 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.190
 in good condition of good quality and cleanliness 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.470
 and in all tasks ipc or what will be 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.480
 something product 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.680
 so that the population received it with good taste 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 or street everything is worth the cd iffhs merchandise 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.320
 avoid the average 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.210
 and then again for the little that does not have quality 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.460
 of joint flight 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.620
 good here biete quality 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.620
 and is that the Balearic govern and without points 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.800
 agr 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.250
 from france 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.870
 legislator 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.870
 p 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.650
 do not 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.340
 the full 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.490
 in people not only from winning but from other parts year 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.410
 each study 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.630
 good that comes fifth place was designed a product or opt for 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.149
 concealment 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:15.089
 i everything is in a tea room and wonderful ambiance bel 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.659
 how it works well 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.300
 at this level and as we are part of the san community the community oar 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
 somehow we press attention to quality 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.459
 time runs and moral 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.309
 normal demand so they say it the entire course 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.309
 fighter I do not tell you we produce an unusual tone 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.479
 finally the day 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.779
 Brazil 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.779
 rather cold 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.229
 require it 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.229
 on the contrary 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.839
 the use of nuclear energy 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.120
 was introduced in the country and from 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.419
 chemotherapy another alternative 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.639
 and they started to see each other 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.389
 very large activities for the past such as homeopathic medicine medicine 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.799
 green 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.480
 pyramidal hilaria in one of the activities that the development 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.069
 Cuban medicine 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.679
 it is said that there was a 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.899
 a French who visited the pyramid in fact the forties and so 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.109
 and he was struck by the fact that the animals that moved inside the 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.319
 pyramid 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.339
 it did not decompose but dried 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.339
 and that we see attention and he said among other things 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.609
 aa to the positive energy charge that avoided the composition 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.199
 this forward 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.009
 in the swatch to work on the subject 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.709
 iii detected 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.259
 what plane 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.129
 that the pyramid a mann ethical field 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.899
 it's an antenna 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.459
 that would concentrate to positive 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.089
 that the whole pyramid 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.029
 both Mesoamerican 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.339
 as new as the addiction has a mathematical relationship equal 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:57.759
 and an orientation 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.759
 magnetic north 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.469
 ikea and different gradient of manipulating all of one's own 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.629
 pyramid 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.640
 that for example with that is its greatest intensity in the area of ​​the camera 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.819
 mortuary lead us to Pharaoh 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.599
 that pyramidal energy 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.339
 Per hundred is done 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.339
 can be pirated media in any way of any material 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.849
 but always a single material 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.229
 is oriented north 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.069
 so there is work that they feel sorry 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:22.229
 And it does not matter 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.360
 the size yes the dimensions e is kept 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 us what I love them as 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.210
 so be it 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.150
 business dinner 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.779
 for dextre 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.159
 for metabolism problems 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.429
 and a lot of people to feel certain concert 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.559
 improvement in his state of 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:43.930
 general physical 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.550
 also used for lapa generation stimulates the elimination of 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.999
 seed 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.479
 is used to put water into pyramidal energy has been generalized 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.479
 avo with pyramidal energy that has a group of benefits also 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.220
 and serves as Jose conservation to the things to do 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:03.659
 pyramid storage 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.199
 delayed corrosion process 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.749
 and one of the things to approve without barely functioning properly 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:10.360
 widely 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.569
 a future is a cucumber or a papaya 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.009
 and it gets one more time inside another outside 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.499
 and you will see the difference that the other one corrupts the first 72 hours after 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:20.949
 spend this week 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.240
 and that brings if it is properly oriented 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.439
 if it is isolated but only material 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.719
 it has become a tradition as foreseen people come here is a pyramid 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.189
 tarapío that the person has well overcome 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.269
 with for the kill people buy more tedious paraplegics that occurred 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:39.809
 and good and there is an experience in that especially in Cuban medicine 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.460
 omar very important challenge 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.650
 that intensive agricultural production where outside of the city new vision 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.919
 to the people what is approved said 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.680
 the work ended passionate children to school sometimes not an easy 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.659
 access 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.339
 and I have acted 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.219
 the possibility of maintaining a permanent sample of what there is no culture of 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.050
 other then the farmer 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.849
 and that this urban agricultural activity 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.030
 can be a life project because it was for sustainability 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.569
 economic that has 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.139
 the development perspective
