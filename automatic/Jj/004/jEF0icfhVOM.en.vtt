00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
gives me extra range so I'm going to try

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
gives me extra range so I'm going to try
and<00:00:50.399> reforge<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.059> after<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:52.140> an<00:00:52.260> extra

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379

and reforge this after and get an extra
range<00:00:52.770> perk<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.079> goes<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
range perk here so this goes to the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560 
range perk here so this goes to the
gunsmith<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.190> give<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.390> gonna
