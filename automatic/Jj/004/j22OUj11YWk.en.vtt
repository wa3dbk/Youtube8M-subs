 USD lower interest rates 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.650

 they master the theoretical content 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.830
 but that's not all it's about I'm following for the learned

 put into action right on the piano 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.100
 a you can say that as I would 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.250
 Gert Lindemann and Horst make 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.670
 and I'm not running out 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 60 percent 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460

 is 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.359

 Pass aptitude test 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:41.669
 there and have already did not know where we are is not taken so cost 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:42.799
 saves 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.109
 but functioning are worth closing Mo and that means stopping then 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.109
 Can scour the ancient thought that will pass the exam 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.290

 but recently there is a glow on the campus sees buildings 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.179
 Here, students can always sample without disturbing others 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.169
 not only solves the problem 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.089
 only a barrier at that Rudi Marx are accordingly 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.389
 is the least favorable solution and over that 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.389
 sensibly redone inside 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.069
