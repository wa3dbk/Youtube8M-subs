00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
soldering iron and get to it first we'll

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.320 
soldering iron and get to it first we'll
unsolder<00:01:12.010> that<00:01:12.250> little<00:01:12.520> microphone<00:01:13.030> because

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
unsolder that little microphone because

we're<00:01:13.689> not<00:01:13.780> gonna<00:01:13.960> use<00:01:14.229> it<00:01:14.409> but<00:01:14.680> we're<00:01:15.040> gonna

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
we're not gonna use it but we're gonna

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.250 
we're not gonna use it but we're gonna
save<00:01:15.490> it<00:01:15.520> for<00:01:15.850> another<00:01:15.880> project<00:01:16.299> and<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.080> two

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
save it for another project and the two

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.720 
save it for another project and the two
wires<00:01:17.500> that<00:01:17.740> we<00:01:17.890> unsoldered<00:01:18.430> from<00:01:18.640> the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
wires that we unsoldered from the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.490 
wires that we unsoldered from the
microphone<00:01:19.180> are<00:01:19.420> gonna<00:01:19.630> go<00:01:19.810> directly<00:01:20.230> to<00:01:20.470> our

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
microphone are gonna go directly to our

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.800 
microphone are gonna go directly to our
audio<00:01:20.950> jack<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.700> wires<00:01:21.910> can<00:01:22.150> be<00:01:22.210> soldered<00:01:22.660> to

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
audio jack the wires can be soldered to

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.480 
audio jack the wires can be soldered to
either<00:01:23.080> connection<00:01:23.620> we'll<00:01:24.070> be<00:01:24.190> replacing

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
either connection we'll be replacing

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.670 
either connection we'll be replacing
that<00:01:24.880> really<00:01:25.360> cheap<00:01:25.660> speaker<00:01:26.260> so<00:01:26.500> we'll

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
that really cheap speaker so we'll

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.830 
that really cheap speaker so we'll
unsolder<00:01:27.250> that<00:01:27.610> as<00:01:27.790> well<00:01:28.030> I'll<00:01:28.390> be<00:01:28.540> using<00:01:28.660> my

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
unsolder that as well I'll be using my

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.630 
unsolder that as well I'll be using my
solder<00:01:29.320> sucker<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:30.010> make<00:01:30.160> that<00:01:30.340> job<00:01:30.610> easier

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
solder sucker to make that job easier

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.940 
solder sucker to make that job easier
now<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.720> speakers<00:01:32.110> on<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.320> solder<00:01:32.530> it's

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
now that the speakers on the solder it's

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.070 
now that the speakers on the solder it's
time<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.520> use<00:01:33.730> some<00:01:33.910> wire<00:01:34.120> will<00:01:34.660> solder<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
time to use some wire will solder the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.780 
time to use some wire will solder the
two<00:01:35.230> connections<00:01:35.740> from<00:01:36.010> one<00:01:36.310> end<00:01:36.550> of<00:01:36.640> that

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
wire to the connections that we just

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.040 
wire to the connections that we just
solder<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.550> speaker<00:01:39.910> from<00:01:40.030> have<00:01:40.570> a<00:01:40.600> playback

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
to make room for the speaker well that's

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.039 
to make room for the speaker well that's
a<00:02:12.220> pretty<00:02:12.489> good<00:02:12.700> fit<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.659> hold<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.959> in

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
a pretty good fit and to hold it in

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.920 
a pretty good fit and to hold it in
place<00:02:14.200> hot<00:02:14.890> glue<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.060> I'll<00:02:16.209> use<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> generous

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
place hot glue so I'll use a generous

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.660 
place hot glue so I'll use a generous
amount<00:02:17.200> around<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> edge<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.159> speaker

enclosure now that our speakers mounted
it's<00:02:22.840> time<00:02:23.170> for<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.560> momentary<00:02:24.280> switch<00:02:24.730> and

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
it's time for that momentary switch and

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.900 
it's time for that momentary switch and
that's<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.690> go<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.110> top<00:02:26.319> as<00:02:26.530> well

on<00:02:27.120> one<00:02:27.510> end<00:02:27.540> next<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.440> speaker<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> used<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
on one end next to the speaker I used a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.190 
on one end next to the speaker I used a
drill<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.940> bit<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.360> little<00:02:30.630> bit<00:02:30.750> larger

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
drill with a bit a little bit larger

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.930 
drill with a bit a little bit larger
than<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.380> switch<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.950> drilled<00:02:32.460> through<00:02:32.700> that

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
than the switch and drilled through that

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.600

top<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.960> switch<00:02:34.290> fits<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.860> perfectly

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
top and the switch fits in perfectly

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.550 
top and the switch fits in perfectly
I'll<00:02:36.030> use<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.360> nut<00:02:36.570> on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> other<00:02:37.050> end<00:02:37.290> to
