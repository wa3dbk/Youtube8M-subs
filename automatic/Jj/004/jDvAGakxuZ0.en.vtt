00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.469
 tutorial to explain how 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.620

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.089
 worth 26 on minecraft in 1.6 points 4 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.520
 it does not matter if you have a real tale 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.600
 or a cracking tale we find ourselves all 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.600
 immediately for the tutorial 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.810
 so we end up now 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.120
 for the tutorial you will need for this 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.090
 amber studio camera mode tutorial 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.950
 6.4 penalty shots and a magic 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.800
 launcher to find a link 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.820
 dropbox in the description for these 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.530
 so now I'm going to explain 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 how to use the magic launcher 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.850
 what for those who already know 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.860
 the magic thrower from top to bottom of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.470
 right to left can click on the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.360
 link that will appear soon for 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.710
 able to move on following the video 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.510
 so now for those who have 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.110
 never seen my tuque launcher continued 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.010
 the video so for those who continue 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.120
 the video we will offer the match launcher 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.590
 it may take a little while 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.590
 depends on your pc 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.750
 in appearance it will look like ac to the ace 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.600
 1.5.2 but I can assure you that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.190
 this is for the 1.6 points 4 1 so if 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.229
 I was in your place for the sake of caution 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.260
 depends on when you will look at the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.360
 video between the word I posted to them that 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.720
 really you'll watch it I 'll go 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.420
 in options and jeffrey spoils the test 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.710
 so I'm going to do it it's useless 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.370
 because I have the latest version I 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.470
 will show you 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.600
 so that where is it going to open a page of 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.450
 minecraft forum less clear 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.010
 look we're just fighting here's the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.100
 last the last version is magic 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.990
 launcher at a point 2.5 and like you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 can see it's my case too so 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.860
 personally I would not need 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.090
 to download so now I think 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.570
 although I put you last 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.920
 version 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.710
 everything is possible and stuffed 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.150
 evolve by then and anyway when 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.649
 you start magic launcher there you 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.220
 will propose to make an update you 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.650
 just have to accept 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.030
 so to set a mode that my jeep 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.489
 launcher will have to execute 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.290
 it's as simple as that you just need 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.430
 to go into your roaming and to 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.480
 place in the mode folder 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.550
 so for those who do not know 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.010
 how are we going in the roaming folder there 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.540
 must open the executor of windows in 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.470
 doing start 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.350
 r there in the line that showed you there 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.110
 you just have to type % appdata% as 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.600
 it's mila and to do ok there it goes you 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.010
 open your robbing you go into the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.269
 corner minecraft weeds in mode 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.130
 once you are there in you 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.720
 take the files that you can 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:54.580
 find in the winrar that she I you 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.319
 have put it on download and it you 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.630
 just slide the first two 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.120
 files in the mode folder when I 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.620
 not going to do it myself here are already so 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.049
 then you close both 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.750
 windows and you go back on the magic 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.489
 launcher so to set modes to 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.390
 run and you just have to go in 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.980
 this up of iron had he going to open you 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.629
 a window that goes up different 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.569
 modes that are placed in your folder 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.940
 mode you select studio camera 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.260
 1.6 point 4 mode and brdp studio cameras 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.909
 26 you open there he goes the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.190
 place for it to be executed but 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.750
 some even seeing panicked at 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.849
 review our moods the smell then 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.910
 actually your minecraft point does not 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.879
 contains no words from the author but the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.000
 magic launcher is an other mode so he 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.510
 will run your modes so at this time 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.910
 there you do 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.980

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.299
 with the modes by closing the magic 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.669

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.010
 the magic launcher will stay open he goes 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.810
 still you start minecraft but 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:54.720
 you know in the in the game as 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.949
 that the running player who's called 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.720
 which costs so I will prove it to you 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.580
 it's true that in single player I do not 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.710
 could not prove to you that the player 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.720
 is called kikoo but to watch in multi 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.970
 player on the server where I will go 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:10.770
 you will see who will be marked who 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.770

 here we go back out of the 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.180
