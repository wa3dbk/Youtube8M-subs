you don't have trapcode particular so
not<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> big<00:00:43.680> deal<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.489> we<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.030> is

a selection of 64 different shape layers

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.150 
a selection of 64 different shape layers
these<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.350> all<00:00:49.469> been<00:00:49.500> conveniently

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
these have all been conveniently

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.250 
these have all been conveniently
organized<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:51.090> two<00:00:51.420> different<00:00:51.570> rows<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
organized in two different rows of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.400 
organized in two different rows of
similar<00:00:52.680> effects<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:54.780> effects<00:00:55.170> were

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
similar effects and these effects were

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.500 
similar effects and these effects were
inspired<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.160> different<00:00:56.670> videos<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> saw

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
inspired by different videos that I saw

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
inspired by different videos that I saw
some<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.930> them<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.079> made<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.350> my<00:00:58.379> own<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> few<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
some of them I made on my own a few of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.680 
some of them I made on my own a few of
them<00:00:59.250> were<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.609> made<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.820> cinema<00:01:00.059> 4d<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
them were actually made in cinema 4d and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.540 
them were actually made in cinema 4d and
then<00:01:01.230> imported<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.800> now<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.070> great<00:01:02.280> thing

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
then imported here now the great thing

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
then imported here now the great thing
about<00:01:02.579> most<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.120> these<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.750> their<00:01:03.899> shape

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
about most of these is that their shape

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
about most of these is that their shape
layers<00:01:04.409> meaning<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.729> change<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
layers meaning that we can change the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840 
layers meaning that we can change the
size<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.720> them<00:01:06.900> bring<00:01:07.350> them<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.850> infinitely

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
size of them bring them up infinitely

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.460 
size of them bring them up infinitely
and<00:01:09.090> they're<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.750> lose<00:01:09.990> their

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and they're not going to lose their

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.200 
and they're not going to lose their
quality<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.670> gonna<00:01:11.760> quickly<00:01:11.909> show<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
quality so I'm gonna quickly show you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.060 
quality so I'm gonna quickly show you
how<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.540> might<00:01:12.810> use<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> project<00:01:13.650> if<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
how I might use this in a project if I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.469 
how I might use this in a project if I
were<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> make<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> new<00:01:14.549> composition<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:15.330> I

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
were to make a new composition here I

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.690 
were to make a new composition here I
have<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.229> new<00:01:16.409> composition<00:01:16.950> let's<00:01:17.520> say<00:01:17.670> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
have this new composition let's say I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.370 
have this new composition let's say I
like<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.090> string<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.689> bounces<00:01:19.200> so

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
like this string here that bounces so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.690 
like this string here that bounces so
I'm<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> hit<00:01:19.740> command<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
I'm going to hit command you're going to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.090 
I'm going to hit command you're going to
select<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.000> string<00:01:21.390> hit<00:01:21.570> command<00:01:21.900> C<00:01:22.140> go<00:01:22.890> here

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
select that string hit command C go here

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
select that string hit command C go here
into<00:01:23.400> my<00:01:23.490> new<00:01:23.610> composition<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> hit<00:01:24.600> command

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
into my new composition and hit command

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.749 
into my new composition and hit command
V<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.500> paste<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.280> I'm<00:01:26.400> gonna<00:01:26.490> hit<00:01:26.640> s

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
V I paste it in there I'm gonna hit s

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.530 
V I paste it in there I'm gonna hit s
for<00:01:27.000> scale<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.479> now<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.350> scale<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
for scale and now I can scale it up and

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.740 
for scale and now I can scale it up and
move<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> around<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:32.100> where<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.700> want<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> it's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
move it around to where I want and it's
going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> still<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.040> good<00:01:35.280> amount<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
going to still have a good amount of

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
going to still have a good amount of
quality<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.240> again<00:01:36.540> I'm<00:01:36.659> only<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.900> quarter

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
quality here again I'm only a quarter

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.330 
quality here again I'm only a quarter
here<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> turn<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> full

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
here but I'm going to turn up to full

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.490 
here but I'm going to turn up to full
and<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> hit<00:01:39.390> paste<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and if I hit paste here we can see that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.950 
and if I hit paste here we can see that
our<00:01:40.619> animation<00:01:41.070> goes<00:01:41.220> through<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.899> now<00:01:42.899> we

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
our animation goes through and now we

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.179 
our animation goes through and now we
can<00:01:43.140> play<00:01:43.229> through<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.950> cool

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
can play through and we have that cool

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.219 
can play through and we have that cool
animation<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.049> with

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
animation there and we can do this with

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.670 
animation there and we can do this with
any<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.860> our<00:01:47.610> shape<00:01:48.270> layers<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:49.049> some<00:01:49.560> of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
any of our shape layers here some of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.139 
any of our shape layers here some of
them<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:49.979> pre<00:01:50.159> composed<00:01:50.549> into<00:01:50.790> different

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
them are pre composed into different

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.899 
them are pre composed into different
compositions<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:52.079> example<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:53.009> animation

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
compositions for example this animation

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.020 
compositions for example this animation
here<00:01:54.149> might<00:01:54.299> command<00:01:54.659> C<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.520> click<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.759> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
here might command C and click here and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.330 
here might command C and click here and
hit<00:01:57.270> command<00:01:57.420> V<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.710> scale<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.189> we

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
hit command V and I can scale it up we

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.490 
hit command V and I can scale it up we
can<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.820> if<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.630> bring<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.020> 100

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
can see that's if I bring up to 100

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
can see that's if I bring up to 100
that's<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> give<00:02:01.979> me<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.430> full<00:02:02.700> scaling

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
that's going to give me the full scaling

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.050 
that's going to give me the full scaling
here<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.320> pick<00:02:04.590> play<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.159> animate

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
here and I can pick play and animate

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.339 
here and I can pick play and animate
through<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.509> cool<00:02:07.469> animation<00:02:09.020> now<00:02:10.020> these

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
through this cool animation now these

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.500 
through this cool animation now these
effects<00:02:10.709> were<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.099> inspired<00:02:11.580> by<00:02:11.730> videos

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
effects were actually inspired by videos

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.280 
effects were actually inspired by videos
that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.009 
that
were<00:02:13.379> sent<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> me<00:02:13.799> on<00:02:13.980> Facebook<00:02:14.879> we<00:02:15.810> had

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
were sent to me on Facebook we had

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.530 
were sent to me on Facebook we had
several<00:02:16.620> users<00:02:16.829> who<00:02:17.069> sent<00:02:17.310> me<00:02:17.400> videos<00:02:17.540> for

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
several users who sent me videos for

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.729 
several users who sent me videos for
certain<00:02:18.810> music<00:02:19.109> videos<00:02:19.409> and<00:02:19.680> different

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
certain music videos and different

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.470 
certain music videos and different
motion<00:02:20.099> graphics<00:02:20.400> projects<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:21.359> actually

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
motion graphics projects that actually

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.069 
motion graphics projects that actually
inspired<00:02:22.200> these<00:02:22.650> shape<00:02:23.310> layer<00:02:23.700> animations<00:02:24.450> so

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
inspired these shape layer animations so

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.899 
inspired these shape layer animations so
we<00:02:25.230> had<00:02:25.379> this<00:02:25.500> music<00:02:25.680> video<00:02:26.069> here<00:02:26.370> where<00:02:26.640> we

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
we had this music video here where we

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.059 
we had this music video here where we
can<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.060> these<00:02:27.359> shape<00:02:27.599> layers<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.140> when<00:02:28.980> we

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
can see these shape layers and when we

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.740 
can see these shape layers and when we
add<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.400> into<00:02:29.549> real-life<00:02:29.879> footage<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.540> they

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
add them into real-life footage it they

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.630 
add them into real-life footage it they
look<00:02:30.930> pretty<00:02:31.109> cool<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:32.040> actually<00:02:32.310> made<00:02:32.519> a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
look pretty cool so I actually made a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.690 
look pretty cool so I actually made a
couple<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.939> shape<00:02:33.180> layers<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.750> are<00:02:34.700> inspired

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
couple of shape layers that are inspired

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.039 
couple of shape layers that are inspired
by<00:02:35.849> these<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.359> so<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.569> can<00:02:36.689> use<00:02:36.810> these<00:02:36.930> in

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
by these and so you can use these in

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.229 
by these and so you can use these in
your<00:02:37.170> own<00:02:37.230> music<00:02:37.530> videos<00:02:37.829> we<00:02:38.640> can<00:02:38.760> also<00:02:38.909> see

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
your own music videos we can also see

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.119 
your own music videos we can also see
here<00:02:39.599> in<00:02:39.659> this<00:02:39.780> video<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.739> have<00:02:40.950> these

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
here in this video that we have these

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.250 
here in this video that we have these
cool<00:02:41.400> reflections<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.689> have<00:02:42.870> been<00:02:42.989> added

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
cool reflections that have been added

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.229 
cool reflections that have been added
onto<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.620> car<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.459> we<00:02:44.579> go<00:02:44.760> here<00:02:44.790> back

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
onto the car and so if we go here back

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.520 
onto the car and so if we go here back
into<00:02:45.389> our<00:02:45.510> project<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:45.989> see<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.319> file

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
into our project we can see this file

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.949 
into our project we can see this file
right<00:02:46.560> here<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:47.069> hit<00:02:47.700> command<00:02:47.849> C<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.480> then<00:02:48.900> I'm

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
right here I hit command C and then I'm

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.920 
right here I hit command C and then I'm
going<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.109> paste<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.500> here<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:50.629> I<00:02:51.629> have<00:02:51.810> these

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
going to paste it here and I have these

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.080 
going to paste it here and I have these
reflections<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.010> I'm<00:02:53.489> going<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.639> scale<00:02:53.909> this

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
reflections and I'm going to scale this

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.879 
reflections and I'm going to scale this
up<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:54.989> going<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.139> create<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.379> new<00:02:55.590> shape

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
up so I'm going to create a new shape

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.339 
up so I'm going to create a new shape
layer<00:02:56.099> here<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.909> is<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.209> circle<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:58.169> can

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
layer here that is a circle and I can

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.500 
layer here that is a circle and I can
add<00:02:58.530> these<00:02:58.950> reflections<00:02:59.669> to<00:02:59.819> that<00:02:59.939> circle<00:03:00.269> by

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
add these reflections to that circle by

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.319 
add these reflections to that circle by
taking<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.530> shape<00:03:01.769> layer<00:03:02.209> duplicating<00:03:03.209> it

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
taking the shape layer duplicating it

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.929 
taking the shape layer duplicating it
and<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.959> take<00:03:04.139> my<00:03:04.260> reflections<00:03:04.709> drag<00:03:05.579> them<00:03:05.760> on

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
and I take my reflections drag them on

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.379 
and I take my reflections drag them on
top<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.419> then<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.500> select<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.939> alpha

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
top and then I select this to the alpha

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.140 
top and then I select this to the alpha
mat<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:11.069> now<00:03:11.280> if<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.459> play<00:03:11.639> through<00:03:11.819> here<00:03:12.030> we

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
mat and now if I play through here we

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.240 
mat and now if I play through here we
can<00:03:12.269> see<00:03:12.419> we<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.569> these<00:03:12.959> reflections<00:03:13.919> that

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
can see we have these reflections that

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.210 
can see we have these reflections that
are<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.579> through<00:03:15.379> just<00:03:16.379> like<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.859> that

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
are going through just like in that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.280 
are going through just like in that
original<00:03:17.519> video<00:03:17.849> with<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.449> car<00:03:18.659> window<00:03:19.049> and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
original video with the car window and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.399 
original video with the car window and
then<00:03:20.129> also<00:03:20.340> taken<00:03:21.000> from<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.409> alphabetic

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
then also taken from this alphabetic

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.809 
then also taken from this alphabetic
video<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.859> we've<00:03:22.979> looked<00:03:23.159> at<00:03:23.280> before<00:03:23.400> we

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
video that we've looked at before we

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.509 
video that we've looked at before we
have<00:03:24.090> these<00:03:25.049> different<00:03:25.590> small<00:03:25.979> animations

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
have these different small animations

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.430 
have these different small animations
that<00:03:26.579> are<00:03:26.699> pretty<00:03:26.879> simple<00:03:27.090> but<00:03:27.389> again<00:03:27.510> we<00:03:27.810> can

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
that are pretty simple but again we can

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.469 
that are pretty simple but again we can
go<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.010> see<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.519> find<00:03:29.819> some<00:03:30.120> similar

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
go here and see and find some similar

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.780 
go here and see and find some similar
animations<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.290> simply<00:03:31.769> add<00:03:31.949> them<00:03:32.159> so<00:03:32.639> all

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
animations and simply add them so all

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.059 
animations and simply add them so all
these<00:03:33.060> animations<00:03:33.419> are<00:03:33.690> fairly<00:03:34.079> simple<00:03:34.440> but

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
these animations are fairly simple but

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.309 
these animations are fairly simple but
it's<00:03:35.340> nice<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.760> have<00:03:35.909> them<00:03:36.269> here<00:03:36.750> organized

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
it's nice to have them here organized

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.830 
it's nice to have them here organized
and<00:03:37.769> in<00:03:38.669> a<00:03:38.760> way<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:38.940> can<00:03:39.150> just<00:03:39.269> copy<00:03:39.419> and<00:03:39.599> paste

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
and in a way you can just copy and paste

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.780 
and in a way you can just copy and paste
them<00:03:40.049> into<00:03:40.229> your<00:03:40.319> own<00:03:40.530> projects<00:03:41.099> some<00:03:41.699> of

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
them into your own projects some of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.219 
them into your own projects some of
these<00:03:41.909> I<00:03:42.030> made<00:03:42.180> pretty<00:03:42.329> customizable<00:03:43.019> here<00:03:43.139> so

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
these I made pretty customizable here so

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.599 
these I made pretty customizable here so
I'm<00:03:43.290> going<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.440> paste<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.919> in<00:03:44.099> here<00:03:44.129> we<00:03:44.459> can

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
I'm going to paste this in here we can

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.610 
I'm going to paste this in here we can
see<00:03:44.639> that<00:03:44.940> it's<00:03:45.060> up<00:03:45.209> in<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.389> top<00:03:45.569> left<00:03:45.620> scale

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
see that it's up in the top left scale

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.149 
see that it's up in the top left scale
it<00:03:46.829> up<00:03:48.079> so<00:03:49.079> we<00:03:49.169> have<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.379> simple<00:03:49.680> animation

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
it up so we have the simple animation

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.439 
it up so we have the simple animation
firework<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.269> animation<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.340> I<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.790> easily

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
firework like animation and I can easily

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.039 
firework like animation and I can easily
change<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.169> color<00:03:55.349> here<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:56.359> can<00:03:57.359> change<00:03:57.629> the

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
change the color here I can change the

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.129 
change the color here I can change the
width<00:03:58.349> as<00:03:59.000> well<00:04:00.000> as<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.540> number<00:04:00.930> of

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
width as well as the number of

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.869 
width as well as the number of
repetitions<00:04:01.319> so<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.919> can<00:04:02.129> bring<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.579> down<00:04:02.699> to

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
repetitions so I can bring it down to

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.039 
repetitions so I can bring it down to
any<00:04:03.540> value<00:04:03.930> above<00:04:04.220> zero<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.699> if<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.750> wanted

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
any value above zero so if I wanted

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.439 
any value above zero so if I wanted
three<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.620> could<00:04:08.430> make<00:04:08.609> it<00:04:08.699> three<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.000> get<00:04:09.239> this

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
three I could make it three and get this

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.659 
three I could make it three and get this
this<00:04:09.900> cool<00:04:10.169> animation<00:04:10.650> here<00:04:10.949> or<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.370> could

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
this cool animation here or I could

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.839 
this cool animation here or I could
bring<00:04:11.819> it<00:04:12.000> all<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.120> way<00:04:12.239> up<00:04:12.359> to<00:04:12.720> fifty<00:04:13.349> and<00:04:13.849> get

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
bring it all the way up to fifty and get

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.249 
bring it all the way up to fifty and get
a<00:04:14.879> much<00:04:15.180> different<00:04:15.599> feel<00:04:15.780> here<00:04:16.049> on<00:04:16.139> our

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
a much different feel here on our

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.339 
a much different feel here on our
animations<00:04:16.820> so<00:04:17.820> these<00:04:18.180> are<00:04:18.389> customizable<00:04:19.049> if

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
animations so these are customizable if

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:20.569 
animations so these are customizable if
you<00:04:19.440> want<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.620> learn<00:04:19.739> how<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:19.949> make<00:04:20.400> these

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
you want to learn how to make these

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.490 
you want to learn how to make these
shape<00:04:20.789> layers<00:04:21.000> yourselves<00:04:21.419> then<00:04:22.289> you<00:04:22.380> might

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
shape layers yourselves then you might

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.330 
shape layers yourselves then you might
want<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.650> check<00:04:22.740> out<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.979> shape<00:04:23.159> layer

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
want to check out the shape layer

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.620 
want to check out the shape layer
