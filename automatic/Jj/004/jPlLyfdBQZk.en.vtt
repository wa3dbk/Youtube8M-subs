00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello everyone guys are andros tablet 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.280
 by fifa www.elle.it on the facebook page 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.840
 action and are what you can present to us 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.090
 for this new plays review 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.260
 it is gasoline it came out in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.119
 the first of yesterday's match days and is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.420
 an interesting tooth card on the future 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.220
 by now it will appear on the left 1 87 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 fast from 93 to 80 in the pass 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.529
 80 would pass after them 50 defense 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.099
 two characteristics are the same on food 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.050
 work up except that he has everyone 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.260
 tried on both was so I am also 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.489
 able to make a comparison and we say 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.879
 some are not valid and also mention the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.670
 clip 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.200
 then we say that we see that these 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.270
 two khartoums the same the same because 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.350
 they are very similar but it changes 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 this position 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.000
 then after the flop we then analyze 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.039
 production the first of course we start 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.629
 from top and flop 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.430
 then after this player's flop 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.500
 many on stage 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 the first is speed compared to itself 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.430
 not in shape it looks much improved 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.049
 in this respect, speed goes 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.180
 always or almost 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.760
 in fact, together with the reading 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.590
 binomial is very good where he would see us 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.990
 together an excellent briefing because 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.450
 can escape players either by using the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.650
 four headquarters writes both running yes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.320
 they will be left anyway 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.770
 served shortly benzema has so many options 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.460
 to get away from the opponents then a 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.369
 other top of this player are without 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.409
 doubt its passages are sparse 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.720
 lots of extortion compared to 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.000
 versions do not inform inter 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.729
 I'm fit was an emilio pass 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.710
 ie national crisis this version is 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.790
 wow if this really start point 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.399
 wow 80 steps with 99 steps 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.720
 sometimes even 90 microphones of a wing and of 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.369
 left because even a good foot 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.619
 bolelli brescia to play big 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.890
 excellent but above all if used votes 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.229
 I don't think one was wrong then 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.810
 instead of later we are there and you retire 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.439
 ecomotive and of all types of excellent 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.119
 shooting at very good organization moms 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.200
 exceptional therefore also under this 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.849
 point of view 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.550
 from which point of view it is not 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.890
 obvious then I 'll be blunt I will be 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.190
 fast the cope the exam did not like the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.349
 body and head but only on the future cup that 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.620
 as a left wing on normal 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.110
 the header is not a requirement 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.120
 fundamental in the last of real jacob 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.950
 if the actor the boss proceeds anyway 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.260
 right 2 wait until you always shave 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.940
 you want some problems because yours 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.769
 tracks not in shape is not at all 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.030
 in fact it seemed to me to have improved at times 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.340
 even two shot when it came 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.170
 just to cover the head sometimes not 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.140
 there was why etnei work remedy is a 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.190
 other against really annoying in 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.160
 both motions given asea times 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.480
 even if there was or did not jump or work 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.340
 in other words, the slack didn't go down 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.709
 however the fact remains that as I already have 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.980
 said beacons leaders from left to me 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.349
 really don't care then 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.450
 then let us reflect a little on these 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.849
 steps in which we have already said that 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.950
 I am after, however, the cross to me 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.630
 how he took so much because not me 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.299
 I expected it so good because it crosses 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.010
 left and he now me then 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.560
 I was expecting a mediocre thing but no 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.239
 cross 90 then feels from the left 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.880
 I am a lot because in the center forward 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.280
 work and very often marked percent 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.980
 varese power the right dated me is 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.019
 liked a little less maybe he took a shot 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.200
 of state that is not really good 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.810
 at least so I found myself there then 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.120
 new than when we study inventions 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.480
 therefore these gathered just for this 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.329
 it was useful if i like it so leaving 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.010
 subscribes to the channel we don't have 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.389
 tomorrow with a no fly review because 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.310
 we are starting to really do it 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.310
 really really many
