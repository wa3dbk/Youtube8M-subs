of course these tractors are both made
by<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.020> same<00:02:39.260> company<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.740> made<00:02:39.980> by

2006 is actually got the Electrolux
brand<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.870> because<00:02:51.740> Husqvarna<00:02:52.640> was

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
brand on it because Husqvarna was

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.890 
brand on it because Husqvarna was
actually<00:02:53.620> spun<00:02:54.620> off<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:55.280> Electrolux<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.090> 2006

at<00:02:57.020> some<00:02:57.200> point<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:59.140> but<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.620> thing

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
at some point so but it is the thing

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.170 
at some point so but it is the thing
that<00:03:04.090> holds<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.690> whole<00:03:05.780> story<00:03:06.170> with<00:03:06.440> them<00:03:07.180> how

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
that holds the whole story with them how

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.020 
that holds the whole story with them how
the<00:03:08.960> company<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.040> started<00:03:10.220> out<00:03:10.460> as<00:03:10.640> Roper

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
the company that started out as Roper

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.080 
the company that started out as Roper
that<00:03:11.210> is<00:03:11.390> now<00:03:12.080> Husqvarna<00:03:12.800> is<00:03:12.950> long<00:03:13.430> winding

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
that is now Husqvarna is long winding

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.830 
that is now Husqvarna is long winding
and<00:03:14.650> extremely<00:03:15.650> confusing<00:03:16.250> yeah<00:03:16.760> maybe<00:03:17.690> out

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
and extremely confusing yeah maybe out

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.980 
and extremely confusing yeah maybe out
maybe<00:03:18.020> I'll<00:03:18.290> get<00:03:19.070> into<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.310> someday<00:03:19.730> but

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
maybe I'll get into that someday but

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.510 
maybe I'll get into that someday but
anyway<00:03:20.990> so<00:03:21.050> let's<00:03:21.770> see<00:03:21.860> what<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.070> differences

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
anyway so let's see what the differences

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.870 
anyway so let's see what the differences
are<00:03:22.670> with<00:03:22.880> these<00:03:23.030> two<00:03:23.330> on<00:03:24.550> this<00:03:25.550> doesn't<00:03:25.790> have

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
are with these two on this doesn't have

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.110 
are with these two on this doesn't have
cruise<00:03:26.090> control<00:03:26.120> does<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:27.610> don't<00:03:28.610> believe<00:03:28.970> it

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
cruise control does it don't believe it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.210 
cruise control does it don't believe it
no<00:03:29.540> okay<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:29.960> neither<00:03:30.320> does<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.740> so<00:03:31.100> that

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
no okay so neither does that so that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.460 
no okay so neither does that so that
both<00:03:31.340> pedal<00:03:31.670> drive<00:03:31.850> hydros<00:03:32.420> they<00:03:33.110> both<00:03:33.290> have

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
both pedal drive hydros they both have

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.080 
both pedal drive hydros they both have
the<00:03:33.560> same<00:03:33.590> rear<00:03:33.980> fender<00:03:34.340> pan<00:03:34.550> they<00:03:34.730> both<00:03:34.880> have

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
the same rear fender pan they both have

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.490 
the same rear fender pan they both have
the<00:03:35.240> same<00:03:35.270> deck<00:03:36.260> height<00:03:36.530> adjust<00:03:38.380> that<00:03:39.380> one

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
the same deck height adjust that one

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.950 
the same deck height adjust that one
actually<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.980> has<00:03:40.070> a<00:03:40.100> nicer<00:03:40.430> seat<00:03:40.730> does<00:03:41.180> that's

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
actually it has a nicer seat does that's

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.840 
actually it has a nicer seat does that's
funny<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.260> thought<00:03:42.350> that<00:03:42.710> the<00:03:43.190> pole<00:03:43.430> ons<00:03:43.640> were

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
funny I thought that the pole ons were

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.070 
funny I thought that the pole ons were
usually<00:03:44.000> because<00:03:44.330> this<00:03:44.450> isn't<00:03:44.690> even<00:03:44.750> a<00:03:44.870> pole

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
usually because this isn't even a pole

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.140 
usually because this isn't even a pole
on<00:03:45.110> pro<00:03:45.620> because<00:03:46.310> there's<00:03:46.490> pole<00:03:46.670> on<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.000> pull

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
on pro because there's pole on and pull

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.710 
on pro because there's pole on and pull
on<00:03:47.300> Pro<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:48.520> but<00:03:49.520> neither<00:03:49.730> neither<00:03:50.300> those

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
on Pro and but neither neither those

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.630 
on Pro and but neither neither those
brands<00:03:51.200> usually<00:03:51.560> have<00:03:51.710> anything<00:03:52.340> like<00:03:52.520> the

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
brands usually have anything like the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.970 
brands usually have anything like the
crashing<00:03:53.060> says<00:03:53.240> now<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:54.110> this<00:03:54.410> pole<00:03:54.650> on<00:03:54.800> is<00:03:54.950> a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
crashing says now that this pole on is a

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.590 
crashing says now that this pole on is a
nice<00:03:55.190> steering<00:03:55.580> wheel<00:03:55.910> this<00:03:56.120> thing<00:03:56.300> has<00:03:56.480> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
nice steering wheel this thing has the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.930 
nice steering wheel this thing has the
old<00:03:56.720> crap<00:03:57.230> steering<00:03:57.770> wheel<00:03:57.950> at<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.490> same<00:03:58.700> pump

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
old crap steering wheel at the same pump

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.110 
old crap steering wheel at the same pump

oh yeah I like that yeah and the hoods

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.320 
oh yeah I like that yeah and the hoods
themselves<00:04:04.460> are<00:04:04.610> different<00:04:04.790> because<00:04:05.090> this

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
themselves are different because this

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.190 
themselves are different because this
one's<00:04:05.540> got<00:04:05.770> metal<00:04:06.770> a<00:04:06.800> lot<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:07.070> here<00:04:08.110> grill<00:04:09.110> is
