this<00:00:21.220> is<00:00:21.370> my<00:00:21.550> review<00:00:21.730> of<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.770> HCM<00:00:23.770> pro<00:00:24.070> series

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
this is my review of the HCM pro series

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.670 
this is my review of the HCM pro series
gundam<00:00:25.720> rx-78<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:28.300> is<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.050> rollout<00:00:29.350> color

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
gundam rx-78 it is the rollout color

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.249 
gundam rx-78 it is the rollout color
version<00:00:30.190> which<00:00:30.430> i'm<00:00:30.789> pretty<00:00:30.850> sure<00:00:31.600> means<00:00:31.900> that

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
version which i'm pretty sure means that

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.279 
version which i'm pretty sure means that
it<00:00:32.439> is<00:00:33.359> supposed<00:00:34.359> to<00:00:34.569> look<00:00:34.690> like<00:00:34.749> it<00:00:35.019> just<00:00:35.199> came

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:35.289 
it is supposed to look like it just came

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:39.719 
it is supposed to look like it just came
out<00:00:35.409> of<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.769> factory<00:00:35.980> it<00:00:36.850> is<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:38.069> it<00:00:39.069> is

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729 
out of the factory it is a it is

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.450 
out of the factory it is a it is
approximately<00:00:40.229> four<00:00:41.229> inches<00:00:41.260> tall<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.190> scale

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
approximately four inches tall the scale

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:51.739 
approximately four inches tall the scale
is<00:00:42.510> 1<00:00:43.589> /<00:00:44.589> 200<00:00:46.859> it<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.879> actually<00:00:49.059> this<00:00:49.600> is

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
is 1 / 200 it is actually this is

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.219 
is 1 / 200 it is actually this is
probably<00:00:52.749> my<00:00:52.899> first<00:00:53.199> review<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.679> a<00:00:54.690> any<00:00:55.690> model

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
probably my first review of a any model

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.500 
probably my first review of a any model
ma<00:00:56.589> this<00:00:56.829> is<00:00:57.069> my<00:00:57.399> first<00:00:57.670> review<00:00:57.819> of<00:00:57.940> any<00:00:58.120> action

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
ma this is my first review of any action

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.289 
ma this is my first review of any action
figure<00:00:58.809> or<00:00:59.339> you<00:01:00.339> could<00:01:00.549> say<00:01:00.729> models<00:01:01.149> or

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
figure or you could say models or

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.189 
figure or you could say models or
anything<00:01:01.629> like<00:01:01.839> that<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.429> gundam<00:01:03.729> series

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199

very<00:02:10.000> hard<00:02:10.330> there<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.890> beam<00:02:12.070> rifle<00:02:12.490> itself<00:02:12.700> is

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
very hard there the beam rifle itself is

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.820 
very hard there the beam rifle itself is
maybe<00:02:13.060> three<00:02:13.360> parts<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:14.460> hand<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:17.230> our<00:02:17.500> four

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
problems are too serious especially if

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.250 
problems are too serious especially if
you're<00:02:57.790> just<00:02:58.000> going<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.210> use<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.080> as<00:02:59.230> a<00:03:00.900> as<00:03:01.900> a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
you're just going to use it as a as a

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.670 
you're just going to use it as a as a
just<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.100> piece<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.430> show<00:03:03.459> off<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:04.000> me<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.300> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
just a piece to show off of me this I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.930 
just a piece to show off of me this I
wouldn't<00:03:05.680> recommend<00:03:06.040> playing<00:03:06.430> with<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.730> very

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
wouldn't recommend playing with it very

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.480 
wouldn't recommend playing with it very
much<00:03:07.120> because<00:03:07.740> some<00:03:08.740> of<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.920> parts<00:03:09.160> are<00:03:09.280> bit

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
much because some of the parts are bit

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.750 
much because some of the parts are bit
fragile<00:03:09.959> like<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.200> hydraulics<00:03:11.800> here<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.220> did

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
fragile like the hydraulics here I did

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.910 
fragile like the hydraulics here I did
have<00:03:12.940> one<00:03:13.209> pop<00:03:13.600> out<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:13.959> me<00:03:14.110> earlier<00:03:14.290> today

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
have one pop out on me earlier today

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.190 
have one pop out on me earlier today
when<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.430> first<00:03:15.640> got<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:20.580> don't<00:03:21.580> recommend

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
when I first got it so I don't recommend

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.960 
when I first got it so I don't recommend
messing<00:03:23.200> with<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:23.440> too<00:03:24.220> much<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.520> might<00:03:24.760> mess

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
messing with it too much you might mess

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.820 
messing with it too much you might mess
it<00:03:25.000> up<00:03:26.430> but<00:03:27.660> all<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:29.080> all<00:03:29.140> it's<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.410> very<00:03:29.650> nice

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
it up but all in all it's a very nice

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.940 
it up but all in all it's a very nice
figure<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.959> for<00:03:31.959> nine<00:03:32.290> hundred<00:03:32.620> yen<00:03:32.739> you

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
figure and for nine hundred yen you

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.990 
figure and for nine hundred yen you
can't<00:03:33.220> go<00:03:33.370> wrong<00:03:38.250> as<00:03:39.250> I'm<00:03:39.430> sure<00:03:39.459> you're<00:03:39.760> all

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
can't go wrong as I'm sure you're all

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.810 
can't go wrong as I'm sure you're all
aware<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:42.480> model<00:03:44.010> rx-78<00:03:45.010> is<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.520> model

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
aware it's the model rx-78 is the model

war<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:51.480> I'm<00:03:52.480> guessing<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.020> is<00:03:53.170> what<00:03:53.320> it

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
war and I'm guessing this is what it

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.140 
war and I'm guessing this is what it
looked<00:03:53.560> like<00:03:53.650> before<00:03:53.739> arm<00:03:54.220> row<00:03:54.430> got<00:03:54.700> it<00:03:54.880> before

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
looked like before arm row got it before

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.360 
looked like before arm row got it before
they<00:03:55.420> painted<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:56.070> it's<00:03:57.070> very<00:03:57.340> nice<00:03:57.520> and

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
they painted it it's very nice and

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.430 
they painted it it's very nice and
although<00:04:00.370> i<00:04:00.400> would<00:04:00.610> prefer<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.290> painted<00:04:02.290> one

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
although i would prefer the painted one

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.590 
although i would prefer the painted one
I<00:04:02.739> think<00:04:03.250> they<00:04:03.340> were<00:04:03.400> out<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.820> stock<00:04:03.910> or<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.480> was

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
I think they were out of stock or it was

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.090 
I think they were out of stock or it was
more<00:04:04.810> expensive<00:04:04.989> at<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.380> time<00:04:06.060> but<00:04:07.890> very<00:04:08.890> nice

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
more expensive at the time but very nice

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.030
