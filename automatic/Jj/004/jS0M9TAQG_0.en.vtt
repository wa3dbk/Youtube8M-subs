00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
at first because they seemed like they

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.820 
at first because they seemed like they
were<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:57.960> far<00:01:58.170> behind<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> way

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
were really far behind but the way

Alliance<00:05:04.130> were<00:05:04.250> clearly<00:05:04.490> under<00:05:04.789> pressure

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
Alliance were clearly under pressure

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.120 
Alliance were clearly under pressure
during<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.449> early<00:05:05.690> stage<00:05:05.900> of<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:06.169> game<00:05:06.289> but

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
during the early stage of the game but

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.850 
during the early stage of the game but
they<00:05:07.849> held<00:05:08.030> strong<00:05:08.330> they<00:05:08.690> only<00:05:08.870> lost<00:05:09.169> what<00:05:09.710> the

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
they held strong they only lost what the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.890 
they held strong they only lost what the
tier<00:05:10.130> 1<00:05:10.160> I<00:05:10.580> think<00:05:10.880> top<00:05:11.090> plane<00:05:11.360> was<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.660> tower

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
tier 1 I think top plane was a tower

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.420 
tier 1 I think top plane was a tower
that<00:05:12.020> they<00:05:12.229> ended<00:05:12.410> up<00:05:12.500> giving<00:05:12.620> up<00:05:12.889> yep<00:05:13.220> and

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
that they ended up giving up yep and

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.159 
that they ended up giving up yep and
then<00:05:13.759> after<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.270> they<00:05:14.570> didn't<00:05:14.810> lose<00:05:14.900> another

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
then after that they didn't lose another

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.110 
then after that they didn't lose another
tower<00:05:15.440> I<00:05:15.710> mean<00:05:16.130> eventually<00:05:16.310> they<00:05:16.789> did<00:05:16.940> but

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
tower I mean eventually they did but

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.850 
tower I mean eventually they did but
during<00:05:17.389> like<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.570> first<00:05:17.810> 20<00:05:18.139> 25<00:05:18.500> minutes<00:05:18.680> of

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
during like the first 20 25 minutes of

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.920 
during like the first 20 25 minutes of
the<00:05:18.919> game<00:05:18.949> it<00:05:19.490> was<00:05:19.639> just<00:05:19.940> we're<00:05:20.599> gonna<00:05:20.720> hold

opportunity arises that we can start

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.290 
opportunity arises that we can start
going<00:05:25.039> in<00:05:25.159> with<00:05:25.340> our<00:05:25.460> profit<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:26.000> our<00:05:26.090> spin
