they're<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.189> energy-efficient<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.240> mean

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
they're more energy-efficient I mean

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.179 
they're more energy-efficient I mean
this<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.689> more<00:02:00.930> energy-efficient<00:02:01.649> than<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> 40

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
this is more energy-efficient than a 40
