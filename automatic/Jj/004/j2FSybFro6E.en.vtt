the phone went to sleep even if you hit

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.490 
the phone went to sleep even if you hit
the<00:04:28.430> lockscreen<00:04:28.760> button<00:04:29.210> in<00:04:29.420> my<00:04:29.960> case<00:04:30.200> that

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
the lockscreen button in my case that

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.230 
the lockscreen button in my case that
did<00:04:30.650> not<00:04:30.770> happen<00:04:30.980> so<00:04:31.280> it's<00:04:31.430> like<00:04:31.550> this<00:04:31.790> option

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
did not happen so it's like this option

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.760 
did not happen so it's like this option
did<00:04:32.420> not<00:04:32.570> work<00:04:32.750> for<00:04:32.930> me<00:04:32.990> at<00:04:33.140> all<00:04:33.290> or<00:04:33.440> maybe<00:04:33.650> I

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
did not work for me at all or maybe I

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.440 
did not work for me at all or maybe I
just<00:04:33.860> need<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.250> understand<00:04:34.730> what<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.000> might<00:04:35.180> do

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
just need to understand what it might do

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.140 
just need to understand what it might do
but<00:04:36.290> in<00:04:36.530> reading<00:04:36.770> it<00:04:37.040> I<00:04:37.220> assume<00:04:37.370> that<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.940> means

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
but in reading it I assume that it means

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.850 
but in reading it I assume that it means
if<00:04:38.420> I<00:04:38.540> hit<00:04:38.780> my<00:04:38.810> lock<00:04:39.170> button<00:04:39.530> when<00:04:39.680> it's

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
if I hit my lock button when it's

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.590 
if I hit my lock button when it's
playing<00:04:40.040> that<00:04:40.220> video<00:04:40.370> it's<00:04:41.030> not<00:04:41.240> gonna<00:04:41.360> stop

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
playing that video it's not gonna stop

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.990 
playing that video it's not gonna stop
the<00:04:41.750> video<00:04:41.890> but<00:04:42.890> regardless<00:04:43.460> if<00:04:43.580> that<00:04:43.730> was<00:04:43.880> on

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
the video but regardless if that was on

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.910 
the video but regardless if that was on
or<00:04:44.120> off<00:04:44.270> hitting<00:04:44.960> that<00:04:45.110> lock<00:04:45.350> button<00:04:45.650> made<00:04:45.800> the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
or off hitting that lock button made the

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.800 
or off hitting that lock button made the
video<00:04:46.190> stop<00:04:46.580> so<00:04:47.060> that's<00:04:47.210> just<00:04:47.390> something<00:04:47.660> to

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
video stop so that's just something to

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.780 
video stop so that's just something to
notate<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.470> then<00:04:48.680> beyond<00:04:49.040> that<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.370> just

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
notate and then beyond that you just

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.760 
notate and then beyond that you just
have<00:04:50.000> options<00:04:50.900> on<00:04:50.990> how<00:04:51.140> to<00:04:51.200> contact<00:04:51.590> a
