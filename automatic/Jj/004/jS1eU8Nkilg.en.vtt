line down the center of the face next

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.650 
line down the center of the face next
we'll<00:01:02.190> draw<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> line<00:01:02.579> across<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.210> middle<00:01:03.239> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
we'll draw a line across the middle of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
we'll draw a line across the middle of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.700 
the egg shape the eyes of a human are at
the<00:01:06.180> halfway<00:01:06.450> point<00:01:06.690> from<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> top<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.649> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the halfway point from the top of the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.290 
the halfway point from the top of the
head<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.280> bottom<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.789> chin<00:01:09.030> we'll

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
head to the bottom of the chin we'll

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.510 
head to the bottom of the chin we'll
sketch<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.810> eyes<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.410> middle<00:01:10.740> line<00:01:10.890> next

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
sketch the eyes on the middle line next

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.730 
sketch the eyes on the middle line next
we'll<00:01:12.030> draw<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.330> line<00:01:12.570> where<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> eyebrows<00:01:13.470> are

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
we'll draw a line where the eyebrows are

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.710 
we'll draw a line where the eyebrows are
and<00:01:13.979> another<00:01:14.549> at<00:01:14.850> where<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> hairline<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and another at where the hairline is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.230 
and another at where the hairline is
then<00:01:16.590> I'll<00:01:16.860> draw<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> tick<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.909> half<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
then I'll draw a tick that is half the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
then I'll draw a tick that is half the
distance<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> bottom<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> chin<00:01:19.979> from

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
distance to the bottom of the chin from

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.310 
distance to the bottom of the chin from
the<00:01:20.369> eyebrows<00:01:20.760> this<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.510> where<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.869> bottom<00:01:22.080> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
the eyebrows this is where the bottom of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.250 
the eyebrows this is where the bottom of
the<00:01:22.470> nose<00:01:22.650> goes<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.909> last<00:01:24.119> line<00:01:24.479> I'll<00:01:24.659> draw<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
the nose goes the last line I'll draw is

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.109 
the nose goes the last line I'll draw is
one-third<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> way<00:01:26.400> between<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.909> nose

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
one-third of the way between the nose

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.539 
one-third of the way between the nose
and<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.600> bottom<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.080> chin<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.400> where

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
and the bottom of the chin this is where

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.910

the<00:01:29.700> mouth<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.119> be<00:01:30.290> look<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> lines<00:01:31.710> I've

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the mouth will be look at the lines I've

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.460 
the mouth will be look at the lines I've
just<00:01:32.159> drawn<00:01:32.430> now<00:01:33.180> sketch<00:01:33.659> them<00:01:33.869> lightly<00:01:34.080> onto
