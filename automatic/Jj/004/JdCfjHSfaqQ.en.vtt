one of my favorite things is actually

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.919 
one of my favorite things is actually
the<00:01:52.189> harsh<00:01:52.520> mellow<00:01:52.819> is<00:01:53.029> dampening<00:01:53.479> system

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
the harsh mellow is dampening system

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.980 
the harsh mellow is dampening system
that's<00:01:54.439> underneath<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:55.399> insert<00:01:55.789> pack<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:56.389> you

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
that's underneath the insert pack so you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.449 
that's underneath the insert pack so you
can<00:01:57.109> kind<00:01:57.289> of<00:01:57.319> see<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:57.679> in<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.919> glare<00:01:58.189> of<00:01:58.219> the

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
can kind of see it in the glare of the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.069 
can kind of see it in the glare of the
lighting<00:01:58.819> there's<00:01:59.239> actually<00:01:59.599> six<00:01:59.959> different

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
lighting there's actually six different

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.129 
lighting there's actually six different
pods<00:02:00.739> under<00:02:01.310> each<00:02:01.819> foot<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.810> kind<00:02:03.079> of

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:03.139 
pods under each foot that kind of

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.830 
pods under each foot that kind of
absorbed<00:02:03.679> impact<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.759> uh<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.539> gonna<00:02:05.689> get

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
absorbed impact it's uh it's gonna get

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.870 
absorbed impact it's uh it's gonna get
gel<00:02:06.139> like<00:02:06.349> material<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:06.889> Katie<00:02:07.489> puts<00:02:07.789> in

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
of course now that WH three cores

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.940 
of course now that WH three cores

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
fiberglass now there's another additive

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.560 
fiberglass now there's another additive
to<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.920> deck<00:02:37.190> it's<00:02:37.460> go<00:02:37.610> out<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.790> carbon<00:02:38.120> web

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
to the deck it's go out the carbon web

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.780 
to the deck it's go out the carbon web
one<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:40.010> kind<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:40.370> like<00:02:40.490> carbon

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
one it's kind of just like carbon

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.700 
one it's kind of just like carbon
stringers<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.870> nose<00:02:42.050> of<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.320> tail<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
stringers on the nose of the tail that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.140 
stringers on the nose of the tail that
gives<00:02:42.920> up<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.310> nose<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.670> tail<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.850> little<00:02:43.940> bit

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
gives up the nose to tail a little bit

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.610 
gives up the nose to tail a little bit
more<00:02:44.360> strength<00:02:44.690> or<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.900> little<00:02:45.050> bit<00:02:45.140> more<00:02:45.290> boost

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
more strength or a little bit more boost

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.610 
more strength or a little bit more boost
and<00:02:46.550> up<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.180> board's<00:02:47.510> gonna<00:02:47.600> have<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> 2,000

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
and up the board's gonna have a 2,000

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.280 
and up the board's gonna have a 2,000
sintered<00:02:49.070> base<00:02:49.190> or<00:02:50.000> Scooby<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> 4000<00:02:51.140> sintered

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
sintered base or Scooby a 4000 sintered

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.170 
sintered base or Scooby a 4000 sintered
base<00:02:51.470> that's<00:02:51.860> gonna<00:02:51.980> absorb<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.400> lot<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.580> Wax<00:02:52.790> of

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
base that's gonna absorb a lot of Wax of

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.120 
base that's gonna absorb a lot of Wax of
course<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.020> this<00:02:54.200> thing<00:02:54.380> definitely<00:02:54.650> pops

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
course so this thing definitely pops

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.310 
course so this thing definitely pops
pretty<00:02:55.520> loud<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.270> die<00:02:56.600> cut<00:02:56.840> base<00:02:57.050> and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
pretty loud it's a die cut base and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.480 
pretty loud it's a die cut base and
there's<00:02:57.770> a<00:02:57.830> one-degree

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
there's a one-degree

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.890 
there's a one-degree
base<00:02:59.180> bevel<00:03:00.010> now<00:03:01.010> overall<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.030> really<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
base bevel now overall I really like the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.680 
base bevel now overall I really like the
board<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:04.070> like<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.460> hybrid<00:03:04.670> tech<00:03:05.060> profile

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
board and I like the hybrid tech profile

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.050 
board and I like the hybrid tech profile
of<00:03:05.810> shaping<00:03:06.670> there's<00:03:07.670> gonna<00:03:07.910> be<00:03:08.030> a

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
of shaping there's gonna be a

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.240 
of shaping there's gonna be a
traditional<00:03:08.270> sidewall<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.260> then<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:10.040> nose

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
traditional sidewall and then the nose

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.860 
traditional sidewall and then the nose
of<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.490> tail<00:03:10.700> are<00:03:10.940> actually<00:03:11.300> gonna<00:03:11.420> have<00:03:11.660> a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
of the tail are actually gonna have a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.200 
of the tail are actually gonna have a
cap<00:03:12.350> construction<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.460> reduces<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.090> amount

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
cap construction and reduces the amount

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.970 
cap construction and reduces the amount
of<00:03:14.360> weight<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.780> deck<00:03:14.960> will<00:03:15.140> have<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.650> if

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
of weight that the deck will have so if

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.770
