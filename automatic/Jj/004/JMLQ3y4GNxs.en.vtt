is<00:00:50.860> a<00:00:50.890> fatty<00:00:51.400> animal<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.449> we<00:00:53.199> knew<00:00:53.500> at<00:00:53.680> that

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
time that high fat intake was associated

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.820 
time that high fat intake was associated
to<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.519> high<00:00:57.699> risk<00:00:57.970> of<00:00:58.180> Cornette<00:00:58.690> how<00:00:59.199> come<00:00:59.530> that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
to a high risk of Cornette how come that

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.060 
to a high risk of Cornette how come that
our<00:01:00.040> co-citizens<00:01:00.729> the<00:01:01.330> Eskimos<00:01:01.750> in<00:01:02.260> which<00:01:02.530> had

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
our co-citizens the Eskimos in which had

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.649 
our co-citizens the Eskimos in which had
a<00:01:03.100> high<00:01:03.250> fat<00:01:03.519> fat<00:01:03.879> diet<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.809> low<00:01:04.960> incidence

a high fat fat diet and a low incidence

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.380 
a high fat fat diet and a low incidence
so<00:01:07.659> we<00:01:08.080> said<00:01:08.470> we<00:01:08.920> will<00:01:09.159> go<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.400> Cree<00:01:09.729> we<00:01:09.940> have<00:01:10.270> to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
so we said we will go to Cree we have to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.560 
so we said we will go to Cree we have to
go<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.570> Greenland<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.530> do<00:01:12.570> examination

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
go to Greenland and and do examination

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.950 
go to Greenland and and do examination
of<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:14.049> blot<00:01:14.320> of<00:01:14.640> Eskimos<00:01:15.640> to<00:01:16.210> see<00:01:16.420> how<00:01:16.600> come

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
of the blot of Eskimos to see how come

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.139 
of the blot of Eskimos to see how come
that<00:01:17.259> they<00:01:17.530> they<00:01:18.159> don't<00:01:18.399> have<00:01:18.549> corners<00:01:18.969> they

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
that they they don't have corners they

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.730 
that they they don't have corners they
they<00:01:19.420> should<00:01:19.479> have<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.869> high<00:01:20.079> cholesterol<00:01:20.560> may

they should have a high cholesterol may

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.649 
they should have a high cholesterol may
be<00:01:20.799> they<00:01:21.070> don't<00:01:21.219> have<00:01:21.490> let's<00:01:21.850> go<00:01:22.060> up<00:01:22.180> there<00:01:22.450> and

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
be they don't have let's go up there and

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.169 
be they don't have let's go up there and
we<00:01:23.140> managed<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.560> come<00:01:23.920> up<00:01:24.100> there<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.729> we

blood we brought back home and we

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.279 
blood we brought back home and we
analyzed<00:01:42.369> it<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:42.789> had<00:01:42.999> it<00:01:43.210> be<00:01:43.479> like<00:01:43.749> a<00:01:43.780> protease

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
analyzed it I had it be like a protease

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.459

and<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.759> was<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.240> we<00:01:49.539> had<00:01:49.659> seen<00:01:49.990> they<00:01:50.229> had

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
and this was that we had seen they had

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.499 
and this was that we had seen they had
lower<00:01:50.740> blood<00:01:51.009> cholesterol<00:01:51.070> but<00:01:51.909> not<00:01:52.149> that

lower blood cholesterol but not that

lower blood cholesterol but not that
much<00:01:52.840> loss<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.469> there<00:01:53.649> must<00:01:54.039> be<00:01:54.310> an<00:01:54.399> extra
