beasts basics lately
I've<00:00:05.549> actually<00:00:05.759> realized<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> large

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
I've actually realized that a large

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.390 
I've actually realized that a large
portion<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.589> community<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
portion of the community of the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.339 
portion of the community of the
Minecraft<00:00:08.820> community<00:00:09.019> even<00:00:10.019> though<00:00:10.290> it

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
Minecraft community even though it

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.169 
Minecraft community even though it
really<00:00:10.650> much<00:00:10.830> enjoys<00:00:11.280> all<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.849> modded

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
really much enjoys all the modded

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.780 
really much enjoys all the modded
content<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.780> Minecraft<00:00:13.259> apparently<00:00:14.219> still<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
content of Minecraft apparently still is

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.570 
content of Minecraft apparently still is
not<00:00:15.150> actually<00:00:15.540> playing<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> based

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
not actually playing for the based

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.580 
not actually playing for the based
simply<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:17.880> most<00:00:18.449> people<00:00:18.779> are<00:00:18.990> being

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
simply because most people are being

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.130 
simply because most people are being
afraid<00:00:20.039> or<00:00:20.520> not<00:00:20.880> framed<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.359> simply<00:00:21.689> put<00:00:21.900> back

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
afraid or not framed but simply put back

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.279 
afraid or not framed but simply put back
by<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> complexity<00:00:23.279> or<00:00:23.670> by<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.630> differences

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
by the complexity or by the differences

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.339 
by the complexity or by the differences
introduced<00:00:26.220> by<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.430> different<00:00:26.760> mods<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
introduced by the different mods and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.689 
introduced by the different mods and
even<00:00:28.349> though<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:28.619> still<00:00:28.680> enjoy<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.250> content

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
even though they still enjoy the content

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.240 
even though they still enjoy the content
they<00:00:29.910> don't<00:00:30.300> play<00:00:30.510> themselves<00:00:31.009> apparently<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
they don't play themselves apparently I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.490 
they don't play themselves apparently I
don't<00:00:32.369> think<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.480> good<00:00:33.630> thing<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.989> think<00:00:34.170> if

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
don't think it's a good thing I think if

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.930 
don't think it's a good thing I think if
you<00:00:34.590> enjoy<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> type<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.460> game<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.670> should

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you enjoy the type of game you should

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
you enjoy the type of game you should
very<00:00:36.210> much<00:00:36.329> play<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.469> why<00:00:37.710> I'm

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
very much play it so this is why I'm

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.940 
very much play it so this is why I'm
making<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.190> new<00:00:38.370> series<00:00:39.410> called<00:00:40.410> feed<00:00:40.739> abyss

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
making this new series called feed abyss

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.340 
making this new series called feed abyss
basis<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> course<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.780> thought<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.200> would

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
basis of course and I thought it would

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
basis of course and I thought it would
be<00:00:43.469> fitting<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.070> episode<00:00:44.550> number<00:00:44.700> zero<00:00:45.180> will

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
be fitting that episode number zero will

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.990 
be fitting that episode number zero will
actually<00:00:45.899> cover<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> launcher<00:00:47.640> itself

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
actually cover about the launcher itself

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.389 
actually cover about the launcher itself
and<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> result<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and as you can see as a result I'm in a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.970 
and as you can see as a result I'm in a
browser<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> actual<00:00:52.050> game<00:00:52.230> so

is<00:02:04.979> extremely<00:02:05.340> useful<00:02:05.579> mainly<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.479> if

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
is extremely useful mainly because if

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.130 
is extremely useful mainly because if
you're<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.290> you're<00:02:07.500> new<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.209> the

you're very if you're new to the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
you're very if you're new to the
the<00:02:10.410> idea<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> modpacks<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:12.240> for<00:02:12.450> example

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the idea of modpacks but for example

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.540 
the idea of modpacks but for example
very<00:02:13.140> much<00:02:13.380> let's<00:02:13.680> say<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:14.160> much<00:02:14.280> like

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
very much let's say you very much like

applied energistics personally elected
but<00:02:16.770> very<00:02:17.010> much<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.060> this

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
but very much because of this

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.570 
but very much because of this
can<00:02:19.110> come<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.470> spreadsheet<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.070> see<00:02:20.280> that

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
can come to the spreadsheet and see that

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.430 
can come to the spreadsheet and see that
for<00:02:20.760> example<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.750> you'd<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.170> play<00:02:22.320> with

you know how to use it the number simply

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.330 
you know how to use it the number simply

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
states which version of the mod it is

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740

that states whether or not the mod is

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.740

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
going to actually take a little bit of a

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.070 
going to actually take a little bit of a
while<00:06:11.190> because<00:06:11.550> it<00:06:11.669> requires<00:06:12.090> to<00:06:12.389> build<00:06:12.659> the

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
while because it requires to build the

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.020 
while because it requires to build the
entire<00:06:13.349> client<00:06:13.770> or<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.159> mods<00:06:14.460> for<00:06:14.789> me<00:06:14.909> it's

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
entire client or the mods for me it's

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.430 
entire client or the mods for me it's
running<00:06:15.240> a<00:06:15.300> little<00:06:15.330> bit<00:06:15.599> faster<00:06:15.930> because<00:06:16.050> I've

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
running a little bit faster because I've

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.290 
running a little bit faster because I've
obviously<00:06:16.680> have<00:06:17.340> launched<00:06:17.729> the<00:06:17.940> client

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
obviously have launched the client

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.450 
obviously have launched the client
beforehand<00:06:18.810> so<00:06:19.500> it's<00:06:19.620> running<00:06:19.770> a<00:06:19.949> lot<00:06:20.070> faster

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 
beforehand so it's running a lot faster

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.279 
beforehand so it's running a lot faster
if<00:06:21.030> you're<00:06:21.419> running<00:06:21.599> it<00:06:21.690> for<00:06:21.780> the<00:06:21.870> first<00:06:22.080> time

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
if you're running it for the first time

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.710 
if you're running it for the first time
again<00:06:22.680> it<00:06:22.740> will<00:06:22.830> be<00:06:23.010> slightly<00:06:23.539> taking<00:06:24.539> some

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
again it will be slightly taking some

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.899 
again it will be slightly taking some
time<00:06:24.960> but<00:06:25.199> as<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:26.190> can<00:06:26.340> see<00:06:26.460> it's<00:06:26.580> finally

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
time but as you can see it's finally

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.089 
time but as you can see it's finally
launched<00:06:27.470> okay<00:06:28.500> that's<00:06:28.830> it

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:29.099 
launched okay that's it

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:31.580 
launched okay that's it
