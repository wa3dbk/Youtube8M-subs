00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:12.650
 Hi, I'm junior 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.230
 but if the skies I 'm doing a series 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.099
 of videos about the concert of central 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.900
 sac 11 52 people brought us even 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.169
 he has spliced â€‹â€‹a thread here 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.470
 and it sure was the short one that peeled 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.480
 a short central show here on the simulator 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.270
 in europe always tests with butterflies 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.769
 along with the pedal has everything counted in the 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:41.870
 stand 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:44.059
 so I'll show you here the league stays 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.070
 these 2 bi that does not work because it's 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:52.219
 connected from the outside here is broken 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:56.329
 connector has no reason whatsoever. 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.870
 no color teacher works and no such 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.870
 it works 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.080
 hence the birth of the central 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.920
 I discovered the lack of a signal that the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:18.470
 eng attack now hold here 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.690
 holding things like the concert of the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.300
 singer tone injetei signal i always 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.300
 I am looking for work five end management 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.020
 of the year 2000 and certainly others are 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.020
 working 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:57.000
 near the center of the closure signal has a 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:00.800
 If I took it now, I'll just repair it. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.800
 central and back to chat 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:16.090
 there the same successful junior the same 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:16.090
 here it is only now that it has been repaired 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.140
 your gender 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.120
 so it remained inert here, right?
