00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.160
 you can find me twitter in fernando 5 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.140
 x 1 I'll leave it for the description 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 to see I come to talk about a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.960
 productivity application you know 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.270
 that here on my channel I like to talk about 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.830
 application clicks sometimes talk about 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.960
 news by hands today is the turn of 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.760
 application the last time advise 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 speaker which is being liked a lot and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.840
 I'm glad I hope it's the same 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.820
 useful or more the application that will talk 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.070
 today it is quite well known it is about one 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.570
 Darlis Vale One DÃ©rlis is an application 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.900
 that you can find free in the app 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.300
 store and that for all those who 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.830
 you have many tasks during the day and 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.350
 you want is to dine and have them all 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.479
 together not to lose and what of what 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.090
 you have to do one then give it to you 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.740
 It also makes it easy one of the things 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 good that you have is like applications 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.729
 as online that you can also use them to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.920
 through your desktop of your monitor 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.270
 your computer which is a point in favor 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.390
 since you do not have to be all day 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.190
 with the mobile device 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.140
 another good thing that you have is that you can 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.030
 Share your to-do lists with others 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.710
 I, for example, have a case 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.780
 practical and I'll teach it to you 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.610
 example if you gave me my lists you see that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.619
 I have about 5 on 1 espresso at home 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.909
 by 5 for 1 and list of programs then 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.040
 I have sharp vodafone and youtube 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.450
 that I also share it with 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.910
 youtube've shared before making 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.119
 some tests with penalized for example 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.040
 the podcast for 5 for 1 is worth this is 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.710
 a shared list that we have now 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.200
 I 'm charged for the pool podcast 5 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.729
 town then he is putting here the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.490
 things we have to do and according to 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.690
 we are completing then we are giving wings 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.830
 for agreement 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.990
 I'm not going to click because if not the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.700
 we go down but let's give the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.140
 aspa and they are getting completed 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.989
 recently the list below 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.150
 agreement also if we want to highlight a 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.300
 task we give him the written one he puts like 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.700
 with a priority not for example this 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.400
 which would be to contact for interview with 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.459
 85% cocoa not these guys so good 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.069
 and let's say we give priority to certain 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.459
 chores 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.689
 I remove the blade in agreement and I already say one 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.239
 of the good things you can share 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.219
 I already tell you the notebook with sayings 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.659
 members with such contacts that 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.629
 want to have for example those of this 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.989
 case this book is public / juanjo and 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.760
 I agree let's go for example to the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.230
 from youtube here right now I do not have 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.659
 nothing because I for example could add 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.960
 an item that I can put in the list 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:56.410
 from youtube make video 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:01.510
 from wander list 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.010
 go go like this has not been done and it gets 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.570
 here I agree to look at the detailed list 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.350
 ok press an item to open the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.300
 detailed view 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.880
 I open for example there will be here and I can 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.080
 even in that element in making video 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.910
 from wander leaks I can put a date 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.700
 limit is ok I can put it over today 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.530
 for example I can put if I want it to be 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.760
 repeat that x days logically in this 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.150
 case no but if for example they were 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.890
 birthday an anniversary or something 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.320
 Well, yes, you could make a repeat 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.470
 annually for example I can not put 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.910
 that reminds me that I have to record 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.460
 before an hour or an hour 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.950
 certain determined forgiveness enters me 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.230
 and stick guardiola 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.269
 remind me for example at two good 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.190
 Well, I can post a notice, it's already 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.290
 two would sound an alarm to me that I have 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.060
 to do that task then I can 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.750
 put a sub task within this task 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.040
 and I can even put notes worth good 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.360
 right now I'm going to put your homework but 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.640
 I can also put my notes 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.790
 ok he had done it and they will stay 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.640
 saved 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.810
 I already say is one thing that is pretty 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.170
 well and that is appreciated to have it all 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.180
 everything is super controlled 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.160
 well let's do for example a 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.050
 ready for you to see how it would be shared 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.050
 that list with a contact for example 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.220
 sand apple fly 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.579
 Manzana 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.320
 friday we accept and here I have the list 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.810
 of the skin friday agree sorry for 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.020
 the tie is worth every time for good wifi 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.440
 and now for example I would add an element 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.740
 and we are going to add the first task 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.520
 meeting for 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.520
 decide 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.289
 sorry I write fatal themes but for 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.889
 determine topics 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.819
 next Friday for example not 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.110
 support here could for example 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.369
 set a deadline 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.550
 come on Thursday today is Tuesday then 

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:55.460
 Wednesday Thursday, February 21 is 21 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.110
 it does not make me doubt I think it's 21 good 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.580
 no matter the 21 February 2013 no 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.349
 I want it to be repeated in this case and 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.119
 I want you to remember me because 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.119
 example wings 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:15.260
 6 o'clock in the evening here it is worth talking about the 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.969
 themes 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:23.039
 to deal with in the next 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.039
 appel friday 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:30.039
 friday to burn I write really good 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.659
 I had done it, I put the tab 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.009
 highlighted if I want to highlight it if 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:36.009
 I had more tasks because I just wanted to 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.869
 highlight it and now I can 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.459
 invite people to read that agenda 

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:43.329
 for example let's invite sergio 

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:46.409
 navas we are going to invite juanjo and we are going to 

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:49.479
 invite I think I do not have Alberto here 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.939
 that is the other good moderator I have to 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.099
 add what I've done and now this 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:56.649
 We could see the three notebooks 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:00.069
 then if horan for example add a 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:01.779
 task or sergio eliminates a task then to 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:03.789
 I will also leave here, it is worth 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.749
 which is pretty good in addition in the 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.049
 moment in which some 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:11.019
 change forgiveness for ties up where 

00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:13.360
 puts uan dÃ©rlis and the alarm that nice 

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:15.610
 that looks like a bell will sound with 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.110
 all notifications of agreement and 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.539
 here they look for example in this 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.300
 case all the notifications I had 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.889
 in the last days 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.139
 then you also have a tray of 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.240
 entry and then also well here you can 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.800
 see all the highlights is to say a 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.110
 list only with the highlights giving 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.090
 priority for example here I have me in 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.789
 my list of programs gives by five 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.560
 one I have highlighted on 24 25 26 27 that 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:40.289
 is what transfers the interview and 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.990
 then down I have the friday paper of the 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.240
 that he just added 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.270
 itself is an application that already tell you 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.890
 you can like it pretty much here you can 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.540
 then for example also customize 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.460
 your profile then put a photo change the 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.140
 name the email llosa tips registres 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.420
 with the email and you can change the 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.160
 password and others I have done is a 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.990
 application that you can find for free 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.700
 in the app store that you might like 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.730
 Pretty if you like to have everything pretty 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.230
 ordered and that has strong points like 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.230
 the possibility of sharing said 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.970
 tasks with your contacts itself I do not have 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.580
 much more than adding guys just for you 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.530
 I advise this application and that you 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.030
 subscribe jce leaves you like that today 

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.590

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.140
 video and behind is doing more for 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:25.660
 commitment that for pleasure because today with 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.660
 what of the application of before the of 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.400

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.590
 street 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.660
 the desire to do everything with 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.060
 attempts and I remembered the mother of 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:39.889
 neighbor said this we see ourselves in a 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.889
 next video and goodbye
