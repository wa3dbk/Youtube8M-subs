00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.139
 hello guys here is you nail art movide 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.970
 this video I will show you this hand 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.360
 beige color with this I say now a little 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.980
 particular on the ring finger with black 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.170
 I used permanent seeds 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.210
 because she uses semipermanent so if 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.860
 the single color a nice on all nails 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.989
 obviously first made permanent styles 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.890
 classic this idea came to me from a 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.989
 boom that is on the net on the effect on 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.149
 this black transparent effect that 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.890
 they are reproducing so many only 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.450
 that in the different gl because in the sites 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.000
 permanently I mixed some 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.680
 sealant with a black little bit 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.180
 black don't be bullshit like me 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.430
 which is not just too much so then I have 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.450
 had to add more sealant to 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.910
 to make this effect 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.560
 clear unscathed if you use the 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.960
 rebuild it mix with 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.720
 builder because it will come a lot 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.520
 transparent stocking effect so there are 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.140
 precisely these two variants for now the 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.640
 reproduced to permanent issues is not 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.920
 having said that I also do the video for 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 as for the gel then ave after 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.729
 having created your own color 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.549
 together we put transparency precisely 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.990
 on the ring finger in one hand and the other 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.609
 make a thin layer 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.619
 put the water to catalyze do the 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.119
 second state need not be 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.300
 covering would have to see 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.980
 this transparent effect 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.700
 on the other nails we give the second one 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.390
 pass of baires this beautiful of 118 of 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.800
 cris 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.180
 you can obviously use that 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.770
 that you have at home but you can 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.390
 absolutely use also the enamels 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.730
 because the concept of mixing the top 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.320
 coat with a black enamel is the same 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.510
 identical we fight from 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.340
 catalyze now what we do we give the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.680
 second pass which as you can see remains 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.840
 always transparent but intensifies 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.850
 this is also slightly black 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.190
 case I call myself catalyze lamp 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.230
 to seal everything and to fix the 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.360
 all 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.460
 now let's take a brush point to zero 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.650
 how are you seeing on purpose for freezes e 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.780
 we start to make the outline we have to 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.720
 do the laterals the slight cuticles the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.420
 tip unfortunately pernier in attention 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.010
 every now and then you will see the camera that 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.750
 it's about my hair because I have it 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.780
 just put in the middle of the boxes with 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.940
 sorry videos but anyway I saw them 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.950
 that you understand what I'm doing 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.840
 I owe you the advice here sees two options 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.120
 or make very thin lines then 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.890
 a very thin profile or you do it 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.900
 a little more often you ask the person 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.300
 because for example she liked the idea 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.820
 to have it more often and above all 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.950
 don't let the smile show completely 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.260
 that is, his fingernail so much that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.720
 in the reconstruction the cover is made first 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
 what less do you cover the whole nail then yes 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 does this effect what you can do too 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.440
 of the passes of very thin lines 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.020
 it's up to you to choose after doing the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.640
 outline the profile put the water from 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.290
 catalyze because the color will be yes 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.480
 expands ruining obviously what 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.459
 do you have to beautify the middle part 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.620
 you have two options or you do it with i 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.360
 black dots or do these 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.920
 doodles that you see are not seen 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.600
 I'm doing in the center 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.760
 of the nail I apologize for 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.260
 this point but it was really 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.970
 the angle of the bible room 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.220
 wrong because I'm trying others 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.989
 angles other points to make people see better 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.730
 the videos to record the best though 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.830
 obviously being say of the tests 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.959
 this small problem can happen 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.360
 as in this, however, we see the same 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.760
 what am i doing i do lightly 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.739
 the relief once done from the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.500
 opposite side three or four points there 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.400
 put the lamp catalyze this is the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.800
 final results 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.540
 so that you like your idea is a 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.890
 big kiss of the next video 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.890
 Hi girls
