00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
and so for this game were looking at how

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.520 
and so for this game were looking at how
the<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.270> interact<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.450> currently<00:01:56.170> there's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the to interact so currently there's

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.690 
the to interact so currently there's
there's<00:01:56.800> two<00:01:56.980> characters<00:01:57.430> here<00:01:57.580> i'm

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
there's two characters here i'm

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.730 
there's two characters here i'm
switching<00:01:58.000> between<00:01:58.090> them<00:01:59.340> and<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:02.140> guy's<00:02:02.410> oh

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
switching between them and this guy's oh

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.340 
switching between them and this guy's oh
no<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.370> just<00:02:03.700> toggle<00:02:04.060> between<00:02:04.270> them<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.260> I've

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
no I just toggle between them so I've

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.910 
no I just toggle between them so I've
now<00:02:05.470> got<00:02:05.620> will<00:02:05.800> selected<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:08.140> gameplay<00:02:08.649> is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
now got will selected so the gameplay is

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.220 
now got will selected so the gameplay is
probably<00:02:09.910> kind<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.119> forty<00:02:10.539> percent<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.140> a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
probably kind of forty percent and a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.949 
probably kind of forty percent and a
point-and-click<00:02:11.770> adventure<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.490> it's<00:02:12.610> about

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
point-and-click adventure and it's about

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.270 
point-and-click adventure and it's about
discovering<00:02:13.959> areas<00:02:14.740> following<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
discovering areas following the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.460 
discovering areas following the
narrative<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.959> forgive<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
narrative I have to forgive the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.440 
narrative I have to forgive the
localisation<00:02:17.890> stirring<00:02:18.520> there<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.950> then<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
localisation stirring there and then the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.720 
localisation stirring there and then the
other<00:02:22.480> half<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.440> heist<00:02:24.010> sneaking<00:02:24.520> game

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
other half is this heist sneaking game

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.990 
other half is this heist sneaking game
so<00:02:25.060> i<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.690> touch<00:02:26.470> these<00:02:26.709> points<00:02:27.100> here<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.550> go

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
so i can touch these points here to go

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.449 
so i can touch these points here to go
into<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.570> a<00:02:28.630> cover<00:02:28.840> point<00:02:29.140> i<00:02:29.560> can<00:02:30.280> move

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
into a to a cover point i can move

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.310 
into a to a cover point i can move
quickly<00:02:30.489> by<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.300> into<00:02:31.420> run<00:02:31.690> mode<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.170> just

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
quickly by going into run mode and just

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.920 
quickly by going into run mode and just
running<00:02:32.560> between<00:02:32.709> blade<00:02:33.070> points<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.720> see

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
running between blade points you can see

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.600 
running between blade points you can see
it<00:02:34.989> as<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.470> guy<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.980> guy's<00:02:36.190> actually<00:02:36.370> quite

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.770 

and<00:04:23.130> how<00:04:23.250> far<00:04:23.490> along<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.850> development<00:04:24.150> are<00:04:24.660> you

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
and how far along in development are you

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.530 
and how far along in development are you
with<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.990> game<00:04:25.610> what<00:04:26.610> pretty<00:04:26.850> far<00:04:27.060> along<00:04:27.150> so

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
with the game what pretty far along so

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.379 
with the game what pretty far along so
with<00:04:27.780> looking<00:04:28.350> at<00:04:28.500> an<00:04:28.620> episodic<00:04:28.980> police<00:04:29.400> so

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389

guards do see your torch light so you've

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.190 
guards do see your torch light so you've
got<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.550> be<00:05:02.639> careful<00:05:02.970> with<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.240> I'm<00:05:03.690> not<00:05:03.960> sure

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
got to be careful with that I'm not sure

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.100 
got to be careful with that I'm not sure
if<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.800> think<00:05:05.280> this<00:05:05.430> so<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.330> know<00:05:06.450> build<00:05:06.870> we've

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
if I think this so you know build we've

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.360 
if I think this so you know build we've
got<00:05:07.290> we<00:05:07.440> can<00:05:07.560> actually<00:05:07.650> move<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:07.950> talk<00:05:08.220> around

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
got we can actually move the talk around

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.760 
got we can actually move the talk around
and<00:05:08.820> that's<00:05:09.240> useful<00:05:09.510> for<00:05:09.900> finding<00:05:10.139> objects

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
and that's useful for finding objects

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.159 
and that's useful for finding objects
that<00:05:11.100> are<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.419> game<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:12.930> need<00:05:13.080> to

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
that are in the game that you need to

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.780 
that are in the game that you need to
illuminate<00:05:13.560> your<00:05:13.620> torch<00:05:13.800> on<00:05:14.010> which<00:05:14.460> there's<00:05:14.700> a

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
illuminate your torch on which there's a

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.820 
illuminate your torch on which there's a
little<00:05:14.970> bit<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.389> pause<00:05:15.870> 11<00:05:16.169> on<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.440> just

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
little bit of a pause 11 on that just

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.180 
little bit of a pause 11 on that just
going<00:05:16.979> to<00:05:17.040> wrap<00:05:17.130> my<00:05:17.280> other<00:05:17.460> guy<00:05:18.919> I'm<00:05:19.919> going

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
going to wrap my other guy I'm going

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.409 
going to wrap my other guy I'm going
we're<00:05:20.460> going<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.639> complete<00:05:20.970> this<00:05:21.090> checkpoint

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
we're going to complete this checkpoint

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.050 
we're going to complete this checkpoint
it

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
it

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:31.220 
it
and<00:05:23.419> get<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.840> next<00:05:24.020> bit<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.200> narrative

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.610
