project<00:00:07.519> today<00:00:08.059> we're<00:00:08.450> learning<00:00:08.599> a<00:00:08.900> flower

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:09.259 
project today we're learning a flower

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.440 
project today we're learning a flower
design<00:00:09.800> these<00:00:10.219> are<00:00:10.400> some<00:00:10.640> of<00:00:10.670> my<00:00:10.790> favorites

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
design these are some of my favorites

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.240 
design these are some of my favorites
because<00:00:11.780> they<00:00:12.290> all<00:00:12.440> start<00:00:12.800> from<00:00:12.950> the<00:00:13.099> center

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
because they all start from the center

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.209 
because they all start from the center
and<00:00:13.580> radiate<00:00:14.389> out<00:00:14.630> and<00:00:15.019> it's<00:00:15.530> a<00:00:15.650> really<00:00:15.889> fun

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
and radiate out and it's a really fun

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.859 
and radiate out and it's a really fun
way<00:00:16.369> to<00:00:16.400> play<00:00:16.939> with<00:00:17.090> lots<00:00:17.390> of<00:00:17.539> different

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
way to play with lots of different

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.409 
way to play with lots of different
textures<00:00:18.260> lots<00:00:18.560> of<00:00:18.739> different<00:00:19.419> designs

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
textures lots of different designs

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.979 
textures lots of different designs
within<00:00:21.169> a<00:00:21.769> small<00:00:22.249> space<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.089> let's<00:00:23.630> get<00:00:23.779> on<00:00:23.839> the

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:23.989 
within a small space so let's get on the

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.720 
within a small space so let's get on the
machine<00:00:24.259> and<00:00:24.439> see<00:00:24.710> how<00:00:24.919> this<00:00:25.099> works<00:00:25.310> on<00:00:25.550> free

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
machine and see how this works on free

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.899 
machine and see how this works on free
motion<00:00:26.230> so<00:00:27.230> here<00:00:27.679> is<00:00:27.829> my<00:00:28.039> quilt<00:00:28.339> sandwich<00:00:28.460> and

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:28.909 
motion so here is my quilt sandwich and

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.659 
motion so here is my quilt sandwich and
I<00:00:28.999> have<00:00:29.269> prepped<00:00:29.630> it<00:00:29.810> just<00:00:30.589> a<00:00:30.679> bit<00:00:30.710> by<00:00:31.130> drawing

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
I have prepped it just a bit by drawing

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.540 
I have prepped it just a bit by drawing
a<00:00:31.819> circle<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.570> I<00:00:32.660> just<00:00:32.899> used<00:00:33.140> my<00:00:33.860> funds<00:00:34.309> and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
a circle and I just used my funds and

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.880 
a circle and I just used my funds and
porter<00:00:34.790> pencil<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.780> draw<00:00:35.810> this<00:00:36.290> and<00:00:36.590> it's<00:00:36.800> just

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
porter pencil to draw this and it's just

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.070 
porter pencil to draw this and it's just
a<00:00:37.190> good<00:00:37.400> idea<00:00:37.480> because<00:00:38.480> what<00:00:38.780> we're<00:00:38.900> going<00:00:38.990> to

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
a good idea because what we're going to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.050 
a good idea because what we're going to
do<00:00:39.260> is<00:00:39.410> we're<00:00:39.590> going<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:39.740> actually<00:00:40.100> stitch<00:00:40.580> a

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
do is we're going to actually stitch a

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.250 
do is we're going to actually stitch a
ring<00:00:41.720> of<00:00:42.020> circles<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.490> circles<00:00:44.210> are<00:00:44.420> all<00:00:44.780> kind

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
ring of circles so circles are all kind

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.600 
ring of circles so circles are all kind
of<00:00:45.320> around<00:00:45.590> in<00:00:45.770> a<00:00:45.890> ring<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.220> you<00:00:46.280> want<00:00:46.490> the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
of around in a ring and you want the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.120 
of around in a ring and you want the
center<00:00:46.880> kind<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.180> open<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:48.290> really<00:00:48.770> is<00:00:49.100> a

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
center kind of open and it really is a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.710 
center kind of open and it really is a
lot<00:00:49.430> easier<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:49.820> stitch<00:00:50.150> this<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.510> kind<00:00:50.600> of

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
lot easier to stitch this and kind of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.720 
lot easier to stitch this and kind of
gauge<00:00:50.930> your<00:00:50.960> space<00:00:51.410> if<00:00:51.650> you<00:00:51.860> have<00:00:52.130> a<00:00:52.430> guideline

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
gauge your space if you have a guideline

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.550 
gauge your space if you have a guideline
if<00:00:53.150> you<00:00:53.270> have<00:00:53.510> that<00:00:53.690> circle<00:00:54.110> already<00:00:54.350> drawn

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
if you have that circle already drawn

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.230 
if you have that circle already drawn
because<00:00:55.100> what<00:00:55.430> we're<00:00:55.550> going<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.730> do<00:00:55.910> is<00:00:56.030> try

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
because what we're going to do is try

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.700 
because what we're going to do is try
and<00:00:56.270> stitch<00:00:56.600> these<00:00:56.810> circles<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:57.410> that<00:00:57.560> that

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
and stitch these circles so that that

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.160 
and stitch these circles so that that
line<00:00:57.980> runs<00:00:58.340> right<00:00:58.460> through<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> center<00:00:59.170> so

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
line runs right through the center so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.960 
line runs right through the center so
once<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.650> have<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:00.920> guideline<00:01:01.370> kind<00:01:01.880> of

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
once you have that guideline kind of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.369 
once you have that guideline kind of
marked<00:01:02.300> out

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
marked out

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
marked out
all<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.610> swing<00:01:05.909> around

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
all you're going to do is swing around

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.240 
all you're going to do is swing around
or<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.380> circles<00:01:09.079> it's<00:01:10.079> okay<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> overlap

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
or your circles it's okay if you overlap

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.039 
or your circles it's okay if you overlap
a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.759> like<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.119> did<00:01:12.360> that's<00:01:12.689> fine

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
a little bit like I just did that's fine

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.069 
a little bit like I just did that's fine
just<00:01:13.350> travel<00:01:13.829> stitch<00:01:14.039> around<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.930> you're

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
just travel stitch around and you're

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.010 
just travel stitch around and you're
aiming<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> try<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.429> line<00:01:18.020> right

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
aiming to try and get that line right

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740 
aiming to try and get that line right
dead<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.250> center<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.270> travel

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
dead in the center and I'm travel

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.740 
dead in the center and I'm travel
stitching<00:01:22.170> doing<00:01:22.560> my<00:01:22.649> travel<00:01:23.009> stitching<00:01:23.340> back

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
stitching doing my travel stitching back

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.779 
stitching doing my travel stitching back
along<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.780> bottom<00:01:25.110> edge<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:26.130> fine<00:01:26.429> it's

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
along the bottom edge that's fine it's

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.190 
along the bottom edge that's fine it's
really<00:01:27.000> however<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> want<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.049> lot<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
really however you want to a lot of

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.139 
really however you want to a lot of
people<00:01:28.319> like<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.649> do<00:01:28.979> figure<00:01:29.250> eights<00:01:29.640> with

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
people like to do figure eights with

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.410 
people like to do figure eights with
circles<00:01:30.569> that's<00:01:31.319> fine<00:01:31.560> too<00:01:31.759> now<00:01:32.759> whatever

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
circles that's fine too now whatever

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
circles that's fine too now whatever
these<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.899> coming<00:01:34.229> together<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.740> want<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
these are coming together you want to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.169 
these are coming together you want to
make<00:01:35.100> sure<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.310> you're<00:01:35.549> forming<00:01:35.970> full

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
make sure that you're forming full

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.300 
make sure that you're forming full
circles<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> want<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.890> kind<00:01:38.069> of<00:01:38.099> make<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
circles so I want to kind of make a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.910 
circles so I want to kind of make a
slightly<00:01:38.670> smaller<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> think

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.649 

there<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.069> go<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.819> felt<00:01:48.209> the<00:01:48.420> space

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
there we go and then felt the space

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.270 
there we go and then felt the space
completely<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> last<00:01:49.709> one

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
completely with the last one

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.570 
completely with the last one
and<00:01:51.850> it's<00:01:52.060> okay<00:01:52.420> these<00:01:52.720> don't<00:01:53.020> end<00:01:53.260> up

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
and it's okay these don't end up

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.340 
and it's okay these don't end up
absolutely<00:01:54.580> perfect<00:01:55.060> that's<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.510> okay<00:01:55.869> no<00:01:56.170> big

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
absolutely perfect that's a okay no big

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.370 
absolutely perfect that's a okay no big
deal<00:01:56.790> now<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:57.820> mean<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.119> stitch<00:01:58.420> inside<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.229> this

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
deal now I mean a stitch inside of this

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.320 
deal now I mean a stitch inside of this
shape<00:01:59.710> we've<00:02:00.040> got<00:02:00.220> this<00:02:00.310> kind<00:02:00.549> of<00:02:00.640> fun<00:02:00.880> star

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
shape we've got this kind of fun star

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.640 
shape we've got this kind of fun star
shape<00:02:01.600> right<00:02:01.810> here<00:02:01.840> in<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.200> center<00:02:02.380> and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
shape right here in the center and

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.380 
shape right here in the center and
there's<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.670> lot<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:03.850> different<00:02:03.940> things<00:02:04.180> that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
there's a lot of different things that

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.300 
there's a lot of different things that
you<00:02:04.450> could<00:02:04.659> do<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.020> could<00:02:05.200> stitch<00:02:05.470> straight

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
you could do you could stitch straight

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.940 
you could do you could stitch straight
lines<00:02:06.549> across<00:02:06.940> you<00:02:07.810> could<00:02:07.990> go<00:02:08.200> inside<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.800> do

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
lines across you could go inside and do

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.910 
lines across you could go inside and do
kind<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.280> an<00:02:09.369> echo<00:02:09.729> spiral<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:11.350> think<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.770> like

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
kind of an echo spiral I think I like

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.440 
kind of an echo spiral I think I like
the<00:02:12.069> idea<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.459> doing<00:02:12.850> some<00:02:13.150> straight<00:02:13.420> lines

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the idea of doing some straight lines

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.300 
the idea of doing some straight lines
because<00:02:14.080> there's<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> lot<00:02:14.319> only<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.620> lot<00:02:14.950> of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
because there's a lot only a lot of

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.240 
because there's a lot only a lot of
curves<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.270> this<00:02:17.020> design<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:17.920> straight

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
curves and this design I think straight

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.740 
curves and this design I think straight
lines<00:02:18.459> are<00:02:18.670> going<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.850> make<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.150> look<00:02:19.270> really

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
lines are going to make it look really

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.710 
lines are going to make it look really
nice<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:21.280> I'm<00:02:21.370> basically<00:02:21.520> just<00:02:21.850> connecting

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
nice so I'm basically just connecting

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.470 
nice so I'm basically just connecting
all<00:02:23.709> those<00:02:24.040> points<00:02:24.900> where<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.959> circles<00:02:26.620> meet

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
all those points where the circles meet

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.080 
all those points where the circles meet
and<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.510> could<00:02:29.080> even<00:02:29.110> add<00:02:29.500> extra<00:02:30.010> lines<00:02:30.220> you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
and you could even add extra lines you

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.520 
and you could even add extra lines you
could<00:02:31.239> add<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.360> little<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.989> know<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.140> could<00:02:32.440> do

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
could add a little you know you could do

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.740 
could add a little you know you could do
even<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.890> little<00:02:33.459> spider<00:02:33.880> web<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.480> center

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
even a little spider web in the center

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.910 
even a little spider web in the center
that<00:02:34.780> would<00:02:35.019> be<00:02:35.170> kind<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.410> cool<00:02:35.590> kind<00:02:35.860> of

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
that would be kind of cool kind of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.059 
that would be kind of cool kind of
combined<00:02:36.310> both<00:02:36.810> both<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.019> spiral<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.800> the

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
combined both both the spiral and the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.940 
combined both both the spiral and the
straight<00:02:39.400> lines<00:02:39.670> idea<00:02:40.709> actually<00:02:41.709> let's<00:02:41.890> just

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
straight lines idea actually let's just

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.620 
straight lines idea actually let's just
see<00:02:42.190> how<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.550> would<00:02:42.670> look<00:02:42.730> I'm<00:02:43.269> just<00:02:43.450> adding

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
see how that would look I'm just adding

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.070 
see how that would look I'm just adding
a<00:02:43.840> little<00:02:43.870> bit<00:02:44.140> more<00:02:44.880> lines<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:46.090> full<00:02:46.360> time<00:02:46.569> and

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
a little bit more lines of full time and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.509 
a little bit more lines of full time and
just<00:02:47.380> bouncing<00:02:48.040> around<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:50.769> form<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.250> little

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
just bouncing around to form a little

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.490 
just bouncing around to form a little
mini<00:02:51.910> spider<00:02:52.420> web<00:02:52.750> right<00:02:53.140> there<00:02:53.350> in<00:02:53.470> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
mini spider web right there in the

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.880 
mini spider web right there in the
center<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:54.069> think<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.400> looks<00:02:54.519> really<00:02:55.120> awesome

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
center I think that looks really awesome

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.380 
center I think that looks really awesome
so<00:02:56.890> that's<00:02:57.130> kind<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.549> cool<00:02:57.760> effect<00:02:57.910> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
so that's kind of a cool effect and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.910 
so that's kind of a cool effect and
understand<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.230> could<00:02:59.380> leave<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.709> blank

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
understand you could leave that blank

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.400 
understand you could leave that blank
too<00:03:00.340> there's<00:03:01.329> no<00:03:01.480> rule<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.780> says<00:03:02.019> that<00:03:02.320> you

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
too there's no rule that says that you

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.590 
too there's no rule that says that you
have<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.950> quote<00:03:03.130> anything<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:03.730> there<00:03:03.970> it's

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
have to quote anything in there it's

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.240 
have to quote anything in there it's
just<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.870> nice<00:03:05.019> little<00:03:05.079> detail<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.100> is

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
just a nice little detail and this is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.789 
just a nice little detail and this is
called<00:03:06.549> Earth<00:03:06.850> flower<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:08.110> it's<00:03:08.530> one<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.739> those

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
called Earth flower so it's one of those

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.770 
called Earth flower so it's one of those
things<00:03:08.860> we<00:03:09.130> as<00:03:09.310> many<00:03:09.880> different<00:03:10.030> elements<00:03:10.360> as

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
things we as many different elements as

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.920 
things we as many different elements as
we<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.170> build<00:03:12.070> up<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:13.000> make<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.420> look<00:03:13.660> you

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
we can build up to make this look you

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.750 
we can build up to make this look you
know<00:03:14.019> have<00:03:14.260> kind<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.620> different<00:03:15.340> elements

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
know have kind of different elements

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.140 
know have kind of different elements
from<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.030> earth<00:03:16.150> okay<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.769> now<00:03:18.100> each<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:18.880> these

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
from the earth okay so now each of these

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.759 
from the earth okay so now each of these
circles<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.690> kind<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.079> base<00:03:20.320> for<00:03:20.709> the

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
circles is kind of the base for the

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.130 
circles is kind of the base for the
design<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.430> burning<00:03:22.420> cocoons<00:03:22.750> or<00:03:22.930> flaming

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
design of burning cocoons or flaming

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.930 
design of burning cocoons or flaming
cocoons<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.400> want<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.760> basically

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
cocoons and so I want to basically

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.759 
cocoons and so I want to basically
stitch<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.630> design<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.260> I'm<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.440> kind<00:03:26.709> of

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
stitch that design so I'm a kind of

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.140 
stitch that design so I'm a kind of
wiggle<00:03:27.070> bound

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
wiggle bound

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.390 
wiggle bound
with<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> flame<00:03:28.780> shape

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.670 

come<00:03:32.030> back<00:03:32.209> up<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:32.689> point<00:03:33.110> where<00:03:33.319> the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
come back up to the point where the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.830 
come back up to the point where the
circles<00:03:34.129> come<00:03:34.340> connect<00:03:34.879> and<00:03:35.239> you're<00:03:35.750> just

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
circles come connect and you're just

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.979 
circles come connect and you're just
going<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.079> go<00:03:36.170> all<00:03:36.379> the<00:03:36.620> way<00:03:36.650> around<00:03:36.739> the

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
going to go all the way around the

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.890 
going to go all the way around the
entire<00:03:39.400> flower<00:03:40.400> this<00:03:40.849> way<00:03:41.120> if<00:03:41.420> you<00:03:41.569> want<00:03:41.780> to

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
entire flower this way if you want to

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.500 
entire flower this way if you want to

freeform<00:03:47.140> but<00:03:48.140> you're<00:03:48.319> just<00:03:48.500> branching<00:03:49.069> out<00:03:49.189> a

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
freeform but you're just branching out a

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.520 
freeform but you're just branching out a
blank<00:03:49.760> shape<00:03:50.090> and<00:03:50.390> coming<00:03:50.780> back<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.379> point

blank shape and coming back to the point

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.440 
blank shape and coming back to the point

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
in all that space between the petal

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.440 
in all that space between the petal
shapes<00:05:48.410> but<00:05:49.100> you<00:05:49.250> definitely<00:05:49.460> can<00:05:49.940> if<00:05:50.270> you're

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450

wiggle<00:05:57.500> in<00:05:57.740> there<00:05:57.920> and<00:05:58.130> stipple<00:05:58.670> you<00:05:59.300> can<00:05:59.450> do<00:05:59.540> a

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
wiggle in there and stipple you can do a

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.570 
wiggle in there and stipple you can do a
lot<00:05:59.870> of<00:05:59.930> different<00:06:00.320> things<00:06:00.500> in<00:06:00.680> that<00:06:00.800> space<00:06:01.100> so
