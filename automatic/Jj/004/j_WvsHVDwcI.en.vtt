but<00:00:11.820> sometimes<00:00:12.179> not<00:00:12.389> really<00:00:12.719> thinking<00:00:13.080> about

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
but sometimes not really thinking about

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.560 
but sometimes not really thinking about
what<00:00:13.410> they're<00:00:14.009> getting<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:15.059> today<00:00:15.330> I'm<00:00:15.420> going

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
what they're getting so today I'm going

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
what they're getting so today I'm going
to<00:00:15.660> compare<00:00:16.109> two<00:00:16.410> sandwiches<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.220> look

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
to compare two sandwiches that look

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.340 
to compare two sandwiches that look
fairly<00:00:17.789> similar<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.720> nutritional

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
fairly similar but the nutritional

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.250 
fairly similar but the nutritional
content<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.949> really<00:00:20.369> quite<00:00:20.699> different

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
content is really quite different

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.060 
content is really quite different
basically<00:00:22.260> when<00:00:22.439> you're<00:00:22.590> choosing<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
basically when you're choosing a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.439 
basically when you're choosing a
sandwich<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.640> want<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:24.060> about<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
sandwich you want to think about the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.210 
sandwich you want to think about the
bread<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.260> want<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> think<00:00:25.740> about<00:00:26.010> what

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
bread you want to think about what

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.920 
bread you want to think about what
you're<00:00:26.400> filling<00:00:26.820> your<00:00:26.849> sandwich<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
you're filling your sandwich with the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.349 
you're filling your sandwich with the
types<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.349> meats<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.220> cheese's<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.910> then

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
types of meats and the cheese's and then

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120 
types of meats and the cheese's and then
what<00:00:30.480> other<00:00:30.599> dressings<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.500> toppings<00:00:32.040> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
what other dressings or toppings you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.560 
what other dressings or toppings you
might<00:00:32.369> put<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.610> your<00:00:32.850> sandwich<00:00:33.239> because

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
might put on your sandwich because

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
might put on your sandwich because
that's<00:00:33.840> gonna<00:00:34.050> make<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> big<00:00:34.559> difference<00:00:34.710> as

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that's gonna make a big difference as

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.850 
that's gonna make a big difference as
far<00:00:35.130> as<00:00:35.399> fat<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.120> calories<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> salt<00:00:37.260> so

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
far as fat and calories and salt so

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.440 
far as fat and calories and salt so
let's<00:00:38.070> take<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> closer<00:00:38.760> look

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
