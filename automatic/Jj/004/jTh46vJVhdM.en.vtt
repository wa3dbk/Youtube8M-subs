like<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.340> some<00:00:41.489> play<00:00:41.610> right<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.149> my

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
like it was some play right now in my

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.930 
like it was some play right now in my
opinion<00:00:42.590> he<00:00:43.590> runs<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> those<00:00:44.309> funky<00:00:44.730> with

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
opinion he runs all of those funky with

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
opinion he runs all of those funky with
swarms<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.050> works<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.350> him<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:46.860> most

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
swarms and it works for him but most

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
swarms and it works for him but most
people<00:00:47.520> don't<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.030> he<00:00:48.210> does<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.660> maybe<00:00:49.079> I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
people don't but he does and maybe I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.799 
people don't but he does and maybe I
guess<00:00:49.410> he<00:00:49.860> could<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.730> whatever<00:00:51.090> so

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809

so<00:03:53.210> he's<00:03:53.480> thinking<00:03:53.630> his<00:03:53.930> plays<00:03:54.170> out<00:03:54.410> he<00:03:54.590> thinks

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
so he's thinking his plays out he thinks

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.770 
so he's thinking his plays out he thinks
every<00:03:55.100> turn<00:03:55.310> which<00:03:55.550> is<00:03:56.000> already<00:03:56.210> a<00:03:56.360> sign<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.720> a

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
every turn which is already a sign of a

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.540 
every turn which is already a sign of a
good<00:03:56.870> player<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.110> don't<00:03:57.500> really<00:03:57.650> think<00:03:57.980> much<00:03:58.250> I

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
good player I don't really think much I

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.580 
good player I don't really think much I
kind<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.820> just<00:03:58.940> go<00:03:59.060> extinct<00:03:59.780> if<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.380> makes

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
kind of just go extinct if that makes

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.810 
kind of just go extinct if that makes
sense<00:04:00.710> you<00:04:00.860> can<00:04:00.980> obviously<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:01.460> ought<00:04:01.520> to<00:04:01.610> think

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
sense you can obviously I ought to think

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.010 
sense you can obviously I ought to think
because<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:02.390> wouldn't<00:04:02.630> make<00:04:02.690> sense<00:04:02.750> just

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
because it wouldn't make sense just

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.220 
because it wouldn't make sense just
obviously<00:04:03.560> just<00:04:03.740> blindly<00:04:04.160> pretty<00:04:04.430> cards<00:04:04.730> down

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
obviously just blindly pretty cards down

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.080 
obviously just blindly pretty cards down
and<00:04:06.230> calling<00:04:06.560> it<00:04:06.680> instinct<00:04:07.190> so<00:04:07.760> he's<00:04:07.970> gonna

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
and calling it instinct so he's gonna

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.180 
and calling it instinct so he's gonna
summon<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.630> hush<00:04:08.930> psychic<00:04:09.530> clarity's<00:04:09.950> of<00:04:10.070> the

so I'm attack he's gonna of course have

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.610 
so I'm attack he's gonna of course have
the<00:06:50.540> mirror<00:06:50.750> force<00:06:51.020> because<00:06:51.380> that's<00:06:51.530> what

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
the mirror force because that's what

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.200 
the mirror force because that's what
they<00:06:51.680> always<00:06:51.770> have<00:06:52.010> and<00:06:52.250> then<00:06:52.670> factories<00:06:53.090> in

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
they always have and then factories in

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.630 
they always have and then factories in
resolve<00:06:53.540> it's<00:06:53.780> just<00:06:53.930> good<00:06:54.080> thing<00:06:54.290> and<00:06:54.710> get<00:06:55.550> my

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:55.640 
resolve it's just good thing and get my

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.730 
resolve it's just good thing and get my
red<00:06:55.790> combo<00:06:56.060> pieces<00:06:56.390> going<00:06:56.570> so<00:06:57.410> I<00:06:57.470> must<00:06:57.620> have

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
red combo pieces going so I must have

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.250
