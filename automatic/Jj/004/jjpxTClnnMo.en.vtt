00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 very good 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.280
 I did not have here saved when in the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.889
 resist map and I do not know who I'm with 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.299
 I'm playing that I do not always play with 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.890
 evil in the end even if you have no 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.199
 no model an interesting game 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.740
 then some streak of 20 and I come to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.600
 tell you about the black ops 3 you already know 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.609
 it has been confirmed that he will leave for the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.840
 last edition that will come out for 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.399
 playstation 3 and for xbox 360 this video 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 I could have done it before and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.469
 upload a video saying simply that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.870
 they are going to take out the white 3 for ps3 for 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.879
 teams 360 and you're not but I could 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.559
 hold a little bit to train me a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.020
 little bit more of the things and do then 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.150
 well my opinion that will be the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.050
 following 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.810
 tell you that the company that is going to 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.000
 develop the target the 360 and the 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.950
 PlayStation 3 is not going to be the same as 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.270
 the company that is going to develop it 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.220
 water and on the ps4 it's going to be stars 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.660
 which will develop it in the new 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.730
 generation of the old one here as no 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.610
 I'll buy me know and do not know how 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.810
 call 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.700
 imagine that you called good, because I 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.160
 principle I was very happy because I was 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.230
 to leave the white perez only to 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.640
 the new generation I have my xbox one 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.370
 aside I have my xbox 360 and obviously if 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.920
 they give me to choose a game between 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.900
 xbox 360 obviously I will not play the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.210
 equipment one because it has better hardware 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.340
 so that's how simple then 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.010
 happens does this mean that I want that 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.330
 3 dishes stop going for the 360 and 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.330
 for playstation 3 no 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.590
 I would like you to take it out just for the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.450
 xbox one and playstation 4 because that's how 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.040
 they will further optimize meaning 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.780
 this because good if they take the game in 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.390
 one and they take the town in 360 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.270
 Obviously in one, 300 thousand 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.000
 times better than 360 but not 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.970
 you notice the difference so much the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.619
 game in xbox one will limit a 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.229
 little so they do not notice the changes 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.869
 brutal from one console to another I would 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.940
 I say that this is not going to be so I do not know 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.739
 they are going to limit the changes of a console 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.380
 to another then to practice because I 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.790
 I think that they are going to be limited 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.980
 not good but we'll see 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.270
 does this mean that I do not want it to be 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.459
 that I am not against the emergence of a 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.220
 game for three hundred people at 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.130
 otherwise if you do not have very a team one 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.590
 not a playstation 4 because I'm happy 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.840
 that you can play with the old 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.340
 generation but what happens with these 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.470
 days for example very simple that what 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.950
 you will understand perfectly is so 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.200
 simple as if you have an airing 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.140
 and it puts you to run to a race 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.870
 one is going to run the race so they're going to 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.730
 white burst so 3363 will 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.980
 steal what the console is going to read 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.959
 right that you will go like the eye 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.120
 like the warfare fan club or even 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.160
 worst correct also then I for 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.230
 that same rule of three I prefer not to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.489
 they took it out for 360 and they did not 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.440
 take out for realization 3 and 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.170
 was only for the new 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.590
 generation that pass here comes the hate 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.569
 of many of you to say then it is 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.810
 that I do not have money to buy a 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.269
 playstation 3 is that it is a precision 4 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.700
 a team one is that they are forcing me 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.030
 to buy me a console of the new 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.650
 generation to move the equipment one leads 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.810
 already two years the market has had time 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.540
 enough to save and buy you 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.299
 a new generation person without 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.190
 others I want to buy is because then not 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.069
 knows how to save or you have wanted it but 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.450
 you've had plenty of time and nobody 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.950
 it forces you to buy yourself any game to 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.290
 play was not always that every year 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.569
 taking captive motorcycle there as sick 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.639
 buying the logo with to prove us 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.239
 but nobody forces you to buy the 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:04:01.090
 new call of duty is not me 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:04.090
 understanding but I believe that yes I believe 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.739
 that most if not to fix a 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.590
 game like of chavannes worf in 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.350
 playstation 3360 I would prefer already 16 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.410
 nothing there, it does not matter to me to continue playing 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.829
 with my team one but I would prefer that 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.139
 not bring forth 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.180
 what you do not get in alien games 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.180
 eye but not be limited in the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.560
 development in the new generations 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.599
 say that if I have my team one and of 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.789
 payment to 1,500 euros that will show equipment 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.439
 one to play the games as 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.270
 that now I do not put the game limited 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:37.080
 so that not only so much difference 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.090
 between 360 and xbox one teams changing 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.280
 of all this topic I preferred that they take it out 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.740
 only for the new generation you like 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.569
 that they are going to take out the game in the hey 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.580
 nerey are even though the game goes to 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.900
 be a car because it is not 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.580
 can be well optimized in the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.719
 360 hardware has to the example 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.569
 I've put before with the race 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:05:03.270
 formula 1t of formula 1 I do not want me 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:05.159
 tell me I would like an old 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.100
 generation that does not limit the 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.650
 development d 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.020
 of the new generation is to say that for 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.380
 that you do not notice the difference so much 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.690
 I would like to limit myself to the example 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.550
 and a pretty little rachet is coming to an end 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.700
 quite the jump and taking several 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.400
 several ground weapons my recommendation 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.800
 that if you can save is to buy a 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.270
 team one or a playstation 4 because yes 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:35.300
 you want to play well in white 3 363 is going 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.830
 to fall short finally my name synopsis 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.440
 I hope you liked this video a lot 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.830
 and we'll see you in the next uses up 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.830
 the next
