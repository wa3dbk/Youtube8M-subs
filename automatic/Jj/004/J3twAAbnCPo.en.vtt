00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:10.459
 Hello friends, how are you? 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:12.590
 in this video is a version 2.0 a 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:14.660
 little bit more advanced dress water 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.920
 and easiest in the world that is a video 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.019
 what I did last year and it 's the most 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.970
 popular from my channel so I've believed 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.860
 that it was worth it as he puts it 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.770
 already in another video make a version a 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.289
 little more advanced no more difficult is 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.869
 just as easy but it can serve 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.430
 both for the formal element and for 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.780
 not be from day to day like to leave 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.640
 according to the type of fabric you use and 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.319
 eight other versions of this dress a 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.069
 that I showed you a few weeks ago in my 

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:45.139
 blog that has a layer of bambula and that 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.149
 it's like an almost transparent base and a 

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:48.979
 lining instead in the tutorial that you 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.049
 I'm going to teach now I'm using a 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.479
 single printed fabric to do it yet 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:56.649
 simpler so good I hope that you 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.649
 like let's start 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 I will start by placing the fabric on the 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.690
 mannequin to calculate the amount that 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.159
 I need and also to give you an idea 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.990
 of the flight that the dress will have 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.660
 you can do it on your 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.370
 own body with someone's help 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.590
 [Music] 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.480
 As you can see you are holding the fabric with 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.400
 a pin in the middle in the neck and 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.690
 another two in the waist in this way 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.730
 I will see the address that you have to 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.120
 have the lateral is to say the line that 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:35.319
 will go from the back to the neck 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:35.319
 [Music] 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.600
 the back was a rectangle that 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.399
 It will be a little wider than the waist 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.399
 so that on canvas and we can frown 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.590
 and those are the pieces of our dress 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.480
 super easy a rectangle of 85 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.610
 centimeters wide to which we will give this 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.020
 triangular shape at the top and 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.610
 a smaller rectangle for the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.510
 back that will have the width of our 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.950
 waist x 15 these measurements are identical 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.409
 for a one size but you can 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.599
 adapt it according to the flight you want 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.459
 now we will finish off all the edges of the 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.200
 neck area we can swim the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.910
 back or I'll do 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.269
 they ticked and then make a 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.269
 hem 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:35.469
 [Music] 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.599
 in the part of the neck we will give a double 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.069
 turn around and cook more to create a channel 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.510
 where will we pass the loop to 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.900
 face our dress and close the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.900
 neck 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.260
 We bend well with the help of the iron and 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.260
 if necessary and consumption 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.200
 in the back we will do the same 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.990
 we will create a channel but this time for 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.140
 pass a rubber 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.300
 [Music] 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.290
 with the help of a safety pin we will pass the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.290
 rubber is trump and others 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:25.829
 [Music] 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.470
 plus 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.470
 ah 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.830
 [Music] 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.400
 and we will close the rubber very hard with the 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.400
 sewing machine 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.000
 [Music] 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.130
 we calculate the width of the back by 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.480
 Last in the fabric we closed the other side 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.680
 and we almost have our dress ready 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.250
 [Music] 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:35.850
 we just have to sew the sides 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:35.850
 [Music] 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.180
 finally we will make a link with the 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.900
 same fabric of the dress and we will pass it 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.900
 By the neck 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.459
 [Music] 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.510
 Y 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.990
 Y 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.169
 ah 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.950
 ah 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.539
 ah 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.539
 to 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.450
 an option could be to create 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.100
 cross braces on the back I've 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.120
 decided to close the neck with a bow and 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.120
 leave your back free 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.530
 ah 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.020
 You can also add some kind of 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.020
 belt 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:58.560
 [Music] 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.510
