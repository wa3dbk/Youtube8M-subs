00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.779
 today 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.070
 Cremer becomes Kewell 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.769
 back in time 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.199
 we need an admired you here 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.720
 a few onions 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.750
 a long green pepper 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.660
 there is usually here 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.370
 and ground beef out of the 1 as well spices continues as cayenne pepper 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.110
 and some salt 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.450
 first users complained for the filling 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.720
 first I will be seeing 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.080
 Music sounds best with us, that is easiest 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.650
 then the Greens waited in the crucial points 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.150
 and chop parsley on small 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
 Deggingen the onion 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.150
 t 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 4 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.940
 4 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.170
 parsley 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.590
 and the minced chopped peppers 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.590
 at market value 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.150
 we have to salt it all up 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.070
 the trend stronger 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.070
 And yet, Pfeiffer says 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.070
 where it spice something careful tendency is burned Manfred 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.560
 then it would all have started 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 After that, the bus came to be violent 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.060
 because that's how it's better mixed up 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.910
 the better the best recipe 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.100
 the more it takes the taste 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.710
 If you stick to your fingers you can add a little bit of water 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.399
 you can relax a little 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.009
 Heitz according to taste 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.009
 in between, just try a little bit 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.589
 there is still some time left 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.589
 and everything through 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.409
 that's the minced meat for the stuffing 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.479
 02 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.429
 lump sugar 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:37.349
 t 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.349
 a little bit lower 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:46.269
 a little more light about 125 milliliters believe something in the water 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.800
 it does not state the help in one point 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
 with the temporary ones 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:53.809
 t 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.809
 we look at it in lukewarm water 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.969
 I am very explosive 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.799
 so that I dissolve everything well and no more Kuklinski happens 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 Add Hemidi milk 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.149
 on 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.149
 4 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.649
 to give something to Nils 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.860
 if you wait a little nowhere 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.860
 it is easier 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.159
 then we gradually add some water 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.359
 making it a liquid mass again 11 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.359
 and then we can never admit that 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.359
 thus strengthening our time fits 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.219
 4 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.789
 therefore, it should have about the consistency of a ballet 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.789
 that sounds strange indeed 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:59.329
 but if you feel like it 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.219
 one earlobe 11 each 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:04.219
 then you also know how far should be distributed 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.339
 thanks to everything wonderful by riveting 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.400
 as soon as you could take that out of the shell as still 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.910
 Can you continue working on the tabletop? No, that's just true 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.370
 because just keep clicking best always want from the outside to the inside 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.039
 and knead 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.039
 let the schedule of half an hour to those 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.210
 cut off the little pieces of it 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:55.210
 4 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.210
 about so big that they fit in one hand both 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.930
 the shape curve out again 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.930
 and prepare the same is from Rome 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.889
 to brush aside explains why he does something 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.180
 because of a wrong way 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.580
 and give a little Son 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.009
 that melt everything would not make it easy 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.479
 Kievans in the distance stroke so that they are beautiful golden brown 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.200
 during the apprenticeship 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.419
 we take the little ones 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.479
 Have shaped cabbage because of it 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.370
 the way for the first in a little more 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.180
 push the festive menu to the side 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.180
 it is still unclear who is as big as a pizza 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.169
 in between childhood always turn 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.650
 then he will play 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.249
 then we take about 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.219
 it may have a lot 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:55.680
 the filling 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.680
 we are up to half the time rolled out 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:07.099
 4 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.100
 Clamp the inspection and press the edges 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.460
 to "So that nothing runs out you can of course vary the filling like 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.740
 one would like to crisis with these shops 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.900
 or you do not feel like commenting on a second request 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.249
 then suddenly 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:23.589
 we give the PDL 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.520
 in trade 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.220
 which we have shrouded before lids on it and still leave 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.889
 No if in the kindergarten 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.339
 until 13 this with the prepared with the prepared butter 

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:41.619
 so that they seemed to be gold dream in the end 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:45.319
 when they get fat 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:48.539
 they are actually very good, it is best recognized by the color 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.990
 best with a glass of hot Zenit St 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.849
 I can only say that 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:06:59.659
 on your costs
