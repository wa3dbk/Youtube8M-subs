for people to understand today and I

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.090

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
think a lot of us at the time were angry

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.249 
think a lot of us at the time were angry
at<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.909> lack<00:01:16.939> of<00:01:17.270> response<00:01:17.659> of<00:01:18.020> our

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
at the lack of response of our
