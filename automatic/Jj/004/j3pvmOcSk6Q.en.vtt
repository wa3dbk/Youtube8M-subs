G's and they're both connected by a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.580 
G's and they're both connected by a
curved<00:00:14.309> line<00:00:14.340> here<00:00:15.210> okay<00:00:17.060> mm-hmm<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.590> that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
curved line here okay mm-hmm and that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.939 
curved line here okay mm-hmm and that
curved<00:00:19.859> line<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> tie<00:00:21.680> because<00:00:22.680> they're

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
curved line is a tie because they're

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.679 
curved line is a tie because they're
both<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.310> same<00:00:23.340> note<00:00:23.820> they're<00:00:24.000> both<00:00:24.180> G's<00:00:24.480> with

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
both the same note they're both G's with

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.029 
both the same note they're both G's with
the<00:00:24.779> same<00:00:24.990> note<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> very<00:00:25.800> next

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the same note and it's the very next

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.720 
the same note and it's the very next
note<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.910> has<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.359> do<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.660> how<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.900> count<00:00:28.349> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
to continue to hold that G down you're

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.310 
to continue to hold that G down you're
not<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.059> play<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.420> again<00:00:42.170> but<00:00:43.170> you're

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
you keep counting it for the time with

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.680 
you keep counting it for the time with
that<00:00:54.930> note<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> tie<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.690> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
that note that's what a tie it is and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.000 
that note that's what a tie it is and
you'll<00:00:58.050> always<00:00:58.199> see<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> curved<00:00:58.980> line

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you'll always see a curved line

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.180 
you'll always see a curved line
connecting<00:00:59.820> those<00:00:59.969> notes<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.710> can<00:01:01.710> also<00:01:01.859> see

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
connecting those notes you can also see

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.390 
connecting those notes you can also see
it<00:01:02.280> down<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:04.229> left<00:01:04.439> hand<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.250> have

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it down here on the left hand you have

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000 
it down here on the left hand you have
all<00:01:05.640> three<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:06.090> notes<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.570> tied<00:01:07.010> see

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
all three of these notes are tied see

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.550 
all three of these notes are tied see
the<00:01:08.220> e<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.520> G<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:08.939> according<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the e of the G it's according to that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.920 
the e of the G it's according to that
but<00:01:10.830> all<00:01:11.070> three<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:12.080> 2<00:01:13.080> 3<00:01:13.830> 4<00:01:14.549> 1<00:01:15.330> 2<00:01:15.710> 3<00:01:16.710> 4

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
but all three of them are 2 3 4 1 2 3 4

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
but all three of them are 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
so<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> keep<00:01:19.259> holding<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.400> nope

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
so you keep holding it down but nope

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.630 
so you keep holding it down but nope
don't<00:01:21.450> play<00:01:21.689> again<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.590> keep<00:01:22.830> counting<00:01:23.460> is

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
don't play again but keep counting is

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.030 
don't play again but keep counting is
the<00:01:23.880> idea<00:01:24.560> all<00:01:25.560> right

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the idea all right

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.679 
the idea all right
and<00:01:27.829> there<00:01:28.829> should<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> tie<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.150> mark

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and there should be a tie here so mark

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.100 
and there should be a tie here so mark
this<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.500> PDF<00:01:32.159> or<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:33.479> printout

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
this in on your PDF or your printout

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.069 
this in on your PDF or your printout
from<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.549> okay<00:01:36.090> those<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:36.540> G's<00:01:36.810> are

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
from there there okay those two G's are

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.120 
from there there okay those two G's are
tied<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.369> should<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.670> tied<00:01:39.770> now<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.829> start<00:01:41.100> with

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
tied it should be tied now we start with

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
tied it should be tied now we start with
a<00:01:41.250> pick<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.579> again<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> 4/4<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.840> our

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
a pick up again we have a 4/4 in our

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.980 
a pick up again we have a 4/4 in our
time<00:01:43.110> signature<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:44.549> top<00:01:44.790> 4<00:01:45.030> tells<00:01:45.299> us<00:01:45.509> four

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
time signature the top 4 tells us four

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.170 
time signature the top 4 tells us four
counts<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> man<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.799> top<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:48.000> bottom

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
counts of the man at the top the bottom

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.880 
counts of the man at the top the bottom
four<00:01:48.570> tells<00:01:48.840> us<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.380> quarter<00:01:49.740> note<00:01:49.860> gets

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
four tells us the quarter note gets

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.440 
four tells us the quarter note gets
account<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:52.280> we<00:01:53.280> start<00:01:53.549> off<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:54.149> counts

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
account so we start off with two counts

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.770 
account so we start off with two counts
of<00:01:54.720> rest<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> two<00:01:56.880> counts<00:01:57.329> where<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.540> don't<00:01:57.659> do

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
of rest so two counts where we don't do

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.709 
of rest so two counts where we don't do
anything<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.560> two<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.090> count<00:02:00.390> three<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
anything one two and on count three and

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.509 
anything one two and on count three and
four<00:02:01.110> will<00:02:01.380> come<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.509> okay
