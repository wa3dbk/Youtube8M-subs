00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
now one of the biggest problems the most

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.590 
now one of the biggest problems the most
common<00:00:16.800> faults<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.279> people<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.449> they're

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
common faults is people when they're

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.029 
common faults is people when they're
working<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:18.930> us<00:00:19.050> they<00:00:19.289> get<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> adhesive<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
working with us they get the adhesive to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.980 
working with us they get the adhesive to
attach<00:00:20.100> together<00:00:20.640> with<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.390> lot<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.630> tapes

the way you fit it you could actually

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.030 
the way you fit it you could actually

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
pull it off start again and you can do

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.260 
pull it off start again and you can do
that<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.280> many<00:00:41.309> times<00:00:41.520> as<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.000> want<00:00:42.180> without

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
same token if you take this tape off

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.920 
same token if you take this tape off
your<00:00:47.399> bike<00:00:47.579> even<00:00:47.820> if<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.149> after<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.600> couple

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
your bike even if you're after a couple

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
your bike even if you're after a couple
of<00:00:49.020> years<00:00:49.350> you'll<00:00:49.950> find<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> adhesive

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
of years you'll find that the adhesive

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.580 
of years you'll find that the adhesive
actually<00:00:51.210> comes<00:00:51.390> off<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> tape<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
actually comes off with the tape you

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
actually comes off with the tape you
don't<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.430> sticky<00:00:53.879> muck<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.480> over

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
don't have all the sticky muck all over

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.000 
don't have all the sticky muck all over
your<00:00:54.870> frame<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.289> take<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.710> hours<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
your frame it can take you hours to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.740 
your frame it can take you hours to
clean<00:00:56.309> off<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> another<00:00:57.690> common<00:00:58.109> problem<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
clean off and another common problem is

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.410 
clean off and another common problem is
if<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.230> fold<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.239> all<00:01:03.239> right

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
if you get a little fold in it all right

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.520 
if you get a little fold in it all right
or<00:01:03.899> kink<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:05.339> than<00:01:05.489> king<00:01:05.790> katar<00:01:06.530> I'm

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
or kink are more than king katar I'm

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.899 
or kink are more than king katar I'm
really<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> give<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> good<00:01:08.520> working

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
really going to give it a good working

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.420 
really going to give it a good working
over<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:11.540> right<00:01:12.540> open<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.530> again

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.770 

now<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.640> probably<00:01:17.850> worse<00:01:18.150> than<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.540> ever

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
now that's probably worse than you ever

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.530 
now that's probably worse than you ever
likely<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.160> you<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.730> that<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.180> your

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
likely to do but if you get that on your

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.110 
likely to do but if you get that on your
tape<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.230> haven't<00:01:22.500> really<00:01:22.740> damaged<00:01:23.160> it<00:01:23.310> all

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
tape you haven't really damaged it all

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.060 
tape you haven't really damaged it all
you<00:01:24.330> need<00:01:24.510> to<00:01:24.660> do<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.260> get<00:01:25.470> yourself<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.890> heat

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you need to do is get yourself a heat

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.540 
you need to do is get yourself a heat
gun

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
gun

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.000 
gun
I<00:01:26.750> suggest<00:01:27.750> always<00:01:28.140> ever<00:01:28.260> heat<00:01:28.500> gun<00:01:28.710> when<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
I suggest always ever heat gun when you

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.760 
I suggest always ever heat gun when you
working<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.880> tape<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.360> apply<00:01:31.260> a<00:01:31.530> bit<00:01:31.710> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
working on this tape and apply a bit of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.429 
working on this tape and apply a bit of
heat<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.160> it

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.889 

and<00:01:39.579> it's<00:01:40.579> back<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:40.880> its<00:01:40.999> original<00:01:41.090> condition

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
and it's back to its original condition

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.469 
and it's back to its original condition
and<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.950> other<00:01:43.069> advantage<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.759> heating<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.270> is

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
and the other advantage of heating it is

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.809 
and the other advantage of heating it is
it<00:01:44.600> does<00:01:44.810> make<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:45.200> very<00:01:45.409> flexible<00:01:46.069> which<00:01:46.670> is

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
it does make it very flexible which is

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.969 
it does make it very flexible which is
great<00:01:47.060> when<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.359> comes<00:01:47.569> to<00:01:47.840> installing<00:01:48.679> it<00:01:48.859> on

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
great when it comes to installing it on

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.510 
great when it comes to installing it on
your<00:01:49.130> bike<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.670> can<00:01:49.850> put<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.149> around<00:01:51.520> welds

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
your bike you can put it around welds

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.239 
your bike you can put it around welds
joints<00:01:53.390> etc<00:01:53.959> the<00:01:54.409> other<00:01:54.530> thing<00:01:54.799> with<00:01:54.920> heating

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
joints etc the other thing with heating

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.639 
joints etc the other thing with heating
it<00:01:55.310> up<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.579> course<00:01:55.819> is<00:01:56.179> that<00:01:56.539> it<00:01:56.689> activates<00:01:57.109> the

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
it up of course is that it activates the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.300 
it up of course is that it activates the
adhesive<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.909> makes<00:01:59.179> it<00:01:59.359> very<00:01:59.719> sticky<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.380> I

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
adhesive it makes it very sticky and I

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.740 
adhesive it makes it very sticky and I
always<00:02:01.640> suggest<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.149> once<00:02:02.450> you've<00:02:02.599> actually

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
always suggest that once you've actually

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.050 
always suggest that once you've actually
put<00:02:03.049> it<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.259> your<00:02:03.439> bike<00:02:03.619> anyway<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:04.579> go<00:02:04.819> over

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
put it on your bike anyway you go over

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.550 
put it on your bike anyway you go over
to<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.299> heat<00:02:05.509> gun<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:05.929> that<00:02:06.140> really

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
to the heat gun and that really

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.680 
to the heat gun and that really
activates<00:02:06.829> that<00:02:07.369> adhesive<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.450> gets<00:02:08.569> it

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
activates that adhesive and gets it

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.860 
activates that adhesive and gets it
sticking<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.140> your<00:02:09.259> bike<00:02:09.709> nicely<00:02:10.870> right

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
sticking to your bike nicely right
