00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
so first for the mousse we have to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.399 
so first for the mousse we have to
combine<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.940> strawberries<00:00:42.539> and<00:00:42.749> sugar<00:00:43.109> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
ingredients are combined and now we will

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980

punny strawberry mixture that we have
blended<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.270> kept<00:01:33.569> so<00:01:34.140> now<00:01:34.289> let's<00:01:34.649> start

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
blended and kept so now let's start

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.160 
blended and kept so now let's start
boiling<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.459> milk<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.330> now<00:01:36.479> first<00:01:36.899> we<00:01:37.049> will

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
boiling the milk so now first we will

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870 
boiling the milk so now first we will
take<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.409> agar-agar<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.459> is<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.700> gorilla

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
take the agar-agar this is a gorilla

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.330 
take the agar-agar this is a gorilla
blended<00:01:39.450> into<00:01:39.569> a<00:01:39.689> smooth<00:01:40.020> powder<00:01:40.289> we'll<00:01:41.159> add

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
blended into a smooth powder we'll add

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.589 
blended into a smooth powder we'll add
the<00:01:41.520> milk<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:44.420> 1/4<00:01:45.420> cup<00:01:45.629> of<00:01:45.750> water

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
the milk and 1/4 cup of water

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:50.240 
the milk and 1/4 cup of water
we<00:01:48.599> keep<00:01:48.810> stirring<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.319> continuously<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:50.220> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
we keep stirring it continuously on a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.580 
we keep stirring it continuously on a
medium<00:01:50.729> flame<00:01:50.759> till<00:01:51.599> it<00:01:51.629> gets<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:52.110> boil<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
medium flame till it gets a boil the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.960 
medium flame till it gets a boil the
reason<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.069> have<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.310> keep<00:01:56.459> stirring<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
reason we have to keep stirring it

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.880 
reason we have to keep stirring it
continuously<00:01:57.239> is<00:01:57.840> because<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.500> may<00:01:58.619> start

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
continuously is because it may start

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.339 
continuously is because it may start
forming<00:01:59.340> lumps<00:01:59.849> so<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.300> do<00:02:00.390> not<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.929> and

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:01.349 
forming lumps so we do not want that and

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.440 
forming lumps so we do not want that and
that's<00:02:01.979> why<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.519> have<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> keep<00:02:02.910> stirring<00:02:03.179> it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that's why you have to keep stirring it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.990 
that's why you have to keep stirring it
continuously<00:02:03.599> you<00:02:04.379> can<00:02:05.190> see<00:02:05.429> if<00:02:05.849> you're

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
continuously you can see if you're

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.759 
continuously you can see if you're
getting<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.330> boil<00:02:06.569> now<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.319> will<00:02:07.470> switch<00:02:07.619> off

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:07.769 
getting a boil now we will switch off

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:12.770 
getting a boil now we will switch off
the<00:02:07.950> gas<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.550> strain<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:12.330> reason<00:02:12.629> we're

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the gas and strain it the reason we're

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.600 
the gas and strain it the reason we're
straining<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.470> get<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> lump<00:02:14.340> free

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
straining it is to get a lump free

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.539 
straining it is to get a lump free
mixture

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.190 

once<00:02:20.549> it's<00:02:20.790> strange<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.390> put<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.689> a<00:02:21.719> bed<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.079> ice

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
once it's strange we put on a bed of ice

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.410 
once it's strange we put on a bed of ice
cubes<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.769> keep<00:02:23.099> whisking<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.640> continuously

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
cubes and keep whisking it continuously

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.599 
cubes and keep whisking it continuously
till<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.469> cools<00:02:25.709> which<00:02:26.310> will<00:02:26.489> take

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
till it cools which will take

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.550 
till it cools which will take
approximately<00:02:26.909> 8<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.540> 10<00:02:27.930> minutes<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:31.230> reason

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
approximately 8 to 10 minutes the reason

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.319 
approximately 8 to 10 minutes the reason
for<00:02:31.680> whisking<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.159> continuously<00:02:32.909> and<00:02:33.030> putting

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
for whisking it continuously and putting

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.539 
for whisking it continuously and putting
it<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.569> an<00:02:33.689> ice<00:02:33.840> bit<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.799> cool<00:02:35.219> down<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
it on an ice bit is to cool down the

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.849 
it on an ice bit is to cool down the
mixture<00:02:35.780> completely<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.349> do<00:02:37.439> not<00:02:37.560> put<00:02:37.799> it

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
mixture completely if you do not put it

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.440 
mixture completely if you do not put it
on<00:02:37.889> the<00:02:38.040> ice<00:02:38.099> bed<00:02:38.489> early<00:02:38.670> take<00:02:38.849> some<00:02:39.030> time<00:02:39.269> to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
on the ice bed early take some time to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.509 
on the ice bed early take some time to
cool<00:02:39.629> down<00:02:39.659> and<00:02:40.109> the<00:02:40.709> mixture<00:02:41.040> mix<00:02:41.280> are

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
cool down and the mixture mix are

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.729 
cool down and the mixture mix are
getting<00:02:41.849> lumpy<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.200> see<00:02:43.379> it's<00:02:43.530> nice<00:02:43.709> and
