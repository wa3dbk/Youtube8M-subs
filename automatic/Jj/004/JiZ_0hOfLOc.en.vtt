be my first logitech keyboard but i've

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.050 
be my first logitech keyboard but i've
been<00:00:28.740> using<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.070> laptop<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> last<00:00:29.849> few

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
been using a laptop for the last few

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.810 
been using a laptop for the last few
years<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.510> I've<00:00:30.630> been<00:00:30.810> used<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.489> built-in

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820

years so I've been used to the built-in
keyboard<00:00:32.969> there<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.600> think<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.899> will

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the keyboard all the way on the left

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
the keyboard all the way on the left
I've<00:01:40.800> got<00:01:42.229> 18<00:01:43.789> programmable<00:01:44.789> macro<00:01:45.479> keys<00:01:45.720> and

I've got 18 programmable macro keys and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.339 
I've got 18 programmable macro keys and
it<00:01:46.979> looks<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.190> we've<00:01:47.399> got<00:01:47.869> up<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.140> three

00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:49.349 
it looks like we've got up to three

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:52.339 
it looks like we've got up to three
different<00:01:49.759> profiles<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.940> can<00:01:51.119> save<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.629> don't

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
different profiles it can save I don't

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.830 
different profiles it can save I don't
think<00:01:52.410> I'll<00:01:52.649> need<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.250> many<00:01:53.840> standard

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
think I'll need that many standard

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.609 
think I'll need that many standard
keyboard<00:01:56.179> mute<00:01:57.179> button<00:01:57.209> for<00:01:57.599> mic<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
keyboard mute button for mic and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.630 
keyboard mute button for mic and
headphones<00:01:59.160> I<00:02:00.140> think<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.259> slider<00:02:01.649> enables

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
headphones I think this slider enables

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.270 
headphones I think this slider enables
and<00:02:02.849> disables<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.890> Windows<00:02:04.890> key<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.190> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
and disables the Windows key on the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.499 
and disables the Windows key on the
bottom<00:02:05.580> I'm<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.849> totally<00:02:06.420> sure<00:02:06.709> and<00:02:08.450> up<00:02:09.450> here

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
bottom I'm not totally sure and up here

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.759 
bottom I'm not totally sure and up here
we've<00:02:09.899> got<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.619> nice<00:02:11.220> little<00:02:11.400> display<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:12.769> info

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
we've got a nice little display for info

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.000 
we've got a nice little display for info
and<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.400> guess<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.730> can<00:02:14.910> display<00:02:15.120> some<00:02:16.010> pc

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and I guess you can display some pc

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.860 
and I guess you can display some pc
specific<00:02:17.489> info<00:02:17.819> like<00:02:18.060> temperatures<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.690> such

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
specific info like temperatures and such

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.940 
specific info like temperatures and such
you<00:02:19.050> could<00:02:19.230> also<00:02:19.349> do<00:02:19.680> ventrilo<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.950> some

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
you could also do ventrilo and some

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.290 
you could also do ventrilo and some
other<00:02:23.129> add-ons<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.610> guess<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.150> do<00:02:24.269> a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
other add-ons I guess that you can do a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.330 
other add-ons I guess that you can do a
lot<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.569> take<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.720> look<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:24.989> that<00:02:25.140> when<00:02:25.290> i<00:02:25.340> plug

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
lot to take a look at that when i plug

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.869 
lot to take a look at that when i plug
this<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:28.370> think<00:02:29.370> that's<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.700> dedicated

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
this in I think that's a dedicated

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.690 
this in I think that's a dedicated
button<00:02:30.209> for<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.660> backlight<00:02:31.280> media<00:02:32.280> controls

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
button for the backlight media controls

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.809 
button for the backlight media controls
I<00:02:33.060> guess<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> volume<00:02:33.930> slider<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.819> your

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
I guess is a volume slider and your

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.960 
I guess is a volume slider and your
keypad<00:02:36.860> up<00:02:37.860> at<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.069> top<00:02:38.220> we've<00:02:38.430> got<00:02:38.459> Jack's

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
keypad up at the top we've got Jack's

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.820 
keypad up at the top we've got Jack's
for<00:02:39.330> headphone<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.019> mic

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.740

case fans lit up nice there it is in the
front

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:36.290 

I<00:03:27.050> thought<00:03:28.050> I'd<00:03:28.170> get<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:32.960> let's<00:03:33.960> hit<00:03:34.140> Del

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
I thought I'd get it let's hit Del

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.760 
I thought I'd get it let's hit Del
there<00:03:37.300> we<00:03:37.540> go<00:03:38.910> awesome<00:03:40.140> Estelle<00:03:42.510> think<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:43.630> a

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
there we go awesome Estelle think it's a

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.310 
there we go awesome Estelle think it's a
UEFI<00:03:44.770> BIOS<00:03:45.250> no<00:03:46.240> it's<00:03:46.540> just<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.780> bios<00:03:46.960> that<00:03:47.200> you

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
UEFI BIOS no it's just a bios that you

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
UEFI BIOS no it's just a bios that you
can<00:03:47.470> use<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.370> mouse<00:03:48.640> in<00:03:50.190> think<00:03:51.190> we're

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
can use a mouse in think we're

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.200 
can use a mouse in think we're
officially<00:03:51.850> in<00:03:53.310> all<00:03:54.310> right<00:03:54.490> so<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:54.670> reposition

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.210 
officially in all right so I reposition

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.300 
officially in all right so I reposition
the<00:03:55.300> camera<00:03:55.630> on<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.810> tripod<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.470> we<00:03:56.590> can<00:03:56.800> take

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
the camera on the tripod so we can take

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.100 
the camera on the tripod so we can take
a<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:57.580> closer<00:03:57.940> look<00:03:58.240> here<00:03:58.510> one<00:03:58.900> thing<00:03:59.050> I

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
a little closer look here one thing I

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.720 
a little closer look here one thing I
did<00:03:59.290> notice<00:03:59.320> is<00:04:00.540> it's<00:04:01.540> registering<00:04:02.050> that<00:04:02.730> even

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
did notice is it's registering that even

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.010 
did notice is it's registering that even
though<00:04:03.820> i<00:04:03.850> have<00:04:04.000> my<00:04:04.150> 16<00:04:04.510> gig<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:04.750> memory<00:04:04.780> which

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
though i have my 16 gig of memory which

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.280 
though i have my 16 gig of memory which
is<00:04:05.290> what<00:04:05.440> I've<00:04:05.560> got<00:04:05.770> it's<00:04:06.760> saying<00:04:07.000> that<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.210> have

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
is what I've got it's saying that I have

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.090 
is what I've got it's saying that I have
it's<00:04:08.290> rated<00:04:08.590> at<00:04:08.710> ddr3<00:04:09.430> 1600<00:04:10.060> megahertz<00:04:10.980> let<00:04:11.980> me

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
it's rated at ddr3 1600 megahertz let me

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.199 
it's rated at ddr3 1600 megahertz let me
zoom<00:04:12.340> in<00:04:12.550> so<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:12.790> can<00:04:12.910> see<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:17.400> so<00:04:18.400> 1600

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
zoom in so you can see that so 1600

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.789 
zoom in so you can see that so 1600
megahertz<00:04:19.360> now<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.959> memory<00:04:20.230> that<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.410> have<00:04:20.620> is

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
megahertz now the memory that I have is

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:29.150 
megahertz now the memory that I have is
rated<00:04:21.130> at<00:04:22.320> 1866<00:04:24.030> so<00:04:25.030> I'm<00:04:25.150> going<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.360> zoom<00:04:25.450> out

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.700 

let<00:04:30.160> me<00:04:30.250> come<00:04:30.430> over<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:31.360> Advanced<00:04:31.720> Mode<00:04:33.300> this

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
let me come over to Advanced Mode this

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.690 
let me come over to Advanced Mode this
bios<00:04:35.710> being<00:04:36.010> able<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.280> use<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.490> mouse<00:04:36.640> is

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
bios being able to use the mouse is

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.810 
bios being able to use the mouse is
actually<00:04:37.150> really<00:04:37.300> convenient<00:04:37.690> here<00:04:38.820> i'm

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
actually really convenient here i'm

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.460 
actually really convenient here i'm
going<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.090> go<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.240> here<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:43.890> use<00:04:44.890> XMP<00:04:45.780> now<00:04:46.780> XMP

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
going to go to here and use XMP now XMP

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.290 
going to go to here and use XMP now XMP
i<00:04:47.830> guess<00:04:48.790> is<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.150> way<00:04:49.570> for<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:50.470> memory<00:04:51.100> to<00:04:52.030> tell

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
i guess is a way for the memory to tell

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.370 
i guess is a way for the memory to tell
the<00:04:52.510> motherboard<00:04:53.020> exactly<00:04:53.860> what<00:04:54.010> it<00:04:54.100> is<00:04:54.130> and

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
the motherboard exactly what it is and

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.810 
the motherboard exactly what it is and
sure<00:04:56.380> enough<00:04:56.410> when<00:04:56.830> i<00:04:56.860> make<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:57.250> change<00:04:57.520> it

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
sure enough when i make that change it

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.300 
sure enough when i make that change it
does<00:04:58.030> say<00:04:58.270> ddr3<00:04:59.190> 1866<00:05:00.570> with<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.990> 910<00:05:02.530> 928

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
does say ddr3 1866 with a 910 928

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.350 
does say ddr3 1866 with a 910 928
setting<00:05:03.820> at<00:05:04.660> one<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.140> half<00:05:05.169> volts<00:05:06.210> so<00:05:07.210> we're

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
setting at one and a half volts so we're

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.340 
setting at one and a half volts so we're
going<00:05:07.480> to<00:05:07.570> save<00:05:08.380> that<00:05:08.410> we<00:05:08.950> save<00:05:10.410> f10

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
going to save that we save f10

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:20.660 
going to save that we save f10
so<00:05:14.350> we'll<00:05:14.470> save<00:05:14.800> that

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.990 

let's<00:05:21.180> see<00:05:21.420> if<00:05:21.480> it<00:05:21.600> takes<00:05:22.580> okay<00:05:23.580> guys<00:05:23.760> i

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
let's see if it takes okay guys i

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.550 
let's see if it takes okay guys i
rebooted<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:25.700> sure<00:05:26.700> enough<00:05:26.730> our<00:05:27.560> settings

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
rebooted and sure enough our settings

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.240 
rebooted and sure enough our settings
took<00:05:28.950> so<00:05:29.400> i<00:05:29.430> do<00:05:29.550> see<00:05:29.850> 1866<00:05:30.810> which<00:05:31.680> is<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.950> rated

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
took so i do see 1866 which is the rated

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.520 
took so i do see 1866 which is the rated
speed<00:05:32.280> of<00:05:32.610> this<00:05:32.700> memory<00:05:33.060> i<00:05:33.290> think<00:05:34.290> we're<00:05:34.440> all

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
speed of this memory i think we're all

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.520 
speed of this memory i think we're all
set<00:05:34.800> so<00:05:35.340> next<00:05:35.670> move<00:05:36.630> for<00:05:36.660> me<00:05:36.960> is<00:05:37.170> to<00:05:37.200> load

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
set so next move for me is to load

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.320 
set so next move for me is to load
windows<00:05:37.680> 7<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:39.170> start<00:05:40.170> testing<00:05:40.500> this<00:05:40.560> bad<00:05:40.740> boy

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
windows 7 and start testing this bad boy

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.950 
windows 7 and start testing this bad boy
thanks<00:05:42.330> for<00:05:42.450> watching<00:05:42.480> everybody<00:05:42.870> stay<00:05:43.740> tuned
