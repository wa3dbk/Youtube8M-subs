00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 there the river below is very beautiful we are at the bottom 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.420
 Uncle Kuzi is flying 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.740
 I have long wanted to ask the river because 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 my fall fall so it turns out 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 that the river flows and does not end a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.460
 my fill is filled but over the edge 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.510
 rushing good question what 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:33.329
 let's think think of a mountain river 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:38.790
 where did it flow from the glacier 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.460
 and from which the glacier came from snow and snow 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.860
 from where from the sky from the cloud 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.719
 just don't ask me please 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:53.100
 where the snow came from I donâ€™t know 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:58.590
 I'll tell you a cloud of snow and rain 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:04.979
 from the sea from the lake from the river from the surface 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:08.369
 land have never seen rain 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.030
 up one must bag from earth to heaven and not 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.490
 did you have to observe such a picture 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 after the rain the sun burns 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.080
 and from the grass the steam rises had to 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.060
 here's the rain upside down just 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.210
 same water under the sun evaporates with 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.729
 surface of the seas and oceans 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.460
 steam rises high into the sky and there 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.040
 going to clouds and clouds 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.680
 and then the clouds are shed by rain and snow 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.590
 snow falls on the mountain turns into ice 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.079
 the river flows from the glacier then water again 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.619
 evaporates understood so the water and turns 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:56.399
 down up down exactly it is spinning 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.640
 the phenomenon is called the water cycle in 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.299
 nature and because of such a cycle the water 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.990
 in the river and it does not end great to me even 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.770
 with a whirlwind rhyme on the mountain 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.930
 snow fell from the clouds and melted under the sun 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.769
 burning down the slope in not 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.569
 a mountain river flowed past the glacier 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.790
 evaporated into the sea and all over again 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:29.000
 repeated very accurately noted 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.000
 chevostik and between us
