00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.610
 What to do if you can not build computers? 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.320
 Do not know how to select components so that they are 100% suitable 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.320
 to each other. 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.530
 The answer is simple and obvious, but not always worth it. 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.960
 cheap - buy a ready PC. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.850
 But what to say, you have to pay for quality. 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.189
 As we said in the last review, total modifications 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.320
 three. 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.020
 We reviewed the top and in the same place briefly told 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.240
 about the average, and now it's time to talk about the most 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.590
 cheap of them. 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.660
 Simple in name, but not very simple in configuration. 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.420
 The structure includes components built by technology. 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.070
 Military Class, so about the reliability and durability 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 especially not to worry. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.309
 All components of the Brain Top Gamer Z800 (B3570K.ZM1) - were placed 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.219
 in the case of Zalman - Z11. 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.329
 What I like about this body is its aggressiveness. 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.450
 But beyond that there are a number of advantages and disadvantages. 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.979
 What I would like to note separately is that 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.250
 all buttons and connectors are located at the top of the case, 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.210
 the body is tall enough so if you prefer 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.671
 put the case on the table, from the convenience of use 

00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:19.671
 will have to refuse. 

00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:22.810
 What else did not like that place under the phone or 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.420
 winchester in the same top with exceptionally glossy 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.060
 surface, so most likely scratches can not be avoided. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.090
 Pleased with the fact that the case as all gaming sharpened 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.969
 under good cooling and no problems with that. 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.100
 But with a carpet inside the case is likely 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 will be 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.750
 But this is rather the lot of all buildings, than a separate 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.909
 lack of it. 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.479
 The kit is powered by the Zalman ZM500-LE power supply. 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.229
 As the name implies a power of 500 watts. 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.469
 MSI motherboard called MSI Z77A-G43. 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.940
 On its back panel there are 2 USB 3.0 connectors, 6 ports 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.320
 USB 2.0, 6 audio outputs, one PS / 2 for connection 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.360
 mice or keyboards, HDMI, Diviai, Disab, and RJ45 for 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.729
 connect the network cable. 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.070
 The internals are generally standard, 4 connectors for 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.050
 memory settings, 2 for installing video cards, however 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.580
 the distance between them is not very big, not sure 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.950
 what will be convenient if you decide. 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.750
 Intel I5 3570K processor, in principle, the top of the AYpyats family. 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.750
 Optimally. 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.800
 As for the video card, GTX is installed here. 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.590
 660 by MSI. 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.700
 What are they can be seen here 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 (stsylko), we did a review on it. 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.790
 16 gigabytes of RAM from Kingston, with a frequency of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.890
 1600 MHz. 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.580
 Storage System. 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.440
 There is a 1 terabyte hard drive installed. 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.480
 from the Western Digital Caviar Black series. 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.310
 Also included is a figure eight. 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.390
 That is directix 11.1 in the set. 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.950
 The main thing that supported the game. 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.550
 As for noise, in a quiet room, the usual 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.390
 the noise of which does not exceed 10 dB, when playing in the game 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.560
 3 we got 35-40 dB, in a closed package. 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.240
 And now the games. 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.390
 Battlefield 3 Oddly enough in a single player, 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.320
 everything was ... stable at the beginning of the mission at the exit 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.480
 from the FPS machine once dropped to 39 frames per second, 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.990
 at the highest settings. 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.470
 In multiplayer, everything was not so stable. 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.280
 FPS jumped and sometimes dropped to 30 frames per second. 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.040
 To be honest, it is not very comfortable for comfortable 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.020
 I think the game settings will have a little lower. 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.210
 Crysis 3 campaign in the first mission 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.010
 on the ship, when it is still raining, we are enough 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.560
 long played with the settings to find the best 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.830
 configuration. 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.420
 FXAA anti-aliasing and high settings provide 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.080
 30 frames per second. 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.090
 Ultra - inhibits. 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:04:00.360
 As in the case of the BF3 FPS in multiplayer behaved unstably, 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.420
 jumping from 30 to 60 frames / s, although here even with such 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.670
 sagging play more comfortable. 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.220
 Farkai 3 As usual with 4-fold 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.190
 smoothing the game did not want to work, I had to reduce 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.790
 to double. 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.480
 In general at the maximum settings for two times 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.640
 smoothing can be played. 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.451
 CK2: HotS Release took place, in the past 

00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:24.860
 review, we could not test CK2, in this work. 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.580
 In general, because the graphics and physics have improved a little 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.270
 It became interesting how this computer can pull out 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.270
 3 limit dogs. 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.400
 And you know, not very bad. 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.020
 Considering that such clusters of units in normal games 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.110
 just does not happen the computer showed 30 frames / s. 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.430
 For starcraft it is a very playable indicator. 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.210
 Since the assembled computers are mainly 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.050
 for people who want to buy a ready-made PC and not think 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.139
 nothing more, this comp shows great value 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.419
 price / performance and performance, assembly fine, case 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.400
 beautiful and well ventilated, although it promises fouling 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400
 dust. 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.249
 In general, I think the purchase is worth the money. 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.979
 Moreover, all this is also collected on the components 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.000
 high-end and bundled with windows 8, after purchase worry 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:26.690
 there will be nothing.
