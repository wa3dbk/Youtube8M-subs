take you to our virtual traffic pattern
and<00:00:35.820> show<00:00:36.330> you<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.720> exact<00:00:37.110> radio<00:00:37.530> calls<00:00:37.860> I

and show you the exact radio calls I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.610 
and show you the exact radio calls I
would<00:00:38.400> make<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.360> situation<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.290> let's<00:00:40.320> go

ahead and cut to that tape so to help us

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.540 
ahead and cut to that tape so to help us
better<00:00:45.090> understand<00:00:46.050> our<00:00:46.410> uncontrolled<00:00:47.219> radio

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
better understand our uncontrolled radio

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.100 
better understand our uncontrolled radio
communications<00:00:48.239> one<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.840> things

the south of the field and my intentions
I'm<00:01:41.039> going<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> enter<00:01:41.429> a<00:01:41.520> left<00:01:41.849> downwind<00:01:42.390> for

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
I'm going to enter a left downwind for

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.609 
I'm going to enter a left downwind for
runway<00:01:42.630> five<00:01:43.369> Donnellan<00:01:44.369> traffic<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
runway five Donnellan traffic so it's

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.620 
runway five Donnellan traffic so it's
very<00:01:46.950> important<00:01:47.700> again<00:01:47.789> that<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.149> start<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
very important again that you start and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.529 
very important again that you start and
end<00:01:49.020> with<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.950> Donnellan<00:01:50.880> traffic<00:01:51.330> or

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
end with that Donnellan traffic or

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.070 
end with that Donnellan traffic or
wherever<00:01:51.929> you're<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.140> traffic<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.780> everyone

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
wherever you're at traffic so everyone

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.169 
wherever you're at traffic so everyone
knows<00:01:55.319> where<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:56.069> were<00:01:56.160> at<00:01:56.340> again<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:56.970> on

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
knows where you were at again because on

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.719 
knows where you were at again because on
these<00:01:57.360> Unicom<00:01:57.810> frequencies<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:59.520> many

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
these Unicom frequencies so many

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.510 
these Unicom frequencies so many
airports<00:02:00.149> share<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.690> same<00:02:00.959> the<00:02:01.950> same

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
airports share the same the same

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
airports share the same the same
frequency<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.209> we<00:02:03.300> have<00:02:03.479> Donnellan<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
frequency and we have Donnellan and

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.650 
frequency and we have Donnellan and
Williston<00:02:04.530> which<00:02:05.280> are<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.789> know<00:02:05.910> within<00:02:06.330> ten

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
Williston which are you know within ten

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.199 
Williston which are you know within ten
miles<00:02:06.959> of<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.470> another<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.520> both<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
miles of one another and both have a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.750 
miles of one another and both have a
runway<00:02:09.599> five<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.500> three<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.099> we're<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
runway five to three and we're on the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.940 
runway five to three and we're on the
same<00:02:11.970> frequency<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:12.780> each<00:02:13.200> other<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.650> great

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
same frequency so each other up great

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.979 
same frequency so each other up great
and<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:14.970> really<00:02:15.150> adds<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.599> some<00:02:15.780> confusion

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
and it really adds to some confusion

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.710 
and it really adds to some confusion
sometimes<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.160> enough<00:02:17.910> with<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.060> let<00:02:18.390> me<00:02:18.420> go

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
sometimes so enough with that let me go

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.540 
sometimes so enough with that let me go
