00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.039 
how you can kill Piranha Plants really
easy<00:02:36.030> because<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.299> know<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.480> can't<00:02:37.660> jump<00:02:37.870> on

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
easy because you know you can't jump on

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:47.190
