00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.519
 help her, we'll go through that for a moment 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.010
 system by catching here 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.660
 that's the onstar sos button if you 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.559
 the then actuated brings you an Opel 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.000
 ambulance or whatever you are 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.129
 had a breakdown then you will be helped by 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.540
 opel over the call center then we have 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.739
 here the button we will too 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 press the same 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.180
 which provides us with a connection to her 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.340
 The consultant we pretty much 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.010
 can ask anything but jokes that can 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 He was not told and we have 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.620
 here then another button of us in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.070
 a private mode during this was 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 just for us Germans thought that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.260
 are very concerned about privacy 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.000
 however, this private is more or 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.010
 less a flight mode 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.700
 software funny on it says that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.720
 then you could theoretically 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.299
 probably chop 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.770
 Anyway, these are the three keys 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.659
 you make this monster element 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.150
 At the same time this element is being used 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.009
 Here we are talking in here but here 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.790
 from the advisory board here in 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.500
 Luton is putting new data on this 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.490

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.860

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.720
 Simply follow the further lawyer 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:11.780

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:13.840

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.450
 finished goodbye 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.040
 yes and this is how it works in life 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.630
 Of course, testing methods are now all 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.590
 trimmed on and journalists 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.769
 because we are the only ones 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.390
 respectively and blogger we are the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.890
 the only ones that are allowed to test this right now 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.360
 Of course, that will happen soon 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.590
 All over Europe, I believe 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.940
 first in england germany and the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.590
 Netherlands as far as I am not 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.840
 deceive 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.340
 and that should be in a total of eight languages 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.890
 that's the way they work 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.900
 Need other employees from the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.620

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.000

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.680

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.299
 costs in the first year nothing internet 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.430
 is also in the first year 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:02.000
 From the second year I think you pay 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.769
 eight euros 99 a month and that 's about it 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.550
