end<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.970> computers<00:02:15.330> always<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> pain<00:02:15.780> so

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
end of the computers always a pain so

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.020 
end of the computers always a pain so
this<00:02:16.680> close<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.980> USB<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> back<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.910> your

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
this close to a USB to the back of your

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.539 
this close to a USB to the back of your
computer<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:19.080> gives<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> port<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.519> you

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
computer and it gives you a port so you

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.530 
computer and it gives you a port so you
can<00:02:20.760> actually<00:02:20.850> just<00:02:21.090> put<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.299> on<00:02:21.360> your<00:02:21.480> desk

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
can actually just put it on your desk

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.630 
can actually just put it on your desk
that<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.959> actually<00:02:22.140> mount<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.739> on<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.489> computer

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
that I actually mount it on the computer

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.570 
that I actually mount it on the computer
itself<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.930> handy<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:25.580> I'll

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
itself and this is handy because I'll

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.229 
itself and this is handy because I'll
show<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.819> right<00:02:26.940> now<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:28.769> camera<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.580> that's

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
show you right now the camera so that's

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:38.660 
show you right now the camera so that's
it<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> box<00:02:33.019> looking<00:02:34.019> at<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.200> camera<00:02:37.670> do

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
it for the box looking at the camera do

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.970 
it for the box looking at the camera do
not<00:02:38.850> drop<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.209> as<00:02:40.049> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.290> see<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.890> very

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
not drop it as you can see it is very

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.750 
not drop it as you can see it is very
tiny<00:02:41.519> but<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:43.440> USB<00:02:43.920> cable<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.340> attached<00:02:44.730> to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
tiny but the USB cable is attached to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.819 
tiny but the USB cable is attached to
the<00:02:44.940> camera<00:02:45.329> itself<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.840> if<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.590> Mac

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
the camera itself so if you have a Mac

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.440 
the camera itself so if you have a Mac
like<00:02:47.070> mine<00:02:47.340> imac<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.940> kind<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.090> difficult<00:02:48.269> to

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
like mine imac it's kind of difficult to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.449 
like mine imac it's kind of difficult to
plug<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.049> have<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.739> camera<00:02:50.070> hanging

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
plug this in and have the camera hanging

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.120 
plug this in and have the camera hanging
so<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:51.480> adapter<00:02:51.900> definitely<00:02:52.560> does<00:02:52.709> come<00:02:52.980> in

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
so this adapter definitely does come in

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.430 
so this adapter definitely does come in
handy<00:02:53.840> where<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.930> have<00:02:55.049> an<00:02:55.140> all-in-one

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
handy where you have an all-in-one

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.590 
handy where you have an all-in-one
desktop<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.190> see<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> camera<00:02:57.209> itself<00:02:57.269> real

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
desktop so see the camera itself real

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.000 
desktop so see the camera itself real
quick<00:02:57.720> as<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.019> can<00:02:58.079> see<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.410> USB<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.799> attached

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
quick as you can see the USB is attached

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.949 
quick as you can see the USB is attached
to<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> camera<00:02:59.489> which<00:03:00.120> can<00:03:00.209> be<00:03:00.540> good<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.870> bad

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
to the camera which can be good and bad

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.780 
to the camera which can be good and bad
as<00:03:01.200> convenient<00:03:01.709> you'll<00:03:01.890> always<00:03:02.130> have<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.430> USB

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
as convenient you'll always have a USB

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.180 
as convenient you'll always have a USB
cable<00:03:03.109> bad<00:03:04.109> because<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.590> actually<00:03:04.769> breaks

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
cable bad because if it actually breaks

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.460 
cable bad because if it actually breaks
off<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.299> lot<00:03:06.420> harder<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.690> replace<00:03:07.109> that

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
off it's a lot harder to replace that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.789 
off it's a lot harder to replace that
would<00:03:07.739> be<00:03:07.799> traditional<00:03:08.130> cable<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.650> we

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
would be traditional cable so in here we

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.759 
would be traditional cable so in here we
