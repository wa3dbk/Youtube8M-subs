apparently when the chapel was first

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.640 
apparently when the chapel was first
constructed<00:01:13.600> they<00:01:14.600> did<00:01:14.780> something<00:01:15.050> that<00:01:15.290> I

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
constructed they did something that I

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.760 
constructed they did something that I
might<00:01:16.100> have<00:01:16.130> done<00:01:16.450> they<00:01:17.450> built<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.140> balcony

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
might have done they built the balcony

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.100 
might have done they built the balcony
and<00:01:19.040> they<00:01:19.400> built<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.880> church<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.570> there<00:01:20.960> was

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
and they built the church and there was

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.070 
and they built the church and there was
no<00:01:21.350> stairway<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.369> get<00:01:22.820> from<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.210> church<00:01:23.509> up<00:01:23.869> to

the balcony

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.760 
the balcony
so<00:01:25.400> I<00:01:25.850> guess<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.330> had<00:01:26.450> this<00:01:26.570> choir<00:01:26.960> loft<00:01:27.290> and

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
so I guess you had this choir loft and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.399 
so I guess you had this choir loft and
there<00:01:28.550> was<00:01:28.670> no<00:01:28.880> way<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.150> actually<00:01:29.420> get<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.110> the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
there was no way to actually get to the

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.800 
there was no way to actually get to the
choir<00:01:30.680> loft<00:01:30.710> they<00:01:31.700> would<00:01:31.880> have<00:01:32.000> had<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.450> use<00:01:32.479> a

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
choir loft they would have had to use a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.749 
choir loft they would have had to use a
ladder<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.590> get<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.890> choir<00:01:34.100> loft<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.580> this

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
ladder to get to the choir loft so this

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.480 
ladder to get to the choir loft so this
was<00:01:34.909> really<00:01:35.180> a<00:01:35.360> dilemma<00:01:35.780> for<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.200> church<00:01:36.530> the
