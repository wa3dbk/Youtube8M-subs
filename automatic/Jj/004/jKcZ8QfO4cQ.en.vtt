00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
then of course they use that for

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.299 
then of course they use that for
information<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> mix<00:00:46.829> where<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> can't<00:00:47.190> use

synchro and they're tired and I go ahead

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
synchro and they're tired and I go ahead
and<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.680> mist<00:01:25.890> wurm<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.490> well<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.820> mean

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and go for mist wurm so that well I mean

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.190 
and go for mist wurm so that well I mean
I<00:01:27.180> wouldn't<00:01:27.330> really<00:01:27.479> sure<00:01:27.659> which<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.049> fire

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
I wouldn't really sure which of the fire

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.899 
I wouldn't really sure which of the fire
information<00:01:28.619> cards<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> send<00:01:29.400> Mac<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.759> thought

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
information cards to send Mac I thought

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.850 
information cards to send Mac I thought
I'd<00:01:30.000> send<00:01:30.240> back<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:30.960> instead<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I'd send back that one instead of the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.200 
I'd send back that one instead of the
one<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.040> gives<00:01:32.159> them<00:01:32.310> an<00:01:32.400> extra<00:01:32.549> summon<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
one that gives them an extra summon just

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.450 
one that gives them an extra summon just
because<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.840> figured<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.860> would<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.310> kind

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
because I figured it would it was kind

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.140 
because I figured it would it was kind
of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.670> that's<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.090> more

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
of the one that's a little bit more

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
of the one that's a little bit more
annoying<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.710> didn't<00:01:38.100> think

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
annoying and it I you know didn't think

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.410 
annoying and it I you know didn't think
they'd<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.520> any<00:01:38.640> extra<00:01:38.820> monster<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.360> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
they'd get any extra monster so I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.819 
they'd get any extra monster so I
figured<00:01:39.720> that'd<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:39.990> better<00:01:40.170> choice<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
figured that'd be the better choice and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.109 
figured that'd be the better choice and
it<00:01:40.920> works<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.850> placed<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it works out because this was placed a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.670 
it works out because this was placed a
phone<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.420> use<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> destroy<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.049> since<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
phone I can use to destroy that since it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.139 
phone I can use to destroy that since it
is<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> better<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> two<00:01:44.549> fire<00:01:44.790> formations

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
is the better of the two fire formations

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.179 
is the better of the two fire formations
in<00:01:45.299> my<00:01:45.390> opinion<00:01:45.659> better<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> field<00:01:47.040> right

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
in my opinion better on the field right

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.940 
in my opinion better on the field right
there<00:01:47.720> anyway<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> course<00:01:49.170> they're<00:01:49.409> tired<00:01:49.649> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
kind of wondering what was gonna happen

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.510 
kind of wondering what was gonna happen
on<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.420> at<00:02:03.509> least<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:04.710> don't<00:02:05.159> really<00:02:05.340> run

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
on that but at least I don't really run

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.920 
on that but at least I don't really run
out<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> monsters<00:02:05.909> easily<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.540> yang<00:02:06.659> Zing's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
out of monsters easily with yang Zing's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.260 
out of monsters easily with yang Zing's
I<00:02:07.079> mean<00:02:07.229> we<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.500> monsters<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.220> days<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.119> it's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
I mean we have monsters for days so it's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.540 
I mean we have monsters for days so it's
not<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.569> problem

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
not really a problem

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.550 
not really a problem
so<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.670> go<00:02:10.850> on<00:02:10.940> ahead<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.240> go<00:02:11.750> for<00:02:11.990> a<00:02:12.020> synchro

time especially whenever they see some
again<00:02:42.410> but<00:02:42.740> there's<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.670> certain<00:02:43.910> card<00:02:44.270> that

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
again but there's a certain card that

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.470 
again but there's a certain card that
has<00:02:44.780> survived<00:02:45.140> in<00:02:45.920> this<00:02:46.040> duel<00:02:46.340> forever<00:02:46.850> even

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
has survived in this duel forever even

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.370 
has survived in this duel forever even
though<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:47.600> couldn't<00:02:47.750> use<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.960> part<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.320> and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
though I couldn't use a part of it and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.650 
though I couldn't use a part of it and
that<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.620> dimensional<00:02:49.040> prison<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.970> with<00:02:50.390> that

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
that is dimensional prison so with that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.620 
that is dimensional prison so with that
I<00:02:50.960> am<00:02:51.260> able<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:52.070> go<00:02:52.820> ahead<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.060> just<00:02:53.210> activate

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
I am able to go ahead and just activate

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.320 
I am able to go ahead and just activate
a<00:02:53.660> supply<00:02:54.230> unit<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.770> go<00:02:55.490> for<00:02:55.670> an<00:02:55.730> attack<00:02:56.000> of

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
a supply unit and go for an attack of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.940 
a supply unit and go for an attack of
course<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.780> was<00:02:56.900> enough<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.170> win<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.770> was

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
course it was enough to win but I was

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.140 
course it was enough to win but I was
hoping<00:02:58.070> that<00:02:58.310> maybe<00:02:58.490> they<00:02:58.850> wouldn't<00:02:59.000> draw

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
hoping that maybe they wouldn't draw

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.790 
hoping that maybe they wouldn't draw
anything<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.750> they<00:03:00.350> didn't<00:03:00.530> draw<00:03:00.620> anything

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
anything and they didn't draw anything

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.500 
anything and they didn't draw anything
that<00:03:00.980> could<00:03:01.070> help<00:03:01.130> them<00:03:01.250> against<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.390> yeah

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
that could help them against it but yeah

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.790 
that could help them against it but yeah
