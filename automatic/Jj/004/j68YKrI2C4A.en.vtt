00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
like writing and it's having parades and

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.320 
like writing and it's having parades and
you<00:01:54.280> could<00:01:54.400> do<00:01:54.460> those<00:01:54.580> by<00:01:54.700> every<00:01:54.880> three<00:01:55.090> months

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
you could do those by every three months

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.140 
you could do those by every three months
in<00:01:55.690> game<00:01:56.410> whatever<00:01:57.450> however<00:01:58.450> long<00:01:58.660> it<00:01:58.810> takes

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
in game whatever however long it takes

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.220 
in game whatever however long it takes
so<00:02:01.150> let's<00:02:01.270> kind<00:02:01.510> of<00:02:01.570> fast<00:02:01.780> forward<00:02:01.870> a<00:02:02.110> little

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
so let's kind of fast forward a little

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.330 
so let's kind of fast forward a little
bit<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.500> look<00:02:02.680> at<00:02:02.830> some<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.190> tech<00:02:03.490> trees

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
bit and look at some of the tech trees

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.190 
bit and look at some of the tech trees
and<00:02:06.340> here<00:02:06.850> we<00:02:06.940> go<00:02:07.030> playing<00:02:07.390> against<00:02:07.840> an<00:02:07.960> AI

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
and here we go playing against an AI

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.749 
and here we go playing against an AI
right<00:02:08.619> now<00:02:08.769> you<00:02:08.830> can't<00:02:09.069> play<00:02:09.220> one<00:02:09.429> of<00:02:09.519> us<00:02:09.640> one

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
right now you can't play one of us one

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.979 
right now you can't play one of us one
against<00:02:09.940> multiplayer<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.539> can<00:02:10.660> queue<00:02:10.869> up<00:02:10.959> for

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
against multiplayer you can queue up for

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.020 
against multiplayer you can queue up for
matches<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.010> bring<00:02:12.099> up<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.340> tech<00:02:12.640> tree<00:02:12.879> if

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
matches so you bring up the tech tree if

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.000 
matches so you bring up the tech tree if
you<00:02:13.120> have<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.360> money<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.840> you've<00:02:14.010> earned

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
you have the money and you've earned

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.860 
you have the money and you've earned
enough<00:02:15.340> research<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.269> can<00:02:16.390> go<00:02:16.540> ahead<00:02:16.659> just

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
enough research you can go ahead just

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.739 
enough research you can go ahead just
unlock<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:18.329> basically<00:02:19.329> you're<00:02:19.450> working

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:19.749 
unlock this basically you're working

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.970 
unlock this basically you're working
toward<00:02:20.019> space<00:02:20.349> programs

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.720 

so<00:02:23.980> there's<00:02:24.280> two<00:02:24.730> types<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:26.430> research<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.640> can

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
so there's two types of research you can

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.070 
so there's two types of research you can
either<00:02:27.910> research<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:30.420> horizontal<00:02:31.420> tier

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
either research on the horizontal tier

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.290 
either research on the horizontal tier
but<00:02:32.530> kind<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.800> unlocks<00:02:33.160> new<00:02:33.370> possibilities<00:02:34.060> or

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
but kind of unlocks new possibilities or

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.090 
but kind of unlocks new possibilities or
you<00:02:34.450> can<00:02:34.570> go<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:34.870> which<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.470> actual<00:02:35.890> like

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
you can go up which is to actual like

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.240 
you can go up which is to actual like
completing<00:02:36.550> program<00:02:37.030> missions<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:38.040> over<00:02:39.040> time

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
completing program missions so over time

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.480 
completing program missions so over time
things<00:02:39.970> like<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.930> Apollo<00:02:41.350> missions<00:02:42.010> going<00:02:42.400> to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
things like the Apollo missions going to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.950 
things like the Apollo missions going to
the<00:02:42.580> moon<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.910> all<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:43.600> also<00:02:43.720> be<00:02:43.870> going

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
the moon and all that but also be going

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.800 
the moon and all that but also be going
up<00:02:44.290> whereas<00:02:45.270> researching<00:02:46.270> newer<00:02:46.450> newer

up whereas researching newer newer
technology<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.710> get<00:02:47.830> more<00:02:48.190> later<00:02:49.090> missions

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
technology to get more later missions

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.320 
technology to get more later missions
that<00:02:50.230> goes<00:02:50.380> right<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:51.550> first<00:02:51.790> person<00:02:52.270> to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
that goes right the first person to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.090 
that goes right the first person to

and as you as you research new missions

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.250 
and as you as you research new missions
don't<00:03:05.890> get<00:03:06.040> new<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:07.060> get<00:03:07.180> influence<00:03:07.750> bonuses

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
and all that fun stuff it looks like I

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.650 
and all that fun stuff it looks like I
have<00:03:15.010> for<00:03:15.130> much<00:03:15.250> max<00:03:15.490> it<00:03:15.610> now<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.210> do<00:03:16.360> have<00:03:16.390> to

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
have for much max it now you do have to

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.330 
have for much max it now you do have to
spend<00:03:17.050> money<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.500> earn<00:03:17.680> gold<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.220> get

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
spend money and you earn gold and get

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.100 
spend money and you earn gold and get
overtime<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.150> also<00:03:19.270> see<00:03:19.570> some<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.930> your

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
overtime you can also see some of your

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.560 
overtime you can also see some of your
so<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.320> takes<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.560> statistics<00:03:21.280> as<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.490> go<00:03:21.610> it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
so it takes is statistics as you go it

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.870 
so it takes is statistics as you go it
does<00:03:22.780> have<00:03:22.990> a<00:03:23.020> RTS<00:03:23.620> feel<00:03:24.010> but<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.460> also<00:03:24.580> kind<00:03:24.850> of

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
does have a RTS feel but it also kind of

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.840 
does have a RTS feel but it also kind of
a<00:03:24.970> turn-based<00:03:25.330> feel<00:03:25.600> too<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.340> kind<00:03:27.610> of<00:03:27.640> alice

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
a turn-based feel too so kind of alice

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.190 
a turn-based feel too so kind of alice
is<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.000> best<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.240> both<00:03:28.300> worlds<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.840> guess<00:03:29.020> in

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
is the best of both worlds I guess in

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.990 
is the best of both worlds I guess in
that<00:03:29.290> case<00:03:29.590> maybe<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.190> bit<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.460> a<00:03:30.550> sins<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.940> a

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
that case maybe a bit of a sins of a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.280 
that case maybe a bit of a sins of a
solar<00:03:31.030> Empire<00:03:31.420> or<00:03:32.670> star<00:03:33.670> drive<00:03:34.000> where<00:03:34.300> it<00:03:34.750> is

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
solar Empire or star drive where it is

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.930 
solar Empire or star drive where it is
real-time<00:03:35.680> but<00:03:36.190> also<00:03:36.340> kind<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:36.700> turn-based

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
real-time but also kind of turn-based

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.710 
real-time but also kind of turn-based
the<00:03:37.360> same<00:03:37.540> time<00:03:40.860> as<00:03:41.860> for<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.220> stats<00:03:42.580> on<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.360> on

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
the same time as for the stats on the on

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.440 
the same time as for the stats on the on
the<00:03:44.380> countries<00:03:44.890> you'll<00:03:45.070> have<00:03:45.360> towards<00:03:46.360> your

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
the countries you'll have towards your

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.330 
the countries you'll have towards your
left<00:03:46.720> on<00:03:46.960> the<00:03:47.080> bottom<00:03:47.350> you'll<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.620> support

and agents can be used to looks like I'm
researching<00:04:07.210> a<00:04:07.390> little<00:04:07.570> more<00:04:07.690> can<00:04:08.230> be<00:04:08.380> used<00:04:08.680> to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
researching a little more can be used to

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.370 
researching a little more can be used to
incite<00:04:09.520> riots<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.360> just<00:04:10.690> cause<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> headache

and you can see you have to deal with

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.670 
and you can see you have to deal with
the<00:04:16.450> opponent<00:04:16.720> agents<00:04:16.989> do<00:04:17.080> like<00:04:17.230> right<00:04:17.380> now<00:04:17.500> on

of<00:04:34.210> at<00:04:34.300> least<00:04:34.360> 80s<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.020> must<00:04:35.290> have

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
of at least 80s so I must have

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.200 
of at least 80s so I must have
really<00:04:35.890> hacked<00:04:36.190> them<00:04:36.370> off<00:04:36.520> before<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:36.940> can<00:04:37.090> make

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
really hacked them off before I can make

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.480 
really hacked them off before I can make
that<00:04:37.330> one<00:04:39.540> so<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:41.380> country<00:04:41.680> only<00:04:41.770> is<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:42.010> peplum

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
that one so the country only is a peplum

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.340 
that one so the country only is a peplum
is<00:04:42.700> not<00:04:42.850> position<00:04:43.180> of<00:04:43.270> 30<00:04:43.510> keep<00:04:43.780> inciting<00:04:44.260> them

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
is not position of 30 keep inciting them

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.080 
is not position of 30 keep inciting them
riots<00:04:44.770> after<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.280> little<00:04:45.520> while<00:04:45.670> and<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:45.940> make

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
riots after a little while and you make

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.370 
riots after a little while and you make
them<00:04:46.180> angry<00:04:46.360> maybe<00:04:46.750> they'll<00:04:46.960> consider

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
them angry maybe they'll consider

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.370 
them angry maybe they'll consider
joining<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:49.330> other<00:04:49.450> option<00:04:49.750> is<00:04:49.900> politics

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
joining you the other option is politics

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.950 
joining you the other option is politics
now<00:04:53.380> government<00:04:53.980> opposition<00:04:54.540> has<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.660> be<00:04:55.750> 80

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
now government opposition has to be 80

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.690 
now government opposition has to be 80
or<00:04:56.050> my<00:04:56.410> influence<00:04:57.010> has<00:04:57.160> to<00:04:57.280> be<00:04:57.370> easy<00:04:57.520> my

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
or my influence has to be easy my

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.450 
or my influence has to be easy my
influences<00:04:58.180> 80<00:04:58.540> then<00:04:59.410> I<00:04:59.740> can<00:04:59.920> go<00:05:00.040> ahead<00:05:00.190> and

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
influences 80 then I can go ahead and

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.130 
influences 80 then I can go ahead and
just<00:05:00.490> kind<00:05:00.820> of<00:05:00.970> convince<00:05:01.240> them<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.390> join<00:05:01.450> me<00:05:01.840> so

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
just kind of convince them to join me so

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.950 
just kind of convince them to join me so
I<00:05:02.380> can<00:05:02.710> add<00:05:03.250> extra<00:05:03.820> influence<00:05:04.270> which<00:05:04.390> was<00:05:04.600> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
I can add extra influence which was the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.560 
I can add extra influence which was the
top<00:05:05.260> I<00:05:05.440> add<00:05:05.700> so<00:05:06.700> it's<00:05:06.880> basically<00:05:07.060> two<00:05:07.270> ways<00:05:07.390> to

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
top I add so it's basically two ways to

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.570 
top I add so it's basically two ways to
add<00:05:07.690> to<00:05:08.440> kind<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.890> take<00:05:09.100> control<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.430> country

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
add to kind of take control of a country

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.060 
add to kind of take control of a country
you're<00:05:10.210> trying<00:05:10.240> to<00:05:10.540> spread<00:05:11.020> all<00:05:11.320> over<00:05:11.770> the

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
you're trying to spread all over the

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.770 
you're trying to spread all over the
world<00:05:12.100> kind<00:05:12.640> of<00:05:12.730> like<00:05:12.850> a<00:05:12.880> risk<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:13.360> eventually

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
world kind of like a risk and eventually

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.820 
world kind of like a risk and eventually
maybe<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:15.720> Americans<00:05:16.720> can<00:05:17.050> defeat<00:05:17.410> the<00:05:17.680> evil

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
maybe the Americans can defeat the evil

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.940 
maybe the Americans can defeat the evil
Reds<00:05:18.490> no<00:05:18.940> but<00:05:19.690> eventually<00:05:19.960> we<00:05:20.230> can<00:05:20.440> push<00:05:20.920> back

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
Reds no but eventually we can push back

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.910 
Reds no but eventually we can push back
the<00:05:21.250> USSR<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:21.640> lot<00:05:22.000> like<00:05:22.270> risk<00:05:22.710> that's<00:05:23.710> why<00:05:23.890> I

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
the USSR a lot like risk that's why I

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.850 
the USSR a lot like risk that's why I
said<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:24.310> reminds<00:05:25.180> me<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.360> if<00:05:26.260> risk<00:05:26.650> was<00:05:26.830> a

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
said it reminds me of if risk was a

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.620 
said it reminds me of if risk was a
real-time<00:05:27.160> strategy<00:05:27.280> although<00:05:28.240> it's<00:05:28.390> a<00:05:28.450> lot

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
real-time strategy although it's a lot

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:35.190 
real-time strategy although it's a lot
more<00:05:28.900> about<00:05:31.800> it's<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:32.890> lot<00:05:33.010> less<00:05:33.340> uh<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:34.360> guess

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
more about it's a lot less uh I guess

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.900 
more about it's a lot less uh I guess
action-packed<00:05:35.980> and<00:05:36.310> risk<00:05:36.490> where<00:05:36.670> you<00:05:36.760> don't

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
action-packed and risk where you don't

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.150 
action-packed and risk where you don't
have<00:05:37.230> units<00:05:38.230> going<00:05:38.440> around<00:05:38.680> fighting<00:05:38.980> each

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
have units going around fighting each

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.430 
have units going around fighting each
other<00:05:39.250> necessarily<00:05:40.020> it's<00:05:41.020> more<00:05:41.260> about

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
other necessarily it's more about
