team prides itself obviously on this
very<00:02:59.810> integrated<00:03:00.620> design<00:03:00.800> if<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.370> would<00:03:01.580> you

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
very integrated design if you would you

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.580 
very integrated design if you would you
know<00:03:01.820> big<00:03:02.330> statement<00:03:03.080> of<00:03:03.200> course<00:03:03.440> the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
know big statement of course the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.440 
know big statement of course the
powerful<00:03:04.130> be<00:03:04.280> front<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:04.880> know<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.210> typical

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
powerful be front you know the typical

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.020 
powerful be front you know the typical
Audi<00:03:05.870> proportions<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:06.950> might<00:03:07.130> write<00:03:07.310> the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
Audi proportions as I might write the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.920 
Audi proportions as I might write the
thing<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.110> we<00:03:09.260> call<00:03:09.490> floating<00:03:10.490> surfaces<00:03:11.120> is

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
thing that we call floating surfaces is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.280 
thing that we call floating surfaces is
a<00:03:11.990> concept<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.800> we<00:03:13.160> use<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.730> describe

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
a concept that we use to describe

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.540 
a concept that we use to describe
basically<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.440> different<00:03:15.800> surfaces<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.459> the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
basically the different surfaces and the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.100 
basically the different surfaces and the
way<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.910> light<00:03:17.120> hits<00:03:17.150> them<00:03:17.570> in<00:03:17.720> order<00:03:17.900> to

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
way the light hits them in order to

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.170 
way the light hits them in order to
really<00:03:18.380> create<00:03:18.709> interplay<00:03:19.340> particularly<00:03:19.970> on

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
really create interplay particularly on

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.080 
really create interplay particularly on
the<00:03:20.209> side<00:03:20.950> also<00:03:21.950> this<00:03:22.130> shoulder<00:03:22.489> line<00:03:22.850> that

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
the side also this shoulder line that

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.360 
the side also this shoulder line that
you<00:03:23.120> see<00:03:23.239> right<00:03:23.450> here<00:03:23.930> typically<00:03:24.800> very<00:03:25.100> high

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
you see right here typically very high

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.120 
you see right here typically very high
for<00:03:25.430> Audi<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.510> really<00:03:26.870> express<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.650> powerful

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
for Audi to really express the powerful

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.600 
for Audi to really express the powerful
statement<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.850> car<00:03:29.090> as<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.230> see

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
statement of the car as you see

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.400 
statement of the car as you see
integrated<00:03:31.610> LED<00:03:31.850> lighting<00:03:32.540> around<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.170> whole

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
integrated LED lighting around the whole

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.250 
integrated LED lighting around the whole
exterior<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.310> car<00:03:34.340> we<00:03:34.790> have<00:03:35.030> led<00:03:35.810> in<00:03:36.050> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
exterior of the car we have led in the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.190 
exterior of the car we have led in the
in<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.709> bi-xenon<00:03:37.070> right<00:03:37.790> here<00:03:38.090> we<00:03:38.570> have<00:03:38.600> led

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
in the bi-xenon right here we have led

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.259 
in the bi-xenon right here we have led
in<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.530> blinker<00:03:40.040> of<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.459> sideview<00:03:40.790> mirror

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
in the blinker of the sideview mirror

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.780 
in the blinker of the sideview mirror
and<00:03:41.810> we<00:03:41.930> also<00:03:42.080> have<00:03:42.260> standard<00:03:42.950> LED<00:03:43.340> in<00:03:43.550> the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
and we also have standard LED in the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.000 
and we also have standard LED in the
trunk<00:03:44.090> lid<00:03:44.300> in<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.540> back<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.140> car<00:03:45.380> so

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
trunk lid in the back of the car so

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.160 
trunk lid in the back of the car so
really<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.459> great<00:03:46.880> lighting<00:03:47.239> technology<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.110> a

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
really a great lighting technology and a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.199 
really a great lighting technology and a
great<00:03:48.380> differentiator<00:03:49.040> for<00:03:49.160> us<00:03:49.489> out<00:03:49.760> there<00:03:50.060> as

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
great differentiator for us out there as

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.430 
great differentiator for us out there as
well<00:03:50.680> because<00:03:51.680> we<00:03:51.860> are<00:03:52.010> really<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.550> very<00:03:52.970> you
