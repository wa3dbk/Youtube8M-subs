screen<00:01:53.600> after<00:01:54.600> buried<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.310> would<00:01:56.430> make

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
screen after buried and that would make

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.490 
screen after buried and that would make
a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.909> sense<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.049> think<00:01:58.259> about<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
a lot of sense so if you think about it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.910 
a lot of sense so if you think about it
we<00:01:58.770> are<00:01:59.420> on<00:02:00.420> dlc<00:02:00.930> three<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.350> buried<00:02:01.740> we're

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
we are on dlc three with buried we're

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.010 
we are on dlc three with buried we're
going<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.280> dlc<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.630> which<00:02:03.899> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
going to be on dlc for with the which is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.660 
going to be on dlc for with the which is
the<00:02:04.140> last<00:02:04.380> dlc<00:02:04.829> there's<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.399> going<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the last dlc there's not going to

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.150 
the last dlc there's not going to
probably<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.119> dlc<00:02:06.630> five<00:02:06.860> guessing<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.009> was

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
probably be a dlc five guessing that was

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.669 
probably be a dlc five guessing that was
faked<00:02:08.580> i<00:02:08.879> mean<00:02:09.599> there<00:02:09.780> still<00:02:09.869> could<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.319> but

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
faked i mean there still could be but

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.140 
faked i mean there still could be but
they<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.790> means<00:02:11.970> they<00:02:12.090> be

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
they would be that means they be

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.340 
they would be that means they be
releasing<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.810> during<00:02:13.080> call

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
releasing it during call

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.810 
releasing it during call
duty<00:02:13.620> ghosts<00:02:14.010> which<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.340> don't<00:02:14.400> think<00:02:14.700> they're

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
duty ghosts which I don't think they're

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.780 
duty ghosts which I don't think they're
going<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.180> doing<00:02:15.390> because<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.960> would<00:02:16.110> be

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
going to be doing because that would be

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.340 
going to be doing because that would be
counterproductive<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.630> there's<00:02:19.200> probably

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
counterproductive so there's probably

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.590 
counterproductive so there's probably
not<00:02:19.650> going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.920> dll<00:02:20.220> c5<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.240> next

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
not going to be a dll c5 but the next

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.080 
not going to be a dll c5 but the next
map<00:02:21.840> will<00:02:22.590> probably<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> loading

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
map will probably have that loading

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.980 
map will probably have that loading
screen<00:02:24.450> after<00:02:24.650> dlc<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:27.120> dairy<00:02:27.510> style

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
screen after dlc for it the dairy style

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.050 
screen after dlc for it the dairy style
loading<00:02:28.350> screen<00:02:28.590> will<00:02:28.740> belong<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.490> now

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
loading screen will belong to that now

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.120 
loading screen will belong to that now
that<00:02:30.270> means<00:02:30.540> that's<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.230> next<00:02:31.530> game<00:02:31.740> if

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that means that's in the next game if

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.620 
that means that's in the next game if
we're<00:02:32.370> saying<00:02:32.550> there's<00:02:32.700> no<00:02:32.820> dlc<00:02:33.210> five<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
we're saying there's no dlc five that

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.270 
we're saying there's no dlc five that
means<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.050> next<00:02:34.230> game<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.650> if<00:02:35.130> it's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
means it's in the next game and if it's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.070 
means it's in the next game and if it's
the<00:02:35.370> next<00:02:35.610> game<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:35.940> black<00:02:36.120> ops<00:02:36.360> 3<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.870> are

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the next game that's black ops 3 so are

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.630 
the next game that's black ops 3 so are
they<00:02:37.230> already<00:02:37.500> thinking<00:02:37.860> about<00:02:37.980> black<00:02:38.220> ops<00:02:38.250> 3

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
they already thinking about black ops 3

zombies<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:39.810> something

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
zombies is this going to be something

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.020 
zombies is this going to be something
