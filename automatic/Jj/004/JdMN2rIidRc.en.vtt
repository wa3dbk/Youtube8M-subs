Victoria's Secret a plant shirt t-shirt
v-neck<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:10.140> thought<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.890> color<00:01:11.130> would

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
v-neck and I thought that color would

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.450 
v-neck and I thought that color would
really<00:01:12.080> make<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.110> pop<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> lighter

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
really make it pop like a lighter

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.880 
really make it pop like a lighter
eggplant<00:01:15.360> color<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
eggplant color but it's really not I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.789 
eggplant color but it's really not I
guess<00:01:17.070> that's<00:01:17.310> probably<00:01:17.490> prune<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> yeah

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
guess that's probably prune and yeah

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.109 
guess that's probably prune and yeah
when<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> think<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.369> prune<00:01:20.549> don't<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> think

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
when you think of prune don't you think

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969 
when you think of prune don't you think
of<00:01:21.240> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> think

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
of kind of like a I don't know I think

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.149 
of kind of like a I don't know I think
of<00:01:23.250> raisins<00:01:23.900> kind<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> dark<00:01:25.170> brown<00:01:25.350> alright

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
of raisins kind of dark brown alright

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.499 
of raisins kind of dark brown alright
probably<00:01:26.939> Brown<00:01:27.920> yeah<00:01:28.920> okay<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.060> anyway<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
probably Brown yeah okay but anyway so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.109 
probably Brown yeah okay but anyway so
I'm<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.439> don't<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.310> thought<00:01:32.970> they

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
I'm really I don't know I thought they

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.850 
I'm really I don't know I thought they
would<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.509> good<00:01:33.750> together<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.470> colors

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
would go really good together the colors

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
would go really good together the colors
because<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> some<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.210> palette<00:01:36.630> but

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
