system only has 10 48 minutes so this is
about<00:00:47.820> half<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:49.320> turned<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.680> 3d

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
about half and I turned on 3d

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.619 
about half and I turned on 3d
acceleration<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.120> get<00:00:51.180> those<00:00:51.329> 3d

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
