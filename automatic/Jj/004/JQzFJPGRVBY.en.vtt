00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
some if I was to move down here to and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.530 
some if I was to move down here to and

one for a player that likes to play safe
this<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> bit<00:00:40.290> scary<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:40.950> I'm

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
this would be a bit scary because I'm

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.160 
this would be a bit scary because I'm
offering<00:00:41.730> three<00:00:42.149> checkers<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.870> hit<00:00:43.140> but

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
offering three checkers to be hit but

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.779 
offering three checkers to be hit but
Brown<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.890> one<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.640> want

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
Brown is not really one of going to want

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.920 
Brown is not really one of going to want
to<00:00:47.850> hit<00:00:48.120> here<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> build<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:50.780> prime<00:00:51.780> that's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
to hit here and build a prime that's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
to hit here and build a prime that's
kind<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:52.890> even<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.160> prime

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
kind of what it's not even a prime

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.299 
kind of what it's not even a prime
builds<00:00:54.140> connected<00:00:55.140> checkers<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.010> far

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
builds connected checkers that's so far

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.840 
builds connected checkers that's so far
apart<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:57.660> if<00:00:58.649> he<00:00:58.829> hit<00:00:59.039> some<00:00:59.250> covers<00:00:59.609> here

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
apart because if he hit some covers here

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.000 
apart because if he hit some covers here
and<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> come<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.629> where<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.500> checkers<00:01:01.770> are

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and you come in where these checkers are

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
and you come in where these checkers are
kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.640> play<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.840> they're

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
kind of out of play so they're

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
kind of out of play so they're
relatively<00:01:04.559> safe<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.489> over<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> only

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
relatively safe and over here the only

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.580 
relatively safe and over here the only
thing<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.990> hit<00:01:07.140> these<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> moment

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
thing that can hit these at the moment

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.370 
thing that can hit these at the moment
would<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.250> quite<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> Lucky<00:01:09.090> Strike<00:01:09.350> with<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
would be a quite a Lucky Strike with a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.750 
would be a quite a Lucky Strike with a
6-4<00:01:11.210> 6-2<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.840> two<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.530> pretty<00:01:14.369> safe

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
6-4 6-2 here for two here so pretty safe

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.230 
6-4 6-2 here for two here so pretty safe
so<00:01:15.119> I've<00:01:15.240> played<00:01:15.479> safe<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.290> also<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.950> is

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
so I've played safe there and also it is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
so I've played safe there and also it is
actually<00:01:18.259> arguably<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.470> best<00:01:19.680> move<00:01:19.890> let's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
actually arguably the best move let's

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.370 
actually arguably the best move let's
move<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.549> anyway<00:01:22.790> six<00:01:23.790> three<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.780> didn't<00:01:25.049> quite

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
move on anyway six three so didn't quite

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
move on anyway six three so didn't quite
make<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:26.040> bear<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:28.430> again<00:01:29.430> there's<00:01:29.670> no

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
make it to bear and again there's no

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.649 
make it to bear and again there's no
real<00:01:30.180> safe<00:01:30.570> play<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:32.150> one<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> aims<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
real safe play so one of the aims you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
real safe play so one of the aims you
want<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> do<00:01:34.130> in<00:01:35.130> backgammon<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:36.650> try<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.710> get

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
want to do in backgammon is try and get

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.389 
want to do in backgammon is try and get
the<00:01:38.850> five<00:01:39.090> point<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:41.240> or<00:01:42.799> the<00:01:43.799> seven<00:01:44.130> point

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.609 
the five point here or the seven point
there<00:01:45.530> or<00:01:47.060> get<00:01:48.060> onto<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.869> opponent's<00:01:48.990> five

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.040 
on de 6 is can be reached in a number of
different<00:02:20.069> ways<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.819> can<00:02:20.970> roll<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> 6<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:21.900> can

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
different ways you can roll a 6 you can

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.119 
different ways you can roll a 6 you can
roll<00:02:22.260> 2<00:02:22.500> 3<00:02:22.890> 0<00:02:23.340> 2<00:02:23.400> 4<00:02:23.700> 2<00:02:24.000> or<00:02:24.269> 5<00:02:24.450> 1<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.920> very

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
roll 2 3 0 2 4 2 or 5 1 so it's a very

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.070 
roll 2 3 0 2 4 2 or 5 1 so it's a very
common<00:02:26.599> landing<00:02:27.599> spot<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:30.080> a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
common landing spot if you like so a

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.339 
common landing spot if you like so a
safe<00:02:31.530> player<00:02:31.800> probably<00:02:32.130> would<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:33.200> if<00:02:34.200> he's

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
safe player probably would then if he's

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.630 
safe player probably would then if he's
going<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> play<00:02:34.650> reasonable<00:02:35.280> game<00:02:35.430> with

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
going to play reasonable game with

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.190 
going to play reasonable game with
reluctantly<00:02:36.420> plates<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:37.019> there<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:39.200> maybe

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
reluctantly plates are there and maybe

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.140 
reluctantly plates are there and maybe
being<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.560> bring<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> builder<00:02:41.310> down<00:02:41.459> here<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.880> call

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
being a bring a builder down here I call

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.330 
being a bring a builder down here I call
it<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.299> builder<00:02:42.660> because<00:02:43.019> this<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:43.950> now<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
it a builder because this is now in a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.220 
it a builder because this is now in a
position<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.849> combine<00:02:45.269> with<00:02:45.540> other<00:02:45.690> counters

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
position to combine with other counters

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.020 
position to combine with other counters
to<00:02:46.410> maybe<00:02:46.590> make<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.190> these<00:02:47.280> two<00:02:47.519> important

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
to maybe make one of these two important

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.690 
to maybe make one of these two important
points<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:49.620> thing<00:02:49.799> about<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.069> moves<00:02:50.400> there

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
points the thing about that moves there

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.470 
points the thing about that moves there
is<00:02:51.470> if<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:53.220> get<00:02:53.400> hit<00:02:53.640> well<00:02:53.910> you're<00:02:54.209> not<00:02:54.269> going

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
is if you get hit well you're not going

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.839 
is if you get hit well you're not going
to<00:02:54.569> be<00:02:54.630> sent<00:02:54.900> very<00:02:55.140> far<00:02:55.440> back<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.860> race<00:02:56.130> so

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
to be sent very far back in the race so

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:05.600 
to be sent very far back in the race so
it<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.690> safe<00:03:01.940> 5/3<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:04.410> because<00:03:04.769> he's

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
it is kind of safe 5/3 now because he's

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.970 
it is kind of safe 5/3 now because he's
played<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.420> checker<00:03:06.780> here<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.319> he<00:03:07.530> can't<00:03:07.799> be

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
played this checker here and he can't be

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.910 
played this checker here and he can't be
hit<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.959> one<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.349> advantages<00:03:10.860> of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
hit this is one of the advantages of

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.610 
hit this is one of the advantages of
this<00:03:11.160> move<00:03:11.430> he's<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:11.819> good<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> whole<00:03:13.110> move<00:03:13.349> to

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
this move he's now good a whole move to

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.900 
this move he's now good a whole move to
try<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:13.950> cover<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.519> have<00:03:14.670> another

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
try and cover that and have another

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.569 
try and cover that and have another
amazing<00:03:15.390> advanced<00:03:16.140> anchor<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:17.220> call<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.489> an

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
amazing advanced anchor we call it an

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.509 
amazing advanced anchor we call it an
anchor<00:03:17.700> because<00:03:18.329> it's<00:03:19.170> your<00:03:19.650> back<00:03:19.859> men<00:03:20.190> and

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
anchor because it's your back men and

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.050 
anchor because it's your back men and
where<00:03:21.150> they<00:03:21.299> influence<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:23.370> anchor<00:03:23.670> back<00:03:23.850> here

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
where they influence so anchor back here

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.879 
where they influence so anchor back here
means<00:03:24.269> they<00:03:24.389> influence<00:03:24.810> around<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:25.170> they

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
means they influence around here they

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.140 
means they influence around here they
influence<00:03:26.340> around<00:03:26.489> here<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.859> now<00:03:29.579> I'm<00:03:29.609> not

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
influence around here so I'm now I'm not

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.490 
influence around here so I'm now I'm not
playing<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.450> best<00:03:30.630> moves<00:03:30.870> at<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.019> moment<00:03:31.380> I'm

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
playing the best moves at the moment I'm

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.180 
playing the best moves at the moment I'm
looking<00:03:31.739> for<00:03:32.280> safe<00:03:32.519> moves<00:03:32.970> all<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.329> time<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
looking for safe moves all the time and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.759 
looking for safe moves all the time and
a<00:03:35.190> typical<00:03:35.940> play<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:36.690> by<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> weaker<00:03:37.530> player

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
a typical play then by a weaker player

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.840 
a typical play then by a weaker player
would<00:03:38.700> be<00:03:38.880> 5<00:03:39.380> 3<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:42.170> what's<00:03:43.170> happening<00:03:43.680> is<00:03:44.010> the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
would be 5 3 and what's happening is the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.229 
would be 5 3 and what's happening is the
player<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.329> trying<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:46.459> not<00:03:47.459> leave<00:03:47.670> any<00:03:47.880> shots

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
player is trying to not leave any shots

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.170 
player is trying to not leave any shots
you'll<00:03:49.049> often<00:03:49.200> see<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:49.799> in<00:03:49.859> a<00:03:50.730> lower-class

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
you'll often see this in a lower-class

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:59.720 
you'll often see this in a lower-class
game<00:03:56.060> 6<00:03:57.060> 1<00:03:57.769> here<00:03:58.769> we<00:03:58.950> have<00:03:59.069> a<00:03:59.099> toss-up<00:03:59.549> between

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
game 6 1 here we have a toss-up between

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.509 
game 6 1 here we have a toss-up between
making<00:04:00.420> our<00:04:01.319> advanced<00:04:01.829> anchor<00:04:02.280> or<00:04:03.500> 6/1

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
making our advanced anchor or 6/1

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.289 
making our advanced anchor or 6/1
forming<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.609> prime<00:04:05.910> and<00:04:07.639> maybe<00:04:08.639> this<00:04:08.819> is<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.150> to

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
forming a prime and maybe this is up to

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.159 
forming a prime and maybe this is up to
taste<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:11.010> think<00:04:11.609> having<00:04:12.299> started<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.930> plan<00:04:13.139> I

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
taste I think having started a plan I

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.319 
taste I think having started a plan I
would<00:04:13.349> see<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.799> through<00:04:14.130> because<00:04:14.849> this<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.150> so

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
would see it through because this is so

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.719 
would see it through because this is so
valuable<00:04:15.540> anyway<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.220> leaves<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.519> with

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
valuable anyway and it leaves you with

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.689 
valuable anyway and it leaves you with
the<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.269> spare<00:04:18.539> one<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.440> play<00:04:21.019> so

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
the the spare one to play so

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.779 
the the spare one to play so
I'm<00:04:24.659> playing<00:04:25.020> as<00:04:25.139> a<00:04:25.169> safe<00:04:25.439> player<00:04:25.710> now<00:04:25.949> I'd

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
I'm playing as a safe player now I'd

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.760 
I'm playing as a safe player now I'd
probably<00:04:26.849> do<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.539> I<00:04:27.870> can't<00:04:28.229> actually<00:04:28.439> have

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
probably do that I can't actually have

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.610 
probably do that I can't actually have
that<00:04:28.949> block<00:04:29.189> safe<00:04:31.969> six<00:04:32.969> four<00:04:33.360> well<00:04:34.229> playing

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
that block safe six four well playing

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.279 
that block safe six four well playing
safe<00:04:34.949> again<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.340> can<00:04:35.580> go<00:04:35.729> six<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:36.509> I<00:04:36.629> can<00:04:36.810> go<00:04:36.960> for

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
safe again I can go six and I can go for

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.330 
safe again I can go six and I can go for
now<00:04:37.560> why<00:04:38.249> is<00:04:38.310> this<00:04:39.090> good<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.860> it's<00:04:41.189> not

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
now why is this good and it's not

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.909 
now why is this good and it's not
fantastic<00:04:42.210> but<00:04:42.659> the<00:04:43.020> point<00:04:43.229> is<00:04:43.349> that<00:04:43.560> one<00:04:43.770> is

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
fantastic but the point is that one is

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.589 
fantastic but the point is that one is
covered<00:04:44.159> and<00:04:46.219> you<00:04:47.219> could<00:04:47.669> roll<00:04:47.879> directly<00:04:48.120> a

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
covered and you could roll directly a

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.469 
covered and you could roll directly a
two<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.319> be<00:04:49.469> to<00:04:49.800> hit<00:04:49.949> me<00:04:50.099> or<00:04:50.310> seven<00:04:50.909> from<00:04:51.180> here

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
two to be to hit me or seven from here

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.399 
two to be to hit me or seven from here
to<00:04:51.719> hit<00:04:51.930> me<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:53.099> I'm<00:04:53.810> reducing<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:54.900> chances<00:04:55.349> of

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
to hit me so I'm reducing the chances of

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:01.040 
to hit me so I'm reducing the chances of
being<00:04:55.680> hit<00:04:56.009> I'm<00:04:56.310> still<00:04:56.610> playing<00:04:56.849> safe<00:05:00.050> three

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
being hit I'm still playing safe three

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.850 
being hit I'm still playing safe three
two<00:05:01.289> here<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.580> get<00:05:03.479> to<00:05:03.659> hit<00:05:03.900> white<00:05:04.169> I<00:05:04.409> did<00:05:04.710> for

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
two here I get to hit white I did for

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.929 
two here I get to hit white I did for
all<00:05:04.919> my<00:05:05.099> two<00:05:05.449> white<00:05:06.449> goes<00:05:06.689> on<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.020> bar<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:07.939> I'm

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
all my two white goes on the bar and I'm

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:12.469 
all my two white goes on the bar and I'm
still<00:05:09.300> looking<00:05:09.569> to<00:05:09.689> play<00:05:09.870> safe<00:05:10.259> I<00:05:11.479> recommend

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
still looking to play safe I recommend

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.300 
still looking to play safe I recommend
this<00:05:12.569> kind<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.930> playoffs<00:05:13.289> I'm<00:05:13.500> trying<00:05:13.919> to<00:05:14.069> get

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
this kind of playoffs I'm trying to get

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.129 
this kind of playoffs I'm trying to get
to<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.580> point<00:05:14.819> here<00:05:15.029> I'll<00:05:15.270> show<00:05:15.569> you<00:05:15.599> that<00:05:15.930> I

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
to the point here I'll show you that I

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.920 
to the point here I'll show you that I
play<00:05:17.129> this<00:05:17.339> way<00:05:17.580> your<00:05:17.849> options<00:05:18.360> become<00:05:18.719> very

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
play this way your options become very

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.260 
play this way your options become very
limited<00:05:19.139> and<00:05:20.129> sooner<00:05:20.550> or<00:05:20.580> later<00:05:20.699> you<00:05:21.089> get

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
limited and sooner or later you get

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.739 
limited and sooner or later you get
forced<00:05:21.749> into<00:05:21.870> making<00:05:22.199> a<00:05:22.529> really<00:05:22.740> bad<00:05:22.949> move<00:05:23.749> 3-1

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:24.749 
forced into making a really bad move 3-1

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.629 
forced into making a really bad move 3-1
so<00:05:25.020> he<00:05:25.110> has<00:05:25.259> to<00:05:25.439> end<00:05:25.620> so<00:05:25.830> here's<00:05:26.039> a<00:05:26.129> choice<00:05:26.370> of

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
so he has to end so here's a choice of

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.499 
so he has to end so here's a choice of
entering<00:05:26.969> on<00:05:27.089> 3<00:05:27.419> or<00:05:27.659> a<00:05:27.719> 1<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:30.000> course<00:05:30.300> with

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
entering on 3 or a 1 and of course with

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:32.119 
entering on 3 or a 1 and of course with
the<00:05:30.629> one<00:05:30.659> you<00:05:30.990> can<00:05:31.139> make<00:05:31.409> that<00:05:31.680> advanced

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 
the one you can make that advanced

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.610 
the one you can make that advanced
anchor<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.479> safe<00:05:33.839> player<00:05:34.139> would<00:05:34.259> be<00:05:34.409> very

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
anchor so a safe player would be very

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.379 
anchor so a safe player would be very
happy<00:05:35.189> with<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:38.149> 6<00:05:39.149> -<00:05:39.479> this<00:05:40.289> is<00:05:40.469> a<00:05:40.500> happy<00:05:40.710> roll

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
happy with that 6 - this is a happy roll

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:52.480 
happy with that 6 - this is a happy roll
as<00:05:42.389> I<00:05:43.219> cover<00:05:44.219> up<00:05:45.139> everything<00:05:48.560> 5<00:05:49.560> -<00:05:50.389> 5<00:05:51.389> is<00:05:51.719> safe

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
as I cover up everything 5 - 5 is safe

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.629 
as I cover up everything 5 - 5 is safe
none<00:05:53.490> of<00:05:53.520> these<00:05:53.789> are<00:05:53.849> safe<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:55.279> you<00:05:56.279> never

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
none of these are safe and you never

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.059 
none of these are safe and you never
want<00:05:56.909> those<00:05:57.779> checkers<00:05:58.289> on<00:05:58.439> one<00:05:58.589> place<00:05:58.830> because

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
want those checkers on one place because

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.719 
want those checkers on one place because
it<00:05:59.189> limits<00:05:59.460> your<00:05:59.580> options<00:05:59.639> so<00:06:00.620> and<00:06:01.620> I'm<00:06:02.370> sure

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
it limits your options so and I'm sure

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.070 
it limits your options so and I'm sure
the<00:06:02.879> safe<00:06:03.120> player<00:06:03.389> wouldn't<00:06:03.629> even<00:06:03.810> want<00:06:04.020> to

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
the safe player wouldn't even want to

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.480 
the safe player wouldn't even want to
leave<00:06:04.199> even<00:06:04.469> a<00:06:04.729> spare<00:06:05.729> checker<00:06:06.509> over<00:06:06.870> here

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
leave even a spare checker over here

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.829 
leave even a spare checker over here
able<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.610> be<00:06:08.699> hit<00:06:08.909> so<00:06:09.180> probably<00:06:09.479> play<00:06:09.659> like

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:09.839 
able to be hit so probably play like

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.999 
able to be hit so probably play like
that<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:10.259> you<00:06:10.349> can<00:06:10.529> see<00:06:10.740> now<00:06:10.949> finally<00:06:13.009> White's

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
that and you can see now finally White's

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:20.149 
that and you can see now finally White's
options<00:06:14.520> are<00:06:14.639> becoming<00:06:14.969> limited<00:06:18.110> 5:1<00:06:19.159> well

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
options are becoming limited 5:1 well

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.279 
options are becoming limited 5:1 well
again<00:06:20.460> if<00:06:20.639> Brown<00:06:20.939> wants<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.330> be<00:06:21.449> safe<00:06:21.719> for<00:06:22.050> one

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
again if Brown wants to be safe for one

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.510 
again if Brown wants to be safe for one
and<00:06:23.250> you<00:06:23.339> can<00:06:23.490> play<00:06:23.669> 1<00:06:24.149> 2<00:06:24.180> 3<00:06:24.750> 4<00:06:25.139> 5<00:06:25.439> putting<00:06:26.430> a

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
and you can play 1 2 3 4 5 putting a

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.920 
and you can play 1 2 3 4 5 putting a
checker<00:06:26.870> safe-ish<00:06:27.870> because<00:06:28.379> it's<00:06:28.529> behind

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
checker safe-ish because it's behind

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.829 
checker safe-ish because it's behind
White's<00:06:30.930> back<00:06:31.229> men<00:06:32.149> but<00:06:33.149> it's<00:06:33.330> out<00:06:33.479> the<00:06:33.629> game

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:33.839 
White's back men but it's out the game

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.790 
White's back men but it's out the game
and<00:06:34.379> this<00:06:34.589> is<00:06:34.709> a<00:06:34.740> bad<00:06:34.949> thing<00:06:35.159> to<00:06:35.339> do<00:06:35.459> in<00:06:35.580> back

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
and this is a bad thing to do in back

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.890 
and this is a bad thing to do in back
gamin<00:06:36.159> you<00:06:36.970> want<00:06:37.330> to<00:06:37.419> use<00:06:37.569> all<00:06:37.750> of<00:06:37.780> the

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
gamin you want to use all of the

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.610 
gamin you want to use all of the
resources<00:06:38.080> available<00:06:38.470> to<00:06:39.009> you<00:06:40.139> so<00:06:41.139> I<00:06:41.169> could

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
resources available to you so I could

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.170 
resources available to you so I could
continue<00:06:41.949> but<00:06:42.159> I'm<00:06:42.460> finding<00:06:42.729> this<00:06:42.909> a<00:06:42.970> bit

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
continue but I'm finding this a bit

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.950 
continue but I'm finding this a bit
soul-destroying

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
soul-destroying

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.110 
soul-destroying
so<00:06:44.289> hopefully<00:06:45.190> I'm<00:06:45.280> making<00:06:45.550> the<00:06:45.639> point<00:06:45.879> here

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 
so hopefully I'm making the point here

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.330 
so hopefully I'm making the point here
that<00:06:46.330> if<00:06:46.659> you<00:06:47.139> play<00:06:47.379> like<00:06:47.409> that<00:06:47.770> you<00:06:47.949> will<00:06:48.129> end

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
that if you play like that you will end

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.279 
that if you play like that you will end
up<00:06:48.550> with<00:06:48.610> this<00:06:48.849> kind<00:06:49.210> of<00:06:49.330> thing<00:06:49.569> where<00:06:49.810> you've

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
up with this kind of thing where you've

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.580 
up with this kind of thing where you've
got<00:06:50.409> long<00:06:50.789> columns<00:06:51.789> of<00:06:52.210> counters<00:06:52.870> with

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
got long columns of counters with

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.279 
got long columns of counters with
limited<00:06:54.039> options<00:06:54.990> and<00:06:55.990> if<00:06:56.830> your<00:06:57.039> opponent<00:06:57.550> is

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
limited options and if your opponent is

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:00.659 
limited options and if your opponent is
more<00:06:59.289> experienced<00:07:00.009> he'll<00:07:00.159> be<00:07:00.280> trying<00:07:00.520> to

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
more experienced he'll be trying to

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.379 
more experienced he'll be trying to
build<00:07:00.789> Prime's<00:07:01.530> block<00:07:02.530> you<00:07:02.710> off<00:07:02.889> and<00:07:03.300> he<00:07:04.300> will

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
build Prime's block you off and he will

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.980 
build Prime's block you off and he will
have<00:07:04.569> quite<00:07:05.500> a<00:07:05.530> lot<00:07:05.800> of<00:07:05.949> opportunity<00:07:06.669> to<00:07:07.539> pick

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
have quite a lot of opportunity to pick

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.999 
have quite a lot of opportunity to pick
you<00:07:08.169> off<00:07:08.550> unless<00:07:09.550> you're<00:07:10.389> being<00:07:10.629> lucky<00:07:11.020> as<00:07:11.229> why

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:12.009 
you off unless you're being lucky as why

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:13.920 
you off unless you're being lucky as why
and<00:07:12.340> you're<00:07:12.460> rolling<00:07:12.669> very<00:07:13.000> well<00:07:13.330> and<00:07:13.599> you're

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
and you're rolling very well and you're

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.080 
and you're rolling very well and you're
ahead<00:07:14.169> in<00:07:14.319> the<00:07:14.409> race<00:07:14.590> but<00:07:15.460> you<00:07:15.580> have<00:07:15.759> to<00:07:15.940> bear

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:16.090 
ahead in the race but you have to bear

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.469 
ahead in the race but you have to bear
in<00:07:16.270> mind<00:07:16.449> that<00:07:16.719> as<00:07:17.020> a<00:07:17.289> long-term<00:07:17.800> strategy

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
in mind that as a long-term strategy

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.369 
in mind that as a long-term strategy
you're<00:07:19.479> not<00:07:19.599> going<00:07:19.750> to<00:07:19.810> be<00:07:19.900> lucky<00:07:20.080> all<00:07:20.259> the

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:20.379 
you're not going to be lucky all the

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:22.830 
you're not going to be lucky all the
time<00:07:20.680> so<00:07:21.129> you<00:07:21.190> need<00:07:21.430> better<00:07:22.030> resources<00:07:22.719> at

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 
time so you need better resources at

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.839 
time so you need better resources at
your<00:07:22.870> disposal<00:07:23.099> so<00:07:24.099> what<00:07:24.250> can<00:07:24.340> we<00:07:24.430> do<00:07:24.610> how

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:24.849 
your disposal so what can we do how

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.449 
your disposal so what can we do how
