00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.620 
thing and I tried to come in different
this<00:03:16.370> year<00:03:16.640> but<00:03:16.820> we<00:03:16.940> can<00:03:17.060> get<00:03:17.180> off<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.450> good

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
this year but we can get off to a good

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.790 
this year but we can get off to a good
start<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.050> can<00:03:18.230> get<00:03:18.320> off<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:18.620> good<00:03:18.739> start

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
start and I can get off to a good start

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.920 
start and I can get off to a good start
I<00:03:19.220> don't<00:03:19.370> think<00:03:19.730> I've<00:03:19.880> seen<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:20.180> as<00:03:20.480> quick<00:03:20.750> as

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
I don't think I've seen you as quick as

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.080 
I don't think I've seen you as quick as
you<00:03:21.080> are<00:03:21.260> since<00:03:21.890> maybe<00:03:22.280> your<00:03:22.520> rookie<00:03:22.820> year<00:03:22.940> and

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
you are since maybe your rookie year and

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.090 
you are since maybe your rookie year and
maybe<00:03:23.239> not<00:03:23.420> even<00:03:23.480> then<00:03:23.870> yeah<00:03:24.500> because<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.920> the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
maybe not even then yeah because of the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.580 
maybe not even then yeah because of the
fact<00:03:25.370> that<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.640> weight<00:03:25.820> and<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:27.050> growing<00:03:27.290> is

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
fact that the weight and the growing is

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.360 
fact that the weight and the growing is
gone<00:03:27.800> finally

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
gone finally

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.280 
gone finally
but<00:03:29.879> I<00:03:29.909> think<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.330> weight<00:03:30.510> has<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.720> lot<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.019> do

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
but I think the weight has a lot to do

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.649 
but I think the weight has a lot to do
with<00:03:31.409> that<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.640> said<00:03:32.700> when<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.480> get

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
with that and like I said when you get

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.530 
with that and like I said when you get
into<00:03:33.870> number<00:03:34.379> 10<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.950> 11<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.299> change

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
into number 10 and 11 you have to change

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.449 
into number 10 and 11 you have to change
your<00:03:37.170> thinking<00:03:37.379> and<00:03:37.739> weight<00:03:37.890> you<00:03:38.040> come<00:03:38.250> into

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
your thinking and weight you come into

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.940 
your thinking and weight you come into
training<00:03:38.760> camp<00:03:39.290> training<00:03:40.290> camp<00:03:40.470> any<00:03:40.680> good<00:03:40.830> in
