00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
here there's a a resonating piece in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.700 
here there's a a resonating piece in
here<00:02:13.790> that's<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.330> include<00:02:14.720> specific<00:02:14.870> pitches

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
here that's to include specific pitches

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.890 
here that's to include specific pitches

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
and this is a whole different ballgame

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.080 
and this is a whole different ballgame
it's<00:02:18.350> not<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> heavy<00:02:19.100> cap<00:02:19.490> it's<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.850> whole

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
different thing and we will go ahead and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.060 
different thing and we will go ahead and
explain<00:02:22.400> these<00:02:22.910> in<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.450> video<00:02:23.750> about<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.650> maxi

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
explain these in a video about the maxi

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.520 
explain these in a video about the maxi
flappers<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:26.120> these<00:02:26.300> are<00:02:26.480> also<00:02:26.750> on<00:02:27.200> this

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
flappers but these are also on this

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.770 
flappers but these are also on this
fantastic<00:02:28.130> trumpet<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.270> the<00:02:29.390> other<00:02:29.510> thing

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
fantastic trumpet and the other thing

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.840 
fantastic trumpet and the other thing
that<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.140> scent<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.590> did<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.130> he<00:02:31.340> put<00:02:31.640> a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
that the scent they did is he put a

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.510 
that the scent they did is he put a
trigger<00:02:32.360> here<00:02:32.720> for<00:02:33.320> your<00:02:33.470> first<00:02:33.740> valve<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.400> it

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
trigger here for your first valve so it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.990 
trigger here for your first valve so it
makes<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.209> easier<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:37.310> ahead<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:37.640> activate

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
makes it easier to go ahead and activate

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.850 
makes it easier to go ahead and activate
your<00:02:38.180> tuning<00:02:38.690> for<00:02:38.900> specific<00:02:39.350> notes<00:02:39.620> that

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
your tuning for specific notes that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.430 
your tuning for specific notes that
involve<00:02:40.190> first<00:02:40.490> valve<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.840> viciente<00:02:42.380> is

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
involve first valve but viciente is

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.620 
involve first valve but viciente is
design<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:43.430> instrument<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.209> maxi

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
design of this instrument the maxi

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.949 
design of this instrument the maxi
clapper<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.320> whole<00:02:45.530> package<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.250> just

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
clapper is the whole package is just

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.280 
clapper is the whole package is just
incredible<00:02:48.020> so<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.980> upper<00:02:49.280> register<00:02:50.140> we<00:02:51.140> know

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
incredible so the upper register we know

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.620 
incredible so the upper register we know
about<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> bottom<00:02:51.830> register<00:02:52.450> expands<00:02:53.450> our

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
about the bottom register expands our

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.110 
about the bottom register expands our
range<00:02:54.200> downward<00:02:54.860> the<00:02:55.310> upper<00:02:55.459> register<00:02:55.730> is

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
range downward the upper register is

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:04.759 
range downward the upper register is
absolutely<00:02:56.630> fantastic<00:02:57.410> on<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.740> one

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.880 

it's<00:03:05.769> just<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.730> kantak<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.900> sound<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.590> get<00:03:08.709> out

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
it's just a kantak the sound you get out
