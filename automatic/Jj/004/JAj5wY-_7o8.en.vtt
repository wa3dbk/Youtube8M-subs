00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
see down this way the creek really gets

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.900 
see down this way the creek really gets
pretty<00:00:48.149> pretty<00:00:48.690> deep<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.520> an<00:00:50.670> area

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
let me see if I can go ahead and pick

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:35.690 
let me see if I can go ahead and pick
this<00:02:23.459> thing<00:02:23.520> up<00:02:32.269> little<00:02:33.269> bottle<00:02:34.670> certainly<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
this thing up little bottle certainly a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.460 
this thing up little bottle certainly a
period<00:02:36.690> bottle<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.810> makes<00:02:40.019> two<00:02:40.260> nice

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
period bottle and that makes two nice

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.280 
period bottle and that makes two nice
bottles<00:02:40.950> for<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.190> day<00:02:43.220> okay<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.080> my

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
bottles for the day okay this is my

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.100 
bottles for the day okay this is my
first<00:02:46.650> decent<00:02:47.069> find<00:02:47.610> with<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.420> metal

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
first decent find with the metal

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.860 
first decent find with the metal
detector<00:02:49.140> today<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.510> looks<00:02:51.690> like<00:02:51.840> a

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
detector today so it looks like a

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.920 
detector today so it looks like a
three-ring<00:02:52.230> minie<00:02:52.680> ball<00:02:53.420> based<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.750> white

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
three-ring minie ball based on the white

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.570 
three-ring minie ball based on the white
color<00:02:55.350> probably<00:02:55.920> hasn't<00:02:56.100> been<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.549> water

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
color probably hasn't been in the water

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.380 
color probably hasn't been in the water
that<00:02:57.060> long<00:02:59.480> it's<00:03:00.480> tough<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.930> see<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
that long it's tough to see it with the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.270 
that long it's tough to see it with the
camera<00:03:04.110> though<00:03:04.769> my<00:03:04.890> eyes<00:03:04.920> there<00:03:05.310> we<00:03:05.519> go

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.460 

yep<00:03:09.940> three-ring<00:03:10.540> miniball<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:13.230> maybe<00:03:14.230> there's

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
yep three-ring miniball so maybe there's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.160 
yep three-ring miniball so maybe there's
better<00:03:14.650> things<00:03:14.740> to<00:03:15.070> come<00:03:18.720> well<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.900> hadn't

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
better things to come well it hadn't

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.620 
better things to come well it hadn't
been<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.290> great<00:03:20.680> day<00:03:20.920> for<00:03:21.280> good<00:03:21.460> finds<00:03:21.850> with<00:03:22.330> the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
been a great day for good finds with the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.800 
been a great day for good finds with the
metal<00:03:23.410> detector<00:03:24.000> hitting<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.060> lot<00:03:25.210> of<00:03:25.270> pockets

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
metal detector hitting a lot of pockets

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.960 
metal detector hitting a lot of pockets
full<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.140> modern<00:03:27.100> bullets<00:03:27.460> and<00:03:27.640> those<00:03:27.760> give

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
full of modern bullets and those give

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.810 
full of modern bullets and those give
you<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.150> good<00:03:28.360> signal<00:03:28.840> but<00:03:29.340> that's<00:03:30.340> been<00:03:30.580> about

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
you a good signal but that's been about

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.300 
you a good signal but that's been about
it<00:03:30.880> besides<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.630> one<00:03:31.840> minie<00:03:32.140> ball<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.770> some

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
it besides that one minie ball and some

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.940 
it besides that one minie ball and some
other<00:03:33.490> pieces<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:34.060> trash<00:03:34.330> so<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:35.560> guess<00:03:35.800> I'm

a<00:04:44.010> half<00:04:44.580> dime<00:04:45.530> let<00:04:46.530> me<00:04:46.680> turn<00:04:46.890> off<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.280> camera

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
a half dime let me turn off the camera

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.130 
a half dime let me turn off the camera
and<00:04:47.730> take<00:04:48.000> a<00:04:48.030> look<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.420> get<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.690> date<00:04:48.900> looks

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
condition and it's in 1858 I don't see

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.110 
condition and it's in 1858 I don't see
the<00:05:00.660> mint<00:05:00.900> mark<00:05:01.110> on<00:05:01.380> it<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:02.070> with<00:05:02.640> that<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:02.880> think

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
the mint mark on it so with that I think

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.370 
the mint mark on it so with that I think
I'm<00:05:03.450> on<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.600> call<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.140> day<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:04.770> here<00:05:05.100> time
