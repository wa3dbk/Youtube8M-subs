well<00:00:00.210> as<00:00:00.299> far<00:00:00.510> as<00:00:00.539> a<00:00:00.630> trigger<00:00:00.900> it<00:00:01.350> could<00:00:01.560> be

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
well as far as a trigger it could be

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.320 
well as far as a trigger it could be
that<00:00:02.040> that's<00:00:02.340> something<00:00:02.550> triggered<00:00:03.060> it<00:00:03.149> but

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
that that's something triggered it but

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.610 
that that's something triggered it but
in<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.629> vast<00:00:03.840> majority<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.380> these<00:00:04.560> cases

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
in the vast majority of these cases

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.010 
in the vast majority of these cases
there's<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.400> pattern<00:00:05.640> of<00:00:05.879> tyvek<00:00:06.180> domestic

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
there's a pattern of tyvek domestic

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.419 
there's a pattern of tyvek domestic
violence<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.040> something<00:00:08.250> that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
violence that this is something that

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.970 
violence that this is something that
typically<00:00:08.760> act<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.900> acted<00:00:10.230> out<00:00:10.349> over<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> course

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
typically act is acted out over a course

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.770 
typically act is acted out over a course
of<00:00:11.130> years<00:00:11.490> sometimes<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.360> under<00:00:12.750> the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
of years sometimes it's under the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.509 
of years sometimes it's under the
surface<00:00:13.049> where<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.530> can't<00:00:13.740> actually<00:00:13.950> see<00:00:14.400> it

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
surface where you can't actually see it

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.220 
surface where you can't actually see it
are<00:00:14.700> people<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.330> community<00:00:15.690> don't<00:00:15.929> see<00:00:16.139> it

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
are people in the community don't see it

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.529 
are people in the community don't see it
but<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.859> victims<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.609> feel<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.119> every<00:00:18.510> day

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
but the victims of it feel it every day

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.810 
but the victims of it feel it every day
so<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.380> probably<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.890> continuing<00:00:20.609> pattern

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
so it's probably a continuing pattern

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.269 
so it's probably a continuing pattern
over<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> years<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.560> just<00:00:22.800> didn't<00:00:23.130> know

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
over the years that we just didn't know

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.830 
over the years that we just didn't know
about<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.550> mean<00:00:23.850> given<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> fact<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.630> there's

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
about I mean given the fact that there's

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.970 
about I mean given the fact that there's
a<00:00:24.930> history<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.800> particular

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
a history in this particular

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.670 
a history in this particular
relationship<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.570> fact<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.199> ended

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
relationship and the fact that it ended

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.490 
relationship and the fact that it ended
so<00:00:28.740> violently<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.849> probably<00:00:30.720> didn't<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.349> go

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
so violently it probably didn't just go

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.310 
so violently it probably didn't just go
from<00:00:31.710> zero<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.430> 60<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.329> one<00:00:33.630> second<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
from zero to 60 in one second it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.549 
from zero to 60 in one second it
probably<00:00:35.100> built<00:00:35.370> up<00:00:35.670> over<00:00:35.880> time<00:00:36.410> it's<00:00:37.410> just

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
probably built up over time it's just

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
probably built up over time it's just
one<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> those<00:00:38.340> tragic<00:00:39.270> things<00:00:39.510> that

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
one of those tragic things that

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.990 
one of those tragic things that
unfortunately<00:00:40.410> there<00:00:40.739> was<00:00:40.860> no<00:00:41.100> intervention

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
unfortunately there was no intervention

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940 
unfortunately there was no intervention
but<00:00:42.510> that's<00:00:42.989> why<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.440> need<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> talk<00:00:43.890> about

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
but that's why we need to talk about

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.290 
but that's why we need to talk about
this<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.579> that's<00:00:44.789> why<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.120> need<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
this more that's why we need to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.200 
this more that's why we need to
encourage<00:00:45.690> women<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.399> seek<00:00:47.399> services<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:48.059> need

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
encourage women to seek services we need

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
encourage women to seek services we need
to<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.570> services<00:00:49.110> available<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.829> them<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to have services available for them to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.540 
to have services available for them to
get<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.050> violent<00:00:52.050> domestic<00:00:52.680> situations

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
get out of violent domestic situations

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
get out of violent domestic situations
so<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.820> they<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> place<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.690> go<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.260> I'm

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
so that they have a place to go and I'm

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
so that they have a place to go and I'm
just<00:00:55.620> curious<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.579> there<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
just curious if there if there is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.849 
just curious if there if there is
concern<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.079> think<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.440> people<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
concern you think what people that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.590 
concern you think what people that
report<00:00:59.250> whether<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.300> they'll<00:01:00.480> be

I've worked a lot with an agency killed

collaborate with the college bridge

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.969 
collaborate with the college bridge
academy<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.479> provide<00:01:15.810> services<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.530> so

there<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.340> been<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.729> number<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:18.060> stories<00:01:18.390> from

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
there have been a number of stories from

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.399 
there have been a number of stories from
women<00:01:18.990> who<00:01:19.040> didn't<00:01:20.040> report<00:01:20.460> because<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:22.229> was

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
women who didn't report because it was

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.530 
women who didn't report because it was
going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.710> shameful<00:01:23.159> about<00:01:23.369> them<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.330> was

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
going to be shameful about them it was

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.940 
going to be shameful about them it was
going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.930> an<00:01:25.110> embarrassment<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
going to be an embarrassment for the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.420 
going to be an embarrassment for the
family<00:01:26.460> they<00:01:27.030> were<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:28.470> fear<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> suffering

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
family they were in fear of suffering

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.550 
family they were in fear of suffering
repercussions<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> fame

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
repercussions so it's not just the fame

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.190 
repercussions so it's not just the fame
of<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.829> fame<00:01:32.280> adds<00:01:32.549> another<00:01:32.880> layer<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.750> but

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
of it fame adds another layer to it but

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.870 
of it fame adds another layer to it but
I<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.290> part<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> syndrome<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.310> being<00:01:35.670> in

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I think part of the syndrome of being in

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.469 
I think part of the syndrome of being in
a<00:01:36.240> domestic<00:01:36.509> violence<00:01:37.220> relationship<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
a domestic violence relationship is that

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.030 
a domestic violence relationship is that
there's<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.869> much<00:01:39.990> secrecy<00:01:40.200> there's<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.920> much

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
there's so much secrecy there's so much

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
fault well I think over the over the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.380 
fault well I think over the over the
decades<00:02:15.750> we've<00:02:16.050> seen<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.770> law<00:02:17.220> enforcement

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
decades we've seen a law enforcement

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.720 
decades we've seen a law enforcement
change<00:02:18.390> in<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.050> country<00:02:19.110> in<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.100> when

change in this country in that when
there<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:22.470> know<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.860> an<00:02:23.490> allegation<00:02:24.030> of

there is a you know a an allegation of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.780 
there is a you know a an allegation of
domestic<00:02:24.810> violence<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.440> they<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
domestic violence that they there the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.600 
domestic violence that they there the
the<00:02:27.180> officers<00:02:28.080> have<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.710> make<00:02:28.980> an<00:02:29.100> arrest<00:02:29.310> they

the officers have to make an arrest they

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.150 
the officers have to make an arrest they
have<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:30.120> at<00:02:30.540> least<00:02:30.930> get<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.380> person<00:02:31.590> away

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
have to at least get the person away

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.820 
have to at least get the person away
from<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.820> victim<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.840> they<00:02:34.050> can<00:02:34.350> you

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
from the victim so that they can you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.860 
from the victim so that they can you
know<00:02:34.860> they<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.490> protect<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:36.030> victim<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.840> I

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
know they can protect that victim so I

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.410 
know they can protect that victim so I
think<00:02:37.020> that<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:38.090> institutionally<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.120> think

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
think that that institutionally I think

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.210 
think that that institutionally I think
we<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.620> course<00:02:40.830> there's<00:02:41.040> going<00:02:41.130> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
we have and of course there's going to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.740 
we have and of course there's going to
be<00:02:41.280> some<00:02:41.550> backlash<00:02:42.120> there's<00:02:42.510> going<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> be

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
be some backlash there's going to be

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.450 
be some backlash there's going to be
people<00:02:42.930> who<00:02:43.380> take<00:02:43.560> advantage<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.220> or

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
people who take advantage of that or

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.430 
people who take advantage of that or
make<00:02:44.610> false<00:02:44.850> claims<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:45.810> forth<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
make false claims and so forth but the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.740 
make false claims and so forth but the
vast<00:02:46.590> majority<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:47.190> them<00:02:47.400> are<00:02:47.580> making<00:02:48.540> claims

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
vast majority of them are making claims

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.420 
vast majority of them are making claims
because<00:02:48.990> they're<00:02:49.470> at<00:02:49.680> risk<00:02:50.010> they're<00:02:50.340> in

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
because they're at risk they're in

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.520 
because they're at risk they're in
danger<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.270> think<00:02:51.480> society<00:02:51.840> has<00:02:52.200> moved

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
danger so I think society has moved

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.230 
danger so I think society has moved
forward<00:02:52.680> but<00:02:53.010> there<00:02:53.190> are<00:02:53.370> always<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.210> be

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
forward but there are always going to be

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.330 
forward but there are always going to be
people<00:02:54.510> who<00:02:54.960> latch<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.650> sort<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
people who latch on to sort of the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.430 
people who latch on to sort of the
extreme<00:02:56.760> case<00:02:57.030> where<00:02:57.390> either<00:02:57.810> somebody<00:02:58.230> takes

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
extreme case where either somebody takes

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.740 
extreme case where either somebody takes
advantage<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.040> system<00:02:59.250> or<00:02:59.730> somebody<00:03:00.210> you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
advantage of the system or somebody you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.500 
advantage of the system or somebody you
know<00:03:00.870> basically<00:03:01.290> cries<00:03:02.280> wolf<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.940> didn't

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
know basically cries wolf and didn't

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.160 
know basically cries wolf and didn't
really<00:03:03.950> need<00:03:04.950> assistance<00:03:05.910> but<00:03:06.420> used<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.960> to

unfortunately that happens but the vast

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.340 
unfortunately that happens but the vast
majority<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.690> people<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.080> take<00:03:13.200> advantage
