all right so tell me about this is that

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.960 
all right so tell me about this is that
the<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.740> lower<00:01:21.950> bunk<00:01:22.250> but<00:01:22.430> underneath<00:01:22.670> is

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
the the lower bunk but underneath is

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.850 
the the lower bunk but underneath is
where<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.240> clean<00:01:23.480> power<00:01:23.690> system<00:01:24.080> is<00:01:24.230> right

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
where the clean power system is right

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.010 
where the clean power system is right
this<00:01:25.070> truck<00:01:25.310> is<00:01:25.340> equipped<00:01:25.580> with<00:01:25.850> the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
this truck is equipped with the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.570 
this truck is equipped with the
integrated<00:01:27.020> clean<00:01:27.320> power<00:01:27.530> system<00:01:28.040> mm-hmm

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
integrated clean power system mm-hmm

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.170 
integrated clean power system mm-hmm
which<00:01:28.760> is<00:01:28.940> our<00:01:29.060> battery<00:01:29.270> based<00:01:30.880> anti<00:01:31.880> idle

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
which is our battery based anti idle

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.270 
which is our battery based anti idle
solution<00:01:32.630> okay<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:33.440> this<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.770> actually<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
solution okay so this is actually the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.660 
solution okay so this is actually the
cool<00:01:34.460> pack<00:01:34.730> that<00:01:35.740> holds<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.920> cold<00:01:37.220> energy

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
cool pack that holds that cold energy

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.210 
cool pack that holds that cold energy
then<00:01:38.360> when<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.660> engine<00:01:38.960> is<00:01:39.050> shut<00:01:39.290> off<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.979> fan

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
then when the engine is shut off the fan

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.430 
then when the engine is shut off the fan
blows<00:01:40.640> over<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.240> cool<00:01:41.479> pack<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:42.020> help<00:01:42.200> keep

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
blows over that cool pack to help keep

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.280 
blows over that cool pack to help keep
the<00:01:42.590> bunk<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.840> sleeping<00:01:44.840> space<00:01:45.050> cool

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
the bunk and the sleeping space cool

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.810 
the bunk and the sleeping space cool
okay

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.270 

so<00:01:51.820> that's

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
so that's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.830 
so that's
upper<00:01:52.490> bunk<00:01:52.670> attaches<00:01:53.240> with<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:53.570> like<00:01:53.659> a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
upper bunk attaches with it's like a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.399 
upper bunk attaches with it's like a
seatbelt<00:01:54.650> right<00:01:55.100> that's<00:01:55.460> right<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:57.170> comes

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
seatbelt right that's right so it comes

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.120 
seatbelt right that's right so it comes
down<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:59.180> can<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.590> lights<00:02:00.890> up

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
down and then you can the lights up

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.630 
down and then you can the lights up
there

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
there

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.280 
there
those<00:02:01.940> have<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.119> little<00:02:02.299> touch<00:02:02.479> pushes<00:02:03.020> right

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
those have a little touch pushes right

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.499 
those have a little touch pushes right
that's<00:02:03.890> right<00:02:04.340> okay<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:05.060> makes<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.330> nice<00:02:05.450> and

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
that's right okay it makes it nice and

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.270 
that's right okay it makes it nice and
convenient<00:02:05.900> for<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.290> upper<00:02:06.500> bunk<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.070> the
