once we have the basic shape roughed out

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.889 
once we have the basic shape roughed out
we'll<00:01:58.039> switch<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.310> our<00:01:58.549> ez<00:01:58.789> finisher<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.539> use

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
we'll switch to our ez finisher and use

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.690 
we'll switch to our ez finisher and use
the<00:02:00.079> round<00:02:00.320> cutter<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.890> create<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.280> outside

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.959 
curve of our bowl the EZ finisher makes
it<00:02:06.259> easy<00:02:06.439> for<00:02:06.590> us<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:07.039> blend<00:02:07.340> our<00:02:07.490> bowl<00:02:07.700> into

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969

it easy for us to blend our bowl into
the<00:02:08.149> rim<00:02:12.069> now<00:02:13.069> we'll<00:02:13.310> clean<00:02:13.489> up<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.730> bottom

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910

the rim now we'll clean up the bottom
and<00:02:14.209> slightly<00:02:14.569> undercut<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.349> so<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.620> will<00:02:15.800> sit

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
and slightly undercut it so it will sit

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
cut down on our sanding later finally we

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.160 
cut down on our sanding later finally we
add<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.730> little<00:02:43.030> shoulder<00:02:43.359> cut<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.840> make<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.109> a

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
we use the easy detailer to put a taper

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.860 
we use the easy detailer to put a taper
on<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.310> tenon<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.819> match<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.269> jaws<00:02:57.510> on<00:02:57.720> our
