00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
you see this really is more like a full

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.540 
you see this really is more like a full
computer<00:02:25.020> running<00:02:25.410> Android<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.130> has<00:02:26.250> an<00:02:26.370> SD

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
card slot USB Jack's on it so looking to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.520 
card slot USB Jack's on it so looking to
do<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> lot<00:02:30.420> more<00:02:30.450> than<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:31.110> streaming

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
do a lot more than just a streaming

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.350 
do a lot more than just a streaming
stick<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:32.490> really<00:02:32.760> want<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:32.970> see<00:02:33.120> how<00:02:33.240> this

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
stick but we really want to see how this

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.300 
stick but we really want to see how this
operates<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.260> let's<00:02:34.440> hook<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:34.710> up<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.130> TV

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
operates so let's hook this up to the TV

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.910 
operates so let's hook this up to the TV
and<00:02:35.670> see<00:02:36.030> how<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.270> goes<00:02:36.420> all<00:02:37.380> right<00:02:37.500> real<00:02:37.680> quick

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
and see how it goes all right real quick

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.560 
and see how it goes all right real quick
before<00:02:38.070> we<00:02:38.280> get<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.640> setup<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> TV<00:02:39.390> but

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
before we get to the setup on the TV but

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
before we get to the setup on the TV but
this<00:02:39.750> step<00:02:39.990> might<00:02:40.170> be<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> little<00:02:40.410> bit

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
this step might be a little bit

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
this step might be a little bit
confusing<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.130> people<00:02:41.400> what<00:02:42.210> you<00:02:42.330> need<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.600> do

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
confusing for people what you need to do

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.910 
confusing for people what you need to do
when<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.930> first<00:02:43.110> get<00:02:43.320> this<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.770> the
