happen on their own here and you can
start<00:01:46.649> matching<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.509> different<00:01:48.509> things<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
start matching up different things and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.990 
start matching up different things and
starts<00:01:49.200> making<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> domino<00:01:50.369> effect<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
starts making like a domino effect so it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.969 
starts making like a domino effect so it
really<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> challenging<00:01:52.049> game<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.560> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
really is a challenging game that you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:53.960 
really is a challenging game that you
kind<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> want<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> make<00:01:53.579> things<00:01:53.729> fall

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
kind of want to make things fall

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.510 
kind of want to make things fall
strategically<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.280> more

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
strategically so that you get more

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.950 
strategically so that you get more
points<00:01:56.790> overall<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.810> i

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
points overall so you can see that i

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.380 
points overall so you can see that i
move<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.399> turns<00:01:59.790> out<00:01:59.909> that<00:01:59.969> domino

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
move that and it turns out that domino

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.789 
move that and it turns out that domino
effect<00:02:00.630> again<00:02:00.840> gets<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.259> crazy<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.560> again

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
effect again gets really crazy and again

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.859 
effect again gets really crazy and again
you're<00:02:01.979> you're<00:02:02.159> battling<00:02:02.670> time<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.450> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you're you're battling time here so you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.120 
you're you're battling time here so you
don't<00:02:04.020> want<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> stop<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.500> want<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> keep<00:02:04.950> on

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
don't want to stop you want to keep on

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.139 
don't want to stop you want to keep on
going<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.549> see<00:02:05.640> i<00:02:05.670> got<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> big<00:02:06.030> one

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
going there you see i got a big one

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.670 
going there you see i got a big one
there<00:02:06.360> got<00:02:06.869> another<00:02:07.079> big<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.350> there<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
there got another big one there and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680 
there got another big one there and
again<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.580> blocks<00:02:09.060> will<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.360> keep<00:02:09.509> on

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
again the blocks will just keep on

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
again the blocks will just keep on
coming<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.379> even<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.770> stuff<00:02:11.370> disappear<00:02:11.790> stuff

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
coming and even as stuff disappear stuff

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.260 
coming and even as stuff disappear stuff
keeps<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.360> falling<00:02:12.540> down

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
keeps on falling down

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.050 
keeps on falling down
so<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.510> just<00:02:13.630> keep<00:02:13.990> on<00:02:14.260> changing<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.520> tiles

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
so you just keep on changing the tiles

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.880 
so you just keep on changing the tiles
and<00:02:16.690> again<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.050> want<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.290> aim<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.620> get<00:02:17.740> those

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and again you want to aim to get those

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.020 
and again you want to aim to get those
skulls<00:02:18.190> out<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.490> way<00:02:18.580> because<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.940> get

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
skulls out of the way because you get

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.700 
skulls out of the way because you get
really<00:02:19.360> you're<00:02:19.720> going<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.990> get<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.110> major<00:02:20.410> bonus

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
really you're going to get a major bonus

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.890 
really you're going to get a major bonus
points<00:02:21.100> in<00:02:21.250> terms<00:02:21.790> of<00:02:21.910> your<00:02:22.060> score<00:02:22.420> there<00:02:22.600> so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
points in terms of your score there so

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.500 
points in terms of your score there so
again<00:02:23.800> eventually<00:02:24.610> obviously<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.270> harder

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
again eventually obviously the harder

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.450 
again eventually obviously the harder
gets<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.930> faster<00:02:26.320> than<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.620> know<00:02:26.710> time<00:02:26.980> stuff

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
gets the faster than you know time stuff

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.250 
gets the faster than you know time stuff
I<00:02:27.550> got<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> harder<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> ties<00:02:28.240> will<00:02:28.420> be<00:02:28.570> again

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
I got a harder the ties will be again

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.600 
I got a harder the ties will be again
run<00:02:29.410> easy<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:30.040> everything's<00:02:30.370> kind<00:02:30.580> of

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
run easy here so everything's kind of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.520 
run easy here so everything's kind of
falling<00:02:30.850> into<00:02:31.000> place<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.780> says<00:02:31.990> time<00:02:32.200> up<00:02:32.380> we

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
falling into place it says time up we

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.590 
falling into place it says time up we
can<00:02:32.620> play<00:02:32.800> again<00:02:32.920> or<00:02:33.130> quit<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.670> just<00:02:34.180> jumping

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
can play again or quit and just jumping

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.760 
can play again or quit and just jumping
let's<00:02:34.750> go<00:02:34.840> ahead<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.020> drop<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.380> hard<00:02:35.620> will

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
let's go ahead and drop at the hard will

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.900 
let's go ahead and drop at the hard will
clip<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.010> show<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.220> kind<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.520> difference

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
clip to show you kind of the difference

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.640 
clip to show you kind of the difference
you<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.750> it's<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:37.990> little<00:02:38.170> bit<00:02:38.260> i<00:02:38.290> would

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
you can see it's a little bit i would

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.930 
you can see it's a little bit i would
guess<00:02:38.800> faster<00:02:39.220> pace<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.700> little<00:02:39.850> bit

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
guess faster pace and a little bit

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.300 
guess faster pace and a little bit
harder<00:02:40.210> with<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.870> tiles<00:02:41.380> here<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.920> kind

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
harder with the tiles here so you kind

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.370 
harder with the tiles here so you kind
