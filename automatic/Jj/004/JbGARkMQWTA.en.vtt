00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
canceling out ambient noise although you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639

do<00:00:39.300> continue<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> hear<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> little<00:00:40.200> bit<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.410> hiss

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
do continue to hear a little bit of hiss

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.799 
do continue to hear a little bit of hiss
but<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.850> coming<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.629> full

for<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.070> moving<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.329> MDR<00:00:46.050> n<00:00:46.890> RBT

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
for that moving on we have the MDR n RBT

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.250 
for that moving on we have the MDR n RBT
now<00:00:48.000> they're<00:00:48.180> essentially<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.600> same<00:00:48.899> as<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
now they're essentially the same as the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.209 
now they're essentially the same as the
