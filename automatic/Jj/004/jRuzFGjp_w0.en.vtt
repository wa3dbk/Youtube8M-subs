familiar with my other brow tutorial

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.790 
familiar with my other brow tutorial
which<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.300> like<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.660> look<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.110> worst<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
which is like I look the worst in the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.710 
which is like I look the worst in the
world<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.729> want<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:02.970> talk<00:02:03.210> about<00:02:03.390> it

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
world and I don't want to talk about it

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.960 
world and I don't want to talk about it
but<00:02:04.229> where<00:02:04.410> I<00:02:04.440> also<00:02:04.770> trimmed<00:02:05.250> my<00:02:05.550> brow<00:02:05.759> with

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
but where I also trimmed my brow with

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.560 
but where I also trimmed my brow with
kitchen<00:02:06.330> scissors<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.580> there<00:02:08.910> there<00:02:09.390> are

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
kitchen scissors so there there are

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.270 
kitchen scissors so there there are
options<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.350> don't<00:02:10.500> have<00:02:10.619> small<00:02:10.890> scissors

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
options if you don't have small scissors

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.000 
options if you don't have small scissors
so<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.510> just<00:02:12.720> slide<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.350> right<00:02:13.380> in<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.440> I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
so I like just slide it right in and I

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.940 
so I like just slide it right in and I
just<00:02:17.040> try<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.519> keep<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.320> like<00:02:19.320> an<00:02:19.410> even<00:02:19.739> line

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
just try and keep it like an even line

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.430 
just try and keep it like an even line
so<00:02:20.670> using<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.120> brow<00:02:21.300> powder<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.019> really<00:02:22.320> good

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
so using a brow powder is a really good

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.350 
so using a brow powder is a really good
alternative<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.950> pencil<00:02:23.459> or<00:02:23.700> gel<00:02:23.730> when<00:02:24.269> you

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
alternative to pencil or gel when you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.090 
alternative to pencil or gel when you
want<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> little<00:02:24.810> bit<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.170> softer<00:02:25.650> look

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
want a little bit of a softer look

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.410 
want a little bit of a softer look
