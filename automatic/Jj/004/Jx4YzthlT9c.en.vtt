I can scroll cross and just look for

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
I can scroll cross and just look for
some<00:01:56.790> more<00:01:56.909> there's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.329> fair<00:01:57.719> few<00:01:57.899> objects<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
some more there's a fair few objects to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.660 
some more there's a fair few objects to
choose<00:01:58.619> from<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> mobile

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
choose from I just go with a mobile

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.090 
choose from I just go with a mobile
phone<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:02.119> you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.240> swipe<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:04.200> different

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
phone and you can swipe in different

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.419 
phone and you can swipe in different
ways<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.450> destroy<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> item<00:02:07.129> and<00:02:08.129> thinking<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
ways to destroy the item and thinking I

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.410 
ways to destroy the item and thinking I
should<00:02:08.580> change<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.940> background<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
should change the background of the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.119 
should change the background of the
earth<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.720> probably<00:02:10.259> quite<00:02:10.410> hard<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:10.950> I

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
earth is probably quite hard to see I

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.300 
earth is probably quite hard to see I
just<00:02:11.280> choose<00:02:11.489> quite

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
just choose quite

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.870 
just choose quite
normal<00:02:13.260> mellow<00:02:14.260> background<00:02:14.860> as<00:02:15.040> such<00:02:15.250> there

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
normal mellow background as such there

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.089 
normal mellow background as such there
you<00:02:15.940> go<00:02:16.030> that's<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.209> lot<00:02:16.360> better<00:02:19.260> yeah<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.500> if<00:02:21.010> I

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
you go that's a lot better yeah and if I

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.839 
you go that's a lot better yeah and if I
get<00:02:21.250> random<00:02:21.610> for<00:02:21.940> example<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:24.640> will<00:02:24.700> just

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
get random for example it will just

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.750 
get random for example it will just
shoot<00:02:25.060> at<00:02:25.209> random<00:02:25.540> objects<00:02:25.950> there's<00:02:26.950> no<00:02:27.160> frame

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
shoot at random objects there's no frame

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.460 
shoot at random objects there's no frame
rate<00:02:28.000> issues<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.510> I've<00:02:28.599> seen<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.019> far<00:02:29.050> I'm

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
rate issues that I've seen so far I'm

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.130 
rate issues that I've seen so far I'm
running<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> on<00:02:30.310> an<00:02:30.580> iPhone<00:02:31.000> 3GS<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.930> it's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
running it on an iPhone 3GS so it's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.870 
running it on an iPhone 3GS so it's
quite<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.650> fast<00:02:32.920> processor<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.640> don't<00:02:33.790> know

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
quite a fast processor so I don't know

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.729 
quite a fast processor so I don't know
how<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.120> handle<00:02:34.450> on<00:02:34.660> an<00:02:34.900> ipod<00:02:35.200> touch<00:02:35.410> for

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
how it handle on an ipod touch for

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.870 
how it handle on an ipod touch for
example<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.819> physics<00:02:37.180> are<00:02:37.300> quite<00:02:37.480> good

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
example but the physics are quite good

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.250 
example but the physics are quite good
like<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:39.970> said<00:02:40.030> no<00:02:40.330> frame<00:02:40.569> rate<00:02:40.750> issues<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:41.110> can

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
like I said no frame rate issues I can

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.190 
like I said no frame rate issues I can
tap<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:43.799> there's<00:02:44.799> no<00:02:44.920> frame<00:02:45.160> rate<00:02:45.370> issues<00:02:46.200> so

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
tap and there's no frame rate issues so

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.930 
tap and there's no frame rate issues so
there's<00:02:47.530> no<00:02:47.920> issues<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.310> I've<00:02:48.400> seen<00:02:48.549> as<00:02:48.790> of

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
there's no issues that I've seen as of

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.350 
there's no issues that I've seen as of
yet<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.160> quite<00:02:51.400> enjoy<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.880> application

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
yet and I quite enjoy this application

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.880 
yet and I quite enjoy this application
is<00:02:52.420> quite<00:02:52.630> fun<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.870> just<00:02:53.110> sit<00:02:53.290> there<00:02:53.410> too<00:02:53.560> quick

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
is quite fun to just sit there too quick

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.140 
is quite fun to just sit there too quick
keep<00:02:54.130> tapping<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.610> try<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.850> breathe<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.000> high

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
keep tapping to try and breathe a high

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.479 
keep tapping to try and breathe a high
school<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.690> would<00:02:56.170> see<00:02:56.410> how<00:02:56.560> get<00:02:56.890> really<00:02:57.220> boring

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
school I would see how get really boring

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.759 
school I would see how get really boring
and<00:02:57.819> monotonous<00:02:58.209> if<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.440> were<00:02:59.560> basically

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
and monotonous if you were basically

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.370 
and monotonous if you were basically
just<00:03:00.220> playing<00:03:00.519> for<00:03:01.120> nothing<00:03:01.510> but<00:03:02.140> it's<00:03:02.319> a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
just playing for nothing but it's a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.870 
just playing for nothing but it's a
great<00:03:02.590> little<00:03:02.680> feature<00:03:02.799> that<00:03:03.250> hope<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.580> faint

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
great little feature that hope and faint

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.789 
great little feature that hope and faint
is<00:03:04.120> enabled<00:03:04.630> so<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.840> can<00:03:05.080> go<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:05.739> the

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
is enabled so you can go for the

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.920 
is enabled so you can go for the
leaderboards<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:07.120> that's<00:03:07.299> basically<00:03:07.540> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
leaderboards so that's basically the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.140 
leaderboards so that's basically the
game<00:03:08.200> right<00:03:08.410> there<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.580> said<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.819> physics

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
game right there like I said the physics

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.370 
game right there like I said the physics
are<00:03:10.269> great<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:12.160> idea<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.489> simple<00:03:12.970> yet

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
are great the idea is simple yet

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.050 
are great the idea is simple yet
executed<00:03:14.380> quite<00:03:14.500> well<00:03:14.769> so<00:03:14.980> there's<00:03:15.580> no<00:03:15.700> issues

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
executed quite well so there's no issues

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.210 
executed quite well so there's no issues
that<00:03:16.180> i<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.420> find<00:03:16.630> with<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.870> game<00:03:17.070> for<00:03:18.070> what

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
that i can find with the game for what

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.349 
that i can find with the game for what
it<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.570> obviously<00:03:19.890> it's<00:03:20.890> not<00:03:21.120> going<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.209> be<00:03:22.329> a

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
it is obviously it's not going to be a

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.750 
it is obviously it's not going to be a
game<00:03:22.630> for<00:03:22.840> everyone<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:24.280> they<00:03:24.430> could<00:03:24.609> be<00:03:24.730> a

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
game for everyone and they could be a

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.190 
game for everyone and they could be a
few<00:03:25.090> different<00:03:25.780> features<00:03:26.140> added<00:03:26.620> for<00:03:27.070> example

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
few different features added for example

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.569 
few different features added for example
that<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.440> don't<00:03:29.650> know<00:03:29.739> maybe<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.069> could<00:03:30.310> take<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
that I don't know maybe you could take a

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.539 
that I don't know maybe you could take a
picture<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.329> an<00:03:31.480> object<00:03:32.160> with<00:03:33.160> your<00:03:33.310> camera

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
picture of an object with your camera

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.720 
picture of an object with your camera
and<00:03:33.850> then<00:03:34.450> maybe<00:03:34.920> enable<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.040> into<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.459> world

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
and then maybe enable it into this world

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.559 
and then maybe enable it into this world
and<00:03:36.970> then<00:03:37.230> destroy<00:03:38.230> whatever<00:03:39.359> they<00:03:40.359> could<00:03:40.420> be

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
and then destroy whatever they could be

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.420 
and then destroy whatever they could be
a<00:03:40.600> few<00:03:40.810> more<00:03:40.900> items<00:03:41.609> maybe<00:03:43.049> competitions

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
a few more items maybe competitions

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.650 
a few more items maybe competitions
against<00:03:45.430> people<00:03:45.819> online<00:03:45.940> where<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.510> got<00:03:46.630> to

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
against people online where you got to

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.920 
against people online where you got to
try<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.639> get<00:03:48.639> as<00:03:48.850> many<00:03:49.090> points<00:03:49.630> as<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.870> can

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
try and get as many points as you can

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.690 
try and get as many points as you can
but<00:03:52.930> apart<00:03:53.350> from<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.769> hardly<00:03:54.130> think<00:03:54.579> of

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
but apart from that I hardly think of

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.039 
but apart from that I hardly think of
anything<00:03:54.790> maybe<00:03:55.150> some<00:03:55.480> music<00:03:55.870> in<00:03:55.959> the

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
anything maybe some music in the

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.530 
anything maybe some music in the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
background there's not really that much

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.590 
background there's not really that much
they<00:03:59.079> could<00:03:59.230> be<00:03:59.319> added<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.769> game<00:03:59.950> like<00:04:00.100> this

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
so the idea is executed perfectly like I

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.490
