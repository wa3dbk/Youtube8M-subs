 and click here 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.079
 it's because of this feature 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.249
 remember here but I imagine if they are putting bmp file attack 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.039
 I'm not jealous of pgr. 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.910

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.180
 pictures may be that I change the 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.330
 I did not come here on foot and I failed 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.189
 drink the file 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.619

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.509
 otherwise confusing background of your theme 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:23.239

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.419
 wait while operating what is this 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.689
 in this phase the teams have to train 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:29.950
 then they fall apart 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.769
 seven countries 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.669

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.419

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.049

 Khomeini 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.929

 let's export operating 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.499
 the forró 6 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:06.639
 want 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.109

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.859
 you when you miss 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.549
 so until I decided homeless people 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.949
 So you're going to talk about expanding the dep 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.949
 the student act 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.979

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.360
 not only him and his brother were with the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.550
 You can not be changing yourselves. 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.099
 remembering that identifying 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.099
 be subject to not voting 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.450
 and if you are changing modifying system files 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.710
 say it's crazy to care 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.940
 Ricardo does the wrong thing by remembering that the system file can 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.940
 changing functionality 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.210
 willy country 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.979
 with which he gave his all if 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 so maybe you can bonus would know that you 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.870

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.860
 here also that several fighters of all here are cheering 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.900
 there in that barbie 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.900

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.870
 parish house 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.650
 this rumor 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.940
 had all this need to change gradually 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.379
 I put my 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.550
 quique too 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.810
 since Wednesday 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.570
 worked as if it could walk oms provoked of the exchange 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.490
 look here 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.680

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.080
 okazaki support you goals and making it will have hu 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.080
 Can you change what you 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:18.569
 is in the sights and make happy the russia exports to the changing modified u deserve 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.729
 you 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.469
 I remember what? 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.330
 have to modify with caution because as I said your file 

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.999
 the system 

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:31.939
 so if you already have everything right and I did not stay retail it will stay over or 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.300
 any less 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.599

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.419

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:43.120
 as I said there are several ways one of them is terrible in this program he 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.599
 is already a bit difficult but has other easier way that has already been showing 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.009
 ahead 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:50.230
 I say people 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.159
