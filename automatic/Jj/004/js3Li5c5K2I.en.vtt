ago<00:00:18.740> well<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.949> don't<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.520> did<00:00:20.730> settle<00:00:21.029> it

we<00:00:21.420> had<00:00:21.570> hoped<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.320> when<00:00:23.130> Brown

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400

versus Board of Education was decided it
was<00:00:25.710> hoped<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> would<00:00:26.580> lead<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
was hoped that that would lead to a

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.740 
was hoped that that would lead to a
race-neutral<00:00:29.060> society<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.510> no

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
race-neutral society in which we no

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.089 
race-neutral society in which we no
longer<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> think<00:00:31.529> about<00:00:31.710> these<00:00:31.859> matters

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
longer have to think about these matters

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
longer have to think about these matters
I<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:32.969> we've<00:00:33.090> learned<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> last<00:00:33.690> 50

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
I think we've learned in the last 50

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.049 
I think we've learned in the last 50
years<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:35.010> somewhat<00:00:35.340> naive<00:00:35.670> in

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
years that that was somewhat naive in

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.720 
years that that was somewhat naive in
fact<00:00:36.360> rather<00:00:37.290> than<00:00:37.620> moving<00:00:37.829> forward<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
fact rather than moving forward we have

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.880 
fact rather than moving forward we have
backtracked<00:00:39.180> since<00:00:39.809> those<00:00:39.989> early<00:00:40.020> days<00:00:40.320> after

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
backtracked since those early days after

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
backtracked since those early days after
we<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> situation<00:00:42.210> where<00:00:42.719> two-thirds

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
we now have a situation where two-thirds

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.229 
we now have a situation where two-thirds
of<00:00:43.379> african-american<00:00:44.250> children<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:45.059> living

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
of african-american children are living

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.430 
of african-american children are living
in<00:00:45.660> segregated<00:00:46.879> schools<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.050> what's<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
in segregated schools so what's going to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.010 
in segregated schools so what's going to
happen<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.829> these<00:00:49.920> two<00:00:50.100> cases<00:00:50.840> well<00:00:51.840> it's

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
happen with these two cases well it's

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600 
happen with these two cases well it's
hard<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.320> know<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.620> course<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.070> court<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.399> very

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
hard to know of course the court is very

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.439 
hard to know of course the court is very
evenly<00:00:53.969> divided<00:00:54.570> today's<00:00:55.199> oral<00:00:55.500> argument<00:00:55.920> was

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
evenly divided today's oral argument was

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.750 
evenly divided today's oral argument was
evidence<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:59.070> hopeful<00:00:59.609> at

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
evidence of that but I'm hopeful at

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.520 
evidence of that but I'm hopeful at
least<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> court<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.690> recognize<00:01:01.199> that

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
least that the court will recognize that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.060 
least that the court will recognize that
this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.550> relatively<00:01:03.030> easy<00:01:03.510> case

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
this is actually a relatively easy case

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.500 
this is actually a relatively easy case
because<00:01:05.070> these<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.369> voluntary<00:01:05.970> programs

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
because these are voluntary programs

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.719 
because these are voluntary programs
that<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.900> initiated<00:01:07.470> by<00:01:07.619> local<00:01:08.159> school

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that are initiated by local school

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.810 
that are initiated by local school
districts<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.390> thought<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.560> what

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
districts I thought that that's what

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.870 
districts I thought that that's what
conservatives<00:01:11.820> were<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.630> favor<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.520> our<00:01:14.520> local

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
conservatives were in favor of our local

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.219 
conservatives were in favor of our local
schools<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.540> these<00:01:15.720> kinds<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> decisions

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
schools to make these kinds of decisions

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.679 
schools to make these kinds of decisions
local<00:01:16.920> communities<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> decide<00:01:18.210> what's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
local communities to decide what's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120 
local communities to decide what's
important<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:19.979> each

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
important and what you know what each

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.039 
important and what you know what each
side<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.850> each<00:01:21.150> side<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.780> getting
