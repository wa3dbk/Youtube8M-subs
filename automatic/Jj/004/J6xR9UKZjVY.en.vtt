when you pull into a breadbox location

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.970 
when you pull into a breadbox location
you'll<00:03:46.750> see<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.959> be<00:03:47.169> clean<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.560> know<00:03:47.680> exactly

you'll see a be clean you know exactly

what you're going to get the free

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.140 
what you're going to get the free
vacuums<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.720> fast<00:03:49.959> watch<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:51.639> the<00:03:51.730> quality

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
vacuums the fast watch and the quality

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.479 
vacuums the fast watch and the quality
of<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.540> wash<00:03:52.859> well<00:03:53.859> I<00:03:53.889> think<00:03:54.130> there's<00:03:54.459> a

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
of the wash well I think there's a

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.670 
of the wash well I think there's a
stigma<00:03:54.669> that<00:03:54.910> goes<00:03:55.060> along<00:03:55.299> with<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:56.560> know<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
stigma that goes along with you know a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.470 
stigma that goes along with you know a
car<00:03:57.010> wash<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.700> is<00:03:57.819> associated<00:03:58.090> with<00:03:58.389> a

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
car wash that is associated with a

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.240 
car wash that is associated with a
convenience<00:03:58.900> store<00:03:59.049> I<00:03:59.079> think<00:03:59.440> that<00:03:59.620> there's<00:04:00.190> a

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
convenience store I think that there's a

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.620 
convenience store I think that there's a
lot<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.430> people<00:04:00.760> that<00:04:00.880> think<00:04:01.060> oh<00:04:01.239> that's<00:04:01.419> just

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
lot of people that think oh that's just

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.330 
lot of people that think oh that's just
a<00:04:01.750> car<00:04:01.959> wash<00:04:02.139> convenience<00:04:02.590> store<00:04:02.739> I<00:04:03.010> mean<00:04:03.160> I

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
a car wash convenience store I mean I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.220 
a car wash convenience store I mean I

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.949 
said just to convene stowable the car

gonna be is getting you through our wash
to<00:04:11.620> see<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:11.919> it's<00:04:12.069> different<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:13.290> 1990<00:04:14.290> we

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
to see that it's different in 1990 we

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.640 
to see that it's different in 1990 we
put<00:04:14.620> in<00:04:14.739> our<00:04:14.829> first<00:04:15.099> car<00:04:15.340> wash<00:04:15.609> it<00:04:16.599> was<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:17.019> first

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
put in our first car wash it was a first

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.190 
put in our first car wash it was a first
touchless<00:04:18.130> watch<00:04:18.400> we<00:04:18.780> put<00:04:19.780> in<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.139> the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
touchless watch we put in and the

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.830 
touchless watch we put in and the
technology<00:04:20.859> was<00:04:21.070> just<00:04:21.130> not<00:04:21.459> there<00:04:21.669> on<00:04:22.150> the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
technology was just not there on the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.110 
technology was just not there on the
on<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.590> touchless<00:04:24.160> wash<00:04:24.370> in<00:04:24.580> that<00:04:24.700> time<00:04:24.910> it

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
on the touchless wash in that time it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.629 
on the touchless wash in that time it
was<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:26.350> got<00:04:26.530> where<00:04:26.740> they<00:04:26.770> would<00:04:26.980> oxidize<00:04:27.160> the

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
was it got where they would oxidize the

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.220 
was it got where they would oxidize the
paint<00:04:27.850> on<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.090> red<00:04:28.240> card<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.840> wouldn't<00:04:29.050> clean

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
paint on the red card and wouldn't clean

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.320 
paint on the red card and wouldn't clean
a<00:04:29.260> white<00:04:29.530> car<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.280> we<00:04:30.400> really<00:04:30.760> just<00:04:31.000> had<00:04:31.300> a

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
a white car and so we really just had a

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.600 
a white car and so we really just had a
bad<00:04:31.510> experience<00:04:31.660> with<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.260> touch<00:04:32.500> with<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:33.430> was

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
bad experience with it touch with it was

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.659 
bad experience with it touch with it was
not<00:04:33.820> until<00:04:34.860> we<00:04:35.860> stalled<00:04:36.190> these<00:04:36.370> tunnel

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
not until we stalled these tunnel

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.140 
not until we stalled these tunnel
washers<00:04:37.000> come<00:04:37.210> through<00:04:37.650> with<00:04:38.650> this<00:04:38.830> soft<00:04:39.310> foam

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
washers come through with this soft foam

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.140 
washers come through with this soft foam
technology<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:42.250> we<00:04:42.370> really<00:04:42.730> started<00:04:43.030> taking

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
technology that we really started taking

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.379 
technology that we really started taking
a<00:04:43.330> look<00:04:43.450> at<00:04:43.690> friction<00:04:44.110> washes<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:45.389> really

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
a look at friction washes and really

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.870 
a look at friction washes and really
started<00:04:46.660> giving<00:04:46.810> them<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.960> hard<00:04:47.080> look<00:04:47.350> and

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
started giving them a hard look and

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.770 
started giving them a hard look and
purchased<00:04:48.880> our<00:04:49.030> first<00:04:49.270> one<00:04:49.480> this<00:04:49.870> year<00:04:50.169> I

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
purchased our first one this year I

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.110 
purchased our first one this year I
think<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:53.139> traditional<00:04:53.440> NBA<00:04:53.860> car<00:04:54.610> wash<00:04:54.820> is

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
think the traditional NBA car wash is

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.240 
think the traditional NBA car wash is
tied<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.570> convenience<00:04:56.080> store<00:04:56.139> for<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:56.979> most

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
tied to a convenience store for the most

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.850 
tied to a convenience store for the most
part<00:04:57.580> is<00:04:57.850> pretty<00:04:58.150> much<00:04:58.270> dead<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.600> think<00:04:59.020> there

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
part is pretty much dead I think there

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.400 
part is pretty much dead I think there
are<00:04:59.889> some<00:05:00.160> outlying<00:05:00.520> areas<00:05:00.970> or<00:05:01.150> some

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
are some outlying areas or some

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.750 
are some outlying areas or some
particular<00:05:02.410> instances<00:05:02.950> where<00:05:03.190> they<00:05:03.340> do<00:05:03.400> all

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
particular instances where they do all

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.760 
particular instances where they do all
right<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.630> we'll<00:05:04.780> continue<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.200> do<00:05:05.380> okay

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
right and we'll continue to do okay

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.890 
right and we'll continue to do okay
especially<00:05:06.310> if<00:05:06.610> they've<00:05:06.760> if<00:05:07.000> they've<00:05:07.210> kept<00:05:07.720> up

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
especially if they've if they've kept up

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.860 
especially if they've if they've kept up
with<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.080> latest<00:05:08.200> technology<00:05:08.639> but<00:05:09.639> I<00:05:10.180> think

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
with the latest technology but I think

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.610 
with the latest technology but I think
these<00:05:11.050> these<00:05:12.300> tunnel<00:05:13.300> washes<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.870> new<00:05:14.020> $3

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
these these tunnel washes the new $3

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.790 
these these tunnel washes the new $3
3-minute<00:05:15.330> washes<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.570> really<00:05:17.410> provide<00:05:17.770> the

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
3-minute washes that really provide the

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.420 
3-minute washes that really provide the
free<00:05:18.100> vacuums<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:18.729> the<00:05:19.889> quick<00:05:20.889> turnaround

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
free vacuums and the quick turnaround

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.460 
free vacuums and the quick turnaround
and<00:05:21.700> the<00:05:22.240> quality<00:05:22.660> of<00:05:22.750> wash<00:05:22.900> they're<00:05:23.139> giving

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
and the quality of wash they're giving

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.240 
and the quality of wash they're giving
is<00:05:23.560> really<00:05:23.880> taking<00:05:24.880> over<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.180> business<00:05:26.100> so<00:05:27.100> we

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
is really taking over the business so we

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.070 
is really taking over the business so we
have<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.729> make<00:05:27.850> a<00:05:27.880> competitive<00:05:28.419> response<00:05:28.539> we

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
have to make a competitive response we

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.600 
have to make a competitive response we
have<00:05:29.229> to<00:05:29.350> do<00:05:29.470> something<00:05:29.950> with<00:05:30.070> that<00:05:30.250> with<00:05:30.490> that

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
have to do something with that with that

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.360 
have to do something with that with that
real<00:05:30.789> estate<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:32.169> try<00:05:32.350> to<00:05:32.410> turn<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.830> trend

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
real estate to try to turn that trend

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.400 
real estate to try to turn that trend
around<00:05:33.520> and<00:05:34.000> we<00:05:34.090> think<00:05:34.360> with<00:05:34.539> with<00:05:35.020> our<00:05:35.169> car

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
around and we think with with our car

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.380 
around and we think with with our car
wash<00:05:35.650> scenarios<00:05:36.460> with<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.669> hen<00:05:36.850> bay<00:05:37.030> if<00:05:37.240> we

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
wash scenarios with the hen bay if we

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.640 
wash scenarios with the hen bay if we
can<00:05:37.539> get<00:05:37.690> a<00:05:37.720> piece<00:05:37.930> of<00:05:37.960> equipment<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.410> will

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
can get a piece of equipment that will

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.390 
can get a piece of equipment that will
give<00:05:39.100> a<00:05:39.130> comparable<00:05:39.820> quality<00:05:40.090> wash<00:05:41.400> obviously

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
give a comparable quality wash obviously

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.980 
give a comparable quality wash obviously
our<00:05:42.550> overhead<00:05:43.000> we<00:05:43.330> already<00:05:43.570> have<00:05:43.690> our<00:05:43.720> land

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
our overhead we already have our land

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.659 
our overhead we already have our land
cost<00:05:44.260> covered<00:05:44.620> all<00:05:44.740> overheads<00:05:45.130> a<00:05:45.250> lot<00:05:45.430> less

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
cost covered all overheads a lot less

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:46.920 
cost covered all overheads a lot less
and<00:05:45.850> then<00:05:45.940> we<00:05:46.030> don't<00:05:46.150> have<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.360> labor<00:05:46.660> piece

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
and then we don't have the labor piece

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.130 
and then we don't have the labor piece
to<00:05:47.140> have<00:05:47.260> to<00:05:47.440> get<00:05:47.710> full<00:05:47.890> with<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:49.660> those<00:05:49.930> do

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
to have to get full with that those do

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.840 
to have to get full with that those do
so<00:05:50.320> we<00:05:50.440> felt<00:05:50.680> like<00:05:50.710> that<00:05:51.010> we<00:05:51.160> can<00:05:51.370> offer<00:05:51.580> the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
so we felt like that we can offer the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.879 
so we felt like that we can offer the
same<00:05:52.060> quality<00:05:52.090> wash<00:05:52.660> at<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.080> lot<00:05:53.320> lower<00:05:53.500> price

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
same quality wash at a lot lower price

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.830 
same quality wash at a lot lower price
and<00:05:54.250> still<00:05:54.430> get<00:05:54.669> a<00:05:54.700> good<00:05:55.270> return

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
and still get a good return

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.659 
and still get a good return
yeah<00:05:56.470> we're<00:05:56.650> averaging<00:05:56.800> six<00:05:57.220> dollars<00:05:57.520> and

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
yeah we're averaging six dollars and

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.210 
yeah we're averaging six dollars and
