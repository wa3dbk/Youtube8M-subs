00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
your horsepower is something you need to

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.400 
your horsepower is something you need to
adjust<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.300> haven't<00:00:30.630> driven<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.170> a

adjust you if you haven't driven it in a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.799 
adjust you if you haven't driven it in a
little<00:00:31.679> while<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.820> yeah<00:00:32.940> there's<00:00:33.300> actually<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
little while so yeah there's actually a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
little while so yeah there's actually a
couple<00:00:34.170> tunnels<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.070> game<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.399> can

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
couple tunnels in this game that you can

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
couple tunnels in this game that you can
drive<00:00:35.910> through<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.660> sort<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.899> planned<00:00:37.110> out

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
drive through and I sort of planned out

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.549 
drive through and I sort of planned out
a<00:00:37.440> sort<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.739> tunnel<00:00:38.059> tunnel<00:00:39.059> look<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.960> wish

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
a sort of tunnel tunnel look I wish

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
a sort of tunnel tunnel look I wish
though<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.010> game<00:00:41.219> it'd<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.570> much

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
though in this game it'd be so much

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.819 
though in this game it'd be so much
easier<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.920> could<00:00:45.170> like<00:00:46.170> create<00:00:46.649> our<00:00:46.800> own

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
easier if we could like create our own

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.459 
easier if we could like create our own
races<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.640> create<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.120> waypoints<00:00:48.840> like

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
races just create like waypoints like

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.770 
races just create like waypoints like
multiple<00:00:49.890> waypoints<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.460> go<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:51.510> right

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
multiple waypoints to go to like right

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080 
multiple waypoints to go to like right
now<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.140> only<00:00:52.260> put<00:00:52.530> coke<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.730> says<00:00:53.879> go

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
now I can only put coke one just says go

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
now I can only put coke one just says go
here<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.739> put<00:00:55.890> those<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
here if I can put those in like a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.610 
here if I can put those in like a
certain<00:00:56.820> order<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.690> made<00:00:57.899> things<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.350> this

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
certain order it made things like this

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.970 
certain order it made things like this
so<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.489> easier<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.840> great<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.559> first<00:01:01.770> one

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
so much easier to be great the first one

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
so much easier to be great the first one
is<00:01:02.070> probably<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.460> longest<00:01:02.609> one<00:01:03.000> probably<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
is probably the longest one probably the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
is probably the longest one probably the
best<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.369> others<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:05.880> all<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
best one but the two others are all so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.690 
best one but the two others are all so
freakin<00:01:06.810> awesome

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
here's the tunnel I'm not going to talk

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.149 
here's the tunnel I'm not going to talk
to<00:01:09.979> this<00:01:10.250> hard<00:01:10.520> flat

stock c7 let's see I can tell I don't

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.080 
stock c7 let's see I can tell I don't
know<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.539> couldn't<00:01:38.990> see<00:01:39.259> it<00:01:39.710> was<00:01:39.829> too<00:01:40.009> fast<00:01:40.280> you

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
are a stock c7 I think this is where the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.539 
are a stock c7 I think this is where the
mountain<00:01:44.719> sort<00:01:45.319> of<00:01:45.409> comes<00:01:45.590> into<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:45.979> sort<00:01:46.520> of

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
mountain sort of comes into it sort of

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.399 
mountain sort of comes into it sort of
do<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.670> mountain<00:01:47.060> run<00:01:47.179> up<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.390> side<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.659> them<00:01:47.959> I

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
do a mountain run up the side of them I

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.600 
do a mountain run up the side of them I
wish<00:01:49.340> there<00:01:49.549> was<00:01:49.640> more<00:01:50.289> elevation<00:01:51.289> change

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
wish there was more elevation change

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.160 
wish there was more elevation change
that'd<00:01:52.610> be<00:01:52.640> something<00:01:52.880> that<00:01:53.149> I'm<00:01:53.240> like<00:01:53.750> if

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
waypoints because this roof definitely

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.870 
waypoints because this roof definitely
does<00:03:42.769> get<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:42.980> bit<00:03:43.010> confusing
