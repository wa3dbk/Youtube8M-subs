00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820
 Ask a question what kind of hair thickener 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.650
 better keratin fibers or powder 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.139
 suffice it to say that both are given 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.990
 tool very effectively cope 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.510
 with his task that is eliminates 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.990
 balding area create effect 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.359
 normal empty and dense hair 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.820
 surely there is a keratin difference 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.429
 fibers 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.480
 sprinkled on dry hair logo 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.399
 behavior and due to static 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.670
 stick to hair creating effect 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.700
 voids 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 it is not necessary to fix though if 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.940
 street strong wind or rainy weather 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.520
 it is certainly better to use 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.860
 some hairspray 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.430
 one jar is enough for about 1 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 month 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.969
 using it is 10 grams unconditionally 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.019
 there is even more economical i am in volume 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:10.640
 25 grams but it is respectively 2-3 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:14.420
 months of use in the morning 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.130
 applied vlan wet sponge on the skin 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.590
 heads and hair roots and all voids and 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.520
 Powder created by two factors 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.460
 matting the scalp to match hair color and 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.050
 thickens its substance hair itself 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.759
 after applying the hair can be combed 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.520
 comb blow-dry and lay 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.950
 bald spot will not be visible 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.310
 however, to those people who are not 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.740
 used neither one nor the other 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.110
 hesitates in my choice I would 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.149
 recommended to buy a set immediately 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.130
 and try this means 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.820
 you will see the effect of both 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.850
 means rate result rate 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.800
 the convenience of use 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.470
 economy and so on you yourself already 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.209
 decide on the parameters that 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.530
 the most significant for you and the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.269
 save your money by the way 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.680
 powder and fibers can be used 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:24.280
 at the same time they have the same color 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.280
 Thanks for attention
