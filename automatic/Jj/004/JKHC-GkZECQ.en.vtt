you're<00:01:10.350> actually<00:01:11.600> participating<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.200> story

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you're actually participating in a story

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.030 
you're actually participating in a story
campaign<00:01:14.310> mission<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.930> i<00:01:15.960> still<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.890> like

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
campaign mission but i still would like

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.039 
campaign mission but i still would like
to<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.520> through<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> story<00:01:18.509> without<00:01:18.720> being

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
to go through the story without being

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.710 
to go through the story without being
interrupted<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.890> my<00:01:20.280> own<00:01:20.460> pace<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.119> whatnot

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
interrupted at my own pace and whatnot

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.240 
interrupted at my own pace and whatnot
so<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.200> why<00:01:22.350> i<00:01:22.380> wanted<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.890> turn<00:01:23.070> off

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
so that's why i wanted to turn off

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.609 
so that's why i wanted to turn off
online<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.689> definitely<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.500> do

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
online now I was definitely going to do

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.499

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this at the start so it probably won't

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.780 
this at the start so it probably won't
affect<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:27.869> at<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> start<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.619> say<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> wanted

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
affect me at the start but say I wanted

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.999 
affect me at the start but say I wanted
to<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.090> turn<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.290> wanted<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.680> you
