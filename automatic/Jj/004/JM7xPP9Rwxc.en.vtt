anywhere and then added another knot and
a<00:01:40.320> loop<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.710> top<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.430> what<00:01:41.640> it's

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
a loop at the top this is what it's

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.819 
a loop at the top this is what it's
going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.939> hang<00:01:42.150> from<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.320> terms<00:01:43.590> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
going to hang from now in terms of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.710 
going to hang from now in terms of
length<00:01:44.189> depending<00:01:44.759> on<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.030> size<00:01:45.240> ladder<00:01:45.509> you

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720

the ladders but not the other because we

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.130

this now a side note at our group VBS
field<00:02:08.069> test<00:02:08.369> we

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
field test we

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.760 
field test we
used<00:02:09.039> a<00:02:09.160> carabiner<00:02:09.700> instead<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.959> loop<00:02:11.200> so

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
used a carabiner instead of the loop so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.860 
used a carabiner instead of the loop so
we<00:02:11.980> could<00:02:12.130> easily<00:02:12.640> move<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.030> several<00:02:13.360> times<00:02:13.569> if

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
we could easily move it several times if

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.080 
we could easily move it several times if
necessary<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.950> if<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.520> large<00:02:15.790> church

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
necessary so if you have a large church

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.339 
necessary so if you have a large church

in different locations you may want to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.850 
in different locations you may want to
consider<00:02:19.270> altering<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.900> with<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.319> carabiner

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
consider altering this with a carabiner

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.339 
consider altering this with a carabiner
now<00:02:21.730> how<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> get<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.360> dowel<00:02:22.630> onto<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
now how to get this dowel onto the

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.900 
now how to get this dowel onto the
latter's<00:02:23.650> you're<00:02:23.830> going<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.160> lay<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.760> on

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
latter's you're going to just lay it on

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.720 
latter's you're going to just lay it on
and<00:02:25.480> then<00:02:25.720> use<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.380> course<00:02:26.650> as<00:02:26.860> VDS<00:02:27.220> directors

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and then use of course as VDS directors

our<00:02:28.000> favorite<00:02:28.750> thing<00:02:28.989> in<00:02:29.200> duct<00:02:29.739> tape<00:02:30.040> you're

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
our favorite thing in duct tape you're

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.170 
our favorite thing in duct tape you're
going<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:32.100> attach<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.340> just<00:02:33.640> like<00:02:33.850> this

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
going to just attach it just like this

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.280 
going to just attach it just like this
and<00:02:34.950> we<00:02:35.950> recommend<00:02:36.250> doing<00:02:36.519> three<00:02:37.209> strips<00:02:38.080> of

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
and we recommend doing three strips of

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.479 
and we recommend doing three strips of
duct<00:02:38.590> tape<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:39.130> it'll<00:02:39.459> be<00:02:39.580> very<00:02:40.090> very<00:02:40.750> sturdy

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
duct tape so it'll be very very sturdy

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.130 
duct tape so it'll be very very sturdy
okay<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.700> a<00:02:42.819> little<00:02:42.850> tip<00:02:43.450> about<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.959> duct

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
okay just a little tip about the duct

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.840 
okay just a little tip about the duct
tape<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.830> want<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.040> make<00:02:45.130> sure<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.819> use

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
tape you want to make sure that you use

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.789 
tape you want to make sure that you use
quite<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.510> bit<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.019> it<00:02:47.140> actually<00:02:47.350> wraps

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
quite a bit so it actually wraps

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.590 
quite a bit so it actually wraps
underneath<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.519> ladder<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.209> sturdier

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
underneath the ladder it's just sturdier

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.280 
underneath the ladder it's just sturdier
that<00:02:49.840> way<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:52.000> comes<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.720> fun<00:02:52.989> part

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
that way and now comes the fun part

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.350 
that way and now comes the fun part
where<00:02:53.620> we<00:02:53.650> get<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:54.010> actually<00:02:54.190> put<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:55.090> test

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
where we get to actually put to test

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.289 
where we get to actually put to test
this<00:02:55.810> physics<00:02:56.739> law<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.610> law<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> pendulum

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
higher than the point it was released at

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.960 
higher than the point it was released at
so<00:03:34.390> now<00:03:34.600> we<00:03:34.660> have<00:03:34.840> replaced<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.859> strong<00:03:36.670> night

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
so now we have replaced the strong night

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.569 
so now we have replaced the strong night
with<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.480> real<00:03:37.959> person<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.709> it's<00:03:38.920> time<00:03:39.190> for<00:03:39.459> me

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
with a real person and it's time for me

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.300 
with a real person and it's time for me
to<00:03:39.760> just<00:03:40.000> relax<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.049> trust<00:03:41.500> in<00:03:41.739> Allah<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.250> the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
to just relax and trust in Allah of the

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.090 
to just relax and trust in Allah of the
pendulum<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.150> see<00:03:43.359> if<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.780> can<00:03:44.049> stand<00:03:44.440> strong

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
pendulum and see if I can stand strong

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.699 
pendulum and see if I can stand strong
hey<00:03:45.970> okay<00:03:46.329> here<00:03:46.600> we<00:03:46.690> go<00:03:46.720> get<00:03:47.200> up<00:03:47.290> just<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.560> little
