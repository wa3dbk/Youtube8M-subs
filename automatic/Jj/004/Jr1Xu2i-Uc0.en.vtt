location we have been analyzing three
really<00:00:24.150> interesting<00:00:24.269> outcrops<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.800> have

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
really interesting outcrops that we have

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.089 
really interesting outcrops that we have
called<00:00:26.220> Goulbourne<00:00:27.000> link<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> hottah<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.890> we

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
called Goulbourne link and hottah if we

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.589 
called Goulbourne link and hottah if we
look<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.400> hottah<00:00:29.580> outcrop<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.420> see<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
look at the hottah outcrop we can see a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.089 
look at the hottah outcrop we can see a
distinct<00:00:31.019> layer<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.380> has<00:00:31.470> been<00:00:31.529> tilted<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
distinct layer that has been tilted and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.310 
distinct layer that has been tilted and
eroded<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:33.090> allows<00:00:33.420> us<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.660> look<00:00:33.989> at<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
eroded and this allows us to look at the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
eroded and this allows us to look at the
cross-section<00:00:35.100> through<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> layer<00:00:35.670> when<00:00:36.480> we

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
cross-section through the layer when we

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.370 
cross-section through the layer when we
looked<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> layer<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.350> our

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
looked at the layer with our

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.590 
looked at the layer with our
high-resolution<00:00:38.190> mastcam<00:00:38.370> camera<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:39.570> found

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
high-resolution mastcam camera we found

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600 
high-resolution mastcam camera we found
that<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> was<00:00:40.050> comprised<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.710> sand<00:00:41.010> grains<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that it was comprised of sand grains and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
that it was comprised of sand grains and
small<00:00:41.760> pebbles<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.870> had<00:00:42.989> become<00:00:43.110> cemented

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
small pebbles that had become cemented

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.670 
small pebbles that had become cemented
to<00:00:43.890> form<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.190> hard<00:00:44.430> layer<00:00:44.809> here<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to form a hard layer here you can see a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.319 
to form a hard layer here you can see a
pebble<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> 3<00:00:47.520> centimeters<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.149> diameter

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
pebble that is 3 centimeters in diameter

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.200 
pebble that is 3 centimeters in diameter
so<00:00:48.960> smaller<00:00:49.500> than<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> ping<00:00:49.890> pong<00:00:49.920> ball<00:00:50.210> this

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
so smaller than a ping pong ball this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.580 
so smaller than a ping pong ball this
suggests<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.780> layer<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> an<00:00:52.289> ancient

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
suggests that this layer is an ancient

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.220 
suggests that this layer is an ancient
gravel<00:00:53.160> deposit<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.480> surprising<00:00:55.020> thing<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
gravel deposit the surprising thing is

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.389 
gravel deposit the surprising thing is
that<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.649> looked<00:00:55.860> at<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> pebbles

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
that when we looked at the pebbles

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
that when we looked at the pebbles
closely<00:00:57.239> we<00:00:57.660> discovered<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:58.289> many<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.590> them

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
closely we discovered that many of them

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
closely we discovered that many of them
were<00:00:58.920> quite<00:00:59.129> well<00:00:59.430> rounded<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.840> very

earth rounded pebbles are a common

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
earth rounded pebbles are a common

against<00:01:21.090> each<00:01:21.270> other<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.170> causes<00:01:22.470> them

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
against each other and this causes them

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
against each other and this causes them
to<00:01:22.799> become<00:01:22.979> rounded<00:01:23.670> through<00:01:23.970> time<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.509> what

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to become rounded through time so what

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.480 
to become rounded through time so what
we<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.290> might<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.619> seeing<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.280> Mars

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
we think we might be seeing here on Mars

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.460 
we think we might be seeing here on Mars
is<00:01:26.700> an<00:01:26.790> ancient<00:01:27.030> riverbed<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> pebble

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
is an ancient riverbed with the pebble

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
is an ancient riverbed with the pebble
beds<00:01:28.650> representing<00:01:29.280> old<00:01:29.520> stream<00:01:29.909> deposits

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
beds representing old stream deposits

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
beds representing old stream deposits
the<00:01:30.930> size<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> pebbles<00:01:31.619> tells<00:01:32.400> us<00:01:32.549> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the size of the pebbles tells us that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.649 
the size of the pebbles tells us that
these<00:01:32.790> rocks<00:01:33.030> could<00:01:33.299> not<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.600> been

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
these rocks could not have been

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.270 
these rocks could not have been
transported<00:01:34.079> by<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.350> wind<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.070> seems

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
transported by the wind so it seems

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.950 
transported by the wind so it seems
clear<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:36.060> must<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.240> been<00:01:36.329> transported

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
clear there must have been transported

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.740 
clear there must have been transported
by<00:01:37.079> water<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.159> how<00:01:38.310> does<00:01:38.390> deposits<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> be

by water so how does deposits get to be
here<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:40.799> look<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.009> broadly<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.700> Gale

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
here if we look more broadly in Gale

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.219 
here if we look more broadly in Gale
Crater<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.750> see<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
Crater we can see that there is a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.350

prominent feature that geologists called
an<00:01:45.479> alluvial<00:01:45.689> fan<00:01:46.729> we're<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.270> take<00:01:48.930> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
an alluvial fan we're going to take a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.160 
an alluvial fan we're going to take a
look<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.549> fans<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.880> Death<00:01:51.299> Valley<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.659> explore

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
look at fans in Death Valley and explore

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.560 
look at fans in Death Valley and explore
how<00:01:52.200> they<00:01:52.530> form<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.070> then<00:01:53.640> travel<00:01:54.180> back<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
how they form and then travel back to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.840 
how they form and then travel back to
Gale<00:01:54.750> Crater<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.290> explore<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> relationship

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
Gale Crater and explore the relationship

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.569 
Gale Crater and explore the relationship
between<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.689> fan<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.770> landing<00:01:59.250> site<00:01:59.460> as

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
fan was built by erosion then of

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.900 
fan was built by erosion then of
sediment<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.410> canyon<00:03:49.800> wall<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.790> was

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
sediment in the canyon wall that was

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.640 
sediment in the canyon wall that was
brought<00:03:51.270> out<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.480> spread<00:03:51.840> across<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.380> crater

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
brought out and spread across the crater

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.210 
brought out and spread across the crater
floor<00:03:53.000> on<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.870> fan<00:03:55.080> itself<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:56.040> see

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
floor on the fan itself we can see

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.530 
floor on the fan itself we can see
evidence<00:03:56.400> for<00:03:56.670> multiple<00:03:57.150> channels

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
evidence for multiple channels

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.420 
evidence for multiple channels
suggesting<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.350> streambed<00:03:58.680> direction

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
suggesting that the streambed direction

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.520 
suggesting that the streambed direction
changed<00:03:59.820> through<00:04:00.030> time<00:04:00.080> when<00:04:01.080> we<00:04:01.200> look<00:04:01.350> at<00:04:01.440> the

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
changed through time when we look at the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.260 
changed through time when we look at the
location<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.160> curiosity<00:04:02.760> landing<00:04:03.060> site

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
location of the curiosity landing site

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.300 
location of the curiosity landing site
with<00:04:03.450> respect<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.020> alluvial<00:04:04.410> fan<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:05.160> see

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
with respect to the alluvial fan we see

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.460 
with respect to the alluvial fan we see
that<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.580> rover<00:04:05.880> landed<00:04:06.330> downstream<00:04:07.230> of<00:04:07.350> the

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
that the rover landed downstream of the

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.730 
that the rover landed downstream of the
fan<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:08.700> rounded<00:04:09.060> pebbles<00:04:09.510> likely<00:04:10.230> represent

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
fan the rounded pebbles likely represent

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.500 
fan the rounded pebbles likely represent
long<00:04:11.010> distance<00:04:11.430> transport<00:04:11.910> down<00:04:12.300> the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
long distance transport down the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.570 
long distance transport down the
alluvial<00:04:12.900> fan<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:13.800> this<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.070> really<00:04:14.340> exciting

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
alluvial fan so this is really exciting

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.190 
alluvial fan so this is really exciting
news<00:04:14.940> for<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.240> science<00:04:15.570> team<00:04:15.600> because<00:04:16.079> it's

news for the science team because it's

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.020 
news for the science team because it's
the<00:04:16.320> first<00:04:16.500> time<00:04:16.680> we<00:04:17.280> are<00:04:17.310> seeing<00:04:17.430> gravel

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
the first time we are seeing gravel

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.180 
the first time we are seeing gravel
transported<00:04:18.720> by<00:04:18.840> water<00:04:19.049> on<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.739> surface<00:04:20.100> of
