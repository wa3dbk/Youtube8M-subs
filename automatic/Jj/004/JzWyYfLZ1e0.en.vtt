Canada people have always looked for

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.089 
Canada people have always looked for
ways<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.240> explore<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.930> deep<00:00:07.109> but<00:00:07.589> never<00:00:07.859> like

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
ways to explore the deep but never like

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.890 
ways to explore the deep but never like
this<00:00:08.160> then<00:00:09.150> this<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.389> what's<00:00:09.540> called<00:00:09.750> an

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
this then this is what's called an

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.259 
this then this is what's called an
ambient<00:00:10.349> pressure<00:00:10.559> submersible<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.429> that

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
ambient pressure submersible is that

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.330 
ambient pressure submersible is that
like<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.690> conventional<00:00:13.259> sub<00:00:13.530> it's<00:00:14.040> not<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
like a conventional sub it's not like a

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.950 
like a conventional sub it's not like a
conventional<00:00:14.549> sub<00:00:15.059> at<00:00:15.179> all<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.630> difference

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
conventional sub at all the difference

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.290 
conventional sub at all the difference
is<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.680> an<00:00:16.980> ambient<00:00:17.190> pressure<00:00:17.460> sub<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.880> balance

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
is in an ambient pressure sub we balance

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.179 
is in an ambient pressure sub we balance
the<00:00:18.480> air<00:00:18.600> pressure<00:00:18.840> inside<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> water

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the air pressure inside with the water

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
go see that opening in the back no it's

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.830 
go see that opening in the back no it's
not<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.289> mistake<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:26.340> allows<00:00:26.699> water<00:00:27.119> inside<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
not a mistake it allows water inside the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.050 
not a mistake it allows water inside the
subs<00:00:28.109> cockpit<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.250> kept<00:00:29.490> waist<00:00:29.820> high

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
subs cockpit to be kept waist high

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.810 
subs cockpit to be kept waist high
here's<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.109> works<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> cup<00:00:32.579> held

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
here's how it works like a cup held

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150 
here's how it works like a cup held
upside<00:00:33.239> down<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.719> water<00:00:33.989> air<00:00:34.410> gets<00:00:34.649> trapped<00:00:34.829> at

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
upside down in water air gets trapped at

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.420 
upside down in water air gets trapped at
the<00:00:35.280> top<00:00:35.540> as<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.780> dive<00:00:36.989> deeper<00:00:37.530> water<00:00:38.040> pressure

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the top as we dive deeper water pressure

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.790 
the top as we dive deeper water pressure
increases<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> water<00:00:39.960> level<00:00:40.379> inside<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
increases and the water level inside the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.610 
increases and the water level inside the
sub<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.370> start<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> rise<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:43.020> keep<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.410> from

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
sub will start to rise to keep this from

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.240 
sub will start to rise to keep this from
happening

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
happening

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.880 
happening
the<00:00:44.489> subs<00:00:44.760> external<00:00:45.450> tanks<00:00:45.840> blast<00:00:46.260> additional

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the subs external tanks blast additional

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.760 
the subs external tanks blast additional
air<00:00:47.129> into<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> cockpit<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.620> it's<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
air into the cockpit so it's like a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.010 
air into the cockpit so it's like a
diving<00:00:50.100> bell<00:00:50.460> with<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> motor<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
diving bell with a motor it's like a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.810 
diving bell with a motor it's like a
diving<00:00:52.199> bell<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> motor<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.489> couple<00:00:53.699> of

of<00:02:06.429> water<00:02:06.640> there's<00:02:06.969> no<00:02:07.090> more<00:02:07.270> air<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.659> them<00:02:07.810> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
of water there's no more air in them the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.169 
of water there's no more air in them the
only<00:02:08.830> air<00:02:08.950> pocket<00:02:09.459> that's<00:02:09.610> keeping<00:02:09.910> us<00:02:10.000> afloat

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
only air pocket that's keeping us afloat

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.110 
only air pocket that's keeping us afloat
is<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.750> air<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.470> this<00:02:11.620> cockpit<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.940> good

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
is the air in this cockpit and a good

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.180 
is the air in this cockpit and a good
time<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.510> go<00:02:13.630> find<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.959> shipwreck<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.860> great

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
time to go find a shipwreck have a great

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:29.300 
time to go find a shipwreck have a great
night<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.760> say<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.630> go<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.810> that

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.979 

what's<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.430> gurgling<00:02:30.880> noise<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.660> buoyancy

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
what's that gurgling noise the buoyancy

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.420 
what's that gurgling noise the buoyancy
control<00:02:32.200> system<00:02:32.829> is<00:02:32.920> off<00:02:33.130> as<00:02:33.940> we<00:02:34.239> descend<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
control system is off as we descend the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.300 
control system is off as we descend the
pressure<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:36.970> this<00:02:37.090> cockpit<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:38.310> increasing

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
pressure in this cockpit is increasing

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.339 
pressure in this cockpit is increasing
so<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.549> me<00:02:40.500> maintain<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.680> volume

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
so to me maintain the volume

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.270 
so to me maintain the volume
we<00:02:43.950> want<00:02:44.219> to<00:02:44.870> be<00:02:45.870> blasting<00:02:46.409> air<00:02:46.560> into<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
we want to be blasting air into the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:03:28.380 
we want to be blasting air into the
water<00:02:47.549> levels<00:02:47.909> out<00:02:48.030> surprise

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.070 

Wow<00:03:33.220> our<00:03:34.220> main<00:03:34.370> tank<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:34.940> that's<00:03:35.810> gonna<00:03:35.959> be<00:03:36.020> a

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
Wow our main tank so that's gonna be a

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.510 
Wow our main tank so that's gonna be a
good<00:03:36.200> idea<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.650> start<00:03:36.890> heading<00:03:37.280> for<00:03:37.430> the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
good idea to start heading for the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.510 
good idea to start heading for the
surface<00:03:38.620> what<00:03:39.620> rate<00:03:39.950> are<00:03:39.980> we<00:03:40.280> allowed<00:03:40.490> to

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
surface what rate are we allowed to

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.150 
surface what rate are we allowed to
ascend<00:03:41.120> we<00:03:41.840> should<00:03:42.020> ascend<00:03:42.320> no<00:03:42.500> faster<00:03:43.040> than

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
ascend we should ascend no faster than

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.540 
ascend we should ascend no faster than
one<00:03:43.340> foot<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.580> second<00:03:44.090> that's<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.660> rated<00:03:45.560> there's

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
one foot a second that's a rated there's

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.940 
one foot a second that's a rated there's
a<00:03:46.670> recommended<00:03:47.270> maximum<00:03:47.480> rate<00:03:47.959> or<00:03:48.350> safe<00:03:48.650> rate

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
a recommended maximum rate or safe rate

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.730 
a recommended maximum rate or safe rate
for<00:03:49.459> scuba<00:03:49.790> divers<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.380> I'm<00:03:54.470> going<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.650> go

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
for scuba divers so I'm going to go

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.050 
for scuba divers so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:54.830> and<00:03:55.010> bring<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.459> surface<00:03:55.640> now

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
ahead and bring it to the surface now

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.050 
ahead and bring it to the surface now
here<00:03:56.870> we<00:03:57.020> are
