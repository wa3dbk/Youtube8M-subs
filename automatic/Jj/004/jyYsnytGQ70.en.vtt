his own end and just an all-around
efficient<00:00:49.710> guy<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:50.640> areas<00:00:51.000> where<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
efficient guy what about areas where you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.110 
efficient guy what about areas where you
look<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> improve<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:53.460> know<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> little<00:00:54.000> bit

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
look to improve you know be a little bit

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.810 
look to improve you know be a little bit
more<00:00:54.239> physical<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.430> know<00:00:56.430> always<00:00:56.610> be

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
more physical and you know always be

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
more physical and you know always be
faster<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.329> bigger<00:00:57.420> stronger<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.199> think

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
faster and bigger stronger I think

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
faster and bigger stronger I think
that's<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.920> uh<00:00:58.949> makes<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> game<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.820> lot

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that's all is uh makes the game a lot

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.000 
that's all is uh makes the game a lot
easier<00:01:00.149> usually<00:01:01.050> indication<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> Blackhawks

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
obviously the Nick Lidstrom zand the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:10.280 
obviously the Nick Lidstrom zand the
true<00:02:01.500> daddies<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:01.920> leagues<00:02:02.250> well<00:02:08.479> yeah<00:02:09.479> you

true daddies are leagues well yeah you
know<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.440> think<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.860> bit<00:02:11.040> of<00:02:11.130> an<00:02:11.220> adjustment

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
know I think it's a bit of an adjustment

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
know I think it's a bit of an adjustment
going<00:02:11.820> into<00:02:11.970> college<00:02:12.150> playing<00:02:13.020> against

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
going into college playing against

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.010 
going into college playing against
bigger<00:02:13.800> older<00:02:14.040> stronger<00:02:14.489> guys<00:02:14.820> but<00:02:15.810> at<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
bigger older stronger guys but at the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
bigger older stronger guys but at the
same<00:02:16.200> time<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.950> think<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:19.020> just<00:02:19.140> takes<00:02:19.350> time<00:02:19.440> to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
same time I think it just takes time to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.800 
same time I think it just takes time to
get<00:02:20.160> used<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.580> rinks<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> older<00:02:21.239> guys<00:02:21.420> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
get used to the rinks the older guys the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.740 
get used to the rinks the older guys the
the<00:02:22.530> players<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.010> atmospheres<00:02:23.489> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
the players the atmospheres and

absolutely it is in college and that's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.770 
absolutely it is in college and that's
that's<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.610> beauty<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:26.910> college<00:02:27.180> hockey<00:02:29.780> yeah
