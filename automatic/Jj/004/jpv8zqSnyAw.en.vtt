has wrist articulation right here then

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:35.930 
has wrist articulation right here then
he<00:04:34.470> actually<00:04:34.620> well<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.250> guess<00:04:35.550> that's<00:04:35.729> above

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
he actually well I guess that's above

join<00:04:40.759> right<00:04:40.970> here<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:42.590> then<00:04:42.919> his<00:04:43.039> hands<00:04:43.250> just

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
join right here and then his hands just

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.400 
join right here and then his hands just
make<00:04:43.699> like<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:43.940> kind<00:04:44.509> of<00:04:44.600> gripping<00:04:44.930> type<00:04:45.259> of
