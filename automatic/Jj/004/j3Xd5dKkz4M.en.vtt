00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:15.990
 my name is george i am 26 years old at the wheel i 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.930
 2008 went by so many cars 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.060
 the japanese and americans flynn domestic 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.960
 of course as for chinese 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.940
 car industry went only to chery amulet 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.570
 big claims for this car then 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.930
 arose due to the fact that the car was not 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.840
 quality assembled very often broke 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.450
 and 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.960
 outwardly unsightly as for 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.750
 external data of this car what am i 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.650
 I can see that the Italians and put 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.780
 to this hand because it feels 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.270
 smooth transition lines 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.840
 I never liked the car without 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.150
 heaps and 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:01.540
 stripes but here it seems this such 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.640
 design move that gives I think 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.300
 a certain sympathy for this car 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.850
 I believe that the target audience is given 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.979
 the machine is most likely suitable for students 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.560
 when i opened this hood basically i 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.390
 did not expect to see some 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.810
 mess to be honest i wouldn't 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.160
 guessed that this is the Chinese auto industry 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.770
 reserve is full in full disk 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.270
 all the necessary tools have arrived 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.009
 interior time of this 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.520
 car instrument panel in principle 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.840
 looks quite ergonomic 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.920
 informative as regards the central 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.679
 panels, too, in principle 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.350
 nice all clear big steering wheel buttons 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:51.720
 pleasant big principle suits me and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.990
 even there are buttons toggle 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.800
 audio recorders 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.869
 and what we started and we go apparently not 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.480
 a little bit of power 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.350
 car water in the other side 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.299
 engine 1 of 6 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.760
 pretty fast car 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:16.630
 reacts accelerator in principle 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.140
 suitable for learning for perception 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.660
 cities we are just friends somewhere 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.350
 why not ride now we stopped 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.600
 only on the tram tracks suspension 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.060
 soft and swallows these bumps no 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.790
 such a feeling that I'm going in principle 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.530
 the guys seemed to make me dynamic 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.000
 suitable for when boy for girls 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.690
 the car as a whole have been waiting for 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.170
 Of course I have the worst because China 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.390
 never set with my cars 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.620
 this car and everything is better than ours 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.519
 domestic car industry 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.590
 with unchanged 40 year standards and 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.010
 guys still do little but 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.110
 are not made to improve this 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.090
 product but wait and see 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.090
 I think everything will be fine
