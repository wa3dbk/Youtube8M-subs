00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 If there is no Toyama National College of Technology, there is a technique. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.540
 For example, in the concept development committee 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.459
 makidai children are full 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.669
 Explain that the tractor is proposed to swing 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.079
 Guardrail waiting for what to do- 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:16.679
 Sai Yousuke 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.570
 One is a win 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.590
 If taken 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.440
 please wait 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.839
 Then I feel like this 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.839
 have 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.390
 It's really so big 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 This too 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.160
 Miyao's hiring is natural compared to several years ago 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.620
 Yu Hosokawa is a problem 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.829
 I think but I feel like being reset once 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.800
 become 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.830
 I had been waiting forever 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.280
 That it is Vine light technique Well 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.160
 That indirect method 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 One of the direct and indirect exchange swaps with teachers 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.360
 If you get this done first 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
 It is so even in the cat survey that is in trouble 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.870
 On the left 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.980
 While it has been taken so far, it is viewed directly as a motive 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.810
 As for me to succeed 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 It was the fifth street of Kyoto 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.960
 I'm doing it from now but hotel. 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 There is also Lotte 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.820
 The most from now on 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.680
 Right and left 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 I can go with my left hand on numbers 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 Takamatsu 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.060
 After all, most are coming 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.010
 It's like a daily email, but it's a feeling I've got 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.400
 Feeling like composition around 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.870
 If we know that we can really bring itself, this measure 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 So let's see it 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.729
 But I felt like I was playing
