00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.650
 well on youtube well on our website or 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.520
 well we said and what we like a lot is 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.040
 the roll we have with others 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.630
 followers that is enough one on one or 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.240
 When I go to mine, I hang it 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.920
 tomorrow is perfect and we are followed 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.539
 they answer and there is good dialogue there 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.259
 good social feedback that's what 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.990
 import 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.610
 in fact we have enough followers 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.799
 good the new channel that we created in 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.170
 youtube we created it in June in 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.270
 recovering the name of someone who 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.490
 had the simple name on youtube what 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.440
 we recover to be in gamefest and from 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.700
 June so far and there are three thousand 800 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.500
 subscribers that we hope will be 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.009
 multiply we reach the 5,000 in 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.470
 short and good then to see this fair 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.330
 gamelab, because it gives us a bit of 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.400
 bustle and this grows more so 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.830
 exaggeratedly but good we like 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.420
 be in means of these and get 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.310
 Follow the atmosphere and do something different 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.620
 which I think is what makes us different 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.959
 little of the rest 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.180
 there are specialized media in the 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.360
 online another in magazines and us 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.400
 we are there in a place that is a bit 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.819
 weird to be the first we try 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.349
 mix the two things to see what good 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.299
 Well sure that very well and you already 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.069
 you know if you've had a video game and not 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.319
 You have still seen a review 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.849
 sensation can offer you this review 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.530
 you are waiting so you only have to 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.599
 write to you through any platform 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.579
 social in which they are present and here 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.030
