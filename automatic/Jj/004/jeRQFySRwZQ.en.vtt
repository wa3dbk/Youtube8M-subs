00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Half -naked women and horror bieber are there 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.970
 to see it in the first German trailer 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.970
 to zambia 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.789
 from here in a raised we kiss 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.719
 looking for a beaver 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.320
 we all understand we had enough 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.680
 Excitement for the first day 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.680
 it was that 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.580
 we go swimming 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.829
 ever thought that it still 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.829
 more could restore 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.450
 i have real beaver here 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.130
 seen near 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.860
 should you ever on my knees in front of me 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.320
 we should not start now 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.439
 that's exactly what the beaver wants 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.450
 Roll over at night are especially the 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.590
 road is blocked there we do not come 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.799
 through damn 20 years I'm still 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.799
 Not 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.810
 it was 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.490
 what should i say i just love 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.440
 trashfilm or I get the grin 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.330
 barely out of the face should bring bieber 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.780
 is dazzling is expected from the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.670
 30 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.660
 October in selected cinemas and tells 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.190
 the story of a series of 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.780
 students and female students of the 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.490
 everyday at the university just too stressful 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.080
 and that's why she's a weekend long 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.790
 want to switch off and that's why 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.800
 of course, it's your agreement in a hut 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.330
 go to party there very far 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.860
 felt cut off from the outside 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.660
 outside world near a body of water 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.940
 and there are many little cute ones 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.440
 bieber but the horror zombie moderately 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.090
 are on the go and like people 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.710
 eat and then these are poor 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.240
 Female students simply isolated from 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.830
 the outside world must someday recognize 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.630
 that they either die there or 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.430
 these bieber fight against it the whole 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.290
 talk with a whole lot of nude 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.970
 skin and semi-dumb dialoge likely 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.950
 song bee at the really funny trashfilm 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.330
 be the one with a run length of 85 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.340
 minutes after exactly this niche 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.280
 beats and I now love matthias films 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.470
 all genres octopus in chucks away it 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.390
 Almost everything Nazi vampires 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.709
 belongs to and exactly for these fans 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.480
 This genre should also sunbathe bieber 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.959
 just make fun I like the 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.610
 trailer 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.750
 I just like the optics we here 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.550
 is cut and looks for the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.260
 crash in even relatively high quality 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.850
 out of not many know just shake 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.830
 just head and say what the fuck and 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.270
 I told you more about it, please 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.800
 what is sometimes better than yourself 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.540
 to sit back and watch a trash movie 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.950
 just to talk about the shit 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.420
 the film is that too 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.010
 Enjoy his cinematic view 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.450
 the other side of the tenth 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.920
 schematically, audience, and I think before 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.120
 all the optics here of these bibles 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.410
 the simple with these radiant 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.209
 shining eyes again so wrong 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.590
 is just so sympathetic that I am me 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.420
 Absorb bieber happy as I said off 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.830
 the 30 october partly in german 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.630
 cinemas and then also very much at the home 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.489
 entertainment release after what says 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.989
 her to this trailer also said oh 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.760
 yes, that's exactly what I sometimes do 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.150
 do not need or say mine at all 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.410
 thing 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.970
 probably will be here once 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.260
 the more ghosts it seems I am 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.360
 In any case, I am missing and looking forward to 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.860
 the 30th of october and am thus with 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.959
 my little trailer check to this 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.550
 trashfilm like to read a thumb there if 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.650
 this video made it stay we will 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.910
 otherwise that's you there is one 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.800
 couple left around me and tomorrow around 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.459
 15 o'clock of course later are a new one 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.230
 Video 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.540
 until then, I hope for weeks again 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.540
 with of course at 3
