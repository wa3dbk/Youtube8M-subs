00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Ok, everyone! So if you have ever corrected your problem 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.589
 Hair, you are trying to get rid of heat, I have a solution already working 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.030
 to me. I only watched a video to do this. I tried it myself. 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.570
 Two weeks ago, it worked very well and I actually did it today - so you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.690
 I can see that my hair is very straight. I will guide you through 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 How to make my hair straighten, I have natural 2B curls, so 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.260
 It's wavy, so it's not curly, it's not for those with 3B or so straight 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.030
 4 - 3/4 hair texture, I will, if this really works, it will be fun 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.000
 For you, if you want to try it, please leave a message below, I really 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.629
 Want to see if it works for different people with real curly hair 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.020
 Because I am somewhere in between - but besides that, stay tuned! 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.859
 For this tutorial you will need: a bottle of water, leave-in conditioner, a 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:10.490
 Detangling brush, detangling comb, a best wearing a wig cap, and a lot of Bobby 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.289
 It depends on how much hair you have. I have conditioned my hair and used one 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.070
 Wide tooth comb to unwind. Use wide teeth or untie the toothbrush depending on you 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.670
 But I use them because it works best for me. Put your hair in the middle, 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.409
 Knock with a hair or use a hair to take off one side of the hair; you will use your 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.250
 Spritz bottles keep your hair moist, not dry or wet. 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.790
 Now, you have to separate this side twice more, then go back 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.300
 The part you are not using. For the rest of the hair, you will go 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.710
 Brush it as straight as possible and start wrapping it on your head. 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.520
 When you go, Bobby pin up and remember to keep it as straight as possible. Depends on how 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.979
 You have a lot of hair and you may need more Bobby pins. - It should eventually look 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.390
 Like this. Repeat the same steps for the rest of the hair brushing 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.869
 It is as straight as possible and pegs your hair around the packaging style 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.130
 your head. Overlap is perfectly possible for your hair, you should start watching 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.782
 Your packaging is shaped. 

00:02:14.782 --> 00:02:23.620
 Now change the other side and you will repeat the same steps 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.070
 At this point you may need to spray your hair with water. Pin any 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.239
 You didn't use and brush your part and nail it into the package 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.230
 By placing it on your head and by the side more than the pre-fixed part. This will get 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.860
 Practice is easier; it's just my second time to do it. As long as you are trying 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.920
 Keep your hair as straight as possible, and you have fixed it to your 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.280
 A small amount of hair will not rise, and the rest will take care of the rest. 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.090
 So don't worry about this. 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.540
 Now you are all done! Your packaging may not look perfect. Wet your hair with a wet needle 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.020
 Hidden million hair clips below will not give the best results, but this is 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.130
 gist! Grab your wig cap - forgive me on my dog's hair and place it from behind 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.950
 To the top of your head. Wig caps are perfect because they are 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.010
 Tight enough to let your hair hang down and keep everything in place. If you are doing 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.190
 This continues your regular bedtime with silk packaging at night. 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.790
 As an extra protection, or you can put one if you want to go out for a run, then you can change to peas 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.180
 Run the leg. It can take four to seven hours depending on how dry your hair is. 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.120
 Finally it's time to see your new straightened hair! Untie each chain and 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.480
 Gently brush your hair in your way to fix it to avoid any tangling. I 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.470
 I absolutely love this method because of course I don't have to use any heat. This one 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.070
 Method can also keep my hair kept out of its body without being suppressed 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.180
 Use an iron. If you are not satisfied with having as many bodies as possible to fix your hair 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.200
 Be as perfect as possible, your hair may be important to you when you pack. heat 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.890
 At this point it will be optional how long you make your hair dry if 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.790
 You are satisfied with the final look. I love to cut my hair natural oil, but 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.540
 Otherwise here is the look I finished. I hope you like my first tutorial! do not
