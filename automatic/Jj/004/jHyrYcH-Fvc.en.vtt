very<00:01:16.259> fast<00:01:16.860> moving<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:17.700> Edwards<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.270> one

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
very fast moving for Edwards this one

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:27.620

very<00:01:19.979> hard<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.640> work<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.240> wash<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:27.390> last

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
very hard to work with wash the last

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
very hard to work with wash the last
batch<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.170> made<00:01:28.439> weren't<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.729> good<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.270> usual

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
batch I made weren't as good as usual

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.890 
batch I made weren't as good as usual
and<00:01:31.170> these<00:01:31.350> aren't<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.979> best<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:36.119> might<00:01:36.570> just

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and these aren't the best it might just

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.870 
and these aren't the best it might just
be<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.650> weather's<00:01:38.070> warmer<00:01:38.549> at<00:01:38.670> this

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
be because the weather's warmer at this

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.060 
be because the weather's warmer at this
time<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.390> year<00:01:41.840> again<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.290> got<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.799> many

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
time of year again I got so many

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.420 
time of year again I got so many
questions<00:01:45.350> I've<00:01:46.350> had<00:01:46.380> some<00:01:46.710> questions<00:01:47.189> this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
questions I've had some questions this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.090 
questions I've had some questions this
morning<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.720> really<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.649> it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
morning and I really think that it's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.130 
morning and I really think that it's
just<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> weather<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
just because of the weather and the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.429 
just because of the weather and the
where<00:01:55.439> we<00:01:55.649> work<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:56.250> everything<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.439> think

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
where we work on everything I think

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.319 
where we work on everything I think
wherever<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.369> you've<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.030> got<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.240> find

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
wherever you are you've just got to find

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.270 
wherever you are you've just got to find
out

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
out

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:15.530 
out
and<00:02:02.549> what<00:02:03.360> will<00:02:03.600> work<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.560> area<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:15.060> think

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and what will work in your area I think

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.210 
and what will work in your area I think
they<00:02:15.690> look<00:02:15.840> better<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.590> pink<00:02:16.890> rose

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
they look better with the pink rose

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.150 
they look better with the pink rose
petals<00:02:17.760> instead<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.750> deep<00:02:19.500> red<00:02:19.830> but

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
petals instead of the deep red but

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.770 
petals instead of the deep red but
probably<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.120> cuz<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.160> change<00:02:23.780> change

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
probably just cuz it's a change change

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.500 
probably just cuz it's a change change
is<00:02:24.959> as<00:02:25.110> good<00:02:25.260> as<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> rest<00:02:25.739> as<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.790> there<00:02:26.970> as

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
is as good as a rest as this is there as

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.350 
is as good as a rest as this is there as
I'm<00:02:28.380> really<00:02:28.950> short<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.430> bubble<00:02:29.880> bath<00:02:30.030> complex
