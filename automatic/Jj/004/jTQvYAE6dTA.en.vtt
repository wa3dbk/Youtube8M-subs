00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.960 
is sort of a standard and in my opinion
creature<00:04:12.020> swap<00:04:12.200> is<00:04:12.410> an<00:04:13.160> unconventional<00:04:13.760> side

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
creature swap is an unconventional side

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.320 
creature swap is an unconventional side
which<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:15.140> second<00:04:15.470> place<00:04:15.620> winner<00:04:16.340> in<00:04:16.580> whitey

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
which the second place winner in whitey

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.000 
which the second place winner in whitey
as<00:04:17.480> Barcelona<00:04:17.900> took<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.290> heart<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.680> he

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
as Barcelona took to heart and he

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.830 
as Barcelona took to heart and he
decided<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.430> side<00:04:19.700> into<00:04:20.030> them<00:04:20.210> and<00:04:20.360> I<00:04:20.690> must

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
decided to side into them and I must

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.270 
decided to side into them and I must
have<00:04:20.930> really<00:04:21.380> helped<00:04:21.590> him<00:04:21.710> out<00:04:21.830> because<00:04:22.070> it

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
have really helped him out because it

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.860 
have really helped him out because it
definitely<00:04:22.400> wasn't<00:04:22.700> second<00:04:23.090> place<00:04:23.240> and<00:04:23.480> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
definitely wasn't second place and the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.330 
definitely wasn't second place and the
only<00:04:24.020> reason<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.380> he<00:04:24.530> lost<00:04:24.680> was<00:04:25.040> because<00:04:25.310> of

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
only reason that he lost was because of

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.280 
only reason that he lost was because of
the<00:04:25.610> stupid<00:04:25.760> first<00:04:26.120> turn<00:04:26.330> my<00:04:26.810> her<00:04:26.930> puzzle<00:04:27.140> of
