post-it flags and post-it notes and that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.479 
post-it flags and post-it notes and that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
peel off the backing of that sticky

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.100 
peel off the backing of that sticky
strip<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> stick<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.600> right<00:00:36.630> into<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
strip and stick it right into the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
strip and stick it right into the
notebook<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.250> literally<00:00:39.000> right

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
notebook and then it is literally right

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.330 
notebook and then it is literally right
there<00:00:39.600> ready<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> grab<00:00:40.829> whenever<00:00:41.190> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
there ready for you to grab whenever you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.740 
there ready for you to grab whenever you
need<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> post-it<00:00:42.059> note<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> post<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.870> flag

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.900 

I<00:00:49.780> also<00:00:50.410> want<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.740> show<00:00:50.950> you<00:00:50.980> these<00:00:51.370> post-it

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
I also want to show you these post-it

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.150 
I also want to show you these post-it
grid<00:00:52.330> notes<00:00:52.630> and<00:00:52.960> I<00:00:53.290> think<00:00:53.530> that<00:00:53.680> these<00:00:53.830> are

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
grid notes and I think that these are

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.590 
grid notes and I think that these are
really<00:00:54.400> really<00:00:54.730> cool<00:00:54.910> because<00:00:55.060> they're

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
really really cool because they're

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.360 
really really cool because they're
sticky<00:00:55.900> so<00:00:56.230> what<00:00:56.410> I<00:00:56.440> did<00:00:56.650> was<00:00:56.830> I<00:00:56.950> just<00:00:56.980> peeled

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
sticky so what I did was I just peeled

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.250 
sticky so what I did was I just peeled
off<00:00:57.490> the<00:00:57.550> back<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:57.850> it<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.630> stuck<00:00:58.930> it<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.170> the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
off the back of it and I stuck it to the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.630 
off the back of it and I stuck it to the
back<00:00:59.410> of<00:00:59.440> my<00:00:59.710> notebook<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:00.280> think<00:01:00.310> this

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
back of my notebook and I think this

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.490 
back of my notebook and I think this
would<00:01:00.730> be<00:01:00.790> so<00:01:01.150> so<00:01:01.450> convenient<00:01:01.960> for<00:01:01.990> math<00:01:02.230> class

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
would be so so convenient for math class

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.830 
would be so so convenient for math class
all<00:01:02.830> you<00:01:03.280> would<00:01:03.400> have<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.700> do<00:01:03.850> is<00:01:04.090> peel<00:01:04.630> one<00:01:04.809> of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
all you would have to do is peel one of

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.390 
all you would have to do is peel one of
these<00:01:04.960> off<00:01:05.230> and<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.530> can<00:01:05.680> draw<00:01:05.890> your<00:01:06.070> grid<00:01:06.250> and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
these off and you can draw your grid and

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.220 
these off and you can draw your grid and
stick<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:06.730> right<00:01:06.760> on<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.180> your<00:01:07.210> notes<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:07.720> always

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
stick it right on to your notes I always

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.140 
stick it right on to your notes I always
hated<00:01:08.500> how<00:01:08.740> grid<00:01:09.070> paper<00:01:09.340> if<00:01:09.610> I<00:01:09.700> was<00:01:09.850> using<00:01:10.000> a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
hated how grid paper if I was using a

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.910 
hated how grid paper if I was using a
notebook<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.750> would<00:01:11.080> have<00:01:11.230> to<00:01:11.320> keep<00:01:11.530> the<00:01:11.680> grid

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
notebook I would have to keep the grid

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.350 
notebook I would have to keep the grid
separately<00:01:12.550> and<00:01:12.760> try<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:12.970> keep<00:01:13.150> it<00:01:13.270> all

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
separately and try to keep it all

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.450 
separately and try to keep it all
organized<00:01:13.840> but<00:01:14.350> now<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.560> could<00:01:14.890> just<00:01:15.070> take<00:01:15.400> one

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
organized but now I could just take one

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.890 
organized but now I could just take one
of<00:01:15.640> these<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.060> stick<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.390> right<00:01:16.420> to<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.750> page

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
of these and stick it right to the page

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.630 
of these and stick it right to the page
instead<00:01:17.290> of<00:01:17.410> everything<00:01:17.740> being<00:01:17.920> all<00:01:18.310> spread

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
instead of everything being all spread

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.810 
instead of everything being all spread
out

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
out

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.340 
out
I<00:01:19.120> think<00:01:19.630> that<00:01:19.750> this<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:20.020> pretty<00:01:20.260> much

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
I think that this is pretty much

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.260 
I think that this is pretty much
essential<00:01:20.710> for<00:01:21.370> math<00:01:21.490> classes<00:01:21.790> now<00:01:22.060> so

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
essential for math classes now so

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.150 
essential for math classes now so
seriously<00:01:22.840> if<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.170> are<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.410> a<00:01:23.500> math<00:01:23.650> class<00:01:23.920> you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
seriously if you are in a math class you

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.080 
seriously if you are in a math class you
have<00:01:24.369> got<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.820> get<00:01:24.940> this<00:01:29.550> so<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.640> next<00:01:30.850> thing<00:01:31.000> I

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
have got to get this so the next thing I

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.160 
have got to get this so the next thing I
want<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.270> show<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.479> is<00:01:31.720> how<00:01:31.869> you<00:01:31.930> can<00:01:32.140> use

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
so aside from those another product that

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.400 
so aside from those another product that
they<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.150> are<00:02:19.360> these<00:02:19.510> post-it<00:02:19.959> flags<00:02:20.200> that

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
they have are these post-it flags that

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.900 
they have are these post-it flags that
are<00:02:20.500> called<00:02:20.680> writable<00:02:21.220> flags<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.730> they're

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
are called writable flags and they're

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.370 
are called writable flags and they're
sort<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.360> same<00:02:22.390> idea<00:02:22.810> as<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.989> last<00:02:23.170> ones

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
sort of the same idea as the last ones

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.990 
sort of the same idea as the last ones
except<00:02:23.769> you<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.160> fill<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.489> your<00:02:24.519> own<00:02:24.670> thing

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
except you can fill in your own thing

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.490 
except you can fill in your own thing
they<00:02:25.150> don't<00:02:25.299> already<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.660> words<00:02:26.019> written<00:02:26.290> on

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
they don't already have words written on

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.350 
they don't already have words written on
them<00:02:26.709> so<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.130> think<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.459> really<00:02:27.790> great<00:02:28.120> thing

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
them so I think a really great thing

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.000 
them so I think a really great thing
about<00:02:28.510> these<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.080> if<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.530> multiple

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
about these is that if you have multiple

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.160 
about these is that if you have multiple
quizzes<00:02:30.430> or<00:02:30.580> tests<00:02:30.910> coming<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.299> you<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:31.900> mark

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
quizzes or tests coming up you can mark

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.810 
quizzes or tests coming up you can mark
them<00:02:32.380> separately<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.010> on<00:02:33.160> one<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.519> can<00:02:33.670> write

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
them separately so on one you can write

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.840 
them separately so on one you can write
quiz<00:02:34.420> coming<00:02:34.720> up<00:02:34.900> on<00:02:35.080> March<00:02:35.380> 2nd<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.100> then<00:02:36.700> you
