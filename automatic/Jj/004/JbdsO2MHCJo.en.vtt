00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
so that he's not playing anymore

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.849 
so that he's not playing anymore
and<00:00:59.910> let<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> controller<00:01:01.199> turn<00:01:01.530> off<00:01:01.680> by

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
and let the controller turn off by

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.130 
and let the controller turn off by
itself<00:01:01.890> over<00:01:02.550> time<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.899> see<00:01:04.019> you

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
itself over time so as you can see you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
got 8 people in this game and it's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.200 
got 8 people in this game and it's
really<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.869> easy<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.880> when<00:01:08.880> people

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
really really easy to do when people

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.030 
really really easy to do when people
leave<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> join<00:01:09.930> they<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
leave and join they can just do it

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.679 
leave and join they can just do it
freely<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> worry<00:01:12.510> about

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
freely so you don't have to worry about

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.600 
freely so you don't have to worry about
people<00:01:12.960> disconnecting<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> game<00:01:14.220> ending

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
people disconnecting in the game ending

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
people disconnecting in the game ending
they<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> actually<00:01:15.299> join<00:01:15.540> back<00:01:15.840> over<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
they can actually join back over and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
they can actually join back over and
over<00:01:16.470> again<00:01:16.560> obviously<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.610> won't<00:01:17.729> join

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
over again obviously they won't join

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.730 
over again obviously they won't join
back<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.390> same<00:01:18.630> guns<00:01:18.900> they'll<00:01:19.229> join<00:01:19.530> back

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
back with same guns they'll join back

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.520 
back with same guns they'll join back
with<00:01:19.920> their<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.640> know<00:01:20.670> their<00:01:21.000> pistol<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.840> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
with their you know their pistol but it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.249 
with their you know their pistol but it
works<00:01:22.950> very<00:01:23.220> very<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.299> really<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.080> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
works very very well I really like this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.450 
works very very well I really like this
glitch<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.280> combine

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
glitch because you can actually combine

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
glitch because you can actually combine
other<00:01:26.790> glitches<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> turbine<00:01:27.840> glitch

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
other glitches like the turbine glitch

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
other glitches like the turbine glitch
and<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.829> use<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> electric<00:01:29.520> trap<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and you can use the electric trap and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.840 
and you can use the electric trap and
using<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> same<00:01:31.020> glitch<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> turret

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
using the same glitch and use the turret

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
using the same glitch and use the turret
