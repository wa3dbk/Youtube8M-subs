00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.059
 to make you downright crazy 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.049
 believe me go I go to the kitchen and you 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.049
 let's look at the ingredients 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.740
 in a saucepan that is not on the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.030
 fire I'm going to put the yellows 2 their 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.030
 just the zest of a lemon 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.530
 I also add lemon juice 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.030
 and the sugar I'm going to do now 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.730
 heat gently so that the sugar 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.050
 2010 room and stirring continuously 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.130
 for two minutes 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.790
 I want to add butter now 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.790
 have not died 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.670
 a stupid trick when you plan 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.800
 a lemon cream like that it takes 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.620
 know that once there is no more 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.239
 cream mousse is already almost ready 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.250
 we want the woman to be 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.350
 slightly and weighs so we'll leave 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.210
 snap wax on soft fire before they have 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.800
 half the heat and cool 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.880
 for the dough it's very simple I want 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.260
 eat the flour with the sugar and I 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.240
 will then add the butter when 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.360

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.360
 fingers 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.750
 the dough is ready I'm going to show it with 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.219
 fingers in the mold to see 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.259
 cuts and easily because and after 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.140
 I took a rectangle mold and then you 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.880
 possible to surprise a square mold and 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.200
 throw in the water uniformly 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.200
 the dough with the fingers 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.289

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.850
 it remained more than cool 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.350
