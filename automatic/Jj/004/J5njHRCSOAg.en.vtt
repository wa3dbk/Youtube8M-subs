00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
which allowed me to pull off the bezel
more<00:00:51.660> tabs<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> freed<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
more tabs that freed up the back of the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.100 
more tabs that freed up the back of the
housing<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.180> time<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.539> pop<00:00:54.719> out<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
housing then it's time to pop out the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.290 
housing then it's time to pop out the
four<00:00:55.379> gauge<00:00:55.710> needles<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.670> first<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.059> put<00:00:57.239> some

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
four gauge needles but first I put some

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.900 
four gauge needles but first I put some
sticky<00:00:57.719> sided<00:00:58.289> paper<00:00:58.559> underneath<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.520> needle

sticky sided paper underneath the needle

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.279 
sticky sided paper underneath the needle
and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.149> made<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> mark<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.050> make<00:01:01.170> sure

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and then made a mark to make sure

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.810 
and then made a mark to make sure
everything<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.800> aligned<00:01:02.190> when<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.489> put<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
everything was aligned when I put it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
everything was aligned when I put it
back<00:01:02.969> together<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.600> using<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> couple<00:01:04.260> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
back together then using a couple of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.200 
back together then using a couple of
screwdrivers<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:05.309> needles<00:01:05.700> popped<00:01:06.000> off

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
screwdrivers then needles popped off

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.840 
screwdrivers then needles popped off
literally<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.560> popped<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> insert<00:01:08.430> out<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
literally I popped the insert out and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.850 
literally I popped the insert out and
then<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.479> trim<00:01:09.780> ring<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.320> did<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.650> for

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
then the trim ring and I did this for

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.980 
then the trim ring and I did this for
all<00:01:10.890> four<00:01:11.460> needles<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.540> whole<00:01:12.720> top

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
all four needles now that whole top

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.719 
all four needles now that whole top
assembly<00:01:13.350> pulls<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:14.070> off<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> circuit

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
assembly pulls right off the circuit

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.480 
assembly pulls right off the circuit
board<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.540> time<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.840> find<00:01:16.290> our<00:01:16.439> LEDs<00:01:17.009> now

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
board and it's time to find our LEDs now

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460 
board and it's time to find our LEDs now
these<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:17.850> circuit<00:01:18.270> mount<00:01:18.540> LEDs<00:01:19.140> they're

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
these are circuit mount LEDs they're

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.469 
these are circuit mount LEDs they're
really<00:01:19.830> small<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.670> case<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.270> yellow

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
really small and in my case the yellow

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.050 
really small and in my case the yellow
ones<00:01:21.810> were<00:01:22.020> actually<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> white<00:01:23.159> LEDs<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
ones were actually the white LEDs I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
ones were actually the white LEDs I
identified<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> total<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.229> six<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.830> I'd<00:01:25.979> be

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
identified a total of six that I'd be

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
identified a total of six that I'd be
removing<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.880> replacing<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.869> time<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
removing and replacing so time to get to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.319 
removing and replacing so time to get to
it<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.250> I'm<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.640> replacing<00:01:30.030> those

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
it now I'm going to be replacing those

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630 
it now I'm going to be replacing those
plain<00:01:30.720> white<00:01:31.049> ones<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.409> these<00:01:31.710> super<00:01:32.340> bright

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
plain white ones with these super bright

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.920 
plain white ones with these super bright
blue<00:01:33.320> SMD<00:01:34.320> LEDs<00:01:34.920> they<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.759> tiny<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.810> off

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
blue SMD LEDs they are tiny but put off

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
blue SMD LEDs they are tiny but put off
a<00:01:36.960> super<00:01:37.619> bright<00:01:37.920> blue<00:01:38.490> light<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.240> carefully

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
a super bright blue light so I carefully

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.929 
a super bright blue light so I carefully
heated<00:01:40.049> up<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> solder<00:01:40.500> under<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> old<00:01:41.280> LEDs

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
heated up the solder under the old LEDs

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
heated up the solder under the old LEDs
release<00:01:42.750> them<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.500> added<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.979> little<00:01:44.189> bit

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
release them and then added a little bit
