your peak tuck and soon as you start to
come<00:02:25.980> down<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.430> when<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.640> want<00:02:26.790> those<00:02:26.940> hands

to come down for me personally tuck
no-hander<00:02:30.090> zar<00:02:30.810> easiest<00:02:31.770> on<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.070> quarter

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
no-hander zar easiest on the quarter

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.400 
no-hander zar easiest on the quarter
pipe<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:33.300> quarter<00:02:33.540> pipe<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.870> perfect<00:02:34.290> because

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
pipe the quarter pipe is perfect because

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.760 
pipe the quarter pipe is perfect because
you're<00:02:34.980> turning<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.580> you're<00:02:36.470> dropping<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
you're turning and you're dropping the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.410 
you're turning and you're dropping the
handlebars<00:02:38.190> into<00:02:38.670> your<00:02:38.790> lap<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.210> you're

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
handlebars into your lap as you're

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.180 
handlebars into your lap as you're
turning<00:02:39.600> whether<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.260> straight<00:02:40.620> or<00:02:40.770> all

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
turning whether it be straight or all

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.250 
turning whether it be straight or all
you<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.210> just<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.420> perfect<00:02:42.630> feeling<00:02:43.140> it's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
you so it's just a perfect feeling it's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.190 
you so it's just a perfect feeling it's
a<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.980> bit<00:02:44.130> scarier<00:02:44.610> for<00:02:44.850> sure<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:45.930> once

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
a it's a bit scarier for sure but once

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.260 
a it's a bit scarier for sure but once
you<00:02:46.320> got<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.890> motion<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.550> just<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.120> really

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
you got the motion it's just it's really

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.260 
you got the motion it's just it's really
fluid<00:02:49.050> so<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.320> feels<00:02:49.650> great<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.220> once<00:02:51.180> you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
fluid so it feels great and once you

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.360 
fluid so it feels great and once you
figure<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.630> out<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:51.990> easier<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.590> going

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
figure it out it's easier but going

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.680 
figure it out it's easier but going
straight<00:02:53.730> over<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.030> Box<00:02:54.240> jump<00:02:54.450> it's

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
straight over the Box jump it's

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.060 
straight over the Box jump it's
definitely<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.260> lot<00:02:55.410> easier<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.740> figure<00:02:55.920> out

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
definitely a lot easier to figure out

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.340 
definitely a lot easier to figure out
the<00:02:56.100> trick
