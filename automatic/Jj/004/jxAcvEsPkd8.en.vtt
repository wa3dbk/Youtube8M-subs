in<00:00:16.320> Mac<00:00:16.740> for<00:00:17.460> your<00:00:17.580> Raspberry<00:00:18.090> Pi<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:20.240> didn't

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
in Mac for your Raspberry Pi I didn't

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.790 
in Mac for your Raspberry Pi I didn't
know<00:00:21.300> how<00:00:21.420> many<00:00:21.630> people<00:00:21.660> are<00:00:22.080> using<00:00:22.260> Mac's<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
know how many people are using Mac's to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.279 
know how many people are using Mac's to
do<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.449> it's<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.689> little<00:00:25.019> bit<00:00:25.109> more

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
do this so it's a little bit more

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
do this so it's a little bit more
complex<00:00:25.710> than<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.189> Windows<00:00:26.550> maybe

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
complex than it is in Windows maybe

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.040 
complex than it is in Windows maybe
because<00:00:27.150> there's<00:00:27.330> some<00:00:27.570> software<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.019> there

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
because there's some software out there

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.859 
because there's some software out there
for<00:00:28.260> Windows<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:28.740> for<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.480> show<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.599> quick

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
for Windows so for just show this quick

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.380 
for Windows so for just show this quick

things<00:01:56.250> first<00:01:56.340> let's<00:01:57.619> utilities<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.070> open

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
things first let's utilities and open

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.730 
things first let's utilities and open
Disk<00:02:00.570> Utility<00:02:02.119> now<00:02:03.119> we're<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
Disk Utility now we're just going to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.999 
Disk Utility now we're just going to
raise<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:05.040> card<00:02:05.369> quickly<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:07.829> also

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
raise this card quickly and then also

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.029 
raise this card quickly and then also
actually<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.860> thought<00:02:10.860> there's

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
actually on it so I thought there's

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.660 
actually on it so I thought there's
already

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
already

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.080 
already
looks<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.150> it's<00:02:13.270> probably<00:02:13.600> already<00:02:13.750> got

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
looks like it's probably already got

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.130 
looks like it's probably already got
debuting<00:02:16.090> on<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:16.540> we'll<00:02:16.660> just<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.930> raise

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
debuting on it but we'll just to raise

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.980 
debuting on it but we'll just to raise
that<00:02:17.790> we<00:02:18.790> raise<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:19.950> exFAT<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.870> leave

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
that we raise it as exFAT and just leave

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.480

going to do that should remelt the car

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.979 
going to do that should remelt the car
which<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.880> has<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.390> now<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.570> just<00:03:46.630> want<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.930> to

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
run this command again so DF minus H and

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.190 
run this command again so DF minus H and
that'll<00:03:52.450> tell<00:03:52.600> us<00:03:52.690> exactly<00:03:53.250> what<00:03:54.250> disk<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
that'll tell us exactly what disk the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.920 
that'll tell us exactly what disk the
card<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.680> now<00:03:57.010> if<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:57.280> have<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.760> look<00:03:58.000> here<00:03:58.269> you

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
card is now if you have a look here you

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
card is now if you have a look here you
can<00:03:58.959> see<00:03:59.110> this<00:03:59.709> has<00:03:59.980> been<00:04:00.160> added<00:04:00.459> so<00:04:01.560> dev<00:04:02.560> disk

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
can see this has been added so dev disk

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.600 
can see this has been added so dev disk
-<00:04:03.310> s1<00:04:04.269> disk<00:04:04.959> being<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.410> disk<00:04:05.650> s1<00:04:06.220> being<00:04:06.489> the

- s1 disk being the disk s1 being the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.020 
- s1 disk being the disk s1 being the
partition<00:04:08.130> so<00:04:09.130> before<00:04:09.580> I<00:04:09.610> didn't<00:04:09.910> have<00:04:09.940> that

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
partition so before I didn't have that

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.370 
partition so before I didn't have that
this<00:04:10.330> so<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.600> know<00:04:10.690> that's<00:04:10.989> my<00:04:11.260> disk<00:04:11.650> now<00:04:12.549> I

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
this so I know that's my disk now I

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.960 
this so I know that's my disk now I
would<00:04:14.380> expect<00:04:14.799> that<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:15.010> lot<00:04:15.100> of<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.640> will

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
would expect that a lot of this will

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.900 
would expect that a lot of this will
probably<00:04:16.600> read<00:04:17.229> probably<00:04:18.070> read<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.459> disk<00:04:18.669> as

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
probably read probably read the disk as

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.370 
probably read probably read the disk as
this<00:04:19.180> one<00:04:19.479> or<00:04:19.510> something<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:19.959> that<00:04:20.019> if<00:04:20.229> it's

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
this one or something like that if it's

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.140 
this one or something like that if it's
the<00:04:20.500> only<00:04:20.620> other<00:04:20.799> disk<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:21.250> obviously<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:22.000> have

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
the only other disk but obviously I have

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.880 
the only other disk but obviously I have
lots<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.450> dis<00:04:22.600> at<00:04:22.750> home<00:04:22.930> I'm<00:04:23.410> at<00:04:23.710> home

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
lots of dis at home I'm at home

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.890 
lots of dis at home I'm at home
currently<00:04:24.370> so<00:04:25.030> it's<00:04:25.210> showing<00:04:25.390> it

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
currently so it's showing it

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.760 
currently so it's showing it
-<00:04:26.050> is<00:04:26.290> normally<00:04:26.620> probably<00:04:26.860> shown<00:04:27.190> as<00:04:27.310> this<00:04:27.520> one

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
- is normally probably shown as this one

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.020 
- is normally probably shown as this one
so<00:04:29.770> now<00:04:29.800> we've<00:04:30.070> done<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:30.580> know<00:04:30.729> exactly

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
so now we've done that we know exactly

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.350 
so now we've done that we know exactly

going to do is I'm just going to copy
and<00:05:46.090> paste<00:05:46.360> this<00:05:46.570> because<00:05:46.960> it<00:05:47.050> was<00:05:47.139> already

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
and paste this because it was already

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.210

pre-prepared

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.790 
pre-prepared
now<00:05:49.000> this<00:05:49.720> obviously<00:05:49.900> is<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.320> location

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
now this obviously is the location

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.909 
now this obviously is the location
downloads<00:05:51.610> that<00:05:52.030> is<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.419> file<00:05:52.900> name<00:05:52.930> and<00:05:53.500> that

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
downloads that is the file name and that

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.980 
downloads that is the file name and that
is<00:05:54.039> the<00:05:54.220> folder<00:05:54.580> name<00:05:54.760> and<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:55.479> is<00:05:55.599> the<00:05:55.750> file

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
is the folder name and that is the file

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.200 
is the folder name and that is the file
name<00:05:56.020> within<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.620> folder<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.460> dot<00:05:57.669> image

name within the folder the dot image

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.689 
name within the folder the dot image
there<00:05:58.449> and<00:05:58.599> then<00:05:59.139> obviously<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.889> want<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.490> mount

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
there and then obviously I want to mount

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.350 
there and then obviously I want to mount
it<00:06:00.789> onto<00:06:01.000> our<00:06:01.389> disc<00:06:01.930> 2<00:06:02.580> so<00:06:03.580> where<00:06:03.789> I<00:06:03.820> said<00:06:04.120> that

it onto our disc 2 so where I said that

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.000 
it onto our disc 2 so where I said that
we're<00:06:04.570> taking<00:06:04.960> off<00:06:05.169> the<00:06:05.289> s1<00:06:05.680> we're<00:06:05.830> going<00:06:05.949> to

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
we're taking off the s1 we're going to

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.070 
we're taking off the s1 we're going to
add<00:06:06.099> an<00:06:06.220> R<00:06:06.340> in<00:06:06.520> from<00:06:06.789> and<00:06:06.970> you'll<00:06:07.720> have<00:06:07.870> to<00:06:07.990> do

add an R in from and you'll have to do

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.360 
add an R in from and you'll have to do
the<00:06:08.199> same<00:06:08.380> thing<00:06:08.650> for<00:06:08.770> yours<00:06:08.949> once<00:06:09.220> you've
