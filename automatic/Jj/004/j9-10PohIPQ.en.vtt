so<00:00:04.770> in<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.190> scenario<00:00:05.549> kind<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.150> environment

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
so in a scenario kind of environment

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.400 
so in a scenario kind of environment
here<00:00:06.960> what<00:00:07.799> we're<00:00:07.980> talking<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.460> is

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
here what we're talking about is

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.749 
here what we're talking about is
sniffing<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.530> network<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:11.010> big<00:00:11.250> money<00:00:11.460> bank

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
sniffing the network at big money bank

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.570 
sniffing the network at big money bank
and<00:00:12.059> then<00:00:12.540> analyzing<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:14.040> stuff<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.460> we

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
and then analyzing the stuff that we

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.849 
and then analyzing the stuff that we
capture<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.299> looking<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.560> third

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
capture and looking for this third

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.040 
capture and looking for this third
bullet<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.340> absolutely<00:00:17.940> critical<00:00:18.150> combining

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
bullet is absolutely critical combining

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.920 
bullet is absolutely critical combining
what<00:00:19.410> we've<00:00:19.590> analyzed<00:00:20.100> what<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.699> capture<00:00:21.240> with

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
what we've analyzed what we capture with

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.080 
what we've analyzed what we capture with
our<00:00:22.140> sniff<00:00:22.470> combining<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.640> our

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
nefarious network map and your catalog
and<00:00:48.899> I'm<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.710> show<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.920> how<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.280> works

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and I'm going to show you how that works

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.000 
and I'm going to show you how that works
now

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 

so<00:00:53.700> in<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.970> demonstration<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
so in this demonstration I'm going to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.750 
so in this demonstration I'm going to
show<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.290> a<00:00:55.410> couple<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.860> different<00:00:56.220> elements

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
show you a couple of different elements

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.330 
show you a couple of different elements
to<00:00:57.360> network<00:00:57.960> sniffing<00:00:58.470> first<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.040> how<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to network sniffing first of all how to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.540 
to network sniffing first of all how to
actually<00:00:59.610> do<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.420> network<00:01:00.720> sniff<00:01:01.200> in<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:02.190> little

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
actually do a network sniff in a little

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.700 
actually do a network sniff in a little
bit<00:01:02.670> more<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.059> secretive<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.870> ethical

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
bit more of a secretive and ethical

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
bit more of a secretive and ethical
hacking<00:01:04.949> way<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.610> also<00:01:06.180> how<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.570> take<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.930> peek

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
hacking way and also how to take a peek

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.850 
hacking way and also how to take a peek
at<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:08.340> capture<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.690> analyze<00:01:10.259> it<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
at a capture to analyze it for a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.820 
at a capture to analyze it for a
critical<00:01:11.520> piece<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.940> data<00:01:12.290> first<00:01:13.290> off<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.680> get<00:01:13.800> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
critical piece of data first off I get a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.040 
critical piece of data first off I get a
lot<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.100> questions<00:01:14.580> around<00:01:14.759> how<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.750> make

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
lot of questions around how do I make

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.650 
lot of questions around how do I make
sure<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.500> no<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.950> knows<00:01:17.190> that<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.580> am<00:01:18.090> me<00:01:18.420> when

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
sure that no one knows that I am me when

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.960 
sure that no one knows that I am me when
I'm<00:01:18.780> sniffing<00:01:19.380> maybe<00:01:20.220> there's<00:01:20.670> some

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I'm sniffing maybe there's some

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
I'm sniffing maybe there's some
detection<00:01:21.509> technique<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.080> possible<00:01:22.800> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
detection technique it's possible to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
detection technique it's possible to
detect<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.610> types<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.000> passive<00:01:24.390> sniffing

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
detect some types of passive sniffing

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
detect some types of passive sniffing
even<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.289> they're<00:01:25.440> passive<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
even if they're passive so what I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.020 
even if they're passive so what I
typically<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.050> actually<00:01:28.729> change<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
typically do is I actually change the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
typically do is I actually change the
MAC<00:01:30.210> address<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:31.080> I'm<00:01:31.410> assigned<00:01:31.830> on<00:01:32.039> this

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
MAC address that I'm assigned on this

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
MAC address that I'm assigned on this
host<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:33.210> way<00:01:33.450> because<00:01:33.899> it's<00:01:34.080> very<00:01:34.289> easy<00:01:34.440> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
host that way because it's very easy to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.050 
host that way because it's very easy to
spoof<00:01:34.800> an<00:01:34.950> IP<00:01:35.100> address<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.940> little

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
spoof an IP address but it's a little

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
spoof an IP address but it's a little
bit<00:01:36.149> harder<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:36.720> change<00:01:36.899> a<00:01:37.110> Mac<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.649> I<00:01:38.160> get

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
bit harder to change a Mac and I get

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.630 
bit harder to change a Mac and I get
questions<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.590> oftentimes<00:01:40.640> Windows

in most hacking scenarios I'm actually

will help avoid detection by kind of

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.790 
will help avoid detection by kind of
looking<00:02:51.629> like<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.959> belong<00:02:52.260> they're<00:02:52.470> kind<00:02:52.709> of

is<00:02:58.910> certainly<00:02:59.910> going<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.239> be<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.450> potential<00:03:00.989> for

is certainly going to be a potential for
raising<00:03:01.500> flags

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
raising flags

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.140 
raising flags
so<00:03:03.540> once<00:03:03.719> you've<00:03:03.870> changed<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.439> MAC<00:03:04.620> address

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
so once you've changed the MAC address

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.040 
so once you've changed the MAC address
all<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.629> and<00:03:06.780> why

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
all you do and why

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.770 
all you do and why
a shark<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.650> start<00:03:08.490> capturing<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:09.210> click<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
a shark to start capturing is click the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.870 
a shark to start capturing is click the
interface<00:03:10.770> button<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.460> going<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.640> start

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.080 
interface button and it's going to start
a<00:03:11.970> capture<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:13.550> unfortunately<00:03:14.550> it<00:03:14.730> captures

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
a capture and unfortunately it captures

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.360 
a capture and unfortunately it captures
can<00:03:15.270> be<00:03:15.390> really<00:03:15.690> really<00:03:15.960> slow<00:03:16.320> they<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.220> be

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
can be really really slow they can be

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.520 
can be really really slow they can be
really<00:03:17.670> really<00:03:17.820> fast<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.660> just<00:03:18.870> depends<00:03:19.380> on

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
really really fast it just depends on

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.230 
really really fast it just depends on
where<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.010> are<00:03:20.040> what<00:03:20.520> kind<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.790> traffic

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
where you are what kind of traffic

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.880 
where you are what kind of traffic
you're<00:03:21.360> seeing<00:03:21.690> whether<00:03:22.320> you're<00:03:22.590> conducting

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
you're seeing whether you're conducting

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.240 
you're seeing whether you're conducting
an<00:03:23.250> active<00:03:23.730> attack<00:03:24.060> or<00:03:24.300> not<00:03:24.380> so<00:03:25.380> for<00:03:25.890> sake<00:03:26.070> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
an active attack or not so for sake of

Lucy's<00:05:14.830> address<00:05:15.160> right<00:05:15.490> here<00:05:16.620> if<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.740> move<00:05:17.950> this

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
Lucy's address right here if I move this

systems<00:06:00.880> are<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.330> domain<00:06:01.600> controllers<00:06:02.170> and

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
systems are the domain controllers and

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.190 
systems are the domain controllers and
then<00:06:03.340> we've<00:06:03.550> got<00:06:03.790> this<00:06:04.030> success<00:06:04.510> response

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
then we've got this success response

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.640 
then we've got this success response
here<00:06:05.590> and<00:06:05.740> she's<00:06:06.400> also<00:06:06.610> asking<00:06:07.210> for<00:06:07.650> network

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
here and she's also asking for network

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.490 
here and she's also asking for network
time<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.310> we<00:06:09.400> know<00:06:09.640> that<00:06:09.910> in<00:06:10.690> Windows<00:06:11.020> the

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
time and we know that in Windows the

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.040 
time and we know that in Windows the
only<00:06:12.400> systems<00:06:12.880> that<00:06:13.090> she's<00:06:13.270> going<00:06:13.450> to<00:06:13.570> ask<00:06:13.780> for

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
only systems that she's going to ask for

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.710 
only systems that she's going to ask for
Network<00:06:14.320> time<00:06:14.620> are<00:06:15.010> going<00:06:15.220> to<00:06:15.340> be<00:06:15.720> Windows

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
Network time are going to be Windows

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.540 
Network time are going to be Windows
domain<00:06:16.900> controllers<00:06:17.590> so<00:06:17.740> we<00:06:17.860> actually<00:06:18.040> know

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
domain controllers so we actually know

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.630 
domain controllers so we actually know
from<00:06:19.270> all<00:06:19.510> of<00:06:19.690> this<00:06:19.840> traffic<00:06:20.200> that<00:06:21.160> this

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
from all of this traffic that this

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.580 
from all of this traffic that this
target<00:06:22.030> here<00:06:22.240> one<00:06:22.690> ninety<00:06:23.020> two<00:06:23.200> dot<00:06:23.410> one<00:06:23.440> sixty

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
target here one ninety two dot one sixty

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.310 
target here one ninety two dot one sixty
eight<00:06:24.010> dot<00:06:24.160> 10.1<00:06:25.060> oh<00:06:25.090> one<00:06:25.420> is<00:06:25.690> almost

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
eight dot 10.1 oh one is almost

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.230 
eight dot 10.1 oh one is almost
certainly<00:06:26.890> a<00:06:27.010> domain<00:06:27.400> controller<00:06:27.580> because

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
certainly a domain controller because

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.230 
certainly a domain controller because
she's<00:06:28.420> talking<00:06:28.870> LDAP<00:06:29.530> to<00:06:29.770> it<00:06:29.920> and<00:06:30.100> she's<00:06:31.030> also

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
she's talking LDAP to it and she's also

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.980 
she's talking LDAP to it and she's also
talking<00:06:31.570> NDP<00:06:32.350> or<00:06:32.560> NTP<00:06:33.370> rather<00:06:33.610> to<00:06:33.910> it<00:06:34.060> so<00:06:34.870> we

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
talking NDP or NTP rather to it so we

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.990 
talking NDP or NTP rather to it so we
know<00:06:35.170> that<00:06:35.380> we<00:06:35.530> can<00:06:35.740> start<00:06:36.040> then<00:06:36.490> sniffing

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
know that we can start then sniffing

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.660 
know that we can start then sniffing
traffic<00:06:37.510> that<00:06:38.110> goes<00:06:38.350> to<00:06:38.590> and<00:06:38.740> from<00:06:38.950> ten<00:06:39.430> dot

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
traffic that goes to and from ten dot

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.490 
traffic that goes to and from ten dot
101<00:06:40.210> and<00:06:40.420> we're<00:06:40.540> going<00:06:40.780> to<00:06:40.810> find<00:06:41.110> a<00:06:41.200> domain

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
101 and we're going to find a domain

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.650 
101 and we're going to find a domain
controller<00:06:41.650> or<00:06:42.190> we<00:06:42.370> can<00:06:42.550> mount<00:06:42.760> a<00:06:43.030> denial<00:06:43.510> of

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
controller or we can mount a denial of

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.650 
controller or we can mount a denial of
service<00:06:44.020> attack<00:06:44.290> against<00:06:45.360> 10.1<00:06:46.360> oh<00:06:46.390> one

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
service attack against 10.1 oh one

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.000 
service attack against 10.1 oh one
because<00:06:47.020> we<00:06:47.170> know<00:06:47.290> it's<00:06:47.470> a<00:06:47.560> domain<00:06:47.860> controller

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
because we know it's a domain controller

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.430 
because we know it's a domain controller
and<00:06:48.580> attacking<00:06:48.940> that<00:06:49.300> might<00:06:50.050> be<00:06:50.230> beneficial

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
and attacking that might be beneficial

00:06:50.440 --> 00:07:00.100 
and attacking that might be beneficial
to<00:06:51.040> kicking<00:06:51.280> people<00:06:51.760> off<00:06:51.880> the<00:06:52.060> network
