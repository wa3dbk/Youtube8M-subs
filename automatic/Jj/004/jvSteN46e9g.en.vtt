00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
thing you would need to do is if you're

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.130 
thing you would need to do is if you're
going<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.309> hang<00:00:33.520> it<00:00:33.640> on<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.789> door<00:00:33.879> is<00:00:34.449> to<00:00:34.510> do<00:00:34.930> a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
going to hang it on the door is to do a

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.010 
going to hang it on the door is to do a
loop<00:00:35.530> so<00:00:35.949> that<00:00:35.980> it's<00:00:36.250> easily<00:00:36.489> suspended<00:00:37.030> and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
loop so that it's easily suspended and

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.869 
loop so that it's easily suspended and
for<00:00:38.170> this<00:00:38.289> I'm<00:00:38.500> using<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.920> Oasis<00:00:39.340> bind<00:00:39.609> wire

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
for this I'm using the Oasis bind wire

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.630 
for this I'm using the Oasis bind wire
which<00:00:40.239> I<00:00:40.480> love<00:00:40.930> but<00:00:41.559> you<00:00:41.649> can<00:00:41.829> just<00:00:42.070> use<00:00:42.280> twine

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
which I love but you can just use twine

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.930 
which I love but you can just use twine
or<00:00:42.969> you<00:00:43.090> can<00:00:43.269> use<00:00:43.420> string<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.829> I'm<00:00:45.489> just<00:00:45.760> going

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
or you can use string and I'm just going

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.939 
or you can use string and I'm just going
to<00:00:46.000> take<00:00:46.600> it<00:00:46.719> there<00:00:46.899> I'm<00:00:47.079> not<00:00:47.289> indenting<00:00:47.859> it

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
to take it there I'm not indenting it

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.459 
to take it there I'm not indenting it
too<00:00:48.219> heavily<00:00:48.550> into<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.000> foam<00:00:49.239> because<00:00:49.989> I

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
too heavily into the foam because I

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.200 
too heavily into the foam because I
don't<00:00:50.710> want<00:00:50.859> it<00:00:51.039> but<00:00:51.460> it's<00:00:51.640> on<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.760> polystyrene

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
don't want it but it's on a polystyrene

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.340 
don't want it but it's on a polystyrene
base<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.710> can't<00:00:54.039> cut<00:00:54.399> through<00:00:54.640> completely

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
base so it can't cut through completely

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.160 
base so it can't cut through completely
so<00:00:56.350> I<00:00:56.559> loop<00:00:56.769> it<00:00:56.920> together<00:00:57.749> so<00:00:58.749> this<00:00:58.960> would<00:00:59.079> be

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
so I loop it together so this would be

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.930 
so I loop it together so this would be
very<00:00:59.199> secure<00:00:59.980> what's<00:01:00.370> hanging<00:01:00.579> on<00:01:00.789> your

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
very secure what's hanging on your

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.160 
very secure what's hanging on your
doorknob<00:01:01.679> like<00:01:02.679> so<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:04.180> then<00:01:04.570> I'm<00:01:04.809> going<00:01:05.110> to

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
doorknob like so and then I'm going to

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.580 
doorknob like so and then I'm going to
cap<00:01:05.470> just<00:01:06.220> take<00:01:06.579> away<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.180> hard<00:01:07.420> edges<00:01:07.689> by

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
cap just take away the hard edges by

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.100 
cap just take away the hard edges by
going<00:01:08.920> round<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.700> ring<00:01:09.880> like<00:01:10.119> this<00:01:10.360> leaving

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
going round the ring like this leaving

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.249 
going round the ring like this leaving
less<00:01:11.590> foam<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.130> be<00:01:12.310> covered<00:01:13.240> I'm<00:01:13.450> just<00:01:14.020> giving

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
less foam to be covered I'm just giving

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.190 
less foam to be covered I'm just giving
a<00:01:14.350> softer<00:01:14.799> shape<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:15.610> design<00:01:16.000> so<00:01:16.930> ran

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
a softer shape to the design so ran

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
a softer shape to the design so ran
there<00:01:17.439> with<00:01:17.649> a<00:01:17.680> knife

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.849

base and it really is very very good you

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.840 
base and it really is very very good you
must<00:01:31.780> keep<00:01:32.079> it<00:01:32.229> watered<00:01:32.619> if<00:01:32.709> it<00:01:32.799> dries<00:01:33.039> out<00:01:33.310> it

will not be a source of water for your
plant<00:01:36.490> material<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:38.020> there<00:01:38.229> very<00:01:38.560> quickly<00:01:38.799> has

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
plant material so there very quickly has

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.819 
plant material so there very quickly has
gone<00:01:39.280> round<00:01:39.520> like<00:01:39.909> that<00:01:40.469> so<00:01:41.469> this<00:01:41.649> is<00:01:41.709> the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.499 
wreath which I've given a basic covering
of<00:01:44.319> little<00:01:44.649> snippers<00:01:45.009> of<00:01:45.159> conifer<00:01:45.609> and<00:01:46.270> now

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
here I've placed it a little bit - such

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.479 
here I've placed it a little bit - such
a<00:03:11.030> dominant<00:03:11.450> form<00:03:11.810> too<00:03:12.410> far<00:03:12.680> into<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.069> center

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
a dominant form too far into the center

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.759 
a dominant form too far into the center
and<00:03:13.940> we're<00:03:14.120> better<00:03:14.269> if<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.510> do<00:03:14.569> that<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.530> that

and we're better if I do that so that

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.059 
and we're better if I do that so that
they<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:16.190> travel<00:03:16.940> around<00:03:17.120> in<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.450> circle<00:03:18.069> like

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
they I travel around in that circle like

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.240 
they I travel around in that circle like
that<00:03:19.310> cut<00:03:19.819> it<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> little<00:03:20.180> bit<00:03:20.329> shorter<00:03:21.099> down<00:03:22.099> to

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
that cut it a little bit shorter down to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.819 
that cut it a little bit shorter down to
the<00:03:22.340> outside<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:23.360> I'm<00:03:23.989> going<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.319> fill<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.680> the

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.460 
the outside and I'm going to fill in the
roses<00:03:25.220> are<00:03:25.430> large<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.329> sometimes<00:03:27.290> you<00:03:27.349> can

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
roses are large and sometimes you can

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.110

wire through the loop at the bottom of
the<00:04:48.140> boardwalk<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:49.520> I've<00:04:49.610> counted<00:04:49.850> with

length

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.480 
length
well<00:04:51.140> it's<00:04:51.290> called<00:04:51.500> parafilm<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.160> don't<00:04:52.340> have

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490

to<00:04:52.610> use<00:04:52.790> that<00:04:52.820> but<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.600> just<00:04:53.780> disguises<00:04:54.470> Anna

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
to use that but it just disguises Anna

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.310 
to use that but it just disguises Anna
makes<00:04:54.770> it<00:04:55.010> look<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:56.090> easier<00:04:56.600> to<00:04:56.750> use<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.140> hide
