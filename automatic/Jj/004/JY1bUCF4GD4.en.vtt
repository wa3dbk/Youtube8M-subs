 Yes it is Hello everybody Well 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.269
 It is the one of the fuel consumption by the saying of the postscript animation 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.760
 I now 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.250

 The previous video 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.280

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.430
 It was a story but 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:43.250
 Well, where is that flat 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.670
 I'd ran a violent way of me quite that up-and-down by Tteyuu do 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:53.720

 There is no heater and no cooling 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:03.100
 Well, without racing cooling and heating 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.230
 So good 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.070
 With energy 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.070

 Once it has also just be a little smell 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.380
 It is to say Na or fuel consumption rises 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.380
 What 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.470

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.010
 Harute 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:38.920
 Autumn cracks are fine 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.770
 With the possibility of being able to run with fuel efficiency demonstrated here and now 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.409
 Yes 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.490

 It so and is willing to say in quite a fuel economy fuel-efficient if it is possible Well look at this number 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:15.239
 It may be a bit tough in summer and winter, but it's amazing to run well in spring and autumn 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.000
 Thank you for watching if it was a report of year low fuel consumption 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.810
 No 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.630
