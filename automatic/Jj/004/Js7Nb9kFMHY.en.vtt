00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.950 
three-quarters of the size of my thumb
tip<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.370> when<00:00:47.579> using<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.329> down<00:00:48.420> volume

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
tip so when using up and down volume

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.660 
tip so when using up and down volume
rocker<00:00:49.200> itself<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.890> might<00:00:50.070> accidentally

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
rocker itself you might accidentally

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150 
rocker itself you might accidentally
press<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.149> wrong<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:51.660> rather<00:00:52.410> than<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
press the wrong one rather than the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
press the wrong one rather than the
actual<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.820> want<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.239> press<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.989> maybe

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
actual one you want into press so maybe

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.139 
actual one you want into press so maybe
having<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.010> volume<00:00:56.399> rocker<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.850> slightly

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
having the volume rocker is slightly

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.229 
having the volume rocker is slightly
bigger<00:00:57.480> would<00:00:58.469> actually<00:00:58.980> solve<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> problem

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
bigger would actually solve this problem

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
bigger would actually solve this problem
now<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.960> also<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.559> placement<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
now in there and also the placement of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.429 
now in there and also the placement of
the<00:01:02.430> volume<00:01:02.699> rockers<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.629> under<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the volume rockers was right under the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
the volume rockers was right under the
power<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.369> off<00:01:05.549> button<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.090> sometimes

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
power on and off button so sometimes

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.750 
power on and off button so sometimes
when<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> press<00:01:07.020> power<00:01:07.320> off<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:07.890> actually<00:01:08.460> press

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
when I press power off or actually press

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
when I press power off or actually press
the<00:01:08.790> volume<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.720> button<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> bit

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the volume up button which can be a bit

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.770 
the volume up button which can be a bit
of<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> pain<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.610> ass<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
of a pain in the ass but not really a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.570 
of a pain in the ass but not really a
major<00:01:13.020> problem<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:13.770> needed<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.340> here

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
major problem all they needed to do here

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.280 
major problem all they needed to do here
is<00:01:14.850> make<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> volume<00:01:15.509> rocker<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> bit<00:01:16.049> bigger

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
is make the volume rocker a bit bigger

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.520 
is make the volume rocker a bit bigger
and<00:01:16.619> maybe<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.070> different<00:01:17.360> placement<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and maybe a different placement on the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320 
and maybe a different placement on the
phone<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.040> maybe<00:01:20.130> lower<00:01:20.460> down<00:01:20.729> away<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
phone and maybe lower down away from the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.999 
phone and maybe lower down away from the
power<00:01:21.600> button<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> problem<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.979> have

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
power button and that problem would have

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.850 
power button and that problem would have
been<00:01:23.159> solved<00:01:24.020> number<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.409> list<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
been solved number two on my list is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.670 
been solved number two on my list is
using<00:01:26.280> 4k<00:01:26.640> video<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.930> thing<00:01:28.259> actually

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
using 4k video now this thing actually

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920 
using 4k video now this thing actually
gives<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> warning<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.270> using<00:01:30.630> this

minute 4k recording and all of a sudden
it<00:01:40.890> stops<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> very<00:01:42.329> big<00:01:42.570> problem

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it stops this can be a very big problem
