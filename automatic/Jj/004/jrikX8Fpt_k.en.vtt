00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and welcome to the first murder 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.049
 installation video come to play 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.330
 concrete at their 13th 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.679
 So this is the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.790
 version 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.230
 What are we doing first is one 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.840
 to look for a place for the game 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.910
 In my case, it is now the murder 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.660
 at why it used to be good once I hit the motto 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.230
 and unzipped it on their desktop, the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.960
 you have done here 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.640
 two new files readme and yes it has 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.220
 this builds new and quite unimportant 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.220
 is 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.340
 So you have the times and big data now 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.200
 and dear and good 11 file i hope that 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.260
 must also speak like that 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:52.190
 so what you did first you go 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:56.840
 then on your euro firefighter hard drive 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:02.200
 on origin games you have it then 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.610
 on conquer 3 tiberium wars and there 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.030
 first you place the school of 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.720
 file if you have done that 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.630
 her on the court then on the 1.9 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.210
 folder and sets the triumph essence 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.590
 dot-file here 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.250
 if you have done that now too 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.190
 meditate on the config file 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.680
 Here you write between these two 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.520
 that's exactly what they 're writing here 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.600
 I have that again in the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.480
 Just describe it in here 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.140
 can copy 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.570
 so at knitting part like msn point away 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.940
 then you save the config file and 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.570
 that's what it actually was 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:47.470
 you now a mod for the German 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.970
 we install version of windows 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.410
 We'll see you soon, too. I want to 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.710
 give you something to show 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.600
 So we'll see you in the main menu right away 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.440
 so hello and welcome back 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.790
 to the video now you can see that I am now 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.550
 arrived at the main menu 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.900
 if the logo of the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.820
 competition sees then you can 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.910
 be quite sure that the mod right 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.170
 was installed a gameplay video 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.330
 will probably be added at some point 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.010
 but I will not come now 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.780
 spoilers with nine units or 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.040
 models 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.780
 You should do that yourself 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.610
 find out by simply battling it 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.960
 I do not know if the murder is too 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.510
 you can work for the campaign 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.830
 but get out might come now testing 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.360
 thus I come to the end of my videos 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.500
 if you liked the video and 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.860
 helped me there I would 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.480
 happy about a thumb and if 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.060
 we want to support us then give us 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.230
 but an abo that 's it then in front of me 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.230
