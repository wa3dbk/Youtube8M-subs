00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.810
 We honestly thought that this was the 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.410
 opportunity to consecrate us with 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.610
 selection to earn some 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.369
 of power for many 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.779
 maybe there is not very little time left 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:24.230
 selection win something leave a trace 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.939
 within what selection and good but 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.939
 unfortunately we could not do it 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.010
 to be honest 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.870
 we are very very hurt by all this 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.079
 because because we had a lot of expectation 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.130
 of being able to win we thought that this was going to 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.610
 be 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:47.520
 the cup for us because of how they had 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.560
 given the things and good nothing now 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.450
 we were not given anything 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.550
 and the truth that hurts a lot we talked 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.020
 with maché and he said is pitiful 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 because we come insinuating and we come 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.690
 doing things well and has the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.280
 football is not always about 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.950
 merit but in this case yes there is 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.900
 clear merit that they wanted to get there 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.580
 to a final they wanted to reverse what was 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.840
 what had been in the world cup with 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.730
 germany and we say they have no luck 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.520
 let's say it was the possibility that 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.010
 we had 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 in quotes of power 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.460
 with the people of what there was what 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.180
 had happened in the world that neither 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.130
 we had been lucky for me 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.120
 and today we are again with this 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.450
 bitter taste like 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.310
 with thinking that for many there will not be 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.950
 another possibility d 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.450
 to be able to get something important with the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.110
 selection and the truth that hurts hurts 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.180
 why 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.120
 because we had what I told you before 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.430
 expectations because we thought that this 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.550
 was 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.500
 the opportunity to be able to earn something and 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.160
 of power 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.760
 and give something to people and to us 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.100
 same as we expected so much and 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.140
 we needed and unfortunately he has not 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.180
 happened you know what king said to you in 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 press conference yes yes until yesterday 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.810
 was all barbarian that does not have why 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.850
 change and that I wanted to continue counting on 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.950
 the same 23 is a time for 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.390
 reflect or you have to remain in 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.500
 the selection has to keep getting 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.270
 in front you have to continue being 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.990
 hard head so that this in some 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.080
 moment is cut I think in part 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.459
 you have to continue by the fact that in 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.800
 some time there will be guys who do not 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.660
 they will be more and that those who come 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.960
 they have to try 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.540
 when they come to absorb that which is 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.150
 has created I think it's very good 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.440
 unfortunately from the side 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.940
 sports we have not achieved things but 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.630
 we are very good in terms of values ​​to 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 human groups 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.680
 athletically I think also that we 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.020
 missing that little step to get something but 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.480
 well hopefully what comes what goes to 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.700
 be the continuation of this for what 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.760
 are for what you have to continue to 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.700
 those who will come 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.650
 for those who will come, I think it's going 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.540
 to be important to last you are part 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.700
 very important a fabulous group of 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.920
 pibes 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.920
 all the cheeses from within 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.849
 what is the heart of the selection 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.310
 someone who is very important is leo is 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.390
 your friend and I am I saw it of course that 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.340
 you can not live the pain of each 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.519
 person but I see him dead dejected 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.709
 because he was perhaps the most expected 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.000
 take this out and say good we win something 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.430
 with the selection would have changed everything 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.150
 his prize is left alone and 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.280
 of speech that supports it because I think that 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.590
 that beyond 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.140
 of the ambition that we all have so much 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.120
 him like all the other players that 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.180
 today they integrate the selection of being able to win 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.990
 something and I think part of it frustrates her 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.930
 frustration of not being able to do it 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.330
 maybe it's one of the ones that you feel it most 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.940
 by a fact of the pressure that implies 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.070
 be messi and play in the national team 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.620
 Argentina many are going to tell us and what 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.750
 pressure me if it's the best player and the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.780
 true that it is like that but but good 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:22.220
 time one with those things is self-pressed 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.190
 and he thought like all of us that 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.410
 that this was going to be the cup the cup and 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.080
 what was going 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.480
 to consecrate and the truth that 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.820
 unfortunately no no no it was not like that but 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.590
 well I think leo is also a boy 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.600
 that has a lot of time in selection and 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.580
 surely 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.100
 at some point it's going to win 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.270
 because the reality is that all 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.260
 Sometimes you can not throw badly for us 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.260
 thanks for having
