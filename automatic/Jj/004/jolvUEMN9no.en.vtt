00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello my friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.550
 I'm currently on vacation in 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.380
 Calabria and exactly where I am 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.040
 Almost 30 years each year for two three 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.049
 Weeks , we go a bit like that 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.250
 whole building so everything can be on top of each other 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.050
 Not with German architectural style 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.650
 compare so a bit of anarchy 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.269
 announced here and there I am already 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.019
 over 30 years I go there for two to 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.810
 three weeks 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.990
 why my father has his roots here 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.579
 that means he was born here 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.710
 my mother is German, I'm in 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.079
 Germany born but here you can see 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.090
 a bit like the whole looks 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.340
 I live like any up here goes here 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 the whole one floor higher than it is here 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 Also a very poor village when I go to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.440
 for cameras show here for example is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.800
 that's one 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.850
 a hit was a good friend 94 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.620
 years old and yes he's out here 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 every evening or every afternoon 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.840
 was carved here was really nice 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.850
 things and the friends were outside 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.360
 act big talk and tub giants 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.860
 action 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.229
 Now it is a few weeks ago 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.390
 died a great pity because it too 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.290
 was friend of mine and stays here for 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.520
 to live me a little bit that is 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.900
 I get a lot more with that means me 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 know the people here from the area 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.430
 is also an area where probably already 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.420
 very long there are many hundreds 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.390
 years 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.200
 and what 's interesting is that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.110
 especially a bit loud that they are ahead 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.460
 About 100 years ago, everything is still here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.900
 the road have thrown that is 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.549
 There were no real toilets 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.909
 the or warm ones have the animals 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.380
 Slept and these are my roots 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.720
 I always say I do not need extreme 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 luxury year is enough if i if i 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.280
 come back to my roots here and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 it's such a great time for me to refuel 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.630
 So here I will be one again 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.189
 I can not get it down 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.770
 quite as successful to order 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.240
 how do you say the best most successful 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.340
 to be here, but here you are 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.530
 Arrives and you are just here and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.300
 I like that here for example 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.160
 you go back there like that too 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.090
 everything looks very run down 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.130
 this was before before 15 years ago 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.170
 In the meantime, there was also a business 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.390
 of course everything to because the older 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.470
 People dying out here is a pity 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.660
 but it's just that's where I am 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.000
 born where my father was born like that 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.640
 Roots and it is a nice thing and 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.440
 Here too I have many friends with the 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.840
 I then meet every evening at noon 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.420
 in the afternoon there are more fruits left 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.370
 a bit at home a bit 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.140
 I wanted to chat with you 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.459
 give a small insight where I actually 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.769
 always spend a holiday like me 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.780
 do not need a luxury holiday is enough for me 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.160
 Here's the roots 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.980
 People really go back 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.510
 to see again and of course you experience 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.250
 again and again sad things 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.510
 who now here with the older gentleman of 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.130
 94 years but was really one 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.700
 absolute joyfulness and the people that 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.500
 I think it's cool 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.910
 they can do very little, so yes 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.260
 if you look a bit with the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.150
 world busy one knows that in 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.480
 Italy is quite a financial crisis 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.350
 and down in Calabria it is like that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.820
 we are really warm so have the 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:26.280
 less often high to Milan rome 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.170
 or or turin work there because they 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.280
 because there is no money here 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.810
 and that's why everything is 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.239
 I am here now in august that is 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.600
 it is also relatively full in this normal 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:40.049
 village here are in winter 7 800 people and 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.820
 In the summer , three and a half 4000 people are rehabilitating 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.829
 Nevertheless, everything is relatively empty 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.400
 More and more people are dying here 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.409
 around the corner so 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.730
 it is getting emptier and it is 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.629
 really a pity because it is there 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:58.610
 pretty story but so is the 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:04:00.530
 just stop things change and 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.209
 I noticed it at home over me 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.959
 It's like that, that's me 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.459
 Everything is very fast and you go 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.560
 when wet person dies then you have it 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.909
 within a short time again 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.409
 forget because everyday life is between 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.629
 catch up and here you are somehow man 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.609
 here comes the time stops 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.650
 you can think about many things 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.389
 Talk a lot to people and I have to go all the way 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.919
 honestly say that here in this 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.590
 Two three weeks where I am the people 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.150
 get to know each other very well because you 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.340
 afternoon with the people spends the 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.229
 friends spend the evening again in the evening 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.120
 a lot of time and I think so 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.729
 It's pretty cool in Italy 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.310
 you just go out there is a street 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.539
 because you meet then probably ever 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.949
 There one goes to meet his other 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.210
 friends just below 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.740
 But what is not there in germany? 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.199
 you said on the phone he is you have 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.669
 to get there and then you meet 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.900
 But here you need to be on the phone 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.050
 you just go out in the evening to see them 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.639
 friends and then it's a funny one 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.120
 Being together talks about everything 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.800
 possible 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.660
 and that I lack a little bit in 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.199
 germany this this loose there 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.060
 his 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.389
 yes that's it from my own 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.010
 insight here in calabria you have 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.610
 are you in front of my private page 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.080
 We met at the meeting 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.090
 next video again take care to 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.090
