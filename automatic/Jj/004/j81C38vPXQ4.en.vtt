00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
guys guess what that's 8 less on the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.140 
guys guess what that's 8 less on the
forefront<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.920> just<00:02:17.070> ran<00:02:17.250> back<00:02:17.430> most<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
forefront that just ran back most of

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.000 
forefront that just ran back most of
which<00:02:18.330> probably<00:02:19.020> got<00:02:19.230> shot<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.590> back<00:02:19.770> and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
which probably got shot in the back and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.260 
which probably got shot in the back and
you're<00:02:20.190> probably<00:02:20.460> never<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.120> recover

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
you're probably never going to recover

you're probably never going to recover
that<00:02:22.260> position<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.920> highly<00:02:23.190> defendable
