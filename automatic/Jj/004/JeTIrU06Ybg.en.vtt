00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.899
 the video pencil to give you some tips 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.179
 When are you going to make your HD antenna? 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.219
 this is the project that today 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.660
 currently to make the antenna it is 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.700
 very good 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.210
 measurements are in inches but it is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.580
 easy to follow the scheme here with 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.420
 you're going to get lucky as eight 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 inches 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.869
 the distance between them is 5 inches 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.420
 and three quarters to thirty-five and thirty- five inches and 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.930
 three rooms and here too 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.520
 the distance between one and the other are 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.750
 two and a half inches and the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.920
 piece that gives me to see is 3 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.820
 inches 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.160
 after tracing in the wood or where 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:58.859
 Are you going to do it like this? 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 and that this 5 - 3 453 4 534 12 6 have 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.400
 traced timber which was made which 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.960
 will be arrested 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.240
 I 've been central to where I 'm going. 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.140
 hold a stuck balÃº that you will use 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.340
 here was an antenna that was almost 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.680
 ready 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.740
 that's where I left that can show 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.380
 this Wednesday if you do not want a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.990
 I support nothing when you have understood 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.150
 run away she will do this and that too 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.939
 turned out to be dismantling a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.460
 disaster then it 's good you support do 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.299
 something a support any foot yes 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.040
 put there behind support like this 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.840
 when you tighten the screw mark 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.619
 firm here isolated 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.780
 the two parts instance above as in 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:01.549
 points out that since there can be no 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.310
 leftover wire to disrupt the signal is 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.849
 advice you bow points that there is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.869
 Yes, but it will be a support and will not 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.519
 leave no tip left 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.230
 will support you when you 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:21.099
 riding will help you a lot in the assembly 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.750
 here you can already see the line at 8 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.090
 inches to measure 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.890
 and here if you do not have the balloon to 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.980
 ride, no problem, you can ride 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:36.489
 I trust it will work the same way 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.110
 It's the same thing in and and the ending here is 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.329
 good to tie your son does not stay 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.390
 dropping noisy balance if you already 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.459
 mounts on time as you wire 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.400
 for use can be any amy 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.489
 until that air next year glued to the television 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.129
 Cable knows that neither side is stuck 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.040
 he had the movie here but he 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.930
 it's great to have a signal that can be 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.849
 now more goals will give more work 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.099
 copper wire 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.620
 It will depend on the material that has not 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.290
 problem can cause this 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.670
 antenna is to ensure hd signal 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.819
 here at home I use 36 channel hd 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.209
 great 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.209
 thanks
