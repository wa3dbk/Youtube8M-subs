little<00:00:59.309> fix<00:00:59.579> their<00:00:59.879> let's<00:01:00.329> drop<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.870> menu<00:01:01.379> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
little fix their let's drop down menu is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.460 
little fix their let's drop down menu is
a<00:01:03.619> very<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.900> starting<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.080> tell<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
a very I think it's starting to tell it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.020 
a very I think it's starting to tell it
looks<00:01:07.650> very<00:01:07.770> dark<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.640> take<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.880> too

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
looks very dark so don't take it too

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.880 
looks very dark so don't take it too
transparent<00:01:09.270> at<00:01:09.750> all<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.380> got<00:01:10.590> quite<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
transparent at all but it's got quite a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.429 
transparent at all but it's got quite a
bit<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> option<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.500> on<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:16.259> we

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
bit of option here on on it so and if we

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.010 
bit of option here on on it so and if we
kill<00:01:16.619> everything<00:01:16.920> off<00:01:18.350> we're<00:01:19.350> running<00:01:19.610> 285<00:01:20.610> 3

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
kill everything off we're running 285 3

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.570 
kill everything off we're running 285 3
286<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:25.320> downside<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
286 so the downside to it is it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.270 
286 so the downside to it is it
currently<00:01:26.970> right<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:28.250> working<00:01:29.250> for

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
currently right now is not working for

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
currently right now is not working for
4G<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.950> 3d<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:34.880> try<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.659> do<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> lot

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
4G or 3d so I try to get on and do a lot

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 
4G or 3d so I try to get on and do a lot
of<00:01:37.079> my<00:01:37.259> downloading<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.950> 4G<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.759> download

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
of my downloading on 4G and I download

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.660 
of my downloading on 4G and I download
rom<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.840> kind<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> use<00:01:41.430> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
rom so I kind of I was going to use it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.960
