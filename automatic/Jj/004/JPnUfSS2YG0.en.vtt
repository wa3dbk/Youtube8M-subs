00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
so what I've got here is a PlayStation

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.509 
so what I've got here is a PlayStation
that<00:00:09.530> has<00:00:10.600> the<00:00:11.600> dreaded<00:00:12.110> red<00:00:13.010> light<00:00:13.309> of<00:00:13.340> death

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
that has the dreaded red light of death

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.600 
that has the dreaded red light of death
yellow<00:00:14.150> light<00:00:14.450> of<00:00:14.480> death<00:00:15.160> whatever<00:00:16.160> you<00:00:16.460> want

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
yellow light of death whatever you want

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.440 
yellow light of death whatever you want
to<00:00:16.760> call<00:00:17.000> it<00:00:17.180> and<00:00:18.160> when<00:00:19.160> I<00:00:19.340> switch<00:00:19.670> it<00:00:19.880> on

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
to call it and when I switch it on

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.490 
to call it and when I switch it on
you'll<00:00:21.140> see<00:00:21.699> yep<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.970> red<00:00:23.180> lights<00:00:23.500> shining

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
you'll see yep the red lights shining

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:32.650 
you'll see yep the red lights shining
there<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:27.189> when<00:00:28.189> we<00:00:28.310> go<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.490> start<00:00:28.970> it<00:00:29.090> up<00:00:31.660> see

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
there and when we go to start it up see

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.610 
there and when we go to start it up see
it<00:00:32.750> went<00:00:33.879> green<00:00:35.530> then<00:00:36.530> it<00:00:36.559> flashed<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:37.850> then

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
it went green then it flashed and then

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.539 
it went green then it flashed and then
went<00:00:39.620> red<00:00:40.360> so<00:00:41.620> basically<00:00:42.620> that<00:00:42.890> motherboard

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:43.549 
went red so basically that motherboard

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:46.410 
went red so basically that motherboard
is<00:00:44.049> gone

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
is gone

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.539 
is gone
so<00:00:47.420> we've<00:00:48.409> already<00:00:48.589> showed<00:00:48.949> you<00:00:49.070> how<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.220> open

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
so we've already showed you how to open

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.600 
so we've already showed you how to open
the<00:00:49.820> console<00:00:50.530> and<00:00:51.530> I<00:00:51.769> want<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:52.100> do<00:00:52.250> is<00:00:52.400> show<00:00:52.580> you

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
the console and I want to do is show you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.119 
the console and I want to do is show you
how<00:00:52.729> to<00:00:52.909> take<00:00:53.629> your<00:00:53.780> motherboard<00:00:54.080> eight<00:00:54.440> and

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
how to take your motherboard eight and

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.939 
how to take your motherboard eight and
another<00:00:55.269> motherboard<00:00:56.269> back<00:00:56.479> in<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:57.680> first

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
another motherboard back in the first

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.280 
another motherboard back in the first
thing<00:00:58.159> to<00:00:58.250> do<00:00:58.400> obviously<00:00:58.580> is<00:00:59.119> to<00:00:59.449> switch<00:01:00.080> off

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
thing to do obviously is to switch off

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.590 
thing to do obviously is to switch off
the<00:01:00.440> part<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.089> unplug<00:01:02.089> it<00:01:02.830> and<00:01:03.830> then<00:01:04.600> remove

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
the part and unplug it and then remove

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.880 
the part and unplug it and then remove
the<00:01:05.780> cable<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:06.770> let's<00:01:07.670> see<00:01:07.970> if<00:01:08.030> work<00:01:08.390> on<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:09.680> I

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
the cable so let's see if work on and I

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.429 
the cable so let's see if work on and I
what<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:10.280> need<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.579> do<00:01:10.899> I'll<00:01:11.899> leave<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.320> this

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
what you need to do I'll leave it this

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
what you need to do I'll leave it this
way<00:01:12.590> round<00:01:12.979> is<00:01:15.490> remove<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:20.270> blu-ray

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.960 

when<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.830> by<00:01:26.369> simply<00:01:26.700> lifting

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
when we do that just by simply lifting

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.280 
when we do that just by simply lifting
it<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:28.259> removing<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.890> power<00:01:29.159> cable<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:31.080> lift

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it and removing the power cable you lift

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.030 
it and removing the power cable you lift
it<00:01:31.439> further<00:01:32.509> underneath<00:01:33.649> there's<00:01:34.649> a<00:01:34.770> little

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it further underneath there's a little

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:46.160 
it further underneath there's a little
clip<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.580> that<00:01:37.549> disengages<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:44.600> variable<00:01:45.600> no

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
clip and that disengages the variable no

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.070 
clip and that disengages the variable no
on<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.430> bottom<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:47.909> blu-ray<00:01:48.240> there's<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
on the bottom of your blu-ray there's a

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.870 
on the bottom of your blu-ray there's a
little<00:01:49.350> circuit<00:01:49.740> board<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.640> called

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
little circuit board and this is called

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.090 
little circuit board and this is called
the<00:01:54.000> logic<00:01:54.390> board<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.289> matched<00:01:55.680> or

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the logic board and it's matched or

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.969 
the logic board and it's matched or
paired<00:01:56.330> with<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.539> motherboard<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.319> Tampa

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
paired with the motherboard the Tampa

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.370 
paired with the motherboard the Tampa
can't<00:01:59.220> be<00:01:59.369> separated<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.179> when<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:00.840> buy<00:02:01.050> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
can't be separated so when you buy a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.330 
can't be separated so when you buy a
motherboard<00:02:02.929> from<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.110> site<00:02:04.380> you'll<00:02:05.130> also

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
motherboard from the site you'll also

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.059 
motherboard from the site you'll also
get<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.270> paired<00:02:06.659> logic<00:02:07.619> board

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
get the paired logic board

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.370 
get the paired logic board
so<00:02:08.399> you'll<00:02:08.549> need<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.880> change<00:02:09.149> both<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:10.140> for

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
so you'll need to change both but for

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.250 
so you'll need to change both but for
the<00:02:10.470> moment<00:02:10.819> we'll<00:02:11.819> get<00:02:12.299> on<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:12.480> removing

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the moment we'll get on with removing

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.559 
the moment we'll get on with removing
the<00:02:14.090> motherboard<00:02:15.090> from<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:16.040> console<00:02:17.040> case

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
the motherboard from the console case

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:25.220 
the motherboard from the console case
so<00:02:19.340> next<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.549> need<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:21.319> kick<00:02:22.319> off<00:02:23.840> or<00:02:24.840> remove

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
so next we need to kick off or remove

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.680 
so next we need to kick off or remove
this<00:02:25.440> cable<00:02:25.890> I'm<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> move<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.180> cable

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
this cable I'm going to move that cable

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.840 
this cable I'm going to move that cable
and<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.530> came<00:02:28.829> up<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.160> they<00:02:29.250> just<00:02:29.280> simply

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
and that came up and they just simply

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.580 
and that came up and they just simply
slip<00:02:30.480> out<00:02:31.549> take<00:02:32.549> off<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.910> aerial<00:02:33.410> that's<00:02:34.410> at

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
slip out take off the aerial that's at

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.130 
slip out take off the aerial that's at
the<00:02:34.709> back<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.380> Bluetooth<00:02:37.590> aerial<00:02:39.140> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
the back this is a Bluetooth aerial and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.440 
the back this is a Bluetooth aerial and
just<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.709> Clemson's<00:02:41.430> little<00:02:41.790> socket<00:02:42.060> there

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
just on Clemson's little socket there

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.430 
just on Clemson's little socket there
put<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.350> one<00:02:43.470> side<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.989> we've<00:02:46.200> said

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
put that to one side and as we've said

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.319 
put that to one side and as we've said
the<00:02:46.500> other<00:02:46.769> videos<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.489> make<00:02:47.760> sure<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.030> you

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
the other videos just make sure that you

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.199 
the other videos just make sure that you
put<00:02:48.600> all<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.079> screws<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.709> bits<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.040> pieces

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
put all the screws and bits and pieces

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.920 
put all the screws and bits and pieces
and<00:02:52.100> such<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> way<00:02:53.430> or<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.910> an<00:02:54.060> order<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.600> you

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
and such a way or in an order that you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.920 
and such a way or in an order that you
know<00:02:55.049> where<00:02:55.260> they<00:02:55.410> go<00:02:55.530> back<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:56.209> don't<00:02:57.209> have<00:02:57.630> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
know where they go back I don't have to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.340 
know where they go back I don't have to
as<00:02:58.320> a<00:02:58.380> safe<00:02:59.299> I've<00:03:00.299> done<00:03:00.570> this<00:03:00.750> hundreds<00:03:01.230> of

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
as a safe I've done this hundreds of

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.759
