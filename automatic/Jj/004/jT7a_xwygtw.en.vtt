00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.010
 he 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.750
 the time should be for the main child 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.790
 here android block together with one more 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.560
 online day care mode after you complete 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.630
 with break mode 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.430
 now this template is very simple but 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.099
 it is very useful to it can saw 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.630
 remove some armor and even some 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.779
 some weapons even from the furniture that 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.330
 they are born with him sometimes, then they are not ambon 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.220
 that seems to book then second regis book 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.040
 Can you catch it then look at health 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.750
 through an iron ladder and 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.280
 of four bars of iron that way 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.960
 similar to s 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.080
 I'm taking ours, it's good to play. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.519
 let's use some lobbying asked 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.129
 For people on twitter and they told me 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.440
 that only I need this type of motor 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.299
 so in radiohead mode right? 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.369
 so this way it's kind of useful 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:01:00.250
 so way domain area building looks 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.250
 I 'm just going to hit you guys. 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.580
 clicking it or knocking it just looks at it 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.619
 exchange all he VIEC mature cua or 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.240
 own weapon in the case and it looks 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.340
 I need a zombie and he's without a 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.369
 Anyway, we do not get him. 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.710
 so the armor is in perfect condition 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.080
 Look, you see, in this writing, only 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.040
 with bow even he exchanged the IMF was 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.710
 perfect state 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.610
 I do not know if it comes how it can be 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.260
 charmed 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.440
 I do not know the type or if sometimes the 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:33.250
 when 19 comes because he has enchanted 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.260
 in fact with 4 enchanted it turns purple but 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.220
 he trooped and in perfect condition I found 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.840
 cool 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.840
 something else, that troop of the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.940
 own jungmann sp from here main 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.820
 We are 11 and will see here 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.890
 Can you get a zombie look here? 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.350
 owner then he came to 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.000
 Hell, just the bass he could get 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.150
 this armor of xinguara that people 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.040
 Can not pick up the rug is normal 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.400
 so without any fashion network, right? 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.229
 So I thought it was cool, even if it did not. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.870
 Be a very simple name but I found 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.550
 very useful table and do not over do this 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.319
 You now the guys beyond the two 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.599
 videos more videos in some ways 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.060
 then said that the comments would 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.430
 You want to like this idea . 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.450
 several videos with odd school days but 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.519
 very short, right? 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.770
 not by chance the 65 had a video and a 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.819
 template there I did not like 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.890
 currently the edict and after the 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.240
 disclosure in the video beauty assessment 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.210
 then that's it 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.000
 guys said what do you think a blow it 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.470

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.850
 When you click here, you do not like it. 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.520
 normal without disability 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.540
 they put me the good one say a check 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.290

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.290
