00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.190 
some of the cosmetic appointments really
make<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.430> first<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.420> foremost<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:54.079> my

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
make it so first and foremost in my

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.319 
make it so first and foremost in my
opinion<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.920> cream<00:02:55.579> binding<00:02:55.939> around<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
opinion the cream binding around the

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.660 
opinion the cream binding around the
fingerboard<00:02:56.659> I<00:02:57.049> think<00:02:57.349> it's<00:02:57.500> just<00:02:57.680> having<00:02:58.129> the

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
fingerboard I think it's just having the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.550 
fingerboard I think it's just having the
