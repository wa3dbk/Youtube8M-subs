00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.640
 month isabelle martinet then it seems 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.470
 that we can recycle it's good on this 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.440
 phone and that can bring us a 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.719
 little money a little way that much 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.070
 depends actually the finding is very 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.570
 simple today the mobile phone 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.100
 has become iran inevitable 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.110
 a lot of services 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.600
 we have a technology that is progressing in 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.970
 permanence we have competition that 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.440
 increases between brands marks eh 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.300
 well we are solicited very 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.170
 regularly by news that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.000
 arrive on the market 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.710
 and if formerly have changed phone 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.410
 every three years on average 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.809
 today it's all 12 to 18 months 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.309
 so he is selling 20 million 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.870
 mobile phones a year and if we 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.359
 count all those who are in circulation 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.370
 we no longer have a cell phone 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.399
 inhabitants because we sometimes have 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.870
 several per person so what he 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.579
 must be understood is that as we 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.530
 change more often we have become accustomed 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.780
 to no longer let our phones sleep 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.089
 laptops in drawers but from 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.289
 sell for two reasons first saada 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.640
 finance the next because today 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.920
 mobile phones are still 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.260
 expensive and then his phones have a 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.940
 technology that really allows to offer 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.950
 a second life to products 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.900
 all this to tell you that there is in 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.090
 france to brive la gaillarde a 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.090
 company that buys the phones 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.700
 the data elite renovates them 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.620
