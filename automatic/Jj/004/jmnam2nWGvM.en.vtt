them all so let's go ahead and try to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.979 
them all so let's go ahead and try to
find<00:00:34.469> nice<00:00:34.620> base<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> attack<00:00:35.390> this<00:00:36.390> record<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
find nice base to attack this record the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.680 
find nice base to attack this record the
video<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.980> first<00:00:38.280> two<00:00:38.460> bases<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.360> found

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
video so the first two bases I found

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.780 
video so the first two bases I found
where<00:00:40.040> were<00:00:41.040> quite<00:00:41.280> good

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
where were quite good

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
where were quite good
well<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.260> skipped<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.860> one

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
well this one I think I skipped this one

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.029 
well this one I think I skipped this one
because<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.579> had<00:00:44.820> quite<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> minds<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:47.010> I

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
because it had quite a lot of minds so I

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.049 
because it had quite a lot of minds so I
had<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> next<00:00:47.489> one

are<00:04:05.519> not<00:04:05.639> helpful<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.329> don't<00:04:06.510> know<00:04:06.690> why

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
are not helpful and so I don't know why

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.629 
are not helpful and so I don't know why
I'm<00:04:07.170> used<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.590> there<00:04:07.739> anyway

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
I'm used it there anyway

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.729 
I'm used it there anyway
it<00:04:09.150> wasn't<00:04:09.569> difficult<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:10.079> destroy<00:04:10.560> this

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
it wasn't difficult to destroy this

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.150 
it wasn't difficult to destroy this
highscores<00:04:11.549> is<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:11.970> very<00:04:12.419> quick<00:04:12.859> open<00:04:13.859> for<00:04:14.099> the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
highscores is so very quick open for the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.379 
highscores is so very quick open for the
win<00:04:14.359> some<00:04:15.359> more<00:04:15.510> explosions<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.289> I<00:04:16.620> did<00:04:16.919> get

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
win some more explosions and I did get

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.500 
win some more explosions and I did get
four<00:04:18.389> of<00:04:18.510> these<00:04:18.660> gems<00:04:20.209> sometimes<00:04:21.209> you<00:04:21.359> can

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
four of these gems sometimes you can

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.550 
four of these gems sometimes you can
SWAT<00:04:21.750> sometimes<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:22.320> don't<00:04:22.440> get<00:04:22.620> any

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
SWAT sometimes you don't get any

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.830 
SWAT sometimes you don't get any
it's<00:04:24.280> very<00:04:24.460> difficult<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:24.940> find<00:04:25.180> those<00:04:25.389> the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
it's very difficult to find those the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.460 
it's very difficult to find those the
ice<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:27.130> highest<00:04:27.550> gems<00:04:27.820> those<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:29.020> boost<00:04:29.320> up

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
ice the highest gems those that boost up

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.820 
ice the highest gems those that boost up
your<00:04:29.620> defenses<00:04:30.930> but<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.350> do<00:04:32.470> find<00:04:32.740> them

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
your defenses but you do find them

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.450 
your defenses but you do find them
somehow

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
somehow

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.990 
somehow
so<00:04:34.090> right<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.200> next<00:04:35.440> base<00:04:35.560> he<00:04:35.830> had<00:04:36.010> most<00:04:36.880> of

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
so right to the next base he had most of

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.820 
so right to the next base he had most of
his<00:04:37.060> mines<00:04:37.360> well<00:04:37.660> actually<00:04:37.870> all<00:04:38.050> his<00:04:38.410> mines<00:04:38.620> in

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
his mines well actually all his mines in

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.370 
his mines well actually all his mines in
front<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.280> base<00:04:39.750> trying<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.870> protect<00:04:41.169> it

front of the base trying to protect it

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.860 
front of the base trying to protect it
so<00:04:42.010> I<00:04:42.040> found<00:04:42.340> this<00:04:42.490> site<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:42.940> corner<00:04:43.389> I<00:04:43.540> took

back to it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.300 
back to it
to<00:05:42.820> my<00:05:42.970> home<00:05:43.660> base<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:45.490> I've<00:05:45.729> got<00:05:45.970> my<00:05:46.690> mind<00:05:47.310> up

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
to my home base and I've got my mind up

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.240 
to my home base and I've got my mind up
creating<00:05:48.669> to<00:05:49.000> level<00:05:49.330> 12<00:05:49.810> which<00:05:50.650> it's<00:05:51.010> going<00:05:51.130> to

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
creating to level 12 which it's going to

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.630 
creating to level 12 which it's going to
take<00:05:51.400> seven<00:05:51.789> hours<00:05:52.120> I<00:05:53.100> want<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.280> upgrade<00:05:54.430> my

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
take seven hours I want to upgrade my

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.909 
take seven hours I want to upgrade my
warriors<00:05:55.330> next<00:05:55.660> but<00:05:56.140> it<00:05:56.260> takes<00:05:56.410> quite<00:05:56.680> a<00:05:56.740> lot

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
warriors next but it takes quite a lot

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.580 
warriors next but it takes quite a lot
of<00:05:56.979> research<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.640> can<00:05:57.729> see<00:05:57.910> 1.6<00:05:58.750> million

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
of research you can see 1.6 million

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.850 
of research you can see 1.6 million
goats<00:06:00.060> so<00:06:01.169> it's<00:06:02.169> not<00:06:02.320> going<00:06:02.530> to<00:06:02.590> be<00:06:02.680> in<00:06:02.770> the

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
goats so it's not going to be in the

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.980 
goats so it's not going to be in the
near<00:06:02.979> future<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.580> that's<00:06:04.330> my<00:06:04.539> look<00:06:04.720> at<00:06:04.840> that

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
near future and that's my look at that

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.240 
near future and that's my look at that
rocket<00:06:05.200> launcher<00:06:05.620> I'm<00:06:05.800> gonna<00:06:05.950> start

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
rocket launcher I'm gonna start

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.850 
rocket launcher I'm gonna start
upgrading<00:06:06.520> my<00:06:07.210> boom<00:06:08.169> cannon<00:06:08.440> because<00:06:08.680> it's

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
upgrading my boom cannon because it's
