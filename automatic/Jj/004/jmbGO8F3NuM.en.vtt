just gonna call in this person here they
couldn't<00:00:19.490> get<00:00:19.780> the<00:00:20.780> auger<00:00:21.080> wasn't<00:00:21.800> spinning

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
couldn't get the auger wasn't spinning

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.460 
couldn't get the auger wasn't spinning
and<00:00:23.680> I<00:00:25.870> need<00:00:26.870> to<00:00:26.960> get<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.110> shear<00:00:27.830> pin<00:00:27.860> for<00:00:28.280> this<00:00:28.460> I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
and I need to get a shear pin for this I

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
and I need to get a shear pin for this I
gotta<00:00:30.470> get<00:00:30.590> a<00:00:30.620> new<00:00:30.680> shear<00:00:30.980> pin<00:00:31.160> because<00:00:31.340> that

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
gotta get a new shear pin because that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.850 
gotta get a new shear pin because that
shouldn't<00:00:31.790> be<00:00:31.850> doing<00:00:31.970> that<00:00:32.469> no<00:00:33.469> big<00:00:33.649> deal

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
shouldn't be doing that no big deal

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.960 
shouldn't be doing that no big deal
there<00:00:34.450> what<00:00:35.450> happened<00:00:35.930> was<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.860> big<00:00:37.550> chunk<00:00:37.790> of

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
there what happened was a big chunk of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.630 
there what happened was a big chunk of
ice<00:00:38.740> built<00:00:39.740> up<00:00:39.950> right<00:00:40.190> there<00:00:40.400> in<00:00:40.520> the

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
ice built up right there in the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.590 
ice built up right there in the
secondary<00:00:41.150> on<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.690> bottom<00:00:42.020> there<00:00:42.200> and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
secondary on the bottom there and

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.670 
secondary on the bottom there and
prevented<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.690> from<00:00:44.720> spinning<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:45.410> what<00:00:45.560> was

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
prevented it from spinning so what was

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.819 
prevented it from spinning so what was
happening<00:00:46.040> as<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.220> belt<00:00:46.400> was<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:48.590> pulley

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
happening as the belt was the the pulley

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.860 
happening as the belt was the the pulley
itself<00:00:49.310> this<00:00:49.820> Poli<00:00:50.150> right<00:00:50.390> there<00:00:50.630> was

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
itself this Poli right there was

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.900 
itself this Poli right there was
spinning<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.710> melting<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.310> belt<00:00:52.489> so<00:00:52.700> I'm

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
spinning and melting the belt so I'm

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.870 
spinning and melting the belt so I'm
gonna<00:00:53.030> solve<00:00:53.329> these<00:00:53.420> guys<00:00:54.170> a<00:00:54.200> new<00:00:54.470> belt<00:00:54.850> but<00:00:55.850> I

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
gonna solve these guys a new belt but I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.850 
gonna solve these guys a new belt but I
wanted<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.210> point<00:00:56.420> something<00:00:56.660> out<00:00:56.840> here<00:00:57.050> they

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
wanted to point something out here they

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.610 
wanted to point something out here they
were<00:00:57.980> saying<00:00:58.220> they're<00:00:58.399> reverse<00:00:58.760> didn't<00:00:59.180> work

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
were saying they're reverse didn't work

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.149 
were saying they're reverse didn't work
on<00:01:00.620> here<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.020> once<00:01:03.020> I<00:01:03.110> get<00:01:03.260> this

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
on here and once I get this

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.069 
on here and once I get this
flipped<00:01:04.489> up<00:01:04.640> here<00:01:04.850> I'll<00:01:05.720> show<00:01:05.899> you<00:01:05.930> something

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
flipped up here I'll show you something

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:13.870 
flipped up here I'll show you something
here<00:01:06.729> um<00:01:08.920> okay<00:01:09.920> focus<00:01:11.200> or<00:01:12.200> not<00:01:12.499> there<00:01:13.490> when<00:01:13.850> I

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
here um okay focus or not there when I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.090 
here um okay focus or not there when I
guess<00:01:14.060> we<00:01:14.179> got<00:01:14.299> some<00:01:14.329> focus<00:01:14.770> when<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.829> have<00:01:15.979> it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
guess we got some focus when you have it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.389 
guess we got some focus when you have it
in<00:01:16.189> reverse<00:01:16.630> what<00:01:17.630> happens<00:01:18.049> is<00:01:18.229> this<00:01:18.409> rubber

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
in reverse what happens is this rubber

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.109 
in reverse what happens is this rubber
disc<00:01:19.490> here<00:01:20.380> okay

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
disc here okay

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.940 
disc here okay
slides<00:01:23.119> on<00:01:23.329> this<00:01:23.479> shaft<00:01:23.719> let<00:01:24.350> me<00:01:24.469> get<00:01:24.649> see<00:01:24.829> if<00:01:24.889> I

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
slides on this shaft let me get see if I

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.389 
slides on this shaft let me get see if I
can<00:01:25.130> get<00:01:25.249> this<00:01:25.509> weight<00:01:26.509> on<00:01:26.689> here<00:01:27.399> this

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
can get this weight on here this

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.719 
can get this weight on here this
friction<00:01:28.789> disk<00:01:29.319> here<00:01:30.319> rides<00:01:31.189> on<00:01:31.369> this<00:01:31.520> shaft

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
friction disk here rides on this shaft

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.199 
friction disk here rides on this shaft
right<00:01:32.060> here<00:01:32.259> okay<00:01:33.670> well<00:01:34.670> when<00:01:34.789> you<00:01:34.880> put<00:01:35.029> it<00:01:35.119> in

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
right here okay well when you put it in

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.260 
right here okay well when you put it in
reverse<00:01:35.439> what<00:01:36.439> happens<00:01:36.889> is<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.939> moves<00:01:38.119> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
reverse what happens is it moves the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.469 
reverse what happens is it moves the
friction<00:01:38.719> disk<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:39.409> side<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.009> plate

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
friction disk to this side of the plate

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.730 
friction disk to this side of the plate
instead<00:01:41.479> of<00:01:41.569> this<00:01:41.719> side<00:01:41.929> of<00:01:41.959> the<00:01:42.079> plate<00:01:42.289> well

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
instead of this side of the plate well

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.019 
instead of this side of the plate well
what<00:01:42.889> was<00:01:43.009> happening<00:01:43.549> in<00:01:43.670> this<00:01:43.819> particular

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
what was happening in this particular

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:48.489 
what was happening in this particular
case<00:01:45.249> is<00:01:46.249> it<00:01:46.459> wasn't<00:01:46.639> doing<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:46.999> it<00:01:47.719> was<00:01:47.959> kind

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
case is it wasn't doing that it was kind

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.469 
case is it wasn't doing that it was kind
of<00:01:48.619> riding<00:01:48.979> almost<00:01:49.249> right<00:01:49.490> there<00:01:49.819> dead<00:01:50.060> center

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
of riding almost right there dead center

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.669 
of riding almost right there dead center
okay<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.490> what<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.520> had<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.819> do<00:01:53.349> was<00:01:54.349> I<00:01:54.439> had<00:01:54.469> to

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
okay so what I had to do was I had to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.330 
okay so what I had to do was I had to
come<00:01:54.829> up<00:01:54.950> here<00:01:55.279> because<00:01:55.569> this<00:01:56.569> here<00:01:57.340> operates

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
come up here because this here operates

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.839 
come up here because this here operates
the<00:01:58.929> control<00:01:59.929> up<00:02:00.049> there<00:02:00.079> for<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.799> gear<00:02:01.009> had<00:02:01.759> to

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
the control up there for the gear had to

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.309 
the control up there for the gear had to
come<00:02:01.969> up<00:02:01.999> here<00:02:02.329> and<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.539> had<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.810> adjust<00:02:02.899> this

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
come up here and I had to adjust this

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.389 
come up here and I had to adjust this
bolt<00:02:03.919> right<00:02:04.009> here

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
bolt right here

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.969 
bolt right here
it's<00:02:04.700> slides<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.419> that's<00:02:06.169> how<00:02:06.380> you're<00:02:06.679> able

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
it's slides and that's how you're able

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.150 
it's slides and that's how you're able
to<00:02:07.130> adjust<00:02:08.259> whether<00:02:09.259> or<00:02:09.410> not<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.619> goes<00:02:09.740> into

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
to adjust whether or not it goes into

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.759 
to adjust whether or not it goes into
reverse<00:02:10.550> on<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.170> just<00:02:12.230> figured<00:02:12.680> I'd

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
reverse on that so I just figured I'd

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.000 
reverse on that so I just figured I'd
point<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.099> out<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.610> guys<00:02:14.260> some<00:02:15.260> some<00:02:15.920> of

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
point that out to you guys some some of

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.220 
point that out to you guys some some of
you<00:02:16.099> guys<00:02:16.220> probably<00:02:16.549> already<00:02:16.819> know<00:02:17.030> that
