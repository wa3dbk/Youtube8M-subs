with one little quick tidbit here so if
you're<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.910> route<00:02:01.240> 7<00:02:01.810> chord<00:02:02.800> shell<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.640> next

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
you're on a route 7 chord shell the next

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.760 
you're on a route 7 chord shell the next
thing<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.180> can<00:02:04.330> move<00:02:04.480> to<00:02:04.510> is<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> root<00:02:05.080> 3<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
thing you can move to is a root 3 and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.070 
thing you can move to is a root 3 and
then<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.070> root<00:02:06.250> 3<00:02:06.550> moves<00:02:07.150> down<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.600> root<00:02:07.780> 7

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
then the root 3 moves down to the root 7

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.410 
then the root 3 moves down to the root 7
and<00:02:08.740> just<00:02:08.890> quickly<00:02:09.040> i'm<00:02:09.700> going<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:09.880> create<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.150> d

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
and just quickly i'm going to create a d
