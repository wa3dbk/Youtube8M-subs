like we do do our normal blades just
going<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.350> probably<00:00:46.710> go<00:00:46.830> light<00:00:47.040> on<00:00:47.070> the

for tip up carry for a right-handed user

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.359 
for tip up carry for a right-handed user
which<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.840> my<00:01:43.259> preferred<00:01:43.709> method<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:44.100> carry

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
which is my preferred method of carry

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.960 
which is my preferred method of carry
for<00:01:44.610> folding<00:01:44.970> knives<00:01:45.950> or<00:01:46.950> EDC<00:01:47.459> blades<00:01:47.700> rather

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
for folding knives or EDC blades rather

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.370 
for folding knives or EDC blades rather
more<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.420> my<00:01:48.840> tasks<00:01:49.349> knives<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.200> that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
more like my tasks knives and with that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.960 
more like my tasks knives and with that
said<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.860> happy<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.369> where<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.670> pocket

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
said I'm happy with where the pocket

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.699 
said I'm happy with where the pocket
clip<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.300> and<00:01:54.539> it's<00:01:54.660> a<00:01:54.810> halfway-decent<00:01:55.110> pocket

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
clip is and it's a halfway-decent pocket

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.430 
clip is and it's a halfway-decent pocket
clip<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.130> fairly<00:01:56.940> discreet<00:01:57.479> nothing<00:01:57.899> over

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
clip it's fairly discreet nothing over

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.100 
clip it's fairly discreet nothing over
the<00:01:58.530> top<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.069> I'm<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.580> board<00:01:59.789> with<00:01:59.910> it<00:02:00.110> let's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the top so I'm on board with it let's

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
the top so I'm on board with it let's
talk<00:02:01.319> about<00:02:01.500> deployment<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.880> blade

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
talk about deployment and the blade

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480 
talk about deployment and the blade
itself<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.229> blade<00:02:04.470> can<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.740> deployed<00:02:05.039> in<00:02:05.280> two

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
itself this blade can be deployed in two

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.699 
itself this blade can be deployed in two
methods<00:02:05.910> first<00:02:06.209> is<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.959> thumb<00:02:07.440> disk

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
methods first is with a thumb disk

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.300 
methods first is with a thumb disk
second<00:02:08.700> way<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.330> pseudo<00:02:09.750> flipper

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
second way is with the pseudo flipper

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.580 
second way is with the pseudo flipper
both<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.520> these<00:02:11.610> methods<00:02:11.880> sort<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.870> require<00:02:13.560> a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
both of these methods sort of require a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.350 
both of these methods sort of require a
wrist<00:02:13.920> action<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.459> get<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> blade<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.150> size

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
wrist action to get a blade of this size

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.839 
wrist action to get a blade of this size
out<00:02:15.890> although<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.220> actually<00:02:17.640> extremely

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
out although it is actually extremely

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.699 
out although it is actually extremely
smooth<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.540> deployment<00:02:18.870> which<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.349> one<00:02:19.590> of

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
smooth and deployment which is one of

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.979 
smooth and deployment which is one of
this<00:02:19.860> knifes<00:02:20.130> high<00:02:20.430> points<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
this knifes high points so with the

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:31.320 
this knifes high points so with the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:40.920 

it's<00:02:32.330> not<00:02:32.510> bad<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.910> blade<00:02:35.150> itself<00:02:37.930> again<00:02:39.670> 440

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
it's not bad the blade itself again 440

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.979 
it's not bad the blade itself again 440
stainless<00:02:41.930> steel<00:02:43.090> not<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.480> great<00:02:44.720> steel

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
stainless steel not not a great steel

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.869 
stainless steel not not a great steel
not<00:02:45.319> impressive<00:02:45.980> but<00:02:46.129> again<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:46.489> knife<00:02:46.700> is

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
not impressive but again this knife is

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.140 
not impressive but again this knife is
only<00:02:47.470> $19<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.709> would<00:02:49.519> like<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.819> mention<00:02:49.970> that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
only $19 I would like to mention that

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.789 
only $19 I would like to mention that
although<00:02:50.599> other<00:02:50.959> manufacturers<00:02:51.650> aren't

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
although other manufacturers aren't

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.080 
although other manufacturers aren't
really<00:02:51.980> putting<00:02:52.190> out<00:02:52.250> knives<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.849> size

really putting out knives of this size
they<00:02:53.840> are<00:02:53.989> putting<00:02:54.170> out<00:02:54.290> knives<00:02:54.530> with<00:02:54.920> a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
they are putting out knives with a

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.470 
they are putting out knives with a
better<00:02:55.250> steel<00:02:55.549> grades<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.090> same<00:02:56.239> price

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
better steel grades in the same price

better steel grades in the same price

we're not I'm not expecting the moon and
hair<00:03:19.790> popping<00:03:20.030> sharpness<00:03:20.599> is<00:03:20.750> one<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.019> those

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
hair popping sharpness is one of those

hair popping sharpness is one of those
things<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:21.590> I<00:03:21.620> find<00:03:21.890> usually<00:03:22.220> typically

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
things that I find usually typically

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.559 
things that I find usually typically
only<00:03:23.599> get<00:03:24.079> on<00:03:24.319> more<00:03:24.650> expensive<00:03:24.739> blades<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.700> wish

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
only get on more expensive blades I wish

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.059 
only get on more expensive blades I wish
that<00:03:26.750> wasn't<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.170> case<00:03:27.349> but<00:03:27.620> that's<00:03:27.860> just

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
that wasn't the case but that's just

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.580 
that wasn't the case but that's just
been<00:03:28.220> my<00:03:28.250> experience<00:03:28.910> with<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.470> anyway<00:03:30.470> the

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
been my experience with it anyway the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.640 
been my experience with it anyway the
blade<00:03:30.769> is<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.980> drop-point<00:03:31.340> style<00:03:31.910> blade<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:33.500> is

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
blade is a drop-point style blade it is

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.370 
blade is a drop-point style blade it is
flat<00:03:33.889> ground<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:35.180> finish<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.750> this

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
flat ground and the finish on this

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.970 
flat ground and the finish on this
specific<00:03:36.859> model<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.370> it's<00:03:37.579> basically<00:03:38.150> a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
specific model and it's basically a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.199 
specific model and it's basically a
monochrome<00:03:39.980> finish<00:03:40.370> all<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.790> way<00:03:40.880> throughout

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
monochrome finish all the way throughout

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.379 
monochrome finish all the way throughout
is<00:03:41.810> just<00:03:42.350> like<00:03:42.590> this<00:03:42.829> it's<00:03:43.639> like<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.760> charcoal

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
is just like this it's like a charcoal

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.479 
is just like this it's like a charcoal
I'd<00:03:44.720> say<00:03:44.959> it's<00:03:45.319> listed<00:03:45.739> as<00:03:45.829> black<00:03:46.069> but<00:03:46.340> it's

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
I'd say it's listed as black but it's

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.699 
I'd say it's listed as black but it's
not<00:03:46.670> it's<00:03:46.910> more<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.239> charcoal<00:03:47.660> finish<00:03:49.420> and

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
not it's more of a charcoal finish and

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.140 
not it's more of a charcoal finish and
again<00:03:51.709> like<00:03:51.889> I<00:03:51.920> said<00:03:52.069> same<00:03:52.489> goes<00:03:52.760> for<00:03:52.790> the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
again like I said same goes for the

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.770 
again like I said same goes for the
handles<00:03:53.599> and<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.180> sort<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.750> know

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
handles and this is sort of you know

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.759 
handles and this is sort of you know
we've<00:03:56.989> kind<00:03:57.139> of<00:03:57.230> hit<00:03:57.380> all<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.620> high<00:03:57.739> points

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
we've kind of hit all the high points

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.930 
we've kind of hit all the high points
about<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.489> blade<00:03:59.290> it<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.500> pretty<00:04:00.889> thin<00:04:01.190> for

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
about the blade it is pretty thin for

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.530 
about the blade it is pretty thin for
such<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.150> big<00:04:02.389> knife<00:04:02.569> and<00:04:03.880> again<00:04:04.880> it<00:04:05.150> was<00:04:05.359> worth

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
such a big knife and again it was worth

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.420 
such a big knife and again it was worth
giving<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.989> shot<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.530> just<00:04:06.709> check<00:04:06.950> out<00:04:07.130> and<00:04:07.160> see

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
giving a shot to just check out and see

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.150 
giving a shot to just check out and see
if<00:04:07.519> it<00:04:07.669> was<00:04:07.849> you<00:04:08.150> know<00:04:08.239> halfway<00:04:08.599> decent<00:04:09.169> but

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
if it was you know halfway decent but

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.440 
if it was you know halfway decent but
the<00:04:10.280> biggest<00:04:10.459> problem<00:04:10.669> with<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.060> blade<00:04:11.239> is

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
the biggest problem with the blade is

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.500 
the biggest problem with the blade is
lockup<00:04:12.139> and<00:04:12.380> traction<00:04:12.910> there's<00:04:13.910> no<00:04:14.150> jumping

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
lockup and traction there's no jumping

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.479 
lockup and traction there's no jumping
on<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.750> blade<00:04:14.930> whatsoever<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.769> really

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
on the blade whatsoever and really

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.990 
on the blade whatsoever and really
nowhere<00:04:16.789> to<00:04:16.910> put<00:04:17.030> your<00:04:17.090> thumb<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:19.070> mean<00:04:19.579> you

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
nowhere to put your thumb so I mean you

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.940 
nowhere to put your thumb so I mean you
can<00:04:20.239> pull<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:20.840> of<00:04:21.109> these<00:04:21.260> where<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.650> kind<00:04:21.919> of

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
can pull one of these where you kind of

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.310 
can pull one of these where you kind of
put<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.220> on<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.610> thumb<00:04:22.820> disk<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.330> use<00:04:23.990> the

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
put it on the thumb disk and use the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.020 
put it on the thumb disk and use the
guard<00:04:24.830> down<00:04:25.099> here<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.460> keep<00:04:25.610> your<00:04:25.760> hand<00:04:25.940> in

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
guard down here to keep your hand in

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.830 
guard down here to keep your hand in
place<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:27.789> yeah<00:04:28.789> if<00:04:28.910> you<00:04:29.060> you<00:04:29.330> can't<00:04:29.570> really

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
place but yeah if you you can't really

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.110 
place but yeah if you you can't really
get<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.680> grip<00:04:30.919> down<00:04:31.099> here<00:04:31.400> on<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.700> knife

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
Williams's design has a handle that's

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.070

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
similar to this in in shape and size but

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.150 
similar to this in in shape and size but
when<00:04:42.860> you

deploying the knife you know with
relative<00:05:09.620> ease<00:05:09.800> for<00:05:10.340> an<00:05:10.430> almost<00:05:10.700> five-inch

blade but lock up up and down so you

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.630 
blade but lock up up and down so you
guys<00:05:21.230> can<00:05:21.440> see<00:05:21.620> it<00:05:21.740> I'm<00:05:21.950> able<00:05:22.130> to<00:05:22.370> move<00:05:22.460> the

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
guys can see it I'm able to move the

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.550 
guys can see it I'm able to move the
blade<00:05:22.820> pretty<00:05:23.150> significant<00:05:23.690> amount<00:05:23.930> that's

blade pretty significant amount that's

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.180 
blade pretty significant amount that's
because<00:05:24.920> of<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.220> liner<00:05:26.410> lock<00:05:27.410> that<00:05:27.980> this

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
because of the liner lock that this

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.690 
because of the liner lock that this
knife<00:05:28.400> utilizes<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:30.260> liner<00:05:30.530> if<00:05:31.100> you<00:05:31.310> open<00:05:31.610> the

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
knife utilizes the liner if you open the

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.640 
knife utilizes the liner if you open the
knife<00:05:31.820> extremely<00:05:32.480> slowly<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.140> I'll<00:05:33.200> do<00:05:33.620> it

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
knife extremely slowly and I'll do it

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.930 
knife extremely slowly and I'll do it
this<00:05:33.830> way<00:05:34.010> so<00:05:34.040> you<00:05:34.190> guys<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.520> see<00:05:34.640> the<00:05:34.760> liner

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
this way so you guys can see the liner

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:44.320 
this way so you guys can see the liner
engage<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.690> do<00:05:36.530> it<00:05:36.710> this<00:05:36.830> way<00:05:42.730> the<00:05:43.730> liner<00:05:43.940> only

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
engage I do it this way the liner only

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.960 
engage I do it this way the liner only
barely<00:05:44.570> engages<00:05:45.200> and<00:05:45.410> there's<00:05:46.400> really<00:05:46.700> no

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
barely engages and there's really no

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.150 
barely engages and there's really no
vertical<00:05:47.330> play<00:05:47.630> however<00:05:47.930> if<00:05:48.680> I<00:05:48.830> do<00:05:48.890> it<00:05:49.040> with

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
vertical play however if I do it with

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.880 
vertical play however if I do it with
any<00:05:49.280> sort<00:05:49.550> of<00:05:49.640> speed<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.390> liner<00:05:50.630> over<00:05:51.170> over

any sort of speed the liner over over

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
any sort of speed the liner over over
engages<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:54.310> unfortunately<00:05:55.310> at<00:05:55.490> that<00:05:55.520> point

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
engages and unfortunately at that point

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.370 
engages and unfortunately at that point
you've<00:05:56.090> got<00:05:56.300> vertical<00:05:56.630> playing<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.140> blade

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
you've got vertical playing the blade

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.520 
you've got vertical playing the blade
and<00:05:57.800> you<00:05:58.550> can't<00:05:58.820> get<00:05:58.970> rid<00:05:59.150> of<00:05:59.210> that<00:05:59.300> guys<00:05:59.600> can't

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
and you can't get rid of that guys can't

and you can't get rid of that guys can't
get<00:06:00.620> rid<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.890> vertical<00:06:01.250> play<00:06:01.430> so<00:06:02.360> with<00:06:03.169> that

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
get rid the vertical play so with that

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.780 
get rid the vertical play so with that
said<00:06:03.620> that's<00:06:04.070> sort<00:06:04.370> of<00:06:04.460> where<00:06:04.669> it's<00:06:04.820> like<00:06:05.650> done

vertical<00:06:07.790> play<00:06:07.940> a<00:06:07.970> knife<00:06:08.180> is<00:06:08.450> really<00:06:08.750> crappy

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
vertical play a knife is really crappy

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.720 
vertical play a knife is really crappy
there's<00:06:09.650> too<00:06:09.830> many<00:06:09.919> good<00:06:10.130> knives<00:06:10.310> out<00:06:10.550> there

that<00:06:10.850> don't<00:06:11.060> do<00:06:11.210> it<00:06:11.330> so<00:06:12.020> with<00:06:12.140> that<00:06:12.230> said<00:06:12.440> guys

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
that don't do it so with that said guys

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.030 
that don't do it so with that said guys
19<00:06:14.120> bucks<00:06:14.330> is<00:06:14.990> it<00:06:15.140> worth<00:06:15.260> it<00:06:15.500> not<00:06:15.800> in<00:06:15.950> my

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
19 bucks is it worth it not in my

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.370 
19 bucks is it worth it not in my
opinion<00:06:16.250> especially<00:06:17.030> with<00:06:17.419> lockup<00:06:17.900> like<00:06:18.200> that

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
opinion especially with lockup like that

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.720 
opinion especially with lockup like that
now<00:06:18.680> do<00:06:19.220> I<00:06:19.250> think<00:06:19.340> that<00:06:19.580> this<00:06:19.760> is<00:06:19.940> just<00:06:19.970> a<00:06:20.240> fluke

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
now do I think that this is just a fluke

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.409 
now do I think that this is just a fluke
probably<00:06:22.730> not<00:06:23.150> I<00:06:23.750> mean<00:06:24.380> maybe<00:06:24.710> maybe<00:06:25.300> some<00:06:26.300> of

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
probably not I mean maybe maybe some of

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.120 
probably not I mean maybe maybe some of
them<00:06:26.570> lock<00:06:26.810> up<00:06:26.990> a<00:06:27.080> little<00:06:27.260> bit<00:06:27.380> better<00:06:27.530> but<00:06:27.919> the

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
them lock up a little bit better but the

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.690 
them lock up a little bit better but the
size<00:06:28.400> of<00:06:28.610> the<00:06:28.669> liner<00:06:28.970> is<00:06:29.300> just<00:06:30.080> so<00:06:30.320> thin<00:06:30.740> that<00:06:31.669> I

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
size of the liner is just so thin that I

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.370 
size of the liner is just so thin that I
think<00:06:32.000> it<00:06:32.120> just<00:06:32.210> has<00:06:32.419> too<00:06:32.630> much<00:06:32.750> ability<00:06:33.230> to

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
think it just has too much ability to

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.490 
think it just has too much ability to
flex<00:06:33.680> there<00:06:33.980> a<00:06:34.510> knife<00:06:35.510> of<00:06:35.690> this<00:06:35.840> size<00:06:36.050> with<00:06:36.350> the

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
flex there a knife of this size with the

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.020 
flex there a knife of this size with the
frame<00:06:36.770> lock<00:06:36.980> would<00:06:37.340> have<00:06:37.490> probably<00:06:37.730> been

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
frame lock would have probably been

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.250 
frame lock would have probably been
phenomenal<00:06:38.960> and<00:06:39.940> I<00:06:40.940> bet<00:06:41.180> you<00:06:41.450> that<00:06:41.810> they<00:06:42.080> would

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
phenomenal and I bet you that they would
