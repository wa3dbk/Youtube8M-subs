00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
for a retail and um so this glove was

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.560 
for a retail and um so this glove was
just<00:02:50.530> regular<00:02:51.250> price<00:02:51.610> you<00:02:51.820> know<00:02:51.970> wasn't<00:02:52.270> like

three hundred dollars or anything but I

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.210 
three hundred dollars or anything but I
think<00:02:58.750> some<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.470> good<00:02:59.800> things<00:02:59.830> about<00:03:00.070> it

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
think some of the good things about it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.250 
think some of the good things about it
being<00:03:01.020> Pro<00:03:02.020> issue<00:03:02.260> basically<00:03:02.620> is<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:04.570> the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
being Pro issue basically is that the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.729 
being Pro issue basically is that the
fingers<00:03:05.650> are<00:03:05.860> our<00:03:06.130> super<00:03:06.760> stiff<00:03:07.030> these<00:03:07.300> are

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
fingers are our super stiff these are

of the of the H web on this glove I

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:24.980 
of the of the H web on this glove I

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
think it really makes it

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
thumb loops and then one other thing I

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.589 
thumb loops and then one other thing I
noticed<00:04:35.880> on<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.090> club<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.440> like<00:04:38.599> every

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
noticed on this club is that like every

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.150 
noticed on this club is that like every
every<00:04:40.289> lace<00:04:40.560> on<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:42.120> glove<00:04:42.419> is<00:04:42.680> is<00:04:43.680> really

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
every lace on this glove is is really

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.580 
every lace on this glove is is really
really<00:04:44.610> stiff<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:46.580> don't<00:04:47.580> know<00:04:47.699> why<00:04:48.030> I<00:04:48.590> don't

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
really stiff I don't know why I don't

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.860 
really stiff I don't know why I don't
know<00:04:49.650> why<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:49.919> is<00:04:50.099> but<00:04:50.460> um<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.860> think<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.160> in

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
know why it is but um I think that in

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.379 
know why it is but um I think that in
according<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:54.990> me<00:04:55.139> it's<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.470> plus<00:04:55.770> because<00:04:56.389> it

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
according to me it's a plus because it

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.290 
according to me it's a plus because it
makes<00:04:57.569> the<00:04:57.750> glove<00:04:57.930> stiffer<00:04:58.409> overall<00:04:59.150> and<00:05:00.620> a

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
makes the glove stiffer overall and a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.029 
makes the glove stiffer overall and a
little<00:05:03.300> bit<00:05:03.389> of<00:05:03.449> stiffer<00:05:03.900> glove<00:05:05.000> so<00:05:06.050> um<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.139> mean

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
little bit of stiffer glove so um I mean

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.550 
little bit of stiffer glove so um I mean
I<00:05:08.280> got<00:05:08.849> it<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.240> think<00:05:09.930> three<00:05:10.710> days<00:05:10.740> ago<00:05:11.130> and

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
I got it I think three days ago and

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.520 
I got it I think three days ago and
gotten<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.680> little<00:05:13.949> bit<00:05:14.130> wider<00:05:14.370> and<00:05:15.289> then<00:05:16.289> I

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
gotten it a little bit wider and then I

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:25.490 
gotten it a little bit wider and then I
can<00:05:17.840> close<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:19.020> somewhat<00:05:19.560> easily<00:05:22.550> but<00:05:24.500> my

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
can close it somewhat easily but my

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.140 
can close it somewhat easily but my
first<00:05:25.770> tournament<00:05:26.009> next<00:05:26.580> weekend<00:05:27.090> and<00:05:28.759> I<00:05:29.759> hope
