00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.450
 and we stand here at the booth of 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:13.820
 we have the food here 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:18.280
 that's the huge sensation 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.490
 as a competitor against the galaxy 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.680
 note 4 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.360
 and we are all traveling with big ones 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.980
 know it is allowed to compete 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:32.200
 great device but it feels very good 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:34.730
 to essent 77 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.970
 So sounds very good in the hand 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.710
 it is not too hard 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.750
 yes she is really good at that too 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.860
 is a very noble workmanship every 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.440
 even from essent previously noted what 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.830
 But the Chinese definitely have 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.770
 Out 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:57.200
 Inside, a whole new keel is working 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.040
 925 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.690
 from the home huawei call them yourself 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:09.140
 your processor is 46,815 in the distance 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.200
 and four cortex a7 nuclei, as it were 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.150
 like the witches of processors samsung 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.000
 can run quite similarly in too 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.720
 the so-called battle architecture of 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.810
 hrm 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.760
 that means you or the cores vary 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.500
 in the order as they run around 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.409
 the different background processes 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.869
 and to work on it 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:35.530
 The display is 6 inches tall and dissolves in 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.799
 1080p full hd, it is incredibly huge 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.429
 but the fry is really going very well 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.840
 it's the emotion 3.0 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.320
 installed this is a new version 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.689
 you look really good and you are 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.609
 actually very fluid myself 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.189
 Hope we get the test equipment behind 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.690
 the device is also very very 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.650
 promising 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.650
 and yes 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.060
 us major good for that 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.869
 2001 will
