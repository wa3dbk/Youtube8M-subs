00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
guys were actually working pretty hard

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.880 
guys were actually working pretty hard
out<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.810> mate<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.500> there's<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
out there and it mate you know there's a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.010 
out there and it mate you know there's a
lot<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.070> ruining

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
lot of ruining

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.749 
lot of ruining
and<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.880> think<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:33.679> setting<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.429> really

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
and I think in that setting it really

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.669 
and I think in that setting it really
helps<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.090> show<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:35.810> skill<00:01:36.020> level<00:01:36.049> a<00:01:36.380> lot<00:01:36.560> of

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
helps to show the skill level a lot of

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.100 
helps to show the skill level a lot of
the<00:01:36.740> guys<00:01:36.890> and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
the guys and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.290 
the guys and

skater in the NHL I don't know what
happened<00:02:37.540> there<00:02:37.959> I<00:02:38.170> think<00:02:38.380> it's<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.890> dishes

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
happened there I think it's I dishes

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.240 
happened there I think it's I dishes
downhill<00:02:39.610> maybe<00:02:39.820> but<00:02:40.830> he's<00:02:41.830> pretty<00:02:41.980> fast

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
downhill maybe but he's pretty fast

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.860 
downhill maybe but he's pretty fast
skater<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.610> guess<00:02:42.970> they<00:02:43.150> don't<00:02:43.239> makes<00:02:43.510> me<00:02:43.660> feel

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.830 
skater I guess they don't makes me feel
better<00:02:44.019> if<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.170> keep<00:02:44.380> up<00:02:44.470> with<00:02:44.590> enough
