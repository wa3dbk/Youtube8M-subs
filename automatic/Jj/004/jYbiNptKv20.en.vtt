00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.709 
have one here just to show you how they
differ<00:00:10.679> now<00:00:11.670> those<00:00:11.969> are<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.210> there<00:00:12.389> looking

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
differ now those are you there looking

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.060 
differ now those are you there looking
at<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> screens<00:00:13.139> right<00:00:13.290> now<00:00:13.440> don't<00:00:13.920> worry

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
at the screens right now don't worry

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.039 
at the screens right now don't worry
they're<00:00:14.580> not<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> same<00:00:15.179> brightness<00:00:15.389> the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
they're not at the same brightness the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.130 
they're not at the same brightness the
Nexus<00:00:16.560> 6<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.859> plenty<00:00:17.220> bright<00:00:17.430> okay<00:00:17.930> I<00:00:18.930> just

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
Nexus 6 is plenty bright okay I just

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.810 
Nexus 6 is plenty bright okay I just
have<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> lower<00:00:19.920> brightness<00:00:20.130> because<00:00:20.670> it

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
have it a lower brightness because it

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.250 
have it a lower brightness because it
messes<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.390> lighting<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> camera

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
messes with the lighting on the camera

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.500 
messes with the lighting on the camera
so<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.039> we've<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.369> both<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.970> them<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.240> same

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
so if we've got both of them on the same

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.960 
so if we've got both of them on the same
song<00:00:24.810> they<00:00:25.230> both<00:00:25.439> had<00:00:25.590> max<00:00:26.250> volume<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.849> we're

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
song they both had max volume so we're

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:41.250 
song they both had max volume so we're
going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> start<00:00:27.359> off<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.660> Nexus<00:00:27.990> 6<00:00:28.230> year

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.960 

Lizzie<00:00:42.260> LOI

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:01:01.779 

tonight

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.649 

so<00:01:02.789> that's<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> Nexus<00:01:03.660> 6<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:06.299> me<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
so that's the Nexus 6 you know for me I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
so that's the Nexus 6 you know for me I
think<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.259> a<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.470> good<00:01:07.710> sound<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.220> don't

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
think it's a pretty good sound I don't

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.789 
think it's a pretty good sound I don't
use<00:01:08.759> the<00:01:08.909> speaker<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.240> whole<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.080> that's

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
use the speaker a whole lot so that's

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.930 
use the speaker a whole lot so that's
probably<00:01:11.040> why<00:01:11.190> I<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> pretty<00:01:11.850> good

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
probably why I think it's a pretty good

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.780 
probably why I think it's a pretty good
song<00:01:12.299> sound<00:01:12.869> mostly<00:01:13.710> run<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:13.920> using<00:01:14.040> using

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
song sound mostly run I'm using using

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.990 
song sound mostly run I'm using using
listen<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.450> listening<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.440> music<00:01:17.000> I'm

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
listen to me listening to music I'm

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670 
listen to me listening to music I'm
using<00:01:18.240> headphones<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.560> doesn't

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
using headphones so that that doesn't

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.649 
using headphones so that that doesn't
really<00:01:19.979> matter<00:01:20.190> that<00:01:20.280> much<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.060> let's

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
really matter that much to me so let's

00:01:21.659 --> 00:02:11.250 
really matter that much to me so let's
go<00:01:21.780> ahead<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:23.509> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.290 

so<00:02:12.260> that's<00:02:12.770> compared<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.520> Galaxy<00:02:13.940> Note<00:02:14.090> 4

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
so that's compared to the Galaxy Note 4

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.720 
so that's compared to the Galaxy Note 4
both<00:02:15.080> sound<00:02:15.350> really<00:02:15.650> good<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:15.950> my<00:02:15.980> opinion<00:02:16.250> but

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
both sound really good in my opinion but

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.980 
both sound really good in my opinion but
be<00:02:16.970> sure<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.210> let<00:02:17.300> us<00:02:17.420> know<00:02:17.540> down<00:02:17.600> in<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990
