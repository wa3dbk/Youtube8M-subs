he's<00:01:15.020> bringing<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.560> down<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.190> I<00:01:16.220> take<00:01:16.580> that

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
he's bringing that down so I take that

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:58.960 

nice<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:30.830> gentle<00:01:31.280> doses

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.950 

it's<00:01:59.970> gone<00:02:00.180> quiet

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's gone quiet

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.270 
it's gone quiet
so<00:02:01.740> maestro<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.670> giving<00:02:03.060> me<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.450> information

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
so maestro is giving me the information

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
so maestro is giving me the information
to<00:02:05.280> bring<00:02:05.580> them<00:02:05.820> down<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.450> take<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.869> tonality

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
to bring them down I take the tonality

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.430 
to bring them down I take the tonality
of<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:07.920> muscles<00:02:08.399> down<00:02:11.870> there<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:12.989> have<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.200> nice

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
of my muscles down there we have a nice

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:37.390 
of my muscles down there we have a nice
finale<00:02:14.010> last<00:02:14.489> two<00:02:14.910> eights

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.149 

so<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.640> see<00:02:38.819> just<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.299> one<00:02:39.709> exercise<00:02:40.709> we

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
so as you see just in one exercise we

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.729 
so as you see just in one exercise we
have<00:02:41.189> exactly<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.969> same<00:02:42.000> tempo<00:02:42.689> maestro<00:02:43.590> is

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
have exactly the same tempo maestro is

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.860 
have exactly the same tempo maestro is
playing<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.159> same<00:02:44.189> tempo<00:02:44.969> but<00:02:45.599> he<00:02:45.719> was

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
playing the same tempo but he was

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.869 
playing the same tempo but he was
playing<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.560> colours<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.099> then<00:02:47.609> it<00:02:47.730> was

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
playing with the colours and then it was

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.750 
playing with the colours and then it was
up<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:48.090> me<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.480> interpretate<00:02:49.469> that<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.579> what<00:02:50.730> we

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
up to me to interpretate that so what we

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.759 
up to me to interpretate that so what we
could<00:02:51.060> do<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.450> now<00:02:51.689> if<00:02:51.930> we<00:02:52.079> could<00:02:52.200> take<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.409> nice

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
could do is now if we could take a nice

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:31.270 
could do is now if we could take a nice
dry<00:02:54.859> two-and-twenty<00:02:55.859> really<00:02:56.639> one

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:50.610 

so<00:03:32.280> now<00:03:32.490> there's<00:03:32.730> annexing<00:03:33.270> patience

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:08.870

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.030 

bringing<00:04:09.880> that<00:04:10.030> down<00:04:10.270> for<00:04:10.630> me<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.530> help<00:04:11.800> me

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
bringing that down for me to help me

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.530 
bringing that down for me to help me
come<00:04:13.560> clean

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.600

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
the tempo didn't change the basic energy

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.290 
the tempo didn't change the basic energy
was<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.200> same<00:04:27.500> but<00:04:28.130> then<00:04:28.340> maestro<00:04:28.670> played

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300
