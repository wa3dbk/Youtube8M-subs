00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.959
 and we are going to prepare today a snack for 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.080
 that children eat fruits you will see that 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.990
 fun let's make a hedgehog go to 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.960
 need grapes 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.050
 a pear and a knife and some sticks 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.470
 first is to separate grapes that have more or 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.689
 less the same size 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.960
 now let's go through with the stick 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.759
 the grapes so that a bit is left 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.669
 to click on the pear here small and 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.559
 one longer in the outside part we 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.350
 we are doing the same with all 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.640
 do enough grapes and then we see if 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 they need more as we go 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.810
 completing the hedgehog 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.730
 [Music] 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.040
 you can put the toothpick through the little hole 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.070
 where the rabbi had the grape 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.680
 well now the pear we are going to mark a 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.410
 line little less than half we cut 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.660
 the tip and we peel it only until 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.450
 that line that we have marked 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.570
 [Music] 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.240
 you see here we would have what is the little face 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.810
 of the hedgehog because now it is so easy 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.340
 how to go pricking all the grapes 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.340
 covering all the space 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.350
 You see the chopsticks will look like the barbs of 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.790
 hedgehog by espn 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.730
 [Music] 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.350
 you have to cover the mark that the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.210
 skin of the pear to the front 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.800
 cover it well so that you only look at the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 peeled pear 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.020
 Well, here I have it whole, look 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.659
 and now we are going to make him face with 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.969
 the same grapes 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.280
 I'm going to put a nose in his eyes like that 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.319
 that I'm going to use half a grape that I'm going to 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.040
 also nailed with half a stick 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.830
 too big 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.330
 with the snout with the movements and how 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.510
 there's the grape with the redundancy part 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.880
 outside if you have used white grapes 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 and you can put average 51 also for 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.750
 make her nose so she was left alone and 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.870
 for the eyes just short two 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.240
 pieces of very tiny skin ex and the 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.479
 He placed in the place of eyes , and already 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.479
 we have 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.969
