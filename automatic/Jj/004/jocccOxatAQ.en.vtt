00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.970
 they were born more 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 hello everyone and welcome to my channel 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.420
 I am javito pinto and today I bring you a 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.250
 new video as you see in the title the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.070
 wheats are the fastest forwards in 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.990
 all ultimate team 14 and what I've done 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.960
 It has been like a podium and in each fall 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.790
 each step of the podium all 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.619
 players there are the same rhythm 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.870
 and good on the third step of the podium 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.260
 the bronze player the only one there is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.550
 this ricketts a Canadian with a lot 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 rhythm but it seems that all the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.079
 other statistics are quite low and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.059
 I 'm good, although logically 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.220
 tried because the game has not come out 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.200
 I think this player is a lot of pace 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.270
 but the rest very little but well there 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.880
 you have or if you are a fast game this 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.230
 player is very very fast in the third 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.760
 the podium 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.540
 the silver player the only one there is 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.700
 this comments 2093 of rhythm and this 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.549
 it seems pretty good because really 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.680
 with that you have 93 rhythm if you see the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.780
 Headline statistics are pretty 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.299
 good 70 headers for a player who 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.549
 It has 93 rhythm and it is also silver 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.229
 I think it's a lot and it 's very, very good 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.840
 so if you want to try this player 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.020
 I think it will be cheap and you can 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.090
 to sign him to try it surely I think 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.649
 that can work very well and in the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.189
 third drawer of the podium the players of 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.380
 gold are these 33 players the most 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.210
 remarkable is undoubtedly the one in this 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.310
 football of 21 30 in change of position in 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.719
 they have put her as a playmaker though 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.369
 surely you can find it from 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.530
 in front of the centers without any problem 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.869
 in young three forwards also with 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.780
 93 rhythm as head statistics 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.240
 cough and with very good reviews of chute 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.549
 especially gareth bale that has 84's 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.170
 chute on the second step of the podium to 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.810
 only in silver players these 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.289
 players have 94 rhythm and these are 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.450
 two 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.039
 hilton hard or hard guys in a player 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.159
 that already during the last last 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.049
 We insisted on 12 and 13 she was 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.670
 a very very fast player very well known 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.619
 for its speed and that again the 14 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.690
 is back here and if the toyo 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.660
 I really did not know him but here what 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.540
 you have 94 the rhythm also 64 retirement 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.069
 have a more hard shot and you felt and 67 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.840
 of head 2 also has more headers 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.360
 that you hard so I think you can 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.550
 work very well 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.370
 and yachts to show you the only player 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.080
 that has the new player that is 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.300
 up all of the center front podium 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.130
 fastest of all ultimate team the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.750
 crazy I want to say is that if you want to see 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.640
 the complete statistics of these 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.040
 players you will simply have to open 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.510
 the description below the video look for the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.250
 player the name of the player already what 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.340
 you will have the link that will take you to foot 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.080
 get this to the sugar page with 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.520
 where will I see the aesthetics of this player 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.590
 that you can see besides the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.660
 statistics this heights or beasts of 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.820
 absolutely bad leg dribble 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.350
 and good now without further delay for 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.540
 teach who is the center forward more 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.860
 fast touch team is a gold player 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.230
 is a player who plays the German league 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.540
 who plays in dortmund and this player 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.640
 it is aubameyang forward center 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.770
 awesome that I loved in 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.080
 ultimate 13 and that here again it returns to 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.970
 be like faster center forward 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.940
 of all ultimate center forward team 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.310
 that a rhythm has to be impressive 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.700
 exaggerated exaggerated 95 of rhythm 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:22.610
 impressive also has 76 shooting 73 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.040
 of pass 78 dribbling 55 defenses that 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.240
 really will not use it much and 76 of 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.070
 butts but also 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.230
 because he is quite tall he is not a player 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.930
 that is under the smell the opposite 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.490
 a player who is tall and I suppose 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.170
 that will go very well on top so yes 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.090
 that he is a fast player and that you can 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.580
 well above here you have the player 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.200
 faster from your last player not the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.080
 faster center forward of ultimate 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.060
