 all right 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.740
 i 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.220
 all right 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.690
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.350
 cook our meat in the express pot 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:46.130
 I put water onion salt and I'm going to cover 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:50.150
 I'm going to leave it approximately 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.390
 30 to 35 minutes after it starts 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.960
 whistle our pot then I 'm going to 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.170
 put it on the fire and we continue with the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.109
 next step 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.290
 while our meat is ready I go 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:08.560
 to wash some tomatoes I'm going to uncover a 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.659
 can of chipotle chilies and I'll chop 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.030
 very well the tomatoes the smallest thing that 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:17.170
 can and I'm going to fry them with a 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.049
 little vegetable oil and onion I put him 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.689
 to fry the tomatoes with the onions and 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.250
 Now I'm going to chop the chipotle peppers and 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.250
 I will also add them here 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.590
 since we prick the chipotle peppers 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.120
 then we also add them here to 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.740
 the tomatoes 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.740
 let's mix them well 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.710
 and I 'm going to leave fire here 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 approximately 30 minutes 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.510
 or until the tomatoes are 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.510
 practically disrupted 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.930
 it's been 20 minutes now, I have not 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.000
 added nothing water all this juice 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.740
 that has the tomato here from the same 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.660
 it's the same tomato 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.729
 and well then now I'm going to 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.100
 add some chicken broth in 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.140
 powder 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.140
 and I will also add salt 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.160
 and I will also put the meat without the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.160
 broth I will add nothing more meat 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.390
 good since we add the meat we're going to 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.520
 mix well remember that we have already 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.120
 seasoned with salt and with broth 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.940
 of chicken powder can cover my casserole 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.230
 and I'm going to leave it here for approximately 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.230
 another 10 minutes more 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.829
 we have already served our entomatado of 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.829
 beef 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.610
