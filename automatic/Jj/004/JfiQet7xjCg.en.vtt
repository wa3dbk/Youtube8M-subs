both speed lights our guide number 43

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.589 
both speed lights our guide number 43
because<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.860> thought<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.580> plenty<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.360> light

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
because I thought that's plenty of light

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.930 
because I thought that's plenty of light
for<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.080> background<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:11.039> then<00:02:11.400> during<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
for this background but then during the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.440 
for this background but then during the
shoot

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
shoot

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.180 
shoot
I<00:02:12.480> found<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.920> had

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
I found that I had

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.190 
I found that I had
to<00:02:14.310> crank<00:02:14.610> them<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.090> their<00:02:15.240> full<00:02:15.570> power<00:02:15.930> in

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
to crank them up to their full power in

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.110 
to crank them up to their full power in
order<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.830> get<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.250> much<00:02:17.430> light<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.940> I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
order to get so much light that I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.750 
order to get so much light that I
actually<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.230> background<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.860> it's

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
actually like the background and it's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.170 
actually like the background and it's
never<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.180> good<00:02:21.270> idea<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.890> power<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.940> speed

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
never a good idea to to power the speed

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.240 
never a good idea to to power the speed
light<00:02:24.300> at<00:02:24.480> full<00:02:24.870> power<00:02:25.170> because<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.130> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
light at full power because then the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.820 
light at full power because then the
recycling<00:02:26.910> time<00:02:27.210> goes<00:02:27.480> up<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> would<00:02:28.680> have

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
recycling time goes up so I would have

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.190 
recycling time goes up so I would have
been<00:02:29.070> math<00:02:30.000> much<00:02:30.270> better<00:02:30.540> off<00:02:30.750> if<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.050> would

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
been math much better off if I would

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.140 
been math much better off if I would
have<00:02:31.320> used<00:02:31.380> speed<00:02:31.920> lights<00:02:32.130> with<00:02:32.490> guide<00:02:32.820> number

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
have used speed lights with guide number

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.220 
have used speed lights with guide number
58<00:02:33.630> over<00:02:34.230> here<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.460> well<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.000> found<00:02:36.540> out<00:02:36.870> once

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
58 over here but well I found out once

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.050 
58 over here but well I found out once
we<00:02:37.410> were<00:02:37.560> rolling<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.880> too<00:02:39.030> late

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
we were rolling and then it was too late

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.330 
we were rolling and then it was too late
to<00:02:39.330> change<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.750> because<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.710> pregnant

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.080 
I have to get going and yeah that's why
I<00:02:45.960> couldn't<00:02:46.320> change<00:02:46.560> anymore<00:02:46.950> speaking<00:02:47.910> of

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
I couldn't change anymore speaking of

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.580 
I couldn't change anymore speaking of
the<00:02:48.270> pregnant<00:02:48.660> woman<00:02:48.930> our<00:02:49.110> model<00:02:49.410> she<00:02:49.560> is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the pregnant woman our model she is

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.680 
the pregnant woman our model she is
standing<00:02:49.980> over<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:50.550> metre<00:02:50.760> sixty<00:02:51.000> five

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
standing over here one metre sixty five

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.430 
standing over here one metre sixty five
and<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.900> half<00:02:51.930> feet<00:02:52.260> away<00:02:52.470> from<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.130> background

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
and a half feet away from the background

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.380 
and a half feet away from the background
this<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.620> also<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.040> distance<00:02:56.460> is<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.000> bit

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
this is also the distance is is a bit

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.420 
this is also the distance is is a bit
too<00:02:57.600> small<00:02:57.870> when<00:02:58.320> we<00:02:58.470> use<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:58.800> much<00:02:58.830> background

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
too small when we use so much background

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.100 
too small when we use so much background
lighting<00:02:59.670> because<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.240> light<00:03:00.390> easily<00:03:00.720> is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
lighting because the light easily is

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.220 
lighting because the light easily is
spilling<00:03:01.470> over<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.800> her<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:03.570> other<00:03:03.810> hand

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
spilling over to her on the other hand

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.470 
spilling over to her on the other hand
if<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.470> would<00:03:04.650> bring<00:03:04.980> her<00:03:05.130> further<00:03:05.580> away<00:03:06.150> from

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
if I would bring her further away from

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.080 
if I would bring her further away from
the<00:03:06.630> background<00:03:06.810> then<00:03:07.740> my<00:03:08.400> small<00:03:08.820> studio

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
the background then my small studio

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.300 
the background then my small studio
background<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.720> just<00:03:09.960> not<00:03:10.170> wide<00:03:10.440> enough<00:03:10.470> now

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
background is just not wide enough now

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.130 
background is just not wide enough now
the<00:03:11.370> further<00:03:11.700> she's<00:03:12.060> away<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.630> smaller<00:03:12.930> the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
the further she's away the smaller the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.140 
the further she's away the smaller the
background<00:03:13.560> gets<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.490> I'm<00:03:14.700> shooting

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
background gets and then I'm shooting

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.840 
background gets and then I'm shooting
the<00:03:15.300> sides<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.020> background<00:03:16.920> but<00:03:17.100> not<00:03:17.130> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
the sides of this background but not the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.810 
the sides of this background but not the
gray<00:03:18.060> paper<00:03:18.300> anymore<00:03:18.860> which<00:03:19.860> by<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.190> way<00:03:20.280> is

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
gray paper anymore which by the way is

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.150 
gray paper anymore which by the way is
just<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.230> ground<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.590> didn't<00:03:22.890> pull

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
just going to the ground I didn't pull

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.280 
just going to the ground I didn't pull
the<00:03:23.280> paper<00:03:23.520> into<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.180> front<00:03:24.600> because<00:03:25.200> I

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
the paper into the front because I

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.380 
the paper into the front because I
didn't<00:03:25.560> want<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:26.010> model<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.730> stand<00:03:27.180> on

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
didn't want the model to stand on

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.300 
didn't want the model to stand on

parts should be in an in shadow there

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.280 
parts should be in an in shadow there
just<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.280> show<00:03:56.489> how<00:03:56.910> round<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.690> how<00:03:57.840> big<00:03:58.080> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290

belly is we want to have fall off over
here<00:04:01.380> now<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.239> actually<00:04:03.780> pretty<00:04:03.959> high

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
here now so this is actually pretty high

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.020 
here now so this is actually pretty high
coming<00:04:04.680> from<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.100> side<00:04:05.370> then<00:04:05.640> there's<00:04:05.940> a

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
coming from the side then there's a
