dying you get them to you know like

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
dying you get them to you know like
maybe<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.619> half<00:01:17.040> health<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> little<00:01:17.820> bit

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
maybe like half health or a little bit

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.630 
maybe like half health or a little bit
lower<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.799> roaches<00:01:19.950> will<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.340> attacking

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
lower and the roaches will be attacking

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940 
lower and the roaches will be attacking
into<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> fresh<00:01:21.390> pack<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.810> stalkers<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
into a fresh pack of stalkers well the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440 
into a fresh pack of stalkers well the
ones<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> back<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> ones<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.360> are

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.880 
getting attacked are still attacking
instead<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.130> dying<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.439> keep<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
instead of dying so you will keep that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.140 
instead of dying so you will keep that
damage<00:01:29.280> output<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> most

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
damage output which is the most

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.120 
damage output which is the most
important<00:01:30.540> thing<00:01:30.659> while<00:01:30.900> you're<00:01:31.110> while<00:01:31.439> your

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
important thing while you're while your

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.350 
important thing while you're while your
opponent's<00:01:32.549> roaches<00:01:32.790> will<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.000> dying<00:01:33.240> so

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
opponent's roaches will be dying so

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.020 
opponent's roaches will be dying so
let's<00:01:36.360> use<00:01:36.780> blink<00:01:37.079> my<00:01:37.200> girl<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
let's use blink my girl so it's going to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.390 
let's use blink my girl so it's going to
attack<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> frontline<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.920> notice<00:01:41.250> which

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
ones are getting attacked blink it back

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.690 
ones are getting attacked blink it back
for<00:01:43.530> beginning<00:01:43.799> players<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.340> might<00:01:44.490> take<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
for beginning players it might take a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.719 
for beginning players it might take a
while<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.119> get<00:01:45.240> used<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:47.670> has

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
while to get used to this but this has

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.550 
while to get used to this but this has
saved<00:01:48.000> me<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.540> games<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.320> should

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
saved me a lot of games so it should

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
back so that instead of dying and it

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.040 
back so that instead of dying and it
keeps<00:05:20.940> attacking<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:23.270> I<00:05:24.270> couldn't<00:05:24.960> really

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
keeps attacking so I couldn't really

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.659 
keeps attacking so I couldn't really
explain<00:05:25.290> it<00:05:25.380> too<00:05:25.650> well<00:05:25.860> because<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.340> was<00:05:26.490> busy

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669

microing<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.419> was<00:05:27.600> a<00:05:27.630> pretty<00:05:27.780> quick<00:05:28.020> fight<00:05:28.200> but

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
microing I was a pretty quick fight but

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.380 
microing I was a pretty quick fight but
you<00:05:28.560> see<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.740> have<00:05:28.919> four<00:05:29.160> zealots<00:05:29.460> left<00:05:29.669> right

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390

alright guys so I'm going to show you
how<00:05:44.910> to<00:05:44.970> micro<00:05:45.419> in<00:05:46.169> a<00:05:46.500> PvP<00:05:47.010> where<00:05:47.430> it's<00:05:48.419> very

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
how to micro in a PvP where it's very

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.110 
how to micro in a PvP where it's very
common<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.230> have<00:05:49.440> six<00:05:50.340> stalkers<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:50.790> to

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
common to have six stalkers and to

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.340 
common to have six stalkers and to
solids<00:05:51.419> out<00:05:51.510> in<00:05:51.660> the<00:05:51.720> beginning<00:05:51.930> game<00:05:52.169> because

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
solids out in the beginning game because

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.290 
solids out in the beginning game because
both<00:05:52.530> of<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:52.860> are<00:05:52.890> you<00:05:53.490> know<00:05:53.790> maybe<00:05:54.030> for

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
both of you are you know maybe for

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.540 
both of you are you know maybe for
gating<00:05:54.600> or<00:05:54.660> something<00:05:54.960> right<00:05:55.200> so<00:05:55.830> the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
gating or something right so the

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.670 
gating or something right so the
important<00:05:57.000> lessons<00:05:57.450> that<00:05:57.510> lessons<00:05:58.410> take<00:05:58.530> away

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
important lessons that lessons take away

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.640 
important lessons that lessons take away
from<00:05:58.830> this<00:05:58.980> is<00:05:59.840> stalkers<00:06:00.840> do<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.320> lot<00:06:01.620> more

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
from this is stalkers do a lot more

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.040 
from this is stalkers do a lot more
damage<00:06:01.830> to<00:06:02.220> armored<00:06:02.550> units<00:06:02.850> so<00:06:03.540> there's

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
damage to armored units so there's

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.920 
damage to armored units so there's
really<00:06:04.430> no<00:06:05.430> point<00:06:05.760> in<00:06:05.970> attacking<00:06:06.360> zealots

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
really no point in attacking zealots

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.540 
really no point in attacking zealots
that<00:06:07.110> are<00:06:07.410> light<00:06:07.650> you're<00:06:08.040> only<00:06:08.220> going<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.430> do

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
that are light you're only going to do

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.100 
that are light you're only going to do
ten<00:06:08.940> damage<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.419> when<00:06:09.690> you<00:06:09.780> reach<00:06:09.930> their

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
ten damage and when you reach their

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.750 
ten damage and when you reach their
actual<00:06:10.470> health<00:06:10.710> they<00:06:10.830> have<00:06:10.860> one<00:06:11.160> armor<00:06:11.580> so

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
actual health they have one armor so

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.100 
actual health they have one armor so
you're<00:06:11.910> only<00:06:12.060> going<00:06:12.210> to<00:06:12.270> be<00:06:12.330> doing<00:06:12.840> nine

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
you're only going to be doing nine

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.980 
you're only going to be doing nine
damage<00:06:13.440> at<00:06:13.560> that<00:06:13.680> point<00:06:13.950> so<00:06:14.700> you<00:06:15.660> need<00:06:15.810> to<00:06:15.900> be

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
damage at that point so you need to be

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.380 
damage at that point so you need to be
smart<00:06:16.320> and<00:06:16.440> focus<00:06:17.340> fire<00:06:17.610> your<00:06:17.940> opponent's
