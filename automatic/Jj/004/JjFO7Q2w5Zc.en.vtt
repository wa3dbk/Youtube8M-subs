fix<00:01:48.610> everything<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.869> when<00:01:50.020> we<00:01:50.140> when<00:01:50.350> we<00:01:50.470> start

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
fix everything and when we when we start

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.410 
fix everything and when we when we start
at<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.920> design<00:01:51.250> process<00:01:51.490> we<00:01:51.820> didn't<00:01:52.090> just

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
at the design process we didn't just

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.120 
at the design process we didn't just
look<00:01:52.600> at<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.869> CD<00:01:53.170> players<00:01:53.530> we<00:01:53.679> looked<00:01:53.860> at<00:01:54.009> the

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
look at the CD players we looked at the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.600 
look at the CD players we looked at the
software<00:01:54.640> so<00:01:55.420> we<00:01:55.570> wanted<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.869> I<00:01:56.399> mean<00:01:57.399> there

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
software so we wanted to I mean there

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.450 
software so we wanted to I mean there
are<00:01:57.759> certain<00:01:58.090> ways<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.630> controlling<00:01:59.500> software

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
are certain ways of controlling software

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.310 
are certain ways of controlling software
better<00:02:00.670> than<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:01.090> would<00:02:01.210> be<00:02:01.270> in<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.600> CD<00:02:01.810> by<00:02:02.289> a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
better than it would be in a CD by a

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.309 
better than it would be in a CD by a
layout<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.670> for<00:02:03.880> example<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.569> browsing<00:02:05.050> here

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
layout so for example the browsing here

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.100 
layout so for example the browsing here
just<00:02:05.770> did<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.979> 200<00:02:06.670> browser<00:02:06.880> here<00:02:07.300> might<00:02:07.960> be

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
just did a 200 browser here might be

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.389 
just did a 200 browser here might be
it's<00:02:08.380> very<00:02:08.560> difficult<00:02:08.950> with<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.220> ones

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
it's very difficult with the ones

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.790 
it's very difficult with the ones
sing-off<00:02:10.209> knob<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.690> go<00:02:10.840> through<00:02:11.080> with<00:02:11.260> tons<00:02:11.620> of

sing-off knob to go through with tons of
tracks<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.160> have<00:02:12.190> there<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:14.050> whole<00:02:14.170> idea

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
tracks you have there and the whole idea

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.110 
tracks you have there and the whole idea
is<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.860> won't<00:02:14.980> have<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.340> touch<00:02:15.910> your

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
is that you won't have to touch your

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.290 
is that you won't have to touch your
laptop<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.810> have<00:02:16.840> everything<00:02:17.350> in<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:18.300> so

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
laptop you have everything in here so

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.820 
laptop you have everything in here so
you<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.630> a<00:02:19.690> mouse<00:02:19.900> pad<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.350> course<00:02:20.590> if<00:02:20.739> you

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
you have a mouse pad of course if you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.590 
you have a mouse pad of course if you
want<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.250> can<00:02:21.400> use<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.700> what's<00:02:21.940> an<00:02:22.030> XY<00:02:22.360> pad

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
want you can use that what's an XY pad

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.590 
want you can use that what's an XY pad
for<00:02:22.930> effects<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.820> one<00:02:24.970> thing<00:02:25.150> we<00:02:25.269> did<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.570> we

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
for effects and one thing we did is we

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.020 
for effects and one thing we did is we
call<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.560> future-proof<00:02:26.950> ideology<00:02:27.850> which

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
call it a future-proof ideology which

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.880 
call it a future-proof ideology which
means<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:28.570> whatever<00:02:29.200> happens<00:02:29.739> with<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
means that whatever happens with the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.280 
means that whatever happens with the
software<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.209> future<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.720> get<00:02:31.870> cool<00:02:32.079> new

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
software in the future you get cool new

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.440 
software in the future you get cool new
effects<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.829> get<00:02:33.010> cool<00:02:33.220> new<00:02:33.459> stuff<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.000> can

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
effects you get cool new stuff you can

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.030 
effects you get cool new stuff you can
immediately<00:02:34.780> make<00:02:35.230> this<00:02:35.440> work<00:02:35.680> with<00:02:35.890> all

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
immediately make this work with all

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.560 
immediately make this work with all
those<00:02:36.400> all<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.790> new<00:02:36.940> stuffs<00:02:37.209> you're<00:02:37.360> not

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
those all that new stuffs you're not

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.600 
those all that new stuffs you're not
stuck<00:02:37.930> with<00:02:37.959> what<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.500> have<00:02:38.680> now<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:39.519> if

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
stuck with what you have now so if

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.479 
stuck with what you have now so if
something<00:02:39.940> new<00:02:40.060> comes<00:02:40.090> up<00:02:40.480> with<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.720> software

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
something new comes up with the software

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.190 
something new comes up with the software
we<00:02:42.489> provide<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:42.880> with<00:02:43.180> support<00:02:43.600> how<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.810> do<00:02:44.019> it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
we provide you with support how to do it

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.840 
we provide you with support how to do it
and<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.470> can<00:02:44.650> just<00:02:44.680> immediately<00:02:45.070> get<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.760> to

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
and you can just immediately get it to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.900 
and you can just immediately get it to
work<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.390> that's<00:02:47.290> that's<00:02:47.890> strong<00:02:48.400> part<00:02:48.609> of<00:02:48.760> the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
work so that's that's strong part of the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.619 
work so that's that's strong part of the
ideology<00:02:49.660> how<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
ideology how the

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.970 
ideology how the
we've<00:02:51.349> landed<00:02:53.109> DZ<00:02:54.109> over<00:02:54.319> here<00:02:54.560> these<00:02:54.709> type<00:02:54.859> of

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
we've landed DZ over here these type of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.679 
we've landed DZ over here these type of
buttons<00:02:55.189> on<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.370> side<00:02:55.579> these<00:02:56.150> are<00:02:56.359> not<00:02:56.510> used

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
buttons on the side these are not used

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:03.190 
buttons on the side these are not used
for<00:02:56.810> loop<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.269> mapping<00:03:02.569> we<00:03:02.870> have<00:03:03.049> these

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
for loop and this mapping we have these

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.309 
for loop and this mapping we have these
are<00:03:03.609> for<00:03:04.609> example<00:03:04.639> for<00:03:05.120> cue<00:03:05.329> points<00:03:05.689> and<00:03:06.200> on

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
are for example for cue points and on

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.009 
are for example for cue points and on
the<00:03:06.409> second<00:03:06.829> layer<00:03:07.010> we<00:03:07.639> have<00:03:07.670> FX<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:08.389> and<00:03:08.569> off<00:03:08.689> I

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
the second layer we have FX on and off I

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.720 
the second layer we have FX on and off I
mean<00:03:09.500> if<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.739> need<00:03:09.889> order<00:03:10.010> chain<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.549> don't

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
mean if you need order chain you don't

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.250 
mean if you need order chain you don't
use<00:03:10.909> piu<00:03:11.209> points<00:03:11.480> you're<00:03:11.599> going<00:03:11.719> to<00:03:11.840> flip<00:03:12.079> that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
use piu points you're going to flip that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.709 
use piu points you're going to flip that
around<00:03:12.319> so<00:03:12.829> then<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.639> will<00:03:13.819> have<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.239> effects

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719 
around so then you will have the effects

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.979 
around so then you will have the effects
on<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:14.989> off<00:03:15.079> here<00:03:15.730> gotcha<00:03:16.730> now<00:03:16.909> there's<00:03:17.750> one

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
on and off here gotcha now there's one

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.110 
on and off here gotcha now there's one
this<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.379> one<00:03:18.560> control<00:03:18.950> it<00:03:19.099> do<00:03:19.579> you<00:03:19.700> need<00:03:19.909> two

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
this is one control it do you need two

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.879 
this is one control it do you need two
controllers<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.810> control<00:03:21.169> the<00:03:21.409> program<00:03:21.650> or

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
controllers to control the program or

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:22.899 
controllers to control the program or
can<00:03:22.069> you<00:03:22.129> do<00:03:22.219> everything<00:03:22.400> from<00:03:22.609> this<00:03:22.730> one

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
can you do everything from this one

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.699 
can you do everything from this one
controller<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:24.079> can<00:03:24.109> do<00:03:24.319> everything<00:03:24.560> here

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
controller you can do everything here

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.709 
controller you can do everything here
you<00:03:24.889> can<00:03:25.129> control<00:03:25.340> two<00:03:25.730> decks<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.419> single

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:26.719 
you can control two decks in a single

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.179 
you can control two decks in a single
controller<00:03:27.139> so<00:03:27.349> now<00:03:27.469> I<00:03:27.500> change<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:28.040> another

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
controller so now I change to another

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.140 
controller so now I change to another
deck<00:03:28.519> here<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.349> can<00:03:30.560> just<00:03:31.150> simulate

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
deck here so you can just simulate

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.849 
deck here so you can just simulate

aeneas we've got two channels of audio
out<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.400> how<00:03:34.609> easy<00:03:34.849> is<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.180> control<00:03:35.569> one

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290

deck and then flip it to the other deck
it's<00:03:39.169> it<00:03:39.590> might<00:03:39.889> take<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:40.579> little<00:03:41.090> time<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.449> get

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
it's it might take a little time to get

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.240 
it's it might take a little time to get
used<00:03:41.659> to<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.049> actually<00:03:42.260> it's<00:03:42.560> very<00:03:42.949> easy

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
used to but actually it's very easy

if you want to do something quick like
this<00:03:50.659> is<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> sheet<00:03:51.519> so<00:03:52.519> if<00:03:52.669> you<00:03:52.760> just<00:03:52.939> press<00:03:53.120> it

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
this is a sheet so if you just press it

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.849 
this is a sheet so if you just press it
down<00:03:53.329> it<00:03:53.569> shaped<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.319> it's<00:03:54.409> all<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.829> you

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
down it shaped so it's all so that you

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.559 
down it shaped so it's all so that you
don't<00:03:55.069> accidentally<00:03:55.579> go<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:56.060> another<00:03:56.329> deck

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
don't accidentally go to another deck

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.929 
don't accidentally go to another deck
double<00:03:57.169> tap<00:03:57.349> it<00:03:57.500> but<00:03:57.979> it<00:03:58.159> also<00:03:58.340> works<00:03:58.699> as<00:03:58.819> an

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
double tap it but it also works as an

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.309 
double tap it but it also works as an
all-in-one<00:03:59.120> controller<00:03:59.780> that's<00:04:00.019> why<00:04:00.139> it's<00:04:00.290> a

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
all-in-one controller that's why it's a

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.409 
all-in-one controller that's why it's a
multi-channel<00:04:00.739> sound<00:04:01.040> card<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.030> can<00:04:02.239> also

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
multi-channel sound card so you can also
