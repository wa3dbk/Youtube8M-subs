those<00:04:09.590> two<00:04:09.859> guys<00:04:10.659> not<00:04:11.659> to<00:04:11.840> say<00:04:12.019> that<00:04:12.230> there

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
those two guys not to say that there

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.550 
those two guys not to say that there
won't<00:04:12.470> be<00:04:12.620> other<00:04:12.709> other<00:04:13.220> people<00:04:14.319> knocking<00:04:15.319> on

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
the door also for for that top spot but

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.800 
the door also for for that top spot but
at<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.250> moment<00:04:19.430> those<00:04:19.759> are<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.030> two<00:04:20.209> who<00:04:20.479> I

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
at the moment those are the two who I

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.480 
at the moment those are the two who I
see<00:04:23.410> being<00:04:24.410> my<00:04:24.530> biggest<00:04:24.740> rivals<00:04:25.190> at<00:04:25.340> this

the<00:05:06.260> real<00:05:06.530> battles<00:05:07.130> will<00:05:07.340> start<00:05:07.639> in<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.820> Alps

the real battles will start in the Alps

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.270 
the real battles will start in the Alps
and<00:05:08.389> from<00:05:08.690> there<00:05:08.870> it<00:05:09.169> will<00:05:09.470> go<00:05:09.620> right<00:05:09.919> down<00:05:09.979> to

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
and from there it will go right down to

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.430 
and from there it will go right down to
the<00:05:10.430> wire<00:05:10.669> looking<00:05:11.510> at<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.720> race<00:05:11.870> in<00:05:12.050> general

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
the wire looking at the race in general

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.439 
the wire looking at the race in general
we've<00:05:12.590> got<00:05:12.800> more<00:05:13.039> mountain<00:05:13.789> top<00:05:13.940> finishes

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
we've got more mountain top finishes

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.350 
we've got more mountain top finishes
than<00:05:14.659> we<00:05:14.780> had<00:05:14.990> back<00:05:15.440> in<00:05:15.650> 2013<00:05:16.340> so<00:05:17.000> I<00:05:17.060> mean<00:05:17.210> it's

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
than we had back in 2013 so I mean it's

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.000 
than we had back in 2013 so I mean it's
it's<00:05:17.479> very<00:05:17.840> much<00:05:18.110> going<00:05:18.349> to<00:05:18.440> be<00:05:18.530> a<00:05:18.560> climbers

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
it's very much going to be a climbers

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.629 
it's very much going to be a climbers
race<00:05:19.479> despite<00:05:20.479> the<00:05:20.599> fact<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:20.870> we've<00:05:21.080> got<00:05:21.260> a

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
race despite the fact that we've got a

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.300 
race despite the fact that we've got a
50-plus<00:05:22.639> kilometer<00:05:23.360> time<00:05:23.570> trial<00:05:23.930> on<00:05:24.889> the

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
50-plus kilometer time trial on the

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.950 
50-plus kilometer time trial on the
penultimate<00:05:25.580> day<00:05:26.030> before<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.510> Sean's<00:05:26.720> early

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
penultimate day before the Sean's early

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.980 
penultimate day before the Sean's early
day<00:05:27.430> it's<00:05:28.430> going<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.180> make<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.449> race<00:05:29.630> really

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
day it's going to make the race really

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.469 
day it's going to make the race really
interesting<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.590> think<00:05:30.770> with<00:05:31.330> we're<00:05:32.330> going<00:05:32.419> to

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
interesting I think with we're going to

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.000 
interesting I think with we're going to
see<00:05:32.659> a<00:05:32.690> big<00:05:32.870> battle<00:05:33.110> in<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.380> mountains<00:05:33.800> and

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
see a big battle in the mountains and

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.980 
see a big battle in the mountains and
the<00:05:34.460> race<00:05:34.639> will<00:05:34.909> be<00:05:35.060> won<00:05:35.419> or<00:05:35.449> lost<00:05:35.570> in<00:05:35.900> the

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
the race will be won or lost in the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.800 
the race will be won or lost in the
mountains<00:05:36.409> but<00:05:38.500> with<00:05:39.500> that<00:05:39.680> final<00:05:39.979> time<00:05:40.310> trial

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
mountains but with that final time trial

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.750 
mountains but with that final time trial
it's<00:05:41.810> it's<00:05:42.199> gonna<00:05:42.470> whoever's<00:05:43.370> in<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.580> lead

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
it's it's gonna whoever's in the lead

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.909 
it's it's gonna whoever's in the lead
then<00:05:44.030> has<00:05:44.630> to<00:05:44.840> be<00:05:44.960> able<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.169> time<00:05:45.440> trials<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:45.830> be

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
then has to be able to time trials to be

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.100 
then has to be able to time trials to be
able<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.099> hold<00:05:46.280> on<00:05:46.430> to<00:05:46.580> that<00:05:46.699> lead<00:05:46.909> so<00:05:47.870> it's

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
able to hold on to that lead so it's

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.379 
able to hold on to that lead so it's
it's<00:05:48.620> panning<00:05:49.009> out<00:05:49.099> to<00:05:49.310> be<00:05:49.460> it's<00:05:50.060> going<00:05:50.240> to<00:05:50.300> be

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
it's panning out to be it's going to be

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:51.890 
it's panning out to be it's going to be
a<00:05:50.449> good<00:05:50.630> fight<00:05:50.810> this<00:05:50.990> year

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900
