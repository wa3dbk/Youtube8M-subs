00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
instantaneous and you'll need to be

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
can't convince him otherwise so you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.910 
can't convince him otherwise so you
might<00:03:28.630> as<00:03:28.720> well<00:03:28.750> give<00:03:28.959> him<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.110> ride<00:03:29.290> he'll

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
might as well give him a ride he'll

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.460 
might as well give him a ride he'll
choose<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> location<00:03:31.030> in<00:03:31.420> Hyrule<00:03:31.840> at<00:03:32.019> random

choose a location in Hyrule at random

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.240 
choose a location in Hyrule at random
and<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.830> take<00:03:32.980> them<00:03:33.130> they're

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
and if you take them they're

worth pointing out though that overall
this<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.810> probably<00:03:56.560> not<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.890> most<00:03:56.980> efficient

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
this is probably not the most efficient

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
way to make money I mean even though it

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.750 
way to make money I mean even though it
is<00:03:59.049> 300<00:03:59.829> rupees<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.220> that's<00:04:00.370> kind<00:04:00.549> of<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:00.670> lot

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
is 300 rupees and that's kind of a lot

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.030 
is 300 rupees and that's kind of a lot
if<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.000> do<00:04:01.239> well<00:04:01.660> at<00:04:01.840> this<00:04:01.989> but<00:04:02.530> bear<00:04:02.769> with<00:04:02.799> me
