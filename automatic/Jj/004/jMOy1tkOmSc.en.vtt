00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
it could be I'm turned off by the fact

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.820 
it could be I'm turned off by the fact
that<00:03:57.810> there<00:03:57.990> were<00:03:58.050> people<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.470> I've<00:03:58.590> heard

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
that there were people that I've heard

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.770 
that there were people that I've heard
of<00:03:58.980> in<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.220> movie<00:03:59.490> which<00:04:00.090> raises<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.570> red<00:04:00.720> flag

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.070 
I think that just cuz you've heard if
someone<00:04:03.000> doesn't<00:04:03.300> mean<00:04:03.390> they're<00:04:03.570> not<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.840> good

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
it's from France it just occurred to me

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.630 
it's from France it just occurred to me
that<00:04:50.180> all<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:51.320> energy<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:51.980> takes<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.550> get

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
that all of the energy it takes to get

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.170 
that all of the energy it takes to get
this<00:04:52.850> water<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.690> me<00:04:53.840> here<00:04:54.200> in<00:04:54.290> America<00:04:54.880> yeah

this water to me here in America yeah
French<00:04:56.660> water<00:04:56.870> it's<00:04:57.440> like<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.650> little<00:04:58.000> big

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
French water it's like a little big

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.810 
French water it's like a little big
carbon<00:04:59.480> footprint<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:01.280> think<00:05:01.580> I<00:05:01.640> probably

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
carbon footprint I think I probably

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.610 
carbon footprint I think I probably
shouldn't<00:05:02.420> get<00:05:03.050> this<00:05:03.230> anymore<00:05:05.410> only<00:05:06.410> cause

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
shouldn't get this anymore only cause

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.200 
shouldn't get this anymore only cause
it's<00:05:06.800> from<00:05:06.890> France<00:05:07.100> because<00:05:07.820> it's<00:05:08.000> from

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
it's from France because it's from

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:16.060 
it's from France because it's from
that's<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:08.690> reason<00:05:14.410> school<00:05:15.410> are<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:15.860> gonna

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
that's the reason school are you gonna

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.620 
that's the reason school are you gonna
cry<00:05:16.310> during<00:05:16.640> some<00:05:16.880> on<00:05:16.970> my<00:05:17.150> own

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
cry during some on my own

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.740 
cry during some on my own
maybe<00:05:18.560> it's<00:05:19.250> hard<00:05:19.580> not<00:05:19.760> to<00:05:19.820> cry<00:05:20.090> during<00:05:20.480> lame

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
maybe it's hard not to cry during lame

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.210 
maybe it's hard not to cry during lame
is<00:05:20.960> you<00:05:21.200> think<00:05:21.380> it's<00:05:21.470> possible<00:05:21.920> that<00:05:21.980> I<00:05:22.100> could

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:53.870 
really impressive vocally but I guess

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.030 
really impressive vocally but I guess
yeah<00:07:54.870> I<00:07:54.900> thought<00:07:55.170> he<00:07:55.230> did<00:07:55.530> a<00:07:55.560> great<00:07:55.680> you're
