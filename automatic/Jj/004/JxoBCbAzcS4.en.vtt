process<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.820> get<00:03:15.940> going<00:03:16.330> but<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.810> found<00:03:17.080> out

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
process to get going but I found out

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.310 
process to get going but I found out
with<00:03:17.320> them<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.980> they<00:03:18.220> had<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.640> whole<00:03:19.090> year

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
with them that they had a whole year

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.930 
with them that they had a whole year
fully<00:03:20.320> planned<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.920> themed<00:03:21.160> for<00:03:21.430> each<00:03:21.610> month

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
fully planned and themed for each month

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.479 
fully planned and themed for each month
so<00:03:22.480> for<00:03:22.930> example<00:03:23.350> one<00:03:23.530> month<00:03:23.739> might<00:03:23.920> be<00:03:24.040> babies

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
so for example one month might be babies

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.520 
so for example one month might be babies
and<00:03:24.790> seniors<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.299> breast<00:03:26.019> cancer<00:03:26.440> awareness

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
and seniors and breast cancer awareness

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.860 
and seniors and breast cancer awareness
then<00:03:27.160> safety<00:03:27.730> all<00:03:28.209> these<00:03:28.570> different<00:03:28.840> things

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
then safety all these different things

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.470 
then safety all these different things
so<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.350> could<00:03:29.709> pull<00:03:30.010> images<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.700> specifically

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
so I could pull images that specifically

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.350 
so I could pull images that specifically
met<00:03:31.900> their<00:03:32.680> criteria<00:03:33.519> for<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.910> month<00:03:34.180> and

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
met their criteria for that month and

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.509 
met their criteria for that month and
then<00:03:34.570> send<00:03:34.930> over<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.320> few<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:36.040> see<00:03:36.220> if<00:03:36.310> they<00:03:36.430> were

recognize<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.110> it's<00:04:22.320> probably<00:04:22.950> not<00:04:23.130> going

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
recognize that it's probably not going

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.100

to<00:04:23.550> fill<00:04:23.730> your<00:04:23.910> schedule<00:04:24.330> as<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.720> said<00:04:24.960> before

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.170 
but it will add credibility to your name
and<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.470> is<00:04:28.680> definitely<00:04:29.160> worth<00:04:29.400> something

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
and that is definitely worth something

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.140
