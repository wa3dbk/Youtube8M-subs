00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.849
 I want to teach is this beknown that already 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.999
 It has its review but 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.760
 Well, if you remember in the review your 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:37.690
 arms had a couple of holes where they were going 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.390
 these hands that are part of the figure 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.890
 then with a partner of the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.770
 community that is a good sculptor 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.760
 of plasticine 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.140
 until it becomes hard and stays with 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.810
 Plastic repair estévez because I see us 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 and it is no longer there because they do not have theirs anymore 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.059
 in the arms is now part of his 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.570
 of that of his body and it was very 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.159
 well this event looks very good 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.100
 See, it was pretty good 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.530
 then the other one that I want to teach them is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.390
 this 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.970
 small sentinel that comes with con with 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.759
 a wolverine of x-men classics see no 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.460
 He had arms and well, he put these 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.220
 arms 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:32.640
 quite well achieved these are not 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.640
 sculpted are from others are from other 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.670
 figures but good to see this one closes and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.030
 it opens and good that it was great 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.130
 al to this robot sentinel landmark and this 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.860

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.800
 robot 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.810
 and the other figure that I want to teach them 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.590
 is the one I like the most 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.170
 huevón had some claws because he did not bring 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.240
 claws good because these claw 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.030
 writing here are new and are from 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.650
 metal 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.229
 this is to win our powder magazine are from 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.850
 metal was super well see 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 the claws look pretty good 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.150
 and well then I am complete this 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.150
 figure to put it with my video 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.659

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.180
 I think he's a great figure and now 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.849
 with those claws it looks great not without 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.310
 doubt very well done very well achieved and 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.220
 Well, what I like the most is that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.140
 They are metal 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.630
 good in the auto figure that I'm going to 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.650
 teach let me go I'm going to remove these three 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.650
 because otherwise it does not 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.630
 it is this end 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.380

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.120
 Y 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.120
 good 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.319
 because I needed this arm that is 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.689
 very hard to get 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.780
 comes with scouts, well, this bullet 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:19.810
 is made of plasticine was a bit 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.470
 flow of the hand but also the person 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.040
