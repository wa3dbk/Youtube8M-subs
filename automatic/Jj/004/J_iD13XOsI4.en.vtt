 box here at the top of the anal with us 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.269
 So here is the bracelet itself 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.310
 here's a bracelet made of 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.700
 high quality rubber 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.090
 hypoallergenic and it comes in three 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.049
 in size, that is, washed away in this case 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.909
 me mk 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.689
 its weight is 22 grams as well he 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.310
 here bends that is inside him 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.219
 metal frame and with various 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.969
 electronic sensor pieces and so 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:34.759
 further and there is only one 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.920
 one button is this button if once 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.979
 press it then green appears 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.469
 asterisk she informs that he 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.380
 now in active mode ie 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:49.209
 you use it in this mode during the day 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.450
 if you hold it it vibrates 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:57.530
 appears a month a month and this is how you would 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.869
 put it into the night mode slip mod 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.209
 that is, with this mode in person 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.399
 turn on and go to bed next morning 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.399
 again they got hold 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.759
 switched to active mode and continue 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.770
 do their own thing, and if not 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.290
 one connector is here under this cap 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.700
 this is the usual three and a half jack here with 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.250
 By this, with its help, it does not charge and does not 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.630
 syncs with phone now 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.450
 I will show further on in our box 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.959
 this 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:38.310
 The charger itself can be said so on one 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.280
 the end of yusb on the other input-output three s 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.379
 half that is left bracelet here 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.620
 In this connector and further beating the computer 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:54.090
 He charges in the box with us 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.930
 there is a small instruction such here 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.720
 instruction in English in 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:05.489
 There is nothing interesting in principle . 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.220
 so application up 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.140
 buddha in bonn it exists only for 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.640
 iphone is not for this but since I 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.650
 iphone 4 he can't strive 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.180
 video replay via airplay on mac i 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.329
 installed that nike app 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.630
 Well, imagine that this is an iphone when you first 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:30.840
 start up she will ask to connect 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.889
 connect the device to iphone and so 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.290
 further and further you go through there 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.130
 registration ie profiles Najaf won 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:48.180
 create your 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:54.190
 but eat meat I will enter it now 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:59.250
 now nut 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.990
 the movie starts training first 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.670
 what for what but also to you the hour is all 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.940
 explainable 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.560
 leaf through here after you 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.780
 create your profile you have it 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:17.230
 asks for your height weight and so on 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.500
 your date of birth and gender of you 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.750
 how would the recommended schedule ie 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.420
 he gets me 8 hours of sleep 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.040
 10,000 steps per day recommended 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:32.850
 do here further that we stupidly screen 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.160
 there was a home screen here 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.190
 brushing us to the left side is like 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:46.060
 life line, that is, you can see 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:49.900
 all their statistics as for all the days afterwards 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.980
 that we have there is still a variety of trends 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.730
 i.e. complete information 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.980
 type social network 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.169
 add friends and so on to share 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.080
 there is something 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.450
 setup message well settings in 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.040
 In principle, you do not need to calibrate yourself 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:11.440
 bracelet either swap your not for weight there 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.110
 or anything like you changed so on 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.410
 the main screen we have this blue 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.260
 which is now spinning is a sleep mode then 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.070
 there is she appeals because how would I 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.200
 fulfilled 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.500
 one hundred and seven percent that is i even 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.070

 how many lay on the bed 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.020
 woke up and so on. 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.730
 the graph is orange we have it 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.310
 active mode that is how much we 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:54.580
 made the steps we see seven percent i 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.160
 passed as if from recommend and that is 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.890
 one hundred percent on the prize today is gender 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.490
 kilometer I passed how many calories 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:05.669
 spent and so on is still here 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.000
 green is this here after we go 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.640
 add 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.970
 some food we ate he adds 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:21.430
 more calories there any choose let's say 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:23.680
 the beer will be like a beer on the right 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.080
 we are on the plus sign click here just 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.390
 we can see the top recommend and what we 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.590
 need to do the day to synchronize 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.530
 it is possible but it is automatically 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.710
 syncs when connected 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:38.380
 alarm clock set alarm clock 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.480
 very cool on him that is you 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.510
 let's say I â€™m worth 830 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:47.560
 and he's in by now there plus there 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:49.990
 minus a few minutes picks you up like 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.660
 you better but the optimal time is that 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.330
 wake up to how would you become 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:59.800
 good mood and so on would be better 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:02.550
 felt this feature this for those 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.270
 whom sedentary work that is you put 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.400
 after what time will it be 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.870
 remind that if you sit not 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.330
 move he will let you go there 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.810
 in 15 minutes it is worth reminding here 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.680
 that you need to get up a little warm up 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:22.840
 so stopwatch 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:25.570
 This we now see power nap this 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:29.050
 if you decide to get some sleep during the day 

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:31.300
 turn on this feature and it gives you there 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.180
 you sleep somewhere 45 minutes is the same as 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.640
 would be so that at the optimum time with 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.570
 more suitable 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.890
 so here we have here you can choose 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.870
 if you are in the gym or anything 

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.540
 take up the load so he 

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.280
 was counting more calories and so 

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.320
