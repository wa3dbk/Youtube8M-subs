00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
might get a little snippy but it was

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.720 
might get a little snippy but it was

that old personality he lost and it

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.640 
that old personality he lost and it
really<00:02:38.370> showed<00:02:38.790> how<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.840> brain<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.290> really

really showed how the brain is a really

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
really showed how the brain is a really

in fact it's entirely composed of
neurons<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.590> those<00:02:58.590> neurons<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.250> way<00:02:59.430> of

neurons and those neurons have a way of

traumas but it's examples like this that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.759 
traumas but it's examples like this that
make<00:03:09.239> people<00:03:09.599> think<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.019> we're<00:03:10.319> really<00:03:10.500> only

the other sections of your brain will

lot of work and with some people helping

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.629 
lot of work and with some people helping
you<00:03:39.540> out<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.620> possible<00:03:40.919> to<00:03:41.220> recover<00:03:41.489> from

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
you out it is possible to recover from

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.710 
you out it is possible to recover from
even<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.419> severus<00:03:43.200> of<00:03:43.410> brain<00:03:43.620> injuries<00:03:44.069> to

even the severus of brain injuries to

so<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:58.090> really<00:03:58.660> hope<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.930> clear<00:03:59.200> /<00:03:59.410> repeat<00:04:00.100> the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
so I really hope that clear / repeat the

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.100 
so I really hope that clear / repeat the
ten<00:04:00.760> percent<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.300> your<00:04:01.390> brain<00:04:02.280> fallacy<00:04:03.280> of

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
ten percent of your brain fallacy of

ten percent of your brain fallacy of
