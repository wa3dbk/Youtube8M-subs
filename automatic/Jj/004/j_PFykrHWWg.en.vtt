00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.540 
one shot to the mag kinda like the word
of<00:01:45.450> crota<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.710> one's<00:01:46.860> also<00:01:47.040> Predis

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
of crota so this one's also Predis

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.940 
of crota so this one's also Predis
interval<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.180> well<00:01:48.470> because<00:01:49.470> we<00:01:49.620> also<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.920> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
interval as well because we also have a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.500 
interval as well because we also have a
smaller<00:01:50.280> where<00:01:50.550> you<00:01:50.700> increase<00:01:51.090> range<00:01:51.330> and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
smaller where you increase range and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.200 
smaller where you increase range and
stability<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> slower<00:01:52.680> reload<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.460> reduce

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
stability and slower reload and reduce

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.480 
stability and slower reload and reduce
the<00:01:54.360> magazine<00:01:54.810> size<00:01:55.049> this'll<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.040> pretty

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the magazine size this'll it's pretty

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.800 
the magazine size this'll it's pretty
good<00:01:56.640> i<00:01:56.700> would<00:01:56.940> definitely<00:01:57.150> use<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.360> perk<00:01:57.659> if

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
good i would definitely use that perk if

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
good i would definitely use that perk if
you<00:01:57.900> do<00:01:58.080> have<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.440> because<00:01:58.770> definitely<00:01:59.250> helps

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
you do have it because definitely helps

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
you do have it because definitely helps
a<00:01:59.490> lot<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.270> kind<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.510> brings<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.080> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
a lot that kind of brings the on a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.810 
a lot that kind of brings the on a
hulking<00:02:01.620> status<00:02:01.950> especially<00:02:02.340> since<00:02:02.549> apart

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
hulking status especially since apart

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480 
hulking status especially since apart
rate<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:04.020> fire<00:02:04.290> 82<00:02:04.590> impacts<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.220> impact

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
rate and the fire 82 impacts the impact

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.010 
rate and the fire 82 impacts the impact
is<00:02:05.640> obviously<00:02:05.940> much<00:02:06.119> higher<00:02:06.420> into<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.780> fire

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
is obviously much higher into the fire

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.109 
is obviously much higher into the fire
rates<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.770> moving<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.519> next<00:02:08.580> weapon<00:02:08.849> we

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
rates so moving on to the next weapon we

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.530 
rates so moving on to the next weapon we
do<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.619> Wolfsbane<00:02:11.340> now<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.209> one<00:02:12.360> used
