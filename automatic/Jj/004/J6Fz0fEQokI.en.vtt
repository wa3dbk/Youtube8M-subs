00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 moin moin and tae ho the new iphone 5 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.819
 Apple has it officially today 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.529
 presented 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.130
 and you know what you already know everything 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.559
 it's really all about it 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.690
 said to the new iphone or yes yes 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.970
 actually everything was already out before 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.769
 rumored it is right gas 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.509
 See for yourself I have a few here 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.519
 made notes so I have from time to time 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.869
 let's down to you guys for a while 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.770
 say come on you have a few 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.090
 general facts in ios apps 1700 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.470
 represented a thousand apps 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.680
 you have to differentiate 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.949
 probably 600 550,000 of them 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.650
 only absolute garbage and the rest are good 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.230
 but well, look 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.600
 In any case, 700,000 apps in the iOS app 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.460
 store of which are 250,000 specially for 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.829
 adapted the ipad and these devices 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.720
 can total 400 million ios 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.170
 devices are displayed and opened 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.080
 become 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.479
 Let's get straight to the iphone 5 that 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.460
 iphone 5 looks exactly like it does 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.580
 that means we have a 4 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.000
 inch display with a resolution of 640 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.280
 x 1136 pixel that means we have 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.890
 the same width only the higher overall 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.869
 we have one in the display 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.030
 integrated touchscreen that was yes 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.950
 otherwise always above 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.150
 we have this back out 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.340
 aluminum exists 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.200
 but that is different for the white one 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.440
 and black iphone so white silver 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.580
 and black could forget the name 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.080
 but look on the apple website 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.230
 So of course, left below in the video 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.850
 description at the Bavarian simple 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.860
 is the original aluminum at the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.350
 black this is still colored so 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.030
 no longer completely original aluminum 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.570
 So yes, but it is a bit 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.050
 yes modified say how it so the whole 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.320
 is only 76 mm thick that is very very 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.960
 very thin as it was said then 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 if you look at the iphone 4s and iphone 4 the 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.060
 back would decrease 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.680
 but it has a glass front 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.260
 and an aluminum back as well 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.640
 said software technically we have five 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.380
 rows of apps that's the first thing 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.090
 so it stands out just like a loved one 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.500
 pictures and old apps so now yes 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.330
 not yet adapted and to the new 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.310
 display so all apple apps are 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.989
 of course already adapted to it 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.879
 all the apps are not on it 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.349
 adapted are the will run so that 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.810
 top down a little black 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.060
 frame, so to speak, I think 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.569
 it would have to be like that somehow 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.819
 it not 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.900
 apple like not perfected the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.120
 display shows 44 better colors 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.099
 There are lte and lte will be in germany 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.499
 supported by telekom and vodafone 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.969
 the new iphone also comes with quite 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:42.939
 new headphones 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.620
 These so-called her potts were extra 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.180
 newly developed and I am very curious 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.040
 how the blades are in any case very much 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.000
 strange, but you can do that too 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.250
 course below in the video 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.010
 See description beside 5 ghz wlan 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.959
 Now we have an a6 processor 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.639
 Unfortunately, there is nowhere I have 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.250
 nowhere found if it is a dual core 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.109
 or quad core is but he is double 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.939
 as fast in the calculation as 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:07.239
 also in the graphic representation and 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.370
 but 22 percent more effective battery 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.189
 that means we have with, so to speak, in 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.519
 same battery we can live longer 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.129
 the iphone battery has exactly the same 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.900
 battery life as the iphone 4s became like this 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.849
 it at least stated we have to be honest 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.209
 talk about eight hours over 3g 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:28.599
 a standby throws 225 hours that are 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.370
 25 hours more than the iphone 4s continues 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.220
 with use over 3 g 8 hours battery 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.019
 durations at wlan ten hours and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.069
 Video playback is ten hours instead of eight 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.859
 not as I said and of course 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.720
 40 hours of music playback so 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.099
 actually quite ok i hope so 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.709
 stay that way that's really 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.569
 The camera stays beautiful 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.879
 the same as in the iphone 4s but 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.819
 she has a better image processor 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.769
 namely, the a6 also has a 40 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.359
 percent shorter trigger delay it 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.859
 is called as soon as we put it on the photo 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.019
 actually also stand directly in the box 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.909
 continues to shoot with 8 megapixels 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.259
 but the sensor has become smaller and it 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.819
 gives a noise reduction around the 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.139
 to prevent image noise 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.079
 There is also an automatic 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.639
 loleit then recognizes the pictures 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.409
 to improve little light 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.209
 cool cameras maybe too 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.500
 say that this panorama function the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.389
 I had already introduced 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.150
 the unofficially about a hack 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.829
 was officially included 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.009
 and we therefore panorama photos banks 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.509
 can be in a size of 28 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.099
 have megapixels 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:28.270
 the camera is still filming in 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.340
 full-hd but with a better one 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.040
 Image stabilization with face recognition 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.840
 and much more something new 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.460
 there is a nano it was not 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.030
 announced but is so on the apple 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.440
 website 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.690
 the iphone also has on the front 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.139
 a camera namely a facetime camera 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:48.410
 the finally hd is 27 phd and does 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.350
 12 megapixel photos the iphone has 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.090
 Now three microphones 1 &amp; 1 above like the aws 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.919
 and 1 on the back will look for 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.300
 Video filming is very useful 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.680
 but also serves the 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.699
 Noise suppression so what 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.680
 to phone 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.030
 We also have his new dock 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.860
 connection is called lightning 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.090
 just as they all rumored 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.710
 he has 8 pins and yes he should 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.510
 being fast is even supportive 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.370
 vanderbilt theoretically until 10 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.870
 gigabit per second I'm not 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.000
 believe the iphone supports this 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.680
 but it is theoretically there is also 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.060
 a very ugly adapter to the 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.040
 man can use around the whole 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.630
 but continue to use music equipment 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.940
 he really is not beautiful 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.380
 that is so super long are really 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.940
 find itself I do not know I 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.050
 personally quite ugly though 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.389
 dock connection looks pretty pretty 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.050
 cool from the iphone design itself 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.160
 I think that's really cool so me 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.840
 I think I'll pick 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.050
 On friday you can do it 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.639
 pre-order because only time was not 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.590
 is always said but from Friday's will 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.090
 simply give cause to the stores 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.680
 Do not let the apple story directly 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.110
 back down list because all people are you 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.630
 have the apple website go and on 21 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.860
 then it comes to us there is still one 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.479
 few others one but germany is 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.120
 among them that means we get that 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.940
 that yes that can only a very early directly 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.250
 on september 21, besides, the iphone is supposed to 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.440
 5 exactly the same prices as that 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.039
 iphone 4s show this is the new one 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.750
 iphone 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:10.070
 Honestly I miss the killer 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.229
 feature why should I choose now 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.820
 iphone I buy do not know there are 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.530
 no iphone killer feature 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.150
 I waited for it but it came 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.240
 not yet, you have to say that 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.800
 a very solid telefonist am curious 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.830
 as i all that a citizen with the 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.970
 new app on solutions so what i buy 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.010
 In any case, probably me 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.180
 32gb black version because I think 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.860
 that black is a bit 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.360
 I also had a cool out here 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.979
 a white and that's why I'm going now 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.630
 let's see to the black change 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.570
 what comes out I order on 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.400
 Friday before 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.570
 will you buy it look and 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.050
 after the description in the video there 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.789
 you will find a link 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.889
 apple website you can look at yourself 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.900
 it looks really big just like in the 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:49.500
 All rumors just look 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.389
 below 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.669
 otherwise write my comment 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.590
 you buy it if so what has you 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.840
 convinced if no why not 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.629
 Now to the say apple is shit 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.120
 or android is shit are both 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.009
 money operating systems but both have 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.419
 your pros and cons and i miss you 

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:07.919
 really that killer feature on the iphone 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.470
 4s because so if we have the samsung galaxy 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.250
 s3 has many many like for kilo 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.900
 features even if you do not 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.729
 but absolutely needs the iphone 4s has 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.409
 somehow I can not help it 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.879
 I do not know why you should think so 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:20.280
 I write in the comments 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:21.569
 I'm curious what you say yes and that was 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.979
 it to the new iphone 5 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.419
 and I hope we see each other then too 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:26.419
 next video is doing well
