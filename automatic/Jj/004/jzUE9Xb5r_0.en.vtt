00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
there which i think is actually a very

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830 
there which i think is actually a very
very<00:01:52.229> cool<00:01:52.770> feature<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.659> my

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
very cool feature with this so in my

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.020 
very cool feature with this so in my
opinion<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> best<00:01:55.860> part<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
opinion the best part about this is it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940 
opinion the best part about this is it
