00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.709
 characters in there they are pretty 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.970
 banal because he looks when you 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.800

 tell me this is science fiction 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.660
 but remains realistic at the level of 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.370
 character modeling in addition to 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.540
 that's good when you see the armor there 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.160
 on the other hand it's ultra well done it's 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.540
 the ultra badass why because when 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.190
 you see the basic character of the ultra 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.720
 man is a guy digging a little 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.130

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.420
 realized also follows the action of the beginning 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.459
 in the end and the movements are good 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.260
