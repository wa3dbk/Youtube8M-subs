00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
running into the ice cream I think he

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550 
running into the ice cream I think he
takes<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.940> little<00:02:09.060> bit<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.300> damage<00:02:09.539> there<00:02:09.959> so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.650 
test runs of this Finn was actually no
killing<00:03:15.640> him<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.820> few<00:03:15.940> times<00:03:16.120> it<00:03:16.330> was<00:03:16.390> kind<00:03:16.600> of

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
killing him a few times it was kind of

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.750 
killing him a few times it was kind of
even<00:03:17.020> but<00:03:17.260> here<00:03:17.800> it<00:03:17.920> seems<00:03:18.130> like<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.400> Ice<00:03:18.430> King

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
even but here it seems like the Ice King

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.360 
even but here it seems like the Ice King
is<00:03:18.820> quite<00:03:19.780> ahead<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.260> him<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:22.860> even<00:03:23.860> damage<00:03:24.220> as

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
is quite ahead of him so even damage as

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.000 
is quite ahead of him so even damage as
of<00:03:24.550> now<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.030> Finn<00:03:25.540> took<00:03:25.840> round<00:03:26.200> two<00:03:26.470> okay<00:03:26.980> I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
of now and Finn took round two okay I

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.160 
of now and Finn took round two okay I
apologize<00:03:27.400> about<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:27.940> so<00:03:28.390> I've<00:03:28.660> noticed<00:03:28.900> a

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
apologize about that so I've noticed a

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.020 
apologize about that so I've noticed a
pattern<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.650> basically<00:03:30.070> whoever<00:03:30.250> i<00:03:30.460> spawn<00:03:30.820> in

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
pattern is basically whoever i spawn in

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.820 
pattern is basically whoever i spawn in
first<00:03:31.300> has<00:03:31.480> been<00:03:31.630> winning<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.080> they<00:03:32.620> put<00:03:32.800> the

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
first has been winning so they put the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.370 
first has been winning so they put the
ice<00:03:33.010> cream<00:03:33.040> all<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.550> way<00:03:33.640> over<00:03:33.880> here<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:35.290> i

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
ice cream all the way over here and i

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.360 
ice cream all the way over here and i
don't<00:03:35.560> know<00:03:35.620> if<00:03:35.710> this<00:03:35.800> really<00:03:36.040> has<00:03:36.160> anything

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
don't know if this really has anything

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.430 
don't know if this really has anything
to<00:03:36.580> do<00:03:36.730> with<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.300> then<00:03:37.720> i'll<00:03:37.840> put<00:03:38.110> Finn

to do with it and then i'll put Finn
over<00:03:39.270> yonder<00:03:40.270> I<00:03:40.480> really<00:03:41.080> wish<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.320> could<00:03:41.350> give

he got a bigger hit up in and that ended
up<00:04:16.150> being<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.450> difference<00:04:16.480> let's<00:04:17.019> see<00:04:17.230> no<00:04:17.890> he

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
up being the difference let's see no he

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.390 
up being the difference let's see no he
still<00:04:18.310> had<00:04:18.459> for<00:04:18.670> health<00:04:18.910> he<00:04:19.690> got<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.110> one

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
still had for health he got that one

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.880 
still had for health he got that one
Finn<00:04:21.400> only<00:04:21.519> hit<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:22.000> one<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.110> he<00:04:23.290> at<00:04:23.500> two<00:04:23.680> so<00:04:23.860> I

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
Finn only hit a one and he at two so I

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.890 
Finn only hit a one and he at two so I
was<00:04:24.100> kind<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.430> it's<00:04:25.000> kind<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.300> weird<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:25.780> I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
was kind of it's kind of weird and I

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.240 
was kind of it's kind of weird and I
don't<00:04:25.930> know<00:04:26.230> if<00:04:26.320> it's<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.560> coincidence<00:04:26.770> my

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
don't know if it's just coincidence my

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.920 
don't know if it's just coincidence my
forever<00:04:27.670> spawns<00:04:28.060> first<00:04:28.390> into<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.690> same

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
forever spawns first into the same

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.690 
forever spawns first into the same
health<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:29.350> gets<00:04:29.500> first<00:04:29.740> hit<00:04:29.950> basically<00:04:30.460> wins

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
health and gets first hit basically wins

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.760 
health and gets first hit basically wins
they<00:04:31.360> both<00:04:31.540> started<00:04:31.810> off<00:04:31.930> with<00:04:32.080> ones<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.560> think

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
they both started off with ones I think

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.530 
they both started off with ones I think
they<00:04:32.890> have<00:04:33.040> just<00:04:33.190> like<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.610> random<00:04:34.090> chance<00:04:34.420> of

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
they have just like a random chance of

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.870 
they have just like a random chance of
hitting<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.810> one<00:04:35.080> or<00:04:35.290> two<00:04:35.620> so<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.280> mean<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.670> will

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
hitting a one or two so I mean that will

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.570 
hitting a one or two so I mean that will
be<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.300> difference<00:04:37.690> ultimately<00:04:38.170> and<00:04:38.560> just<00:04:39.460> by

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
be the difference ultimately and just by

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.090 
be the difference ultimately and just by
like<00:04:39.760> running<00:04:40.060> into<00:04:40.150> them<00:04:40.420> it's<00:04:40.600> like<00:04:40.890> if<00:04:41.890> it

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
like running into them it's like if it

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.800 
like running into them it's like if it
automatically<00:04:42.730> takes<00:04:42.970> damage<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.540> if<00:04:43.630> I

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
automatically takes damage so if I

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.050 
automatically takes damage so if I
scream<00:04:44.050> kill<00:04:44.320> Finn<00:04:44.560> here<00:04:44.860> Ice<00:04:45.400> King<00:04:45.700> will<00:04:45.880> win

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
scream kill Finn here Ice King will win

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.460 
scream kill Finn here Ice King will win
it<00:04:46.180> all<00:04:46.300> their<00:04:46.600> kind<00:04:46.780> of<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:47.020> in<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.200> corner

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
it all their kind of just in the corner

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.040 
it all their kind of just in the corner

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
back and each other down it's man look
