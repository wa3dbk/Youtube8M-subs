 soon as the most recognized 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.380
 percent very successful 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 in patients 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.330
 With chronic diseases it is difficult to treat like migraine 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.120
 hernandez chronic migraine 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.510
 sure hundred with great success 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.990
 scientific 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.249
 and it slowly corresponds slowly the patient goes 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 want to improve its quality tnt skin 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.230
 and the pepper c / indicating that it is in the case of the negative r process that lasts 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.420
 approximately eight months to a year 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.000
 percent in real terms like osteoporosis 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.049
 the organism has received teeth calcium 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.169
 deserved end 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.610
 for being a special case organic coffee 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.429
 in the organism barracks 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.950
 pa little by little 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.669
 the portillo olé electricity 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:22.879
 the normal movement in case the reconstruction abn - the headline and 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.639
 cellular components 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.239
 Perez after 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.299
 dt ricardo suddenly what have been their results 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.939
 in this line is complex like that of irache and cancer 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.629
 p in cancer 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.209
 percent the patient carried in this work counted 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.749
 can not you say that the patient the judges mackie 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:44.749
 is going to heal 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.589
 but palm hope good hope 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.579
 the patient 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.249
 the peri so it is developing 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.149
 electricity the answer has been too much 

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.409
 affected 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.349
 the ere by the organism the patient because the quality due to improve 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.530
 notably 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.039
 80 to 90 percent 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:09.159
 diseases like advanced diabetes diabetes ep 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.419
 the improvement is 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.919
 we do not form chicken 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.119
 the glycemia 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:18.700
 couple of gando yet for an average of 110 120 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.900
 the level the patient is also the police on the part of the organs 

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:27.180
 deplore the charge you are very famous 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.520
 that's why his master formulas 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.520
 could you talk a little about these formulas 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:36.369
 percent the masterful ointment this percent 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:37.609
 substances 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.579
 that has already been proven with the experience you are from jacque patients 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.099
 distance shaved 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.819
 the one they have put on their part and the mega zion drugs like that 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.729
 appropriate 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:50.969
 the organism 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.720
 to respond with ease 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.939
 3 that way 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.729
 that way that city 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.289
 formula murcia city 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:59.520
 the crazy priest 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.319
 to follow diseases 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.509
 already registered and formula 1 and that's why there are patients who are not from here 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.789
 from this city but different parts of the world that we clean them and the 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:14.249
 patient has an answer 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:18.479
 percent essential elements for back healing of any

 one of his master formulas 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:27.680
 logical 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.110
 despite all the world we are all human beings we accept it 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.569
 percent and we send it a part way 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.409
 We give guarantees that the patient has been 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.919
 petare thistle tell us a little 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.669
 about our nutrition that you think of our nutrition today 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.950
 percent the human being 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.120
 he asks the favorite in a classic artificial chemical world 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.600
 where he with his metal wind percent and that is called qatar food 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:56.800
 the food 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.930
 essentials 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.319
 the polo organism does not have them 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.370
 different chronic diseases every day because the organism 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.520
 by having daddy defense begin at this entrance 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.200
 to organisms different types of hospitalization singing 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.849
 and light part that every time there is more the other one called bacterial resistance 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.520
 then we need a 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.270
 precise formula for night the organism and thus with the precise medicines 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.439
 so I can answer and I could 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.490
 regenerate 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.580
 at the cellular and tissue level 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.370
 berto modesty we have information 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.059
 that you have a formula too 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:40.669
 the kiel has called juice of long life can tell us because it is called like that i 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.739
 the moscow to excel the origin of this document arga life 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.240
 the popular every day 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.800
 natural components 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.879
 very easy to prepare 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.120
 An example 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.199
 We go to the ico to prepare it easily about 30 seconds per minute 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.529
 and when they make half a glass of water 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:01.999
 a fruit can be a Panamanian

 so that the organism is well nourished 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.630
 we change a little bit when the diabetic patient 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.550
 because it can not take certain parts contemplates
