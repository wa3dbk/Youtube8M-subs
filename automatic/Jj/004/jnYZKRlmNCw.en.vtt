00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.699
 john people your race kieran welcome to 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.560
 another new body complete on this 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.599
 blackops one 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.770
 today a fully play with and so show 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.669
 Everyone knows, of course, on the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.079
 stoner is that then you only know 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.119
 today I am going to playmen with a weapon 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.369
 stoner is called and this weapon 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.579
 he falls under a gluing shimmer class 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.980
 but in my eyes it's an esl driver 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.899
 I don't know why that is still in it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.190
 A live single class is about first 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.570
 he 40 bullets 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.420
 I have an uccent nothing to assist 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.160
 that out and I have 60 bullets in addition he 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 shoots like an esl dry he plays and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.450
 sl5 where runs like an esl he doubts 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.680
 is so die from essel driver so i 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.870
 still won't be in those three years 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.329
 time I black as a pivot why 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.850
 this weapon to that may seem like them 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.620
 class of mine is really very strong 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.970
 guarantee unjust and therefore also or after 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.670
 I show you 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.470
 the stoner from black or is a one of the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 maybe best light bus ever filled me in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.960
 a call of duty game made to it 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.310
 comes of course 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.079
 First, he plays like a hessel 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.119
 driver is always ideal 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.400
 if we play much better 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 tastier than maybe my coast 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.500
 in addition, the them which really has up to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.630
 high fire the light pot high and everything 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.909
 body broken high with this weapon and he 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.420
 is really really very strong this on which 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.070
 you 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.560
 he will kilt in about needle will be there 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.970
 five six carbon just because of the fire 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.940
 those five and six balls are already greeks 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.320
 within half a millisecond man like that 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.340
 it just goes fast 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.500
 unfortunately someone comes with one again 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.760
 claim must be the Kempen and it really is one 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.170
 tube evening to use you have to 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.850
 toes watching me stuff are also once 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.659
 with this weapon because it's just real 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.119
 really very truth auto gali 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.860
 johannes he also enjoys swimming 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.409
 The chimu would actually be any weapon in it 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 game that is only there when you go to 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.470
 schiedam and it's just really a whole 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.970
 chill weapon to use are now two 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.500
 next to me 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.090
 come here thank you so much he's a lot 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.970
 preferably also fire with fire 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.460
 of course the old version of the folder 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.039
 studio on site or two because studios one 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.810
 remake of firing and i find this in 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.340
 my eyes probably just one 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.700
 tastiest smack to spot was one too 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.650
 play 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.480
 he is small which of course just chill 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.020
 is he is compact than is even chiller 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.790
 He plays so incredibly smoothly and yes you 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.590
 just want to have it smoothly already in one 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.300
 call or duty game you want may not have 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.860
 like term that really way too much 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.170
 are big already don't have folders 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.269
 as 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.129
 watch out for the claymore like others 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.190
 folders that just don't taste good 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.500
 Play folder must be fast and the must action 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.569
 be full and that's what you come for 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.540
 made for action packed 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.920
 I like games that get into it and or some 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.480
 folders you just don't get that sometimes 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.730
 back in call of duty I think that's a shame 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.440
 I just again you play the game because 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.090
 Your topical is a lot of game because you have a lot 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.099
 henry's okay game you really play 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.299
 just feel for a moment 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.360
 attack boy this is watched 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.190
 and you don't get that back in every folder 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.530
 that you get in call of duty and that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.269
 I think it's a bit of a shame as the 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.650
 find a market for college team up designs 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.390
 I think they really take that into account 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.370
 must keep that is really just it 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.410
 call of duty and that they cannot 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.230
 make a pedophile mat because they are not 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.970
 and and and random dora xplore man magic 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.349
 really just need to call or 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.640
 duty mold made call or duty call or 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.140
 duty call or duty de turned the game 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.269
 with play it's not called code duty for nothing 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.790
 and that action must always remain in it 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.280
 we keep that is just one and and 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.930
 point of sale of the game itself so that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.250
 I think looked and this mobistar the ideal 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.109
 Example of you looks a lot of action there 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.190
 this is what you still see 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.750
 Just a few knowledgeable you are 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.769
 natural pair of headless chefs in it 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.630
 but all that interests me not one ass 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.609
 still used to play fast 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.380
 then you don't care about knowledge 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.810
 mail is not allowed to do anything or 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.549
 someone just random there is the it 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.019
 klitsie on the canvas anybody so me 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.209
 just find this 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.739
 maybe also on location as a second folder 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.139
 studio of course can also from this folder 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.940
 is one of the coolest setup of it 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.130
 just a folder 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.989
 I hope to do this more often in such a way 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.060
 kind of a layout because it is real 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.680
 so sion to play and I 'm just going to the guy 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.299
 which imitate me just first kill in 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.370
 potty because edna claim you are not enjoying 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.540
 upstream Kempen and I go for myself 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.160
 do like him but i have none there 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.019
 be patient for that so I am already running away for hours 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.680
 I have no patience to stay put 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.150
 man 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.239
 I do n't understand that for a camper anyway 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.760
 screens that are sometimes just three 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.680
 minutes in a place and I don't understand 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.180
 where she gets that patience she gets it in no time 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.220
 being able to sit still for a long time like me 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.440
 if i know it then i love it 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.910
 it sometimes takes so much time for lady 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.320
 I just spend a minute somewhere 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.539
 with everyone knows when i all know 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.820
 study play but really close the try 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.099
 hard campers that really just enough 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.180
 sit still say but I do not understand is true 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.830
 that patience of dana 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.300
 all that they can remain silent for a day 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.680
 sit what is not nice 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.320
 music toys what do you actually do 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.300
 nothing to watch 2 kills and pdm 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.970
 and then still fun to play 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.470
 play well that is the inspiration of 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.009
 those people and also on the manga 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.720
 not off 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.520
 will always remain at the core 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.960
 send if you can that he played hit 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.759
 You naturally get used to this irritating 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.229
 but you know shit happens 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.500
 and you see it is those stoney guys 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.360
 it so so good to play with and 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.570
 I want to go into the comments and you now 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.930
 questions let the responses know if you have these 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.789
 class this weapon finds this stoner fall 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.740
 under the esl doubt class or online 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.360
 machine their class because i personally like me 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.680
 think it is really a so 5 icon skull 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.570
 michael for further away he almost 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.960
 no where we have high fire i am high term 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.610
 is 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.169
 he runs as fast as a doubt 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.870
 he really played his live and charred 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.070
 his ijssel drive us under external macs 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.419
 and in my eye a donkey is waving 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.070
 leave to sweat or your interactions 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.259
 find a leader single or an so 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.460
 doubt as the is made in call or 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.870
 duty in real life 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.580
 so in real life you just get results 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.650
 A line machine have been around for ever 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.630
 but the bow one ass he score was 30 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.650
 at seven with the night killstreak in it 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.630
 three got the shot cap 3450 xp and 518 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.949
 student house boys dolph watch people forget 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.990
 of course not to like and to the 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:50.990
 next time with people again
