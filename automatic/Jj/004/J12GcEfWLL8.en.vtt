00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.059
 one of the surprises of the just 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.650
 past e3 2015 is the announcement 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.869
 a new anno 22 05 plays like that 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.180
 predecessor in the future but comes along 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.410
 a lot of innovations after all 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.750
 So far we have been to the construction simulation 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.279
 We will show you in this video 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.619
 the new anno remains the principles of 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.510
 faithfully you build big cities and cities 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.100
 The resident will probably take care of her 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.440
 but does not choose between story anymore 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.350
 campaign and endless play the two modes 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.480
 are intertwined in 22 05 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.070
 if you start on a new map 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.320
 Do you have the choice story missions? 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.879
 fulfill or just to build on it 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.489
 every new state world has its own 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.230
 resources and incidental missions over one 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.300
 Overview card drives you between 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.550
 different island and moon settlements 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.850
 trade each of your settlements is quasi 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.530
 like a score on the predecessors 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.190
 The development of the moon is a 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.810
 important day of anno 22 05 the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.120
 story of the campaign turns around 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.280
 the race to the earthly dwells 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.500
 colonies provide important raw materials and 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.300
 energy to earthly cities of change 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.910
 between the game worlds should be afloat and 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.220
 without loading times important 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.680
 tool of every mayor 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.840
 is of course the overview card on it 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 set your trade routes and press 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.160
 you as manager different 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.280
 settlements in the economic system changes 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.080
 some things in anno 5.22 you persecute 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.640
 your goods were no longer in circulation 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.860
 start to finish 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.960
 as soon as you built a production building 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.210
 have the goods are your account 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.770
 So you look at one 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.420
 look which were in abundance 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.430
 are present and which are not 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.280
 Three factors affect yours 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.409
 economy labor logistics and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.760
 energy 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.330
 the latter behaves as in the predecessor 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.460
 In 2070, wind turbines erected power stations 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.770
 and other buildings that generate electricity 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.869
 to that comes the factor logistics if 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.880
 for example, stadium far from 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.380
 your city center is removed 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.610
 logistics are higher 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.650
 the same applies to 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.510
 production building the farther you from 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.930
 a transport center are removed 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.340
 the higher the costs develop 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.150
 you also have to have your workforce 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.950
 manage 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.390
 if you are too few human workers 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.400
 you can count on the help of 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.320
 robots set the production buildings 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.030
 you can expand it with different modules 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.340
 So you get about a higher yield 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.140
 bring or lower energy and 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.090
 production costs 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.739
 But back to the colonization of the moon 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.880
 one of the biggest innovations in the year 22.05 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.610
 In principle, the conquest of 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.790
 Luna less complex than island worlds 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.870
 your moon colonists have two 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.190
 the islanders classify civilizations 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.320
 against 4 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.430
 But that does not mean that the thing to 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.230
 moon walk becomes 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.480
 you have to make sure that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.230
 meteor shower your space settlement 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.390
 spare 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.549
 always under foodstuff enough to 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.530
 to be available 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.750
 You have to lift it first by outer space 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.560
 from the earth send a costly 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.140
 venture 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.660
 after all, you continue your moon colony 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.440
 expand the more automatisms you can 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.209
 unlock 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.340
 you at the administration at hand 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.140
 the developers go big 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.120
 worth on flottier and catchy 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.250
 play mechanics let's see if 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.709
 that works you will build new 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.420
 island metropolis neither on other players 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.340
 still meet opponents 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.079
 the latter will only be available for trade 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.970
 appear in the overview menu 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.500
 have a multiplayer function 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.620
 Developers also deleted 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.320
 In addition, anno 22:05 no mod 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.320
 Support offers the innovations and 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.120
 promise changes of anno 05.22 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.250
 a brisk and catchy 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.650
 We look forward to everyone 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.079
 case on the construction simulation appear 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.079
 it should be on the third of november 2015
