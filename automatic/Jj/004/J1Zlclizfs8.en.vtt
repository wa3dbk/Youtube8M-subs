00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Nine are welcome to the pga champion 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 preview and today we'll have a good look 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.540
 the heart of fred place at 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.519
 because this is supposed to be the new potter 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.549
 who also come from frejd that is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.770
 much has to do with 1 but also from the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.690
 mentality ago the train or in itself 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.730
 that does not just mean that of the im 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 place but also of the skills he 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 is a nice guy but the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.670
 can slap sometimes yes and we 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.439
 Just make the following we go 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.869
 now all skills through and look 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.550
 in which role he fits best 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.440
 because I have my guess so 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.450
 We want to start everything clearly 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 with the passive because this allows 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.500
 to reinforce his autochips 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.270
 hand out or a little cc 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.219
 because once he's an enemy once 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.730
 has attacked receives this one 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.260
 mark as soon as he has a lot of markings 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.289
 this explodes and the opponent is for 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.090
 12 5 seconds confessed that is funny now 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.610
 that the whole scales with that level 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.210
 one he comes sometime to 1.75 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 seconds 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.010
 that's super long that sounds like it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.470
 not bad but two things 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.570
 be mentioned first as soon as the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.540
 first steak on it are also allies 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.400
 with their cars capable of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.670
 pick up mark and I'll tell you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840
 at a carey that damn fast good 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.490
 and the second point is now that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.200
 of course after the adversary confessed 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.340
 he did not live for eight seconds 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.930
 can be confessed 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 but the special feature lies in it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.400
 as long as he is protected from this or more 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.110
 less affected is the bonus damage 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.430
 from our colleague and that is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.070
 of course also very very uncomfortable 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.840
 that means he could text on him 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.729
 really be interesting because how 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.799
 said he is self-employed in the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.119
 However, the mark can occur but to do so 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.799
 we come later look 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.020
 First his cow ability at this 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.299
 very simple linear killshot 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.310
 also a subtle speed to the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.799
 day brings and as soon as the opponent 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.509
 was hit or the first opponent 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.850
 got hit this one 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.560
 70 percent sloan two seconds ago 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.600
 is already relatively much and receives 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.219
 also a stack of his passive ones 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.290
 in relation to the damage you have to 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.689
 say that the whole does not escalate with 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.420
 but with his maximum life and 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.829
 currently it is on the bab 2 5 percent 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.599
 I have to say that it is a very 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.970
 can be useful tool to the opponents 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.560
 is to be expected and the idea carrier 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.450
 thus time audio tracks on the 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.280
 to land where it may become a stan 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.080
 leads google now we come to his 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.030
 this ability to see and little bit 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.190
 also to the trailer in which we yes 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.290
 but seen the little pro for he is 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.849
 in the position of an allied one 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.920
 to make or first time to 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.200
 to jump it all works 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.090
 even with minions next to the jump 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.440
 but also in the situation now 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.180
 even or the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.769
 to protect allies with and with 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.660
 a fair amount of magic 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.400
 Resistance and armor will be worth this 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.930
 also depending on how strengthened 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.060
 magic resistance or how much 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.680
 armor brown also brings along well 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.720
 come only to his abilities and 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.790
 German she calls herself indestructible 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.650
 and from the mechanic one is in the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.450
 able to set up a wall 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.400
 well and this reminds a little 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.380
 a bit of anja suhr also has one 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.780
 similar function that would be the first 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.819
 screenshot or first projects will be 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.310
 completely intercepted and the rest 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.959
 are mitigated by the damage that 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.720
 Practical meanwhile is the braum 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.310
 ten minutes later holds without as well 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.799
 can carry the shield around 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.630
 or very mobile with it 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.980
 So this is the perfect tool for you 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.459
 for example, before di luci multi too 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.170
 put 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.079
 Well, now we come to his ultimate 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.540
 the one mixture between tolls between 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.250
 name and between rumble represents that 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.620
 means brown smashes on the floor and 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.420
 thus creates a wave and the first 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.819
 opponent who was hit by this 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.620
 is thrown 15 seconds into the air 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.579
 the remaining bit shorter the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.829
 it is now practical that the 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.290
 crevasse remains four seconds and 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.079
 every opponent who runs through it for 15 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.519
 seconds for 60 slows down so similar 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.290
 like the ultimate of rumble what 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.569
 at least the slowdown concerns 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.639
 initiate but also to hunt is this 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.709
 Ultimate really great 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.600
 but what you do not have is the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.500
 stacks for the passive but I too 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.569
 consider fair 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.250
 good as much about the skills here 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.440
 Of course you can say that we still 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.260
 it can still be on the pc 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.160
 change everything right now the numbers are there 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.720
 I still think one or the other 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.489
 experience adaptation 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.900
 Let's take another look at that 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.609
 he was already able to play in the 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.790
 background see that we have one 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.590
 could see support in the room and who 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.600
 makes itself quite good that is 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.430
 just with the relic of that I think 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.620
 a big advantage what the sustain 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.229
 and as I said the passive that 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.660
 one with the allied common one 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.910
 can trigger as soon as the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.040
 stack imposed by oneself 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.290
 that is great so it is 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.610
 an almost eternal idea here in the game 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.560
 you could see that he shared with 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.140
 was played out and it was already 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.540
 it's very funny that it dominates 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.950
 in the same game also a tree on the 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.200
 been played top line and I think 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.330
 he also has potential for that he has there 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.070
 a massive bonus to a massive tank 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.280
 can therefore be very good with 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.960
 armor or with life he scales 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.000
 yes, the shield can also on itself 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.710
 make or minions on 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.780
 security for the appropriate time 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.670
 reinforce and besides that is the high one 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.710
 be already through his passive reason 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.080
 extremely useful for destroying enemies 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.420
 or just to help with gangs 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.490
 I also think that he has potential in 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.410
 he's even in the jungle to go 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.210
 able to be played on expeed 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.160
 because quite simply the passive one very much 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.990
 it is not only useful that the stand 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.670
 comes faster but as long as that 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.280
 opponent can no longer be confessed 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.050
 he is also capable of bonus armani 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.600
 to do and there it is at high 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.280
 text something very very uncomfortable that 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.850
 means we have a champion here 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.290
 in front of us the super flexible what can be 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.480
 but I think one or the other 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.070
 against the line is the ride is yes 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.330
 trying to bring out something new and 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.920
 I think with brown you have one there 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.570
 very very good step done 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.430
 Of course you have to look that one 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.440
 no one really cements everywhere 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.030
 that fits very well, of course 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.320
 nice because that is just in the 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.480
 Champions league already has a bandwidth 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.910
 There are possibilities because nobody knows 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.320
 where he plays everything clearly further 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.180
 I leave out speculation outside 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.100
 As I said we are here on the pbs 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.990
 can still very many changes 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.180
 I give hope all but still 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.300
 pure skin and have fun while 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.300
 guess
