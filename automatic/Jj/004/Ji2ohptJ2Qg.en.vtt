00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
when you look at these they're mainly

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.609

variations<00:00:37.840> not<00:00:38.840> even<00:00:39.020> remotely<00:00:39.410> let's<00:00:40.280> look

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
variations not even remotely let's look

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:49.100 
variations not even remotely let's look
at<00:00:40.640> myth<00:00:40.790> number<00:00:40.969> two

altered to be more historic in fact
there<00:01:31.510> is<00:01:31.690> proof<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.080> little<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.010> New

Testament has been altered if we look at

Testament has been altered if we look at
the<00:01:35.920> early<00:01:36.220> manuscripts<00:01:36.550> of<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.030> New

the early manuscripts of the New

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.090 
the early manuscripts of the New
Testament<00:01:37.450> we<00:01:38.200> find<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.560> there<00:01:38.740> are<00:01:38.800> some

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
Testament we find that there are some

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.280 
Testament we find that there are some
differences<00:01:39.369> between<00:01:39.910> variant<00:01:40.570> manuscripts

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
differences between variant manuscripts

differences between variant manuscripts
but<00:01:42.250> these<00:01:42.430> are<00:01:42.580> mainly<00:01:42.760> small<00:01:43.270> words

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
but these are mainly small words

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.310
