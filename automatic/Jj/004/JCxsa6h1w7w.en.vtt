00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480 
gotten any of these sets so far I

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.410 
gotten any of these sets so far I
recommend<00:07:23.350> you<00:07:23.500> should<00:07:23.560> get<00:07:24.100> them<00:07:24.340> and<00:07:24.580> what

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.420 
recommend you should get them and what

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.290 
recommend you should get them and what
the<00:07:25.750> set<00:07:26.350> the<00:07:26.740> set<00:07:27.010> I<00:07:27.250> probably<00:07:27.580> recommend<00:07:28.000> the

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.300 
the set the set I probably recommend the

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.840 
the set the set I probably recommend the
most<00:07:28.480> is<00:07:28.830> probably<00:07:29.830> team<00:07:30.430> cut<00:07:30.670> and

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:30.850 
most is probably team cut and

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.610 
most is probably team cut and
heaven-born<00:07:31.300> because<00:07:31.690> same<00:07:31.870> cutter<00:07:32.110> is<00:07:32.290> a<00:07:32.350> new

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
heaven-born because same cutter is a new

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.070 
heaven-born because same cutter is a new
figure<00:07:33.400> and<00:07:34.000> he<00:07:34.180> hasn't<00:07:34.300> been<00:07:34.540> resting<00:07:34.930> that

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 
figure and he hasn't been resting that

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.840 
figure and he hasn't been resting that
much<00:07:35.290> also<00:07:35.560> what<00:07:35.890> seven<00:07:36.190> born<00:07:36.460> being<00:07:36.610> a<00:07:36.700> new

picture figure not resting that much and

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.510 
picture figure not resting that much and
they<00:07:39.400> probably<00:07:40.000> probably<00:07:40.600> will<00:07:41.020> go<00:07:41.170> rare<00:07:41.530> so

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520
