each story propels the next story and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.990 
each story propels the next story and
then<00:02:01.710> you're<00:02:01.860> back<00:02:02.040> again<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.550> it<00:02:02.610> propels

on a separate level all the stories that
we<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.510> obviously<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.650> idea<00:02:37.860> was<00:02:38.040> they

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
we have obviously the idea was they

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.770 
we have obviously the idea was they
should<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.519> connected<00:02:38.790> through<00:02:39.000> something

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
should be connected through something

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.110 
should be connected through something
like<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.930> character<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:41.250> started<00:02:41.580> looking<00:02:42.030> at

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.090 
we just started finding those connective
moments<00:04:12.970> in<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.299> cards<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.049> it<00:04:14.319> was<00:04:14.440> amazing

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
moments in the cards and it was amazing

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.789 
moments in the cards and it was amazing
how<00:04:15.400> all<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.060> them<00:04:16.329> matched<00:04:16.539> up<00:04:16.720> we<00:04:17.380> had<00:04:17.500> I

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
how all of them matched up we had I

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.890 
how all of them matched up we had I
think<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.190> big<00:04:18.400> field<00:04:18.789> of<00:04:18.970> what<00:04:19.239> we<00:04:19.389> all<00:04:19.570> loved

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
think of big field of what we all loved

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.920 
think of big field of what we all loved
then<00:04:20.680> slowly<00:04:21.220> it<00:04:21.639> had<00:04:21.880> kind<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.330> natural

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
then slowly it had kind of a natural

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.110 
then slowly it had kind of a natural
progression<00:04:23.139> towards<00:04:23.979> slimming<00:04:24.639> down<00:04:24.789> the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
progression towards slimming down the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.090 
progression towards slimming down the
amount<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.479> information<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:26.200> one<00:04:26.560> movie<00:04:26.919> can

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
amount of information that one movie can

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.060 
amount of information that one movie can
carry<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:28.270> this<00:04:28.600> extraordinary<00:04:29.229> experience

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
where what looks like it can't be done

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.570 
where what looks like it can't be done
is<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:34.150> somehow<00:04:34.510> being<00:04:35.139> done<00:04:35.440> all<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.370> them<00:04:36.460> all

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
is it somehow being done all of them all
