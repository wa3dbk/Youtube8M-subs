00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.840
 on this occasion he is sun king and not a 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.670
 launch that we are doing 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.910
 together with intel media phone 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.920
 smartphone with intel processor is a 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.740
 processor with a core of the guides 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.410
 hertz the novillada of ram 8 villademor 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.940
 internal with a screen 43 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.220
 Perhaps the detail you can see is that 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.930
 for being a power 43 is the phone 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.210
 smaller in dimensions with a 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.550
 4t screen of the market why because 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.349
 it's practically edges does not have almost 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.570
 edges on the front we are 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.339
 speaking that occupies 75% of the part 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.949
 frontal is attractive that is to say it is 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.890
 screen a product that also comes 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.239
 the king family are and have what is the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.710
 that speaks on the back that what 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.980
 makes a screen much more robust 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.050
 8 megapixel camera and front what 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.260
 galas security for everything that is 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.579
 Robustness the product with julia android 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.999
 that starts with a and if it is what is 40 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.950
 to try of diable bird to 41 soon 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:07.000
 share the policies 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:10.060
 good if I leave to tell you the subject 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.370
 to be arranged in a second and 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.750
 in addition also hdr and if you can see this 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.270
 phone that faster activates a 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.580
 goat although this we are going to block it 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.580
 an unlocked example 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 to the active camera 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.540
 and very fast what is what is the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.540
 camera opening 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.710
 with simple webs are the camera 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.650
 you practically do not have to remove it from 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.090
 pockets is taking the form 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.480
 is the most important solution that 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.840
 we have 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.610
 when I do believe that they are in 10 days 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.760
 all the most retail operators in 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.350
 set an approximate value the product 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.440
 quite from 2002 500 pesos depending 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.080
 of the operator the subsidy of the credit already 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.080
 Free and free level to be enough in four thousand 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.890
 but the game 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.880
 the operators we are talking about 40 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.569
 3 because double to cover the part 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.569
 later 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.799
 a screen of 4 frontal score 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.720
 with a density of 320 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.720
 largest market 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.580
 with 4 points 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.079
 the maintained battery of 2,600 million 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.739
 which will have more than one day safe 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.709
 product is also nfc and this product 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.489
 in addition it is also 4g lte has the 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.200
 capacity of networks to needs 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.390
 really extreme and also both are 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.390
 from 4g to chip let's say 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.840
 with respect to the hike the microprocessor 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.379
 intel applications abstentions 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.239
 all the problem in which 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.400
 obviously you have to turn off rays 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.840
 specific and specific algorithms by 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.879
 each processor works different 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.160
 this is already solved before the 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.620
 same product I realized, let's say 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.460
 with all the standard functions of 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.470
 android 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.210
 like summer 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.920
 so whatever application I get 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.890
 happen to install I will be able to be and 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.380
 eventually the application of a 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.380
 application is very specific but good
