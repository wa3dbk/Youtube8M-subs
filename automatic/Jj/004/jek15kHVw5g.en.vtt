00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and one of the questions that we wanted

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.740 
and one of the questions that we wanted
to<00:00:40.980> try<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.700> begin<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> address<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.510> why<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to try to begin to address as why is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.840 
to try to begin to address as why is
this<00:00:43.110> isn't<00:00:43.530> oxygen<00:00:43.860> concentration<00:00:44.489> truly

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
this isn't oxygen concentration truly

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.520 
this isn't oxygen concentration truly
important<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.110> how<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.350> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
important and if so how is it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.110 
important and if so how is it
functioning<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.100> breast<00:00:47.309> cancer<00:00:47.430> cells<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
functioning in breast cancer cells to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.750 
functioning in breast cancer cells to
either<00:00:48.539> repress<00:00:49.140> their<00:00:49.620> proliferation<00:00:50.219> rates

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
either repress their proliferation rates

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
either repress their proliferation rates
or<00:00:51.030> block<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> activity<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> estrogen

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
or block the activity of the estrogen

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
or block the activity of the estrogen
receptor<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.920> those<00:00:53.039> cell<00:00:53.219> lines<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.480> what

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
receptor in those cell lines and so what

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 
receptor in those cell lines and so what
we've<00:00:54.840> shown<00:00:55.079> today<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.850> doc<00:00:57.090> suphan

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
we've shown today is that in doc suphan

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.380 
we've shown today is that in doc suphan
can<00:00:58.469> cause<00:00:58.739> estrogen<00:00:59.399> receptor-alpha<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.270> be

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
can cause estrogen receptor-alpha to be

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.080 
can cause estrogen receptor-alpha to be
degraded<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.109> therefore<00:01:02.100> reducing<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
degraded and therefore reducing the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.729 
degraded and therefore reducing the
levels<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.840> receptor<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.530> found

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
levels of that receptor that are found

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.399 
levels of that receptor that are found
in<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.610> tissue<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.290> can

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
in the tissue and we know that they can

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.649 
in the tissue and we know that they can
also<00:01:07.500> block<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.250> alpha<00:01:08.520> function<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
also block your alpha function and it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
also block your alpha function and it
does<00:01:09.869> does<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.070> quite<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:11.580> at

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
does does this quite well at

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820 
does does this quite well at
concentrations<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:12.780> found<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.229> those

that one of the things that both the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799

sequencing of that gene and patients

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.450

probably<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.470> something<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.920> should<00:01:43.979> start

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
probably is something that should start

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.490 
probably is something that should start
to<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.729> becoming<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.540> common<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.020> practice

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to be becoming more common of a practice

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
to be becoming more common of a practice
because<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.640> individual<00:01:48.149> has<00:01:48.360> mutations

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
because if an individual has mutations

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.139 
because if an individual has mutations
in<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.409> gene<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.979> therefore<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:50.970> not

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
in that gene and therefore what will not

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
in that gene and therefore what will not
metabolize<00:01:51.780> high<00:01:51.960> levels<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> undocks<00:01:52.619> when

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
metabolize high levels of undocks when

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.020 
metabolize high levels of undocks when
they're<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> respond<00:01:53.790> very<00:01:53.939> well

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
they're not going to respond very well

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.120 
they're not going to respond very well
to<00:01:54.180> tamoxifen<00:01:54.540> therapy<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.560> those<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:56.009> be

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
to tamoxifen therapy so those would be

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.230 
to tamoxifen therapy so those would be
the<00:01:56.159> individuals<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.820> would<00:01:56.969> need<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> be

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the individuals that would need to be

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
the individuals that would need to be
treated<00:01:57.509> with<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.810> different<00:01:58.170> drug<00:01:58.670> while

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
treated with a different drug while

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.910 
treated with a different drug while
patients<00:02:00.000> who<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.689> wild<00:02:01.020> type<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.649> gene

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
patients who are wild type for this gene

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.230 
patients who are wild type for this gene
would<00:02:02.130> probably<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.759> quite<00:02:03.000> well<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
would probably do quite well in

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.600 
would probably do quite well in
tamoxifen<00:02:03.659> therapy<00:02:04.079> there's<00:02:04.680> also<00:02:04.920> some<00:02:05.399> hope

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
tamoxifen therapy there's also some hope

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.490 
tamoxifen therapy there's also some hope
maybe<00:02:06.210> down<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.479> road<00:02:06.600> quite<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> ways<00:02:07.259> after

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
maybe down the road quite a ways after

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.350 
maybe down the road quite a ways after
some<00:02:07.829> more<00:02:07.950> extensive<00:02:08.340> research<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:09.209> in

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
some more extensive research that in

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.729 
some more extensive research that in
docs<00:02:09.539> oven<00:02:09.810> could<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.110> developed<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.619> an

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
docs oven could be developed as an

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.710 
docs oven could be developed as an
alternative<00:02:11.220> drug<00:02:11.459> therapy<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.690> we

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
alternative drug therapy and so if we

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.580 
alternative drug therapy and so if we
could<00:02:13.050> create<00:02:13.290> an

into a drug that patients could take we

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.509 
into a drug that patients could take we
wouldn't<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.800> worry<00:02:16.950> about<00:02:17.069> their<00:02:17.340> sip
