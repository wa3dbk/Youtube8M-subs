kind of plain but the blue and silver

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.719 
kind of plain but the blue and silver
always<00:00:50.879> look<00:00:51.210> nice<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.190> it's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> good<00:00:53.519> set

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
always look nice and it's a good set

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.609 
always look nice and it's a good set
this<00:00:53.909> actually<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.540> an<00:00:54.720> original<00:00:55.260> blue<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
this actually was an original blue and

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.750 
this actually was an original blue and
silver<00:00:55.799> set<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.299> uh<00:00:58.460> it's<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.549> been

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
silver set so it's uh it's just been

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.640 
silver set so it's uh it's just been
repainted<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.479> match<00:01:00.659> the<00:01:00.930> original<00:01:01.019> colors

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
repainted to match the original colors

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.160 
repainted to match the original colors
which<00:01:02.059> don't<00:01:03.059> tend<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.479> hold<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.960> too<00:01:04.140> well

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
which don't tend to hold up too well

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.990 
which don't tend to hold up too well
especially<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.920> silver<00:01:05.189> like<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> lot<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
especially the silver like a lot of the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.630 
especially the silver like a lot of the
line<00:01:06.180> L<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.780> didn't<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.200> being<00:01:08.100> pulled<00:01:08.370> by

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
line L so it didn't it's being pulled by

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.430 
line L so it didn't it's being pulled by
a<00:01:09.320> pre-war<00:01:10.320> Lyon<00:01:10.620> L<00:01:10.830> 204<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:12.320> as<00:01:13.320> I

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
a pre-war Lyon L 204 which was as I

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.500 
a pre-war Lyon L 204 which was as I
understand<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.160> one<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> engine<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
understand that one of the engine that

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.170 
understand that one of the engine that
could<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.870> been<00:01:16.400> included<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.790> set<00:01:18.030> that

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
could have been included in a set that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.870 
could have been included in a set that
had<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.600> cards<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.460> I'm<00:01:20.460> pretty<00:01:20.670> happy

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
had these cards and I'm pretty happy

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.430 
had these cards and I'm pretty happy
with<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> way<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.420> turned<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.230> hope

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
with the way these turned out so hope

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:40.649 
with the way these turned out so hope
you<00:01:22.560> enjoy<00:01:22.770> seeing<00:01:23.070> them<00:01:23.190> run

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:46.359 
kind of a sort of a precursor to the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.899 
kind of a sort of a precursor to the
