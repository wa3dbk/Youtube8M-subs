because<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> save<00:01:31.950> me<00:01:32.100> money

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
because it's just going to save me money

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.999 
because it's just going to save me money
overall<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.390> might<00:01:33.600> even<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:34.079> me<00:01:34.259> 99<00:01:34.590> cuz

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
overall and it might even get me 99 cuz

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.620 
overall and it might even get me 99 cuz
I'm<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> train<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.700> obviously<00:01:36.090> between

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
I'm going to train up obviously between

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.330 
I'm going to train up obviously between
now<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> then<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.560> whatever<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.100> left

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
now and then and whatever I have left

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.890 
now and then and whatever I have left
I'm<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.939> try<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.180> smash<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.780> on

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
I'm just going to try and smash out on

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.280 
I'm just going to try and smash out on
the<00:01:40.140> day<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.350> that's<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.400> plan<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.700> me<00:01:42.030> if<00:01:42.509> I

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the day so that's the plan for me if I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.109 
the day so that's the plan for me if I
do<00:01:43.350> already<00:01:43.710> reach<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.189> goals<00:01:44.399> before<00:01:44.610> then<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
do already reach the goals before then I

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.690 
do already reach the goals before then I
obviously<00:01:45.689> need<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> backup<00:01:46.439> plan<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
obviously need a backup plan and the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.660 
obviously need a backup plan and the
back-up<00:01:48.060> plan<00:01:48.350> might<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.549> Dungeoneering<00:01:50.549> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
back-up plan might be Dungeoneering it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.130 
back-up plan might be Dungeoneering it
might<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.060> prayer<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:51.930> too<00:01:52.110> sure

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
might be prayer I'm not really too sure

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.649 
might be prayer I'm not really too sure
yet<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.130> think<00:01:53.490> prayer<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> moment

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
yet because I think prayer at the moment

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.830 
yet because I think prayer at the moment
being<00:01:54.899> 95<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:56.310> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.390> good<00:01:57.810> level

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
being 95 it's kind of at a good level

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
being 95 it's kind of at a good level
you<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.350> I've<00:01:58.469> already<00:01:58.680> got<00:01:58.920> curses<00:01:59.490> I've

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you know I've already got curses I've

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.999 
you know I've already got curses I've
got<00:01:59.909> turmoil<00:02:00.479> all<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.229> things<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.649> really

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
got turmoil all the things that really

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.580 
got turmoil all the things that really
work<00:02:02.610> together<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.200> happy

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
work together I do have and I'm happy

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.649 
work together I do have and I'm happy
with<00:02:04.770> how<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.369> prayer<00:02:06.180> isn't<00:02:06.360> my<00:02:06.600> number

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
with how it is so prayer isn't my number

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.419 
with how it is so prayer isn't my number
one<00:02:07.110> priority<00:02:07.259> yes<00:02:07.770> it'd<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.009> nice<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.190> have

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
one priority yes it'd be nice to have

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729 
one priority yes it'd be nice to have
the<00:02:08.610> cape<00:02:08.789> have<00:02:09.030> 99<00:02:09.509> however<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the cape have 99 however you know I

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.890 
the cape have 99 however you know I
guess<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.310> top<00:02:11.580> priority<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.239> not

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
guess that it's not top priority so not

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.400 
guess that it's not top priority so not
only<00:02:12.959> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
only to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.830 
only to
that<00:02:13.770> one<00:02:13.920> yet<00:02:14.100> but<00:02:14.880> if<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.090> don't<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.480> prayer

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that one yet but if I don't do prayer

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.900 
that one yet but if I don't do prayer
and<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.470> herb<00:02:16.680> lore<00:02:16.890> done<00:02:17.280> before<00:02:17.670> double

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
and I get herb lore done before double

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.090

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
well and pretty much just range up the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.680 
well and pretty much just range up the
variety<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.460> I<00:03:05.580> do<00:03:05.640> over<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.060> weekend<00:03:06.480> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
variety if I do over the weekend and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.320 
variety if I do over the weekend and

just off get the best and make the most
of<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.570> guess<00:03:09.780> as<00:03:09.960> best<00:03:10.530> as<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.800> can<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.370> that's

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
of a guess as best as I can so that's

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.490 
of a guess as best as I can so that's
the<00:03:12.060> plan<00:03:12.300> for<00:03:12.510> me<00:03:12.630> let<00:03:13.170> me<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.320> what<00:03:13.380> you

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
a double XP weekend now you do so like I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.600 
a double XP weekend now you do so like I
said<00:03:19.290> we<00:03:19.410> do<00:03:19.530> about<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.800> month<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.190> half<00:03:20.220> so

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
said we do about a month and a half so

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.150 
said we do about a month and a half so
no<00:03:21.030> need<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.300> rush<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.959> will<00:03:22.380> start<00:03:22.920> to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
no need to rush but I will start to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.980 
no need to rush but I will start to
gather<00:03:23.670> up<00:03:23.940> my<00:03:24.090> supplies<00:03:24.420> fairly<00:03:24.780> soon

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
gather up my supplies fairly soon

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.540 
gather up my supplies fairly soon
because<00:03:25.260> by<00:03:25.470> limits<00:03:25.800> are<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.950> pain<00:03:26.160> in<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.340> bum

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
because by limits are a pain in the bum

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.400 
because by limits are a pain in the bum
so<00:03:27.120> he<00:03:27.270> I'll<00:03:27.390> get<00:03:27.570> those<00:03:27.720> gathered<00:03:28.110> up<00:03:28.200> and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
so he I'll get those gathered up and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.110 
so he I'll get those gathered up and
sort<00:03:28.980> out<00:03:29.160> pretty<00:03:29.400> soon<00:03:29.610> but<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.820> guess<00:03:30.000> you

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
sort out pretty soon but I guess you

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.640 
sort out pretty soon but I guess you
guys<00:03:30.270> will<00:03:30.390> see<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.690> throughout<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.320> month

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
guys will see that throughout the month

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.260 
guys will see that throughout the month
and<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.830> half<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.160> progress<00:03:32.459> videos<00:03:32.730> i'm<00:03:32.910> making

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
and a half of progress videos i'm making

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.630 
and a half of progress videos i'm making
so<00:03:33.959> i<00:03:34.290> think<00:03:34.650> that's<00:03:34.860> pretty<00:03:35.100> much<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.370> in

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
so i think that's pretty much it in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.640 
so i think that's pretty much it in
terms<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.240> double<00:03:36.930> XP<00:03:37.140> weekend<00:03:37.410> there's<00:03:37.560> not

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
terms of double XP weekend there's not

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.840 
terms of double XP weekend there's not
really<00:03:37.770> too<00:03:38.040> much<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.490> really<00:03:38.520> talk<00:03:38.790> about

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
really too much I can really talk about

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.330 
really too much I can really talk about
you<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.600> on<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:40.020> topic<00:03:40.260> however<00:03:41.070> there<00:03:41.250> is

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
you know on that topic however there is

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.860 
you know on that topic however there is
something<00:03:41.610> else<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.940> wanted<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.239> solve<00:03:42.540> just

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
something else I wanted to solve just

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.500 
something else I wanted to solve just
quickly<00:03:43.560> run<00:03:43.739> past<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.430> guys<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.180> had

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
quickly run past you guys so I had

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.600 
quickly run past you guys so I had
someone<00:03:45.720> asked<00:03:45.959> me<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.260> other<00:03:46.320> day<00:03:46.440> on<00:03:46.830> if<00:03:47.280> I'm

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
someone asked me the other day on if I'm

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.000 
someone asked me the other day on if I'm
able<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.180> upload<00:03:48.300> more<00:03:48.780> frequently<00:03:49.290> than<00:03:49.410> you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
able to upload more frequently than you

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.260 
able to upload more frequently than you
know<00:03:50.100> solve<00:03:50.310> every<00:03:50.580> three<00:03:50.850> days<00:03:50.970> which<00:03:51.180> I'm

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
know solve every three days which I'm

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.520 
know solve every three days which I'm
doing<00:03:51.420> at<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.660> moment<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.320> thought

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
doing at the moment and I thought

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.140 
doing at the moment and I thought
address<00:03:52.920> this<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.370> video<00:03:53.610> cuz<00:03:53.880> there<00:03:54.060> might

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
address this in a video cuz there might

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
address this in a video cuz there might
be<00:03:54.180> some<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.510> guys<00:03:54.630> out<00:03:54.780> there<00:03:54.840> who<00:03:55.140> are

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
be some of you guys out there who are

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.260 
be some of you guys out there who are
thinking<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.650> same<00:03:55.800> thing<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.640> thought<00:03:56.880> it

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
thinking the same thing and I thought it

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.060 
thinking the same thing and I thought it
would<00:03:57.390> be<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:58.080> know<00:03:58.200> make<00:03:58.410> more<00:03:58.560> sense<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:58.980> do

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
would be you know make more sense to do

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.010 
would be you know make more sense to do
it<00:03:59.130> in<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.310> video<00:03:59.430> than<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:00.239> it<00:04:00.390> in<00:04:00.600> just<00:04:00.930> a

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
it in a video than to do it in just a

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.470 
it in a video than to do it in just a
comment<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.410> case<00:04:01.530> people<00:04:01.770> miss<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.480> what

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
comment in case people miss it so what

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.790 
comment in case people miss it so what
I'm<00:04:03.570> thinking<00:04:03.600> about<00:04:03.900> doing<00:04:04.020> is<00:04:04.380> if<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.620> guys

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
I'm thinking about doing is if you guys

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.880 
I'm thinking about doing is if you guys
do<00:04:05.100> want<00:04:05.280> more<00:04:05.489> frequent<00:04:06.030> videos<00:04:06.620> I'm<00:04:07.620> going

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
do want more frequent videos I'm going

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.680 
do want more frequent videos I'm going
to<00:04:07.950> sort<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.370> cut<00:04:08.670> down<00:04:08.910> the<00:04:09.060> progress<00:04:09.270> videos

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
to sort of cut down the progress videos

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.870 
to sort of cut down the progress videos
not<00:04:10.200> in<00:04:10.350> length<00:04:10.620> just<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.220> literal

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
not in length just in literal

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.910 
not in length just in literal
progression<00:04:12.420> because<00:04:12.540> each<00:04:13.290> progression

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
progression because each progression

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.860 
progression because each progression
video<00:04:14.130> takes<00:04:14.760> around<00:04:14.970> four<00:04:15.300> days<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.690> make

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
video takes around four days to make

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.380 
video takes around four days to make
because<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:17.040> know<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.280> levels<00:04:17.609> like<00:04:18.239> the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
because you know the levels like the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.180 
because you know the levels like the
ones<00:04:18.540> I'm<00:04:18.720> going<00:04:18.959> for<00:04:19.230> a<00:04:19.260> quite<00:04:19.590> note<00:04:19.890> on<00:04:20.040> the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
ones I'm going for a quite note on the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.250 
ones I'm going for a quite note on the
high<00:04:20.370> end<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.910> they<00:04:21.419> take<00:04:21.630> longer<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.109> gauge

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
high end and they take longer to gauge

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.960 
high end and they take longer to gauge
level<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:22.830> I'm<00:04:23.100> not<00:04:23.340> going<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.520> upload<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.760> video

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
level so I'm not going to upload a video

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.800 
level so I'm not going to upload a video
if<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.270> has<00:04:24.360> hardly<00:04:24.720> any<00:04:24.780> progression<00:04:25.169> in<00:04:25.380> it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
if it has hardly any progression in it

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.629 
if it has hardly any progression in it
levels<00:04:26.200> were<00:04:26.320> easy<00:04:26.530> then<00:04:26.919> it<00:04:27.190> wouldn't<00:04:27.280> matter

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
levels were easy then it wouldn't matter

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.970 
levels were easy then it wouldn't matter
but<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.600> ones<00:04:28.780> I'm<00:04:28.990> going<00:04:29.230> for<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.860> know

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
but the ones I'm going for you know

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.129 
but the ones I'm going for you know
previously<00:04:30.580> have<00:04:31.240> taken<00:04:31.720> quite<00:04:31.870> a<00:04:31.930> long<00:04:32.110> time

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
previously have taken quite a long time

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.930 
previously have taken quite a long time
to<00:04:32.560> sort<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.770> get<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.070> amount<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.520> XP<00:04:33.850> in

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
to sort of get the amount of XP in

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.730 
to sort of get the amount of XP in
between<00:04:34.270> each<00:04:34.300> level<00:04:34.720> so<00:04:35.290> that's<00:04:35.500> why<00:04:35.680> it

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
between each level so that's why it

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.980 
between each level so that's why it
takes<00:04:35.980> so<00:04:36.070> long<00:04:36.280> but<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:37.270> plan<00:04:37.480> is<00:04:37.720> if<00:04:37.900> you

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
takes so long but the plan is if you

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.600 
takes so long but the plan is if you
guys<00:04:38.169> want<00:04:38.410> more<00:04:38.530> frequent<00:04:38.980> uploads<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.430> can

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
guys want more frequent uploads I can

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.460 
guys want more frequent uploads I can
sort<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:39.880> cut<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.210> progression<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:40.930> half<00:04:41.110> so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
sort of cut the progression in half so

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.700 
sort of cut the progression in half so
record<00:04:42.310> over<00:04:42.700> like<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> day<00:04:43.450> or<00:04:43.780> maybe<00:04:44.200> even<00:04:44.320> two

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
record over like a day or maybe even two

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.040 
record over like a day or maybe even two
probably<00:04:45.430> too<00:04:45.669> because<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.300> think<00:04:46.419> one<00:04:46.810> will<00:04:46.930> be

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
probably too because I think one will be

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.470 
probably too because I think one will be
pushing<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:47.530> for<00:04:47.770> content<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.310> that<00:04:49.090> if<00:04:49.330> I<00:04:49.450> a

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
pushing it for content and that if I a

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.390 
pushing it for content and that if I a
record<00:04:49.900> over<00:04:49.990> two<00:04:50.260> days<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.770> then<00:04:51.100> upload<00:04:51.280> it

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
record over two days and then upload it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.159 
record over two days and then upload it
and<00:04:51.669> then<00:04:51.970> just<00:04:52.180> keep<00:04:52.300> repeating<00:04:52.480> that<00:04:52.840> as

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
and then just keep repeating that as

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.170 
and then just keep repeating that as
opposed<00:04:53.770> you<00:04:54.010> know<00:04:54.130> waiting<00:04:54.730> for<00:04:54.970> days<00:04:55.150> or

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
opposed you know waiting for days or

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.180 
opposed you know waiting for days or
waiting<00:04:55.630> another<00:04:55.780> week<00:04:55.930> for<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.320> video<00:04:56.440> if<00:04:57.010> that

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
waiting another week for a video if that

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.070 
waiting another week for a video if that
makes<00:04:57.340> sense<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:57.940> just<00:04:58.450> cut<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.690> progression

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
makes sense so just cut the progression

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.080 
makes sense so just cut the progression
down<00:04:59.260> but<00:04:59.889> I'm<00:05:00.220> going<00:05:00.400> to<00:05:00.460> try<00:05:00.639> and<00:05:00.729> keep<00:05:00.940> the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
down but I'm going to try and keep the

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.090 
down but I'm going to try and keep the
same<00:05:01.240> video<00:05:01.510> length<00:05:01.720> around<00:05:02.110> 15<00:05:02.560> minutes<00:05:02.889> and

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
same video length around 15 minutes and

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.010 
same video length around 15 minutes and
you<00:05:03.970> know<00:05:04.090> just<00:05:04.120> all<00:05:04.419> wrong<00:05:04.570> with<00:05:04.720> that<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:04.900> know

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
you know just all wrong with that I know

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.930 
you know just all wrong with that I know
you<00:05:05.169> guys<00:05:05.290> like<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.620> longer<00:05:05.860> videos<00:05:06.100> so<00:05:06.610> I

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
you guys like the longer videos so I

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.430 
you guys like the longer videos so I
mean<00:05:07.240> a<00:05:07.300> jam<00:05:07.570> pack<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:07.960> as<00:05:08.050> much<00:05:08.229> as<00:05:08.260> possible

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
mean a jam pack it as much as possible

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.830 
mean a jam pack it as much as possible
when<00:05:08.919> work<00:05:09.520> on<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:09.850> videos<00:05:10.120> as<00:05:10.300> much<00:05:10.510> as<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.780> can

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
when work on the videos as much as I can

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.200 
when work on the videos as much as I can
bear<00:05:11.410> in<00:05:11.590> mind<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:12.130> does<00:05:12.340> take<00:05:12.669> quite<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.180> long

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
bear in mind it does take quite a long

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.879 
bear in mind it does take quite a long
time<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.720> make<00:05:13.810> each<00:05:14.020> video<00:05:14.320> so<00:05:14.560> don't<00:05:14.680> be

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
time to make each video so don't be

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.920 
time to make each video so don't be
expecting<00:05:15.160> like<00:05:15.669> miracles<00:05:16.330> or<00:05:16.510> amazing

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
expecting like miracles or amazing

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.810 
expecting like miracles or amazing
progress<00:05:17.169> in<00:05:17.500> each<00:05:17.590> one<00:05:17.830> because<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.520> does

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
progress in each one because it does

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.670 
progress in each one because it does
take<00:05:19.000> quite<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.240> long<00:05:19.270> time<00:05:19.389> so<00:05:19.870> you<00:05:20.560> know<00:05:20.590> I

take quite a long time so you know I
just<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:21.160> just<00:05:21.220> thought<00:05:21.550> I'd<00:05:21.639> put<00:05:22.030> it<00:05:22.060> in<00:05:22.210> a

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
just I just thought I'd put it in a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.060 
just I just thought I'd put it in a
video<00:05:22.389> and<00:05:22.690> sort<00:05:23.080> of<00:05:23.139> osh<00:05:23.320> you<00:05:23.560> guys<00:05:23.740> what<00:05:23.950> you

a new progress video or would you rather
see<00:05:34.210> one<00:05:34.390> every<00:05:34.690> two<00:05:34.870> days<00:05:35.050> but<00:05:35.410> even<00:05:35.860> if<00:05:35.950> it

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
see one every two days but even if it

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.950 
see one every two days but even if it
has<00:05:36.130> less<00:05:36.370> progress<00:05:36.700> in<00:05:36.880> it<00:05:37.000> so<00:05:37.180> let<00:05:37.810> me<00:05:37.900> know

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
has less progress in it so let me know

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.170 
has less progress in it so let me know
what<00:05:38.050> you<00:05:38.110> think<00:05:38.200> about<00:05:38.320> that<00:05:38.760> of<00:05:39.760> course<00:05:40.030> I<00:05:40.120> do

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
what you think about that of course I do

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.790 
what you think about that of course I do
have<00:05:40.419> the<00:05:40.539> QA<00:05:40.750> still<00:05:41.200> which<00:05:41.350> is<00:05:41.440> coming<00:05:41.680> out

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
have the QA still which is coming out

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.040 
have the QA still which is coming out
very<00:05:41.919> soon<00:05:42.039> I<00:05:42.520> need<00:05:43.120> to<00:05:43.210> record<00:05:43.479> that<00:05:43.630> tomorrow

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
very soon I need to record that tomorrow

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.810 
very soon I need to record that tomorrow
so<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.650> do<00:05:44.740> have<00:05:44.919> that<00:05:45.070> coming<00:05:45.310> out<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:45.550> almost

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
so I do have that coming out I almost
