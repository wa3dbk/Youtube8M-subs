00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.790
 they are going to serve we found they were from 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.620
 stroma tarragon and before moving on to the subject 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.320
 that we will deal with just installed thanks 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 to everyone for your support in the face of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.770
 capture everything is part of your velist 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 English of banking of málaga by the 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.029
 Tenders that subsequently 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.519
 we receive and nothing we just say that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.619
 let's continue working for everyone 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.650
 trying to drill ourselves from 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.910
 agreement we know precisely that it is a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.250
 training to improve the floor 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.260
 dead after changing herds and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 with a view of some competitions and about 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.899
 everything to the international routes that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.699
 will take place in madrid september 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.900
 we will visit the training to improve 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.330
 the basic movements 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.790
 and be able to give performance on the edge 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.620
 therefore we dealt with today is the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.690
 deadweight is a training 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.700
 simply to realize a day to the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.830
 week is to say if then we already 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.750
 we do another alternative training of 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.790
 back often two weeks 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.820
 It is always the first during 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.830
 next ten weeks of agreement we will do 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.660
 this training to detect improve 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.850
 the deadlift we will do a download 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.640
 of a week and we will try to the fullest 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.619
 quick the training is a little different 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 plane we have done so far but good 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.330
 until you have to also try some one 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.770
 rod some variation about what 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.390
 silent we always work so that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.369
 the body as we always say 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.979
 surprise and we can continue to progress 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.510
 no stalemate according here 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.220
 you have the training we will do with 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.900
 his series and his repetitions 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.050
 the first exercise that is a bit 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:43.740
 shocking the training 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.310
 and from behind when we think it's very 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.170
 important to sit down to face because 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.630
 the muscles that intervene in the weight 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:00.090
 dead there is a lot of transfer with the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:02.820
 that will therefore help us improve 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.560
 the dead weight to adopt a body of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.290
 strength in general and above all is very 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.270
 important because to our students 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.940
 they have that problem to keep the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.910
 straight back the front sentence both 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.920
 be in arms of another subsidiary or with the 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.610
 mother here forces that skirts 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.530
 always straight but also elbows 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.030
 therefore we add it because we believe 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.850
 that we will do well to maintain a good 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.250
 posture and to work muscles lack 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.950
 of weight after leaving the weight 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.750
 conventional dead properly 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.030
 with this number of repetitions above 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.700
 only 7 repetitions you have from a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.760
 work practically of rank of 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.800
 hypertrophy up a series of a 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.650
 repetition and in the carrying weight of the 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.239
 grain by the same 12 10 112 5 a 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.700
 series of three and one last one already very 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.770
 fatigued will not be a mass but will be a 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.900
 approximation depending on how we are 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.310
 resting then we will make a variant 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.060
 of the deadlift that is with the winning of 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.590
 torn out is to say the two hands looking 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.810
 by the palms with the palms towards 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.560
 down therefore if we improve a 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.950
 little grip and not charge both 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.950
 He says 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.709
 and then we'll look for two exercises to 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.930
 buy back density and 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.400
 very important many times that the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.400
 back then also 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.030
 for above the back to vote it 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.489
 in the strength attitude teacher of 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.769
 combat as possible as possible 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.680
 work the dorsal and also what 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.290
 We will work with 6 series of long 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.180
 practically direct agreement and 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.670
 finally we see nkunda and here 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.459
 we recommend once closed in the world 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.110
 is to catch a food a gardel ariza 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.510
 bar because we have already worked the 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.189
 directory of the previous 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.349
 then the remón next to vote to the 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.480
 central part of the voters of the 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.220
 column here we work a little more the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.159
 of wards off the portal 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.379
 since a little the internal part and four 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.900
 series of 5 repetitions this would be the 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.750
 I train base of the first day of 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.550
 frequency the frequency 2 that the first 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.260
 day of back training then 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.300
 and later on if it is that we will try 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.919
 that this will make us improve each one of us 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.750
 that of frequency 2 the second of 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.720
 training but that will consist more 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.010
 steps and a little bit more 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.780
 different more back because then 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.820
 We also see them launch 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.860
 squat training and banking and 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.710
 we will also add a little bit to another 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.630
 subsidiary being the advice of some good 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.440
 friend Felix and we will be telling you 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.440
 perfectly everything we are doing 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.949
 good
