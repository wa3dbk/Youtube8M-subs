00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
not going to be risotto so that's number

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.300 
not going to be risotto so that's number
one<00:01:14.900> tip<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.470> here<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:16.159> a<00:01:16.190> couple

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
one tip in here I have a couple

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.940 
one tip in here I have a couple
tablespoons<00:01:16.760> of<00:01:17.030> olive<00:01:17.210> oil<00:01:17.619> to<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:18.770> I'm

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
tablespoons of olive oil to that I'm

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.250 
tablespoons of olive oil to that I'm
going<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.130> add<00:01:19.250> in<00:01:19.369> my<00:01:19.520> onion<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.119> have<00:01:20.990> it<00:01:21.080> over

going to add in my onion I have it over
medium-high<00:01:21.770> heat<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.729> now<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.450> my<00:01:24.760> chicken

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
medium-high heat and now to my chicken

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.250 
medium-high heat and now to my chicken
stock<00:01:26.060> that's<00:01:26.240> been<00:01:26.299> simmering<00:01:26.720> back<00:01:26.990> there

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
stock that's been simmering back there

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.899 
stock that's been simmering back there
I'm<00:01:27.470> going<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:27.979> add<00:01:28.130> in<00:01:28.250> some<00:01:28.369> saffron<00:01:28.670> threads

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
I'm going to add in some saffron threads

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.030 
I'm going to add in some saffron threads
and<00:01:29.360> saffron<00:01:29.900> threads<00:01:29.960> are<00:01:30.380> actually<00:01:30.770> found

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
and saffron threads are actually found

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.609 
and saffron threads are actually found
in<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.700> crocus<00:01:32.060> flower<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.229> very

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
in the crocus flower so it is a very

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.179 
in the crocus flower so it is a very
expensive<00:01:34.040> spice<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:36.290> crucial<00:01:36.770> for

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
expensive spice but it is crucial for

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.890 
expensive spice but it is crucial for
this<00:01:37.369> result<00:01:37.729> too<00:01:37.850> otherwise<00:01:38.030> without<00:01:38.570> this

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
this result too otherwise without this

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.749 
this result too otherwise without this
you<00:01:39.560> basically<00:01:39.710> have<00:01:40.100> white<00:01:40.310> results<00:01:40.670> though

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
you basically have white results though

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.820 
you basically have white results though
you<00:01:41.030> don't<00:01:41.180> have<00:01:41.240> risotto<00:01:41.720> Milanese<00:01:41.840> this<00:01:42.500> is

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
you don't have risotto Milanese this is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.460 
you don't have risotto Milanese this is
what<00:01:43.250> gives<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.670> flavor<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:44.960> means<00:01:45.409> on

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
what gives it that flavor that means on

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.920 
what gives it that flavor that means on

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
pinch it out and put it into the warm

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.060 
pinch it out and put it into the warm
stock<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.450> that's<00:01:51.020> going<00:01:51.229> to<00:01:51.409> infuse<00:01:51.770> and
