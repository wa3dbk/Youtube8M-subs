00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:23.349 

let's<00:00:21.949> take<00:00:22.099> a<00:00:22.130> look<00:00:22.310> at<00:00:22.429> the<00:00:22.550> major<00:00:22.759> two<00:00:23.060> chord

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
let's take a look at the major two chord

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.060 
let's take a look at the major two chord
in<00:00:23.480> our<00:00:23.630> 12<00:00:23.929> keys<00:00:24.140> and<00:00:24.380> we<00:00:24.439> first<00:00:24.679> need<00:00:24.859> to<00:00:24.919> look

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
in our 12 keys and we first need to look

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.740 
in our 12 keys and we first need to look
at<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.310> formula<00:00:25.699> for<00:00:25.820> major<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:26.269> court<00:00:26.539> and

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
at the formula for major to court and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.529 
at the formula for major to court and
the<00:00:27.199> key<00:00:27.380> of<00:00:27.529> c-major<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:28.820> numerical<00:00:29.300> formula

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
the key of c-major the numerical formula

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.830 
the key of c-major the numerical formula
for<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:29.930> made<00:00:30.079> you<00:00:30.199> to<00:00:30.349> court<00:00:30.619> there's<00:00:30.859> a<00:00:30.949> one

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
for the made you to court there's a one

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.970 
for the made you to court there's a one
two<00:00:32.840> three<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:35.090> five<00:00:35.329> scale<00:00:35.719> tone<00:00:35.989> one<00:00:36.559> two

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
two three and a five scale tone one two

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.979 
two three and a five scale tone one two
three<00:00:37.339> five<00:00:37.640> that's<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.089> numeric<00:00:38.420> triangle<00:00:38.809> I

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
three five that's the numeric triangle I

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.960 
three five that's the numeric triangle I
made<00:00:39.620> you<00:00:39.769> two<00:00:39.949> quarters<00:00:40.339> no<00:00:40.519> more<00:00:40.760> than<00:00:40.940> a

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
made you two quarters no more than a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.119 
made you two quarters no more than a
major<00:00:41.239> triad<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.839> one<00:00:42.170> three<00:00:42.470> five<00:00:42.710> with<00:00:43.100> the

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
major triad a one three five with the

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.389 
major triad a one three five with the
added<00:00:43.550> second<00:00:43.909> with<00:00:44.030> justa<00:00:44.269> two<00:00:44.979> so<00:00:45.979> let's

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
added second with justa two so let's

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.219 
added second with justa two so let's
look<00:00:46.640> at<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:47.030> forcing<00:00:47.629> which<00:00:47.930> is<00:00:48.050> very

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
look at this forcing which is very

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.689 
look at this forcing which is very
popular<00:00:48.620> because<00:00:48.710> there's<00:00:49.100> one<00:00:49.250> more<00:00:49.280> we<00:00:49.550> need

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
popular because there's one more we need

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.329 
popular because there's one more we need
to<00:00:49.760> learn<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:50.149> all<00:00:50.329> twelve<00:00:50.600> keys<00:00:50.890> key<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.129> C

d flat 2 1 2 3 5 this chord voicing is
great<00:01:12.140> for<00:01:12.350> arpeggios<00:01:16.840> it<00:01:17.840> works<00:01:18.020> really

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
great for arpeggios it works really

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.499 
great for arpeggios it works really
great<00:01:18.560> as<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.740> song<00:01:19.040> ending<00:01:19.490> holding<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.240> pedal

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509

great as a song ending holding the pedal
down<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:24.080> that's<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.380> ending<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.890> we<00:01:25.009> hear

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
down and that's the ending that we hear

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.620 
down and that's the ending that we hear
classically<00:01:25.759> on<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.880> lot<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.149> song<00:01:26.330> but<00:01:26.540> that's
