00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
what's up YouTube I got a quick unboxing

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.020 
what's up YouTube I got a quick unboxing
for<00:00:02.669> you<00:00:02.790> today<00:00:02.970> of<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.830> LG<00:00:07.370> dvd/cd<00:00:08.370> writing

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
for you today of the LG dvd/cd writing

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.120 
for you today of the LG dvd/cd writing
drive<00:00:09.889> external<00:00:10.889> portable<00:00:12.769> but<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> idea

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
drive external portable but the idea

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.040 
drive external portable but the idea
this<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.350> obviously<00:00:16.350> made<00:00:16.560> by<00:00:16.740> LG<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.690> you<00:00:18.690> can

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
this is obviously made by LG and you can

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.830 
this is obviously made by LG and you can
get<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.320> Amazon<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.520> did<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.029> 30<00:00:21.570> bucks

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
get it on Amazon like I did for 30 bucks

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
get it on Amazon like I did for 30 bucks
so<00:00:22.560> I'm<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.740> too<00:00:22.890> bad<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.220> deal<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.580> is

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
so I'm not too bad of a deal this is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.560 
so I'm not too bad of a deal this is
gonna<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:24.439> hopefully<00:00:25.439> use<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.369> netbook<00:00:27.210> if

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
gonna be hopefully use on my netbook if

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.830 
gonna be hopefully use on my netbook if
it<00:00:27.750> works<00:00:27.960> less<00:00:28.349> when<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> order<00:00:29.250> did<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.429> work

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
it works less when I order did not work

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.420 
it works less when I order did not work
but<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.170> supposed<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> leave<00:00:31.740> compatible

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
but this is supposed to leave compatible

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670 
but this is supposed to leave compatible
with<00:00:32.610> Windows<00:00:33.329> 7<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.870> Mac<00:00:34.140> that's<00:00:34.440> what<00:00:34.620> I'm

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
with Windows 7 and Mac that's what I'm

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.450 
with Windows 7 and Mac that's what I'm
looking<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.050> um<00:00:37.050> off<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.070> bat<00:00:38.250> we've

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
looking for so um off the bat we've

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.910 
looking for so um off the bat we've
looks<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.440> trying<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> figure<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.800> exactly

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
looks like trying to figure out exactly

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.170 
looks like trying to figure out exactly
what<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.760> guess<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.090> 2<00:00:42.680> USB<00:00:44.180> standard

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
what this is I guess it's 2 USB standard

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.660 
what this is I guess it's 2 USB standard
USB<00:00:45.660> plugs<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> plug<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> computer<00:00:46.670> that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
USB plugs to plug into the computer that

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.720 
USB plugs to plug into the computer that
goes<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.329> one<00:00:48.710> mini<00:00:49.710> USB<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.550> plugs

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
goes down to one mini USB that plugs

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.619 
goes down to one mini USB that plugs
into<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> drive<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.899> will<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.199> is

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
into the drive so what this will do is

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.040 
into the drive so what this will do is
probably<00:00:54.629> bring<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> standard<00:00:55.739> 5<00:00:55.980> volts<00:00:57.050> I'm

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
probably bring the standard 5 volts I'm

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.689 
probably bring the standard 5 volts I'm
not<00:00:58.199> sure<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> needs<00:00:58.800> 10<00:00:59.039> volts<00:00:59.370> or<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
not sure if it needs 10 volts or if it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.529 
not sure if it needs 10 volts or if it
just<00:00:59.879> needs<00:01:00.090> more<00:01:00.390> amps<00:01:01.170> than<00:01:01.410> whatever<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
just needs more amps than whatever a

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.010 
just needs more amps than whatever a
standard<00:01:03.949> USB<00:01:04.949> Drive<00:01:05.610> earth<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.240> excuse<00:01:06.869> me

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
standard USB Drive earth I'm excuse me

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
standard USB Drive earth I'm excuse me
USB<00:01:07.439> port<00:01:07.770> provides<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.210> half<00:01:09.390> an

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
USB port provides I think it's a half an

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
USB port provides I think it's a half an
ampere<00:01:10.790> per<00:01:11.790> plug<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.510> would<00:01:12.689> give<00:01:13.729> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
ampere per plug so this would give the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.240 
ampere per plug so this would give the
drive<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> full<00:01:15.299> lamp<00:01:15.830> if<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
drive a full lamp if that's what it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.429 
drive a full lamp if that's what it
needs<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.450> looks<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:21.259> we<00:01:22.259> have

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
needs and then it looks like we have

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.580 
needs and then it looks like we have
some<00:01:22.790> instructions<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.479> an<00:01:25.140> installation

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
some instructions and an installation

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.149 
some instructions and an installation
disk<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.880> ironic<00:01:27.030> why<00:01:28.009> how<00:01:29.009> on

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
disk which is kind of ironic why how on

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.740 
disk which is kind of ironic why how on
earth<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.700> an<00:01:29.880> installation<00:01:30.509> disk

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
earth do you use an installation disk

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.679 
earth do you use an installation disk
for<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.610> disk<00:01:32.610> drive<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> most

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
for a disk drive is that not the most

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.940 
for a disk drive is that not the most
ridiculous<00:01:34.229> thing<00:01:34.380> you've<00:01:34.409> ever<00:01:34.560> heard<00:01:34.799> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
ridiculous thing you've ever heard of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.380 
ridiculous thing you've ever heard of
hopefully<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:35.520> need<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> installation

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hopefully we don't need the installation

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
hopefully we don't need the installation
disk<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:37.369> there's<00:01:38.369> no<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.729> doing

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
disk because there's no way of doing

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.319 
disk because there's no way of doing
that<00:01:39.119> without<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> disk<00:01:39.689> drive<00:01:40.159> um<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.299> looks

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
that without a disk drive um so it looks

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.120 
that without a disk drive um so it looks
like<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.689> got<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.009> front<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:45.049> slim

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
like we got on the front here just slim

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.179 
like we got on the front here just slim
portable<00:01:47.130> DVD<00:01:47.759> writer<00:01:48.360> I'm<00:01:49.350> hoping<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.070> is

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
portable DVD writer I'm hoping this is

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.100 
portable DVD writer I'm hoping this is
gonna<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> seen<00:01:50.880> heat<00:01:51.060> reader<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.930> said

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
gonna be a seen heat reader like it said

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.219 
gonna be a seen heat reader like it said
on<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> internet<00:01:53.479> let's<00:01:54.479> see<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.869> says<00:01:55.079> in

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
on the internet let's see if it says in

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.490 
on the internet let's see if it says in
the<00:01:55.320> back

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.270 

well<00:02:00.500> I'm<00:02:01.340> not<00:02:01.549> too<00:02:01.760> sure<00:02:01.970> about<00:02:02.150> that<00:02:02.299> I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
well I'm not too sure about that I

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.070 
well I'm not too sure about that I
believe<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:04.400> is<00:02:04.460> supposed<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:04.940> be<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.090> CD<00:02:05.420> CD

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
believe this is supposed to be a CD CD

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.040 
believe this is supposed to be a CD CD
Drive<00:02:06.470> I'll<00:02:06.650> be<00:02:06.799> returning<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.340> if<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.580> isn't

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
Drive I'll be returning it if it isn't

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.500 
Drive I'll be returning it if it isn't
that's<00:02:09.050> what<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.229> bought<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.530> for<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:10.360> guess<00:02:11.360> we

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
that's what I bought it for I guess we

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.150 
that's what I bought it for I guess we
have<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.690> have<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.930> plug<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.440> eject<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.890> but

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
have to have it plug in to eject it but

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.729 
have to have it plug in to eject it but
yeah<00:02:13.580> there's<00:02:13.850> some<00:02:14.170> information<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.590> the

back for you if you'd like to read that

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.260 
back for you if you'd like to read that
and<00:02:17.630> then<00:02:18.130> they're<00:02:19.130> on<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.370> bottom<00:02:19.580> excuse<00:02:20.150> me

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
and then they're on the bottom excuse me

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.449 
and then they're on the bottom excuse me
on<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.480> back<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> mini<00:02:21.709> USB<00:02:21.920> port

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
on the back we just have a mini USB port

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.000 
on the back we just have a mini USB port
which<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.209> believe<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.660> not<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.840> standard<00:02:24.380> mini

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
which I believe is not a standard mini

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.830 
which I believe is not a standard mini
USB<00:02:25.250> port<00:02:25.550> because<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.209> looks<00:02:26.420> like<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.720> either

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
USB port because it looks like it either

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.880 
USB port because it looks like it either
requires<00:02:27.430> ten<00:02:28.430> volts<00:02:28.819> between<00:02:29.000> those<00:02:29.330> two<00:02:29.890> USB

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
requires ten volts between those two USB

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.850 
requires ten volts between those two USB
cords<00:02:31.790> or<00:02:31.970> five<00:02:33.310> one<00:02:34.310> hand<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.450> I'm<00:02:36.170> not<00:02:36.470> not

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
cords or five one hand so I'm not not

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.440 
cords or five one hand so I'm not not
quite<00:02:36.980> sure<00:02:37.070> I'm<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.519> little<00:02:37.850> unfamiliar<00:02:38.300> I've

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
quite sure I'm a little unfamiliar I've

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.729 
quite sure I'm a little unfamiliar I've
never<00:02:38.600> seen<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.840> cord<00:02:39.110> like<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.440> before

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
never seen a cord like that before

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:40.810 
never seen a cord like that before
hopefully<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.160> don't<00:02:40.220> lose<00:02:40.430> it<00:02:40.489> because<00:02:40.760> I

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
hopefully I don't lose it because I

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.910 
hopefully I don't lose it because I
don't<00:02:40.940> know<00:02:41.000> where<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.150> would<00:02:41.330> get<00:02:41.390> another<00:02:41.920> but

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
don't know where I would get another but

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.770 
don't know where I would get another but
there<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.459> is<00:02:43.489> check<00:02:43.910> back<00:02:44.120> soon<00:02:44.150> for<00:02:44.450> the
