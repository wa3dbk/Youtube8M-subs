00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
between 2013 or say 2014 giving you're

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.749 
between 2013 or say 2014 giving you're
up<00:01:09.549> close<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.330> of<00:01:10.720> knowledge<00:01:11.170> that's<00:01:12.159> even<00:01:12.490> I

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
up close and of knowledge that's even I

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.160 
up close and of knowledge that's even I
think<00:01:13.270> I'll<00:01:13.360> definitely<00:01:13.479> there's<00:01:13.869> still<00:01:14.020> want

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
think I'll definitely there's still want

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.929 
think I'll definitely there's still want
to<00:01:14.229> talk<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.470> his<00:01:14.590> admission<00:01:14.830> against<00:01:15.729> have

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
to talk to his admission against have

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.609 
to talk to his admission against have
been<00:01:16.060> closer<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.420> this<00:01:16.659> year<00:01:16.869> but<00:01:17.020> i<00:01:17.049> think<00:01:17.259> the

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
been closer to this year but i think the

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.649 
been closer to this year but i think the
two<00:01:18.369> insensitive<00:01:18.820> later<00:01:19.000> this<00:01:19.119> year

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
two insensitive later this year

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.319 
two insensitive later this year
better<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:21.070> can't<00:01:21.280> relax<00:01:21.520> that<00:01:21.759> at<00:01:21.850> all<00:01:21.939> you

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
better so we can't relax that at all you

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.370 
better so we can't relax that at all you
know<00:01:22.479> we<00:01:22.600> still<00:01:22.719> gotta<00:01:22.899> cover<00:01:23.049> these<00:01:23.229> guys

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
know we still gotta cover these guys

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.050 
know we still gotta cover these guys
hundred<00:01:23.679> percent<00:01:23.979> because<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.700> still<00:01:24.880> really

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
hundred percent because it still really

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.599 
hundred percent because it still really
good<00:01:25.240> for<00:01:25.390> watching<00:01:25.719> and<00:01:26.079> I<00:01:26.340> obviously<00:01:27.340> I

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
good for watching and I obviously I

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.789 
good for watching and I obviously I
don't<00:01:28.450> think<00:01:28.600> they're<00:01:28.689> much<00:01:28.869> worse<00:01:29.259> than<00:01:29.500> they

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
don't think they're much worse than they

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:30.990 
don't think they're much worse than they
were<00:01:29.859> last<00:01:29.979> year<00:01:30.429> I<00:01:30.640> think<00:01:30.850> they're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
were last year I think they're

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.969 
were last year I think they're
struggling<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.450> team<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.840> just<00:01:31.960> made<00:01:32.770> some

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
struggling a team that just made some

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.039 
struggling a team that just made some
feeling<00:01:33.340> states<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.700> they<00:01:34.060> make<00:01:34.810> them<00:01:34.959> look

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
feeling states that they make them look

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.690 
feeling states that they make them look
like<00:01:35.109> we're<00:01:35.799> seeing<00:01:36.039> but<00:01:36.159> I'm<00:01:36.250> thinking<00:01:36.549> stuff

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
like we're seeing but I'm thinking stuff

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.569 
like we're seeing but I'm thinking stuff
