00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 there are some myths and stories 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.839
 counted by the human being who from so 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.980
 being repeated become a 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.990
 truth 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 is it true that we use 10% 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 of our brain but what it means 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 say that we only use 10% of our 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.550
 brain 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.550
 if I took it I'd take 90% of my brain 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.770
 still survive even because 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.719
 people know nowadays that small 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.149
 lesions in some specific areas of the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.180
 can have sequelae consequences 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 devastating diseases such as 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.090
 parkinson 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.550
 it reaches a specific area of ​​the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.020
 brain has a devastating consequence 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 and it affects affects much less than 90% of the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.280
 our brains and if the people who 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.170
 created a myth meant that one in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.359
 every ten neurons our brains are 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 used 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.830
 Unfortunately, I still did not do much 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.380
 sense because even in that neuron 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 not being used directly 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 it still makes connections with other 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.619
 neurons and this is necessary to 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.729
 pass information to the brain with 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.740
 synapses 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.860
 even if a neuron is not being 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.290
 used directly it will still be 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.630
 such as the synapses that the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
 transport of information through the brain 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.340
 from the point of view of the evolution 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.509
 what would be the function of having a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.689
 big brain 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.009
 if this did not bring any advantage 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.530
 there are some parts of our brain 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.670
 that although they are different, they 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.939
 same function 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.310
 for example the vision but this occurs 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.420
 because in the event of an accident in a 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.759
 of these parts 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.860
 the other can work and make the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.840
 people keep coming 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.180
 besides, we can make a 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.640
 MRI is an image 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.490
 real time of our brain and find out 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.860
 using the science we use 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.740
 100% of our brain until when 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.140
 Sundays to kill this myth once 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.140
 it is enough to recognize that the concept of use 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.210
 or lose applies 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.500
 very well to the nervous system during 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.900
 our development 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.590
 several synapses are created and they can 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.209
 well be destroyed in the future by 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.080
 example let's suppose you forget the key 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.220
 from my car 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.010
 there goes a synapse or several 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.510
 this myth was created by natural persons 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.690
 people who say they have powers 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.750
 supernatural if we used 100% 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.220
 our brain could move objects to the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.530
 distance 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.350
 Look, I can guarantee that you and I, 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.270
 we are using 100% our brain and 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.540
 I can not turn off the machine with just 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.390
 thought the next time they say 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.640
 that you only use 10% of your brain 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.100
 Do you know how to refute this argument? 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.930
 but I ask you a question 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.850
 you would prove to someone who believes 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.570
 that we only use 10% of our brain 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.400
 that we use it in full 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.989
 here in the video comments is 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.000
 Brigadier watching this video this 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.200
 was the channel back on the sixth day there was a 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.910
 time without recording 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.170
 so thank you so much if you like it 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.299
 please click i liked it 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.530
 subscribe to the channel and watch the 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.549
 recent videos that I think you will 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.290
 like it a lot 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.290
 Thank you very much and see you next time.
