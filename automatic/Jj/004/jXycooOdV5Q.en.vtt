contouring I just wouldn't I prefer
stiffer<00:01:02.100> brush<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.760> blend<00:01:02.910> better<00:01:03.210> um

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
stiffer brush so I can blend better um

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.770 
stiffer brush so I can blend better um
also<00:01:04.880> for<00:01:05.880> highlight<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.360> could<00:01:06.510> use<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.750> for

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
also for highlight you could use it for

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.630 
also for highlight you could use it for
highlight<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.530> could<00:01:07.740> use<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.100> blush<00:01:08.460> if

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
highlight you could use it for blush if

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.120 
highlight you could use it for blush if
you<00:01:08.700> wanted<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.170> it's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you wanted to but it's not really it's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.700 
you wanted to but it's not really it's
kind<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> large<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:12.000> blush<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.750> taste<00:01:13.350> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
kind of large for blush in my taste I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.429 
kind of large for blush in my taste I
usually<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.970> standard<00:01:15.450> sized<00:01:15.930> blush

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
usually use a more standard sized blush

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.109 
usually use a more standard sized blush
brush<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.729> use<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.060> powder<00:01:18.860> so

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
brush so you can use it for powder so

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.020 
brush so you can use it for powder so
but<00:01:21.119> again<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.720> other<00:01:21.900> brushes<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.799> have

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
but again I have other brushes I have

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.609 
but again I have other brushes I have
several<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> actual<00:01:24.900> powder<00:01:25.259> brushes

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
several of the actual powder brushes

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
several of the actual powder brushes
from<00:01:25.979> Hakata<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> usually<00:01:27.390> reach<00:01:27.689> for<00:01:27.900> those

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
from Hakata so I usually reach for those

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.280 
from Hakata so I usually reach for those
more<00:01:28.290> than<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.650> one

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
more than this one

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.620 
more than this one
so<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.799> general<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.479> won't

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so in general you know if you won't

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.780 
so in general you know if you won't
wanted<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.229> brush<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> face<00:01:35.579> brush

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
wanted one brush that was a face brush

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.460

from<00:01:36.060> Haku<00:01:36.329> Cotto<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.439> as

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
from Haku Cotto I would see this one as

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.550 
from Haku Cotto I would see this one as
being<00:01:37.829> quite<00:01:38.189> versatile<00:01:38.700> however<00:01:39.509> it's<00:01:40.439> just

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
being quite versatile however it's just

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.069 
being quite versatile however it's just
not<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:41.100> favorite<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.700> guess<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.659> two<00:01:42.960> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
not my favorite I guess I have two of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.330 
not my favorite I guess I have two of
the<00:01:43.170> blue<00:01:43.350> squirrel<00:01:43.649> hair<00:01:43.799> ones<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.250> they're

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
the blue squirrel hair ones and they're

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
the blue squirrel hair ones and they're
just<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.880> soft<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.720> don't<00:01:45.899> compare

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
just so soft like they don't compare

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.830 
just so soft like they don't compare
really<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.340> goat<00:01:47.850> hair<00:01:48.090> ones<00:01:48.390> although

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
really to the goat hair ones although

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.020 
really to the goat hair ones although
