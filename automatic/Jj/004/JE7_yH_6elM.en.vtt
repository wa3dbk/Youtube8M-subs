00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
about a foot or so away from our gun if

about a foot or so away from our gun if
we<00:01:33.750> carried<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> belt<00:01:34.649> line<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.159> our

we carried it the belt line on our

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.109 
we carried it the belt line on our
strong<00:01:35.940> side<00:01:36.619> since<00:01:37.619> less<00:01:38.009> travel<00:01:38.670> distance

equates<00:01:39.539> to<00:01:39.659> greater<00:01:40.020> speed<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.700> all

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
equates to greater speed I think we all

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.779 
equates to greater speed I think we all
can<00:01:42.060> agree<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:43.049> strong<00:01:43.500> side<00:01:43.859> belt<00:01:44.219> carry<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
can agree that strong side belt carry is

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.389 
can agree that strong side belt carry is
the<00:01:44.820> primary<00:01:45.450> location<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.829> carrying<00:01:47.250> our

the rear the hand will still travel

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.880 
the rear the hand will still travel
along<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.700> consistent<00:02:35.330> path<00:02:35.540> if<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.440> happens<00:02:36.830> to

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
along a consistent path if it happens to

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.130 
along a consistent path if it happens to
be<00:02:37.010> up<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.280> here<00:02:37.340> because<00:02:37.670> I'm<00:02:37.970> startled<00:02:38.540> elbow

in<00:02:42.350> a<00:02:42.410> consistent<00:02:42.800> path<00:02:44.050> now<00:02:45.050> we<00:02:46.040> get<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.460> the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
in a consistent path now we get to the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.340 
in a consistent path now we get to the
gun<00:02:46.820> how<00:02:47.150> do<00:02:47.210> we<00:02:47.420> get<00:02:47.600> our<00:02:47.720> hand<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.140> wrap

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
gun how do we get our hand to wrap

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.870 
gun how do we get our hand to wrap
around<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.800> grip<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.220> same<00:02:49.430> way<00:02:49.550> each<00:02:49.700> and

around that grip the same way each and
every<00:02:50.060> time<00:02:50.330> well<00:02:51.020> if<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.320> look<00:02:51.560> at<00:02:51.680> the

the juncture of where the trigger guard
and<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.970> grip<00:02:59.239> meet<00:02:59.540> if<00:03:00.200> we<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.860> get<00:03:01.070> our<00:03:01.220> hand

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
and the grip meet if we can get our hand

into that location right there we can

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.940 
into that location right there we can
wrap<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:04.970> around<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.840> it<00:03:06.140> will<00:03:06.170> be<00:03:06.260> consistent

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
wrap it around and it will be consistent

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.699 
wrap it around and it will be consistent
each<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.370> every<00:03:07.610> time<00:03:08.290> doesn't<00:03:09.290> matter<00:03:09.470> if<00:03:09.650> my

if I can get into that juncture right

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.300 
if I can get into that juncture right
there<00:03:17.239> my<00:03:17.870> hand<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.410> going<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.650> be<00:03:18.830> on<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.100> gun

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
there my hand is going to be on the gun

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.180 
there my hand is going to be on the gun
up<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:20.030> around<00:03:20.300> so<00:03:20.690> once<00:03:21.320> I<00:03:21.470> draw<00:03:21.770> it<00:03:21.920> up<00:03:22.010> and

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
up and around so once I draw it up and

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.550 
up and around so once I draw it up and
out<00:03:22.340> I've<00:03:22.580> got<00:03:22.880> two<00:03:23.090> things<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.480> can<00:03:23.510> do<00:03:23.930> I<00:03:24.200> can

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
out I've got two things I can do I can

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.590 
out I've got two things I can do I can
either<00:03:24.830> turn<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.340> gun<00:03:25.700> towards<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.330> target

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
either turn the gun towards the target

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.710 
either turn the gun towards the target
and<00:03:26.930> push<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.800> straight<00:03:28.160> out<00:03:28.190> or<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.180> can<00:03:29.390> draw

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
and push it straight out or I can draw

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.110 
and push it straight out or I can draw
the<00:03:29.780> gun<00:03:30.080> up<00:03:30.260> rotate<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.190> elbow<00:03:31.310> down<00:03:31.790> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
the gun up rotate the elbow down and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.470 
the gun up rotate the elbow down and
push<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.780> gun<00:03:33.110> straight<00:03:33.410> out

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
push the gun straight out

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.180 
push the gun straight out
okay<00:03:35.170> what<00:03:35.319> we're<00:03:35.410> going<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.590> do<00:03:35.709> now<00:03:35.860> is<00:03:36.069> we're

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
okay what we're going to do now is we're

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.920 
okay what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.340> do<00:03:36.489> a<00:03:36.520> couple<00:03:36.849> of<00:03:36.910> live<00:03:37.120> draws<00:03:37.540> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
going to do a couple of live draws and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.850 
going to do a couple of live draws and
I'm<00:03:38.349> going<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.590> show<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:38.830> that<00:03:39.780> herky-jerky

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
I'm going to show you that herky-jerky

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.589 
I'm going to show you that herky-jerky
spastic<00:03:41.860> motion<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.459> not<00:03:42.760> what<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.180> want<00:03:43.450> to

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
spastic motion is not what you want to

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.229 
spastic motion is not what you want to
acquire<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.080> fast<00:03:44.470> draw<00:03:44.800> let's<00:03:45.730> do<00:03:45.940> just<00:03:46.090> a

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
acquire a fast draw let's do just a

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.240 
acquire a fast draw let's do just a
couple<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.599> nice<00:03:46.840> easy<00:03:47.260> draw<00:03:47.620> strokes<00:03:48.040> and

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
couple of nice easy draw strokes and

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.059 
couple of nice easy draw strokes and
let's<00:03:48.730> see<00:03:48.910> how<00:03:49.030> fast<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.629> be<00:03:49.780> done<00:03:50.069> start

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
let's see how fast it can be done start

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.170 
let's see how fast it can be done start
with<00:03:51.160> our<00:03:51.280> hands<00:03:51.459> down<00:03:56.370> okay<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.819> was<00:03:58.000> one

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
with our hands down okay that was one

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.759 
with our hands down okay that was one
point<00:03:58.420> two<00:03:58.690> seconds<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.380> was<00:03:59.530> from<00:03:59.680> my

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
point two seconds and that was from my

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.039 
point two seconds and that was from my
hands<00:04:00.040> down<00:04:00.340> now<00:04:00.970> let's<00:04:01.180> try<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.510> for<00:04:01.720> my<00:04:01.840> hands

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
hands down now let's try it for my hands

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.500 
hands down now let's try it for my hands
in<00:04:02.230> front<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.590> like<00:04:02.709> a<00:04:02.769> common<00:04:03.220> position

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.320 

okay<00:04:07.510> 1:17<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:09.280> difference<00:04:09.700> was<00:04:09.880> only

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
okay 1:17 so the difference was only

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.080 
okay 1:17 so the difference was only
measurable<00:04:10.900> by<00:04:11.019> an<00:04:11.170> electronic<00:04:11.739> timer<00:04:12.090> now

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
measurable by an electronic timer now

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.000 
measurable by an electronic timer now
let's<00:04:13.299> do<00:04:13.480> it<00:04:13.510> from<00:04:13.810> say<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.019> startled<00:04:14.560> position

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
let's do it from say a startled position

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.349 
let's do it from say a startled position
like<00:04:15.190> suddenly<00:04:15.579> we<00:04:15.730> were<00:04:15.880> startled<00:04:16.329> by

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
like suddenly we were startled by

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.960 
like suddenly we were startled by
something<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.810> happened<00:04:17.079> in<00:04:17.290> front<00:04:17.350> of<00:04:17.620> us

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
something that happened in front of us

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.900 
something that happened in front of us
and<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:20.320> was<00:04:20.530> 115<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.430> was<00:04:21.549> actually<00:04:21.850> a

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
and that was 115 so it was actually a

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.390 
and that was 115 so it was actually a
little<00:04:22.090> bit<00:04:22.240> faster<00:04:22.930> but<00:04:23.470> as<00:04:23.620> you<00:04:23.740> can<00:04:23.889> see<00:04:24.100> the
