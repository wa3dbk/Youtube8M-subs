00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
hello there it's the evil geocache here

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.950 
hello there it's the evil geocache here
again<00:00:04.580> doing<00:00:05.580> some<00:00:05.730> geocaching<00:00:06.420> today<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.899> I

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
again doing some geocaching today and I

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.589 
again doing some geocaching today and I
came<00:00:07.140> across<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:07.710> one<00:00:07.919> I'm<00:00:08.099> actually<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.670> was

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
came across this one I'm actually I was

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.509 
came across this one I'm actually I was
out<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.780> town<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.500> while<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.710> was<00:00:10.920> traveling<00:00:11.130> I

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
out of town and while I was traveling I

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.499 
out of town and while I was traveling I
thought<00:00:11.730> well<00:00:11.849> let's<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:12.120> some<00:00:12.300> geocaching

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
thought well let's do some geocaching

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.950 
thought well let's do some geocaching
and<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.790> found<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.330> brings<00:00:15.509> me<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.780> a

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
and I found this one that brings me to a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.550 
and I found this one that brings me to a
train<00:00:16.410> caboose<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.420> don't<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.539> if<00:00:19.350> you've

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
train caboose I don't know if you've

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.700 
train caboose I don't know if you've
ever<00:00:19.680> tried<00:00:20.070> any<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.369> these<00:00:21.090> train<00:00:21.750> geocaches

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
ever tried any of these train geocaches

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.470 
ever tried any of these train geocaches
in<00:00:22.859> our<00:00:22.980> area<00:00:23.340> there<00:00:23.519> tends<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> be<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> lot<00:00:24.420> of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
in our area there tends to be a lot of

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.359 
in our area there tends to be a lot of
them<00:00:25.010> even<00:00:26.010> though<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.730> listed<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
them even though this is listed as a

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.959 
them even though this is listed as a
fairly<00:00:29.369> moderate<00:00:29.939> difficulty<00:00:30.869> setting<00:00:31.610> it<00:00:32.610> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
fairly moderate difficulty setting it is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.799 
fairly moderate difficulty setting it is
almost<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:34.040> impossible<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.480> find<00:00:36.480> these

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
almost just impossible to find these

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.160 
almost just impossible to find these
things<00:00:37.230> because<00:00:37.640> there<00:00:38.640> are<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:40.579> many

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
things because there are so many

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.069 
things because there are so many
possible<00:00:43.170> almost<00:00:43.649> endless<00:00:44.250> locations<00:00:45.079> where

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
possible almost endless locations where

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.110 
possible almost endless locations where
these<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.710> geocaches<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.820> hit<00:00:48.090> on

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
these little geocaches can be hit on

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.869 
these little geocaches can be hit on
these<00:00:48.480> trains<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.260> mean<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> little

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
these trains I mean you have a little

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.779 
these trains I mean you have a little
nano<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.500> bison<00:00:52.890> tube<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> magnet

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
nano a little bison tube with a magnet

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.270 
nano a little bison tube with a magnet
on<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.170> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.949> anywhere

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
on it you can just put that anywhere

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420 
on it you can just put that anywhere
underneath<00:00:57.030> these<00:00:57.149> trains<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:59.100> I've<00:00:59.250> already

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
underneath these trains and I've already

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.729 
underneath these trains and I've already
been<00:00:59.640> looking<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.149> quite<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> while<00:01:00.600> we've<00:01:01.559> got

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
been looking for quite a while we've got

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.820 
been looking for quite a while we've got
some<00:01:01.949> old<00:01:02.390> duct<00:01:03.390> tape<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:03.989> maybe<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.619> was

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
some old duct tape here maybe that was

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.300 
some old duct tape here maybe that was
connected<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:05.790> some<00:01:06.030> point<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.420> time

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
connected with it at some point in time

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
connected with it at some point in time
you've<00:01:08.310> got<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.670> these<00:01:08.880> little<00:01:09.240> hidden<00:01:10.049> areas

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you've got all these little hidden areas

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.240 
you've got all these little hidden areas
up<00:01:10.770> underneath<00:01:11.040> where<00:01:12.260> geocaches<00:01:13.260> could<00:01:14.070> be

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
up underneath where geocaches could be

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.749 
up underneath where geocaches could be
located<00:01:15.740> tons<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.070> doors<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
located tons of little doors and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.740 
located tons of little doors and
compartments<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.950> that<00:01:19.950> open<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:21.030> where

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
compartments that that open and where

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
compartments that that open and where
things<00:01:22.020> could<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.229> inside<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:24.030> just

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
things could be inside there it's just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.210 
things could be inside there it's just
unlimited<00:01:25.080> pipes<00:01:25.920> &amp;<00:01:26.250> tubing<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.909> hoses<00:01:28.220> and

unlimited pipes &amp; tubing and hoses and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.340 
unlimited pipes &amp; tubing and hoses and
it's<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> little<00:01:30.000> bit<00:01:30.119> warm<00:01:30.329> outside<00:01:30.540> today<00:01:30.810> and

I've<00:01:31.439> already<00:01:31.650> been<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.220> 10

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I've already been out here about 10

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.609 
I've already been out here about 10
minutes<00:01:32.880> looking<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.659> geocache<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
minutes looking for this geocache so I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.190 
minutes looking for this geocache so I
thought<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.220> what<00:01:35.720> I'm<00:01:36.720> probably<00:01:37.049> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
thought you know what I'm probably just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.319 
thought you know what I'm probably just
going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> go<00:01:37.590> ahead<00:01:38.329> log<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.630> dnf<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:41.329> just

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
going to go ahead log the dnf and just

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.020 
going to go ahead log the dnf and just
bite<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.840> move<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.250> because<00:01:44.250> I'm<00:01:44.670> tired<00:01:44.939> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
bite it and move on because I'm tired of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.160 
bite it and move on because I'm tired of
looking<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.600> thing<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.840> maybe<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170

a comment about some of your worst did

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.440 
a comment about some of your worst did
not<00:01:55.619> fines<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.610> problems<00:01:57.240> you've<00:01:57.420> had

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
not fines and problems you've had

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.560 
not fines and problems you've had
locating<00:01:58.320> geocaches<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.360> this<00:02:00.360> type<00:02:00.540> of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
locating geocaches is this type of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.359 
locating geocaches is this type of
geocache<00:02:01.140> too<00:02:01.619> hard<00:02:03.409> since<00:02:04.409> there<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.799> about<00:02:05.070> 2

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
geocache too hard since there is about 2

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.920 
geocache too hard since there is about 2
million<00:02:05.700> different<00:02:06.210> ways<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.719> could

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
million different ways that you could

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.450 
million different ways that you could
hide<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.320> geocache

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
hide this geocache

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.120 
hide this geocache
I<00:02:08.520> guess<00:02:09.210> if<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.420> wore<00:02:09.630> my<00:02:09.750> coveralls<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.620> was

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
I guess if I wore my coveralls and was

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.800 
I guess if I wore my coveralls and was
willing<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.490> spend<00:02:11.760> about<00:02:12.000> three<00:02:12.300> hours<00:02:12.480> out

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
willing to spend about three hours out

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.540 
willing to spend about three hours out
here<00:02:12.870> climbing<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:13.650> underneath<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.130> train

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
here climbing up underneath this train

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.820 
here climbing up underneath this train
and<00:02:14.880> getting<00:02:15.570> greasy<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.140> nasty<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.590> dirty
