okay<00:00:01.319> so<00:00:01.380> here's<00:00:01.620> what<00:00:01.800> we<00:00:01.890> got<00:00:03.049> in<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.170> MS<00:00:04.470> o

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
okay so here's what we got in the MS o

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.490 
okay so here's what we got in the MS o
map<00:00:04.980> we<00:00:05.759> got<00:00:05.940> all<00:00:06.150> zeros<00:00:06.629> and<00:00:06.930> all<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.230> fuel

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720 
maps upper/lower IEP and TPS we've got
all<00:00:12.570> zeros<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.500> timing<00:00:14.219> maps<00:00:14.400> all

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
all zeros in the timing maps all

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
cylinders the MSO is the default map see

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.880 
cylinders the MSO is the default map see
we<00:00:19.650> got<00:00:19.800> nothing<00:00:20.130> plugged<00:00:20.369> into<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> kts<00:00:21.150> plug

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
we got nothing plugged into the kts plug

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.060 
we got nothing plugged into the kts plug
the<00:00:22.890> MS<00:00:23.310> 1<00:00:23.580> map<00:00:23.820> should<00:00:24.630> switch<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.410> when

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the MS 1 map should switch to it when

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.380 
the MS 1 map should switch to it when
you<00:00:26.189> put<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> jumper<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.260> its<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.470> stock<00:00:29.390> so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
you put the jumper in its all stock so

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.840 
you put the jumper in its all stock so
the<00:00:31.140> bike<00:00:31.320> will<00:00:31.529> not<00:00:31.650> start<00:00:31.980> watch<00:00:32.850> this

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.220 

hey<00:00:40.850> let's<00:00:41.450> see<00:00:41.540> myself<00:00:41.900> won't<00:00:42.500> start<00:00:43.060> okay

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
hey let's see myself won't start okay

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.590 
hey let's see myself won't start okay
that's<00:00:45.230> what<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:45.560> would<00:00:45.680> think<00:00:45.710> it<00:00:46.010> would<00:00:46.130> do

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
that's what we would think it would do

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.479 
that's what we would think it would do
now<00:00:47.600> if<00:00:47.750> we<00:00:47.810> put<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.080> jumper<00:00:48.560> in<00:00:48.739> guess<00:00:49.430> what

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
now if we put the jumper in guess what

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.910 
now if we put the jumper in guess what
it<00:00:52.489> still<00:00:52.879> won't<00:00:53.090> start<00:00:53.650> because<00:00:54.650> it's<00:00:54.830> not

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
it still won't start because it's not

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.520 
it still won't start because it's not
switching<00:00:55.430> to<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.820> MS<00:00:56.120> 1<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.570> I<00:00:56.600> know<00:00:56.660> why<00:00:59.530> and

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
switching to the MS 1 and I know why and

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.500 
switching to the MS 1 and I know why and
the<00:01:00.620> reason<00:01:00.650> it's<00:01:01.070> not<00:01:01.250> good<00:01:01.580> to<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.000> MS<00:01:02.239> one

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
the reason it's not good to the MS one

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.280 
the reason it's not good to the MS one
is<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:03.590> will<00:01:03.739> not<00:01:03.920> switch<00:01:04.309> on<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:04.879> fly<00:01:05.290> you've

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
is it will not switch on the fly you've

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.639 
is it will not switch on the fly you've
gotta<00:01:06.500> turn<00:01:06.740> off<00:01:06.950> key<00:01:08.229> wait<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.259> few<00:01:09.470> minutes

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
gotta turn off key wait a few minutes

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.270 
gotta turn off key wait a few minutes
well<00:01:10.280> not<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:10.550> few<00:01:10.700> minutes<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:10.940> few<00:01:10.970> seconds<00:01:11.509> and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
well not a few minutes a few seconds and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.770 
well not a few minutes a few seconds and
then<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.550> turn<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.850> key<00:01:14.000> back<00:01:14.149> on<00:01:16.780> now

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
then you turn the key back on now

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.050 
then you turn the key back on now
running<00:01:18.110> on<00:01:18.259> ms<00:01:18.619> one

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.210 

you<00:01:24.149> can<00:01:24.299> even<00:01:24.390> pull<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> jumper<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you can even pull the jumper out the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.770 
you can even pull the jumper out the
bike<00:01:26.430> will<00:01:26.640> continue<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> run<00:01:27.500> on<00:01:28.500> ms<00:01:28.920> one

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.370 

till<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.470> bank<00:01:33.619> is<00:01:33.799> shut<00:01:34.010> off<00:01:35.140> once<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:36.229> shut

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
till the bank is shut off once you shut

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.870 
till the bank is shut off once you shut
the<00:01:36.530> bike<00:01:36.680> off<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.460> wait<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.640> few<00:01:37.850> seconds

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
the bike off and you wait a few seconds

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.609 
the bike off and you wait a few seconds
the<00:01:40.880> bike<00:01:41.090> will<00:01:41.270> not<00:01:41.390> start<00:01:41.690> because<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.500> now

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
the bike will not start because it's now

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.710 
the bike will not start because it's now
going<00:01:42.799> to<00:01:42.890> default<00:01:43.100> back<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.520> MSO<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.890> start

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
going to default back the MSO that start

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.499 
going to default back the MSO that start
now<00:01:47.720> we<00:01:47.810> leave<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.140> key<00:01:48.320> on<00:01:49.060> plug<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.180> jumper

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
now we leave the key on plug the jumper

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.380 
now we leave the key on plug the jumper
in<00:01:53.950> bike<00:01:54.950> still<00:01:55.340> will<00:01:55.520> not<00:01:55.610> start<00:01:56.000> because

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
in bike still will not start because

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.749 
in bike still will not start because
math<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:56.990> not<00:01:57.170> defaulted<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.920> ms<00:01:58.250> one<00:01:58.460> because

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
math is not defaulted to ms one because

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.669 
math is not defaulted to ms one because
we<00:01:58.909> haven't<00:01:59.210> cycled<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.659> key<00:02:02.649> cycle<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.740> key

we haven't cycled the key cycle the key

will<00:02:12.860> start<00:02:13.100> right<00:02:13.280> up<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.810> ms<00:02:17.810> OMS<00:02:18.380> one<00:02:18.709> does

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
will start right up so ms OMS one does

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.030

not switch on the fly
you<00:02:22.430> have<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.790> recycle<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.599> guess<00:02:23.989> they

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
you have to recycle it I guess they

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.559 
you have to recycle it I guess they
assume<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.209> people<00:02:27.049> wouldn't<00:02:27.290> be<00:02:27.409> doing<00:02:27.680> it

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
assume that people wouldn't be doing it

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.239 
assume that people wouldn't be doing it
like<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.230> say<00:02:30.349> even<00:02:30.560> if<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.709> pull<00:02:30.859> the<00:02:30.980> jumper

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:31.249 
like I say even if you pull the jumper

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:35.100 
like I say even if you pull the jumper
out<00:02:31.370> while<00:02:31.609> it's<00:02:31.760> running<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:33.319> will<00:02:33.530> remain

out while it's running it will remain

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.450 
out while it's running it will remain
nms<00:02:35.860> one

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
nms one

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
remaining in this one you shut the bike

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.540 
remaining in this one you shut the bike
off

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.050 

you<00:02:45.850> can<00:02:46.000> turn<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.180> kill<00:02:46.870> switch<00:02:47.170> off<00:02:47.940> turn<00:02:48.940> and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
you can turn it kill switch off turn and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.910 
you can turn it kill switch off turn and

kill switch back on Mike fires right up

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.650 
kill switch back on Mike fires right up
only<00:02:53.920> when<00:02:54.070> you<00:02:54.160> cut<00:02:54.340> off<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> key<00:02:54.850> and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
only when you cut off the key and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.030 
only when you cut off the key and
recycle<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:57.220> goes<00:02:57.400> back<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.640> ms<00:02:58.180> oh<00:02:58.530> now<00:02:59.530> it

bike will start up so the map switching
from<00:03:28.090> ms<00:03:28.450> ODMs<00:03:29.020> one<00:03:29.230> when<00:03:29.500> we<00:03:29.530> install<00:03:29.740> that

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
from ms ODMs one when we install that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.760 
from ms ODMs one when we install that
jumper<00:03:31.050> it's<00:03:32.050> not<00:03:32.260> switching<00:03:32.920> on<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.400> fly<00:03:34.770> got

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
to cycle the power from the key not sure

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.590 
to cycle the power from the key not sure
how<00:03:42.190> that's<00:03:42.370> going<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.640> do<00:03:42.790> me<00:03:42.820> flying<00:03:43.510> down

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
how that's going to do me flying down

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.140 
how that's going to do me flying down
the<00:03:43.810> freeway<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.490> wanting<00:03:45.490> to<00:03:45.550> switch<00:03:45.820> from<00:03:46.000> a

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
the freeway and wanting to switch from a

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.960 
the freeway and wanting to switch from a
stock<00:03:46.390> map<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.020> nitrous<00:03:47.470> map<00:03:47.710> I<00:03:48.040> have<00:03:48.850> to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
stock map to a nitrous map I have to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.290 
stock map to a nitrous map I have to
stop<00:03:50.130> turn<00:03:51.130> off<00:03:51.280> key<00:03:51.489> turn<00:03:51.730> key<00:03:51.940> back<00:03:52.090> on

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
stop turn off key turn key back on

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.840 
stop turn off key turn key back on
that's<00:03:52.989> how<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.230> would<00:03:53.530> have<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.770> work<00:03:53.950> but

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
that's how that would have to work but

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.820 
that's how that would have to work but
the<00:03:54.940> changes<00:03:55.360> are<00:03:55.480> going<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:55.989> ECU<00:03:56.320> because

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
the changes are going to the ECU because

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.710 
the changes are going to the ECU because
I<00:03:56.860> got<00:03:57.520> everything<00:03:57.820> zeroed<00:03:58.120> out<00:03:58.239> an<00:03:58.360> MS<00:03:58.570> though

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
I got everything zeroed out an MS though

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.170 
I got everything zeroed out an MS though
in<00:03:58.840> the<00:03:58.900> bike<00:03:59.050> won't<00:03:59.290> run<00:03:59.820> so<00:04:00.820> that's<00:04:00.970> pretty

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
in the bike won't run so that's pretty

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.160 
in the bike won't run so that's pretty
obvious<00:04:02.160> okay
