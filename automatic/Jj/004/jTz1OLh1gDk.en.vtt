00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.400
 Yes everyone 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:14.049
 Hello Nagaosa Takatoshi 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.049
 It is today 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:25.350
 Of order to draw the muscles of purpose prior to the training 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.350
 We will tell you in a video about how to weaken other branch schools 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:37.030
 Well then this 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:40.360
 I would like to demonstrate the weakness way to relieve the tension of the muscles of the sides over the shoulder from the trapezius muscle 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.940
 At first you stand upright on the ground 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.500
 And relax 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.579
 And yeah it is next 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:54.150
 I will raise people all the time with a feeling that brings people closer to my ears . 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 To in the image at this time 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.760
 It feels like this person is already sticking to the earlobe 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.460
 I will go up with such a feeling 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.509
 It is in its sometimes I just blood that has entered into the mouth to the pin over the total from this man 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 like this 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.190
 The rag 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.780
 It looks like I'm squeezing lines with such an image 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:22.820
 I feel like I squeezed out when I put blood 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.910
 I 'm going to raise it up in a way that brings you closer to the ear 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 If you really tense up to the point where it does not go beyond 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.659
 In one fell swoop 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.100
 Push down and weaken 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.310
 And relax 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.990
 It is about 5 seconds now to relax with 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.820
 Spit in the Sa' a breath when the benefit 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.200
 Repeat this three times 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.200
 Well then I will try 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.870
 This is just this overall 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.280
 The tension is relaxed after this, for example 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:28.280
 It's a squat, and it's Carl, and then it's a side raise. 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.200
 It's time to do it, so the tension in the muscles around here is relaxed, so let 's make it to the target muscle 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.290
 Ice is in a state of right 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.310
 You should also try Yes over 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.310
 Today is the end of it
