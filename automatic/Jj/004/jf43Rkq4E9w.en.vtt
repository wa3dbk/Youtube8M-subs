to layer import images as layers and I

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.070 
to layer import images as layers and I
have<00:00:27.340> a<00:00:27.369> library<00:00:27.640> here<00:00:27.880> of<00:00:28.300> visual<00:00:28.900> reference

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
have a library here of visual reference

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.740 
have a library here of visual reference
material<00:00:29.859> oh<00:00:30.010> here's<00:00:30.460> one<00:00:30.640> that<00:00:30.760> I<00:00:30.849> like<00:00:31.119> I'll

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
material oh here's one that I like I'll

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.430 
material oh here's one that I like I'll
open<00:00:32.080> that<00:00:32.140> up<00:00:32.470> it<00:00:32.650> imports<00:00:33.220> directly<00:00:33.670> in<00:00:33.879> I

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
open that up it imports directly in I

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.950 
open that up it imports directly in I
can<00:00:35.440> go<00:00:35.530> on<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:35.920> another<00:00:36.130> layer<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:40.450> I<00:00:40.540> can<00:00:40.780> use

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
can go on to another layer and I can use

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.910 
can go on to another layer and I can use
that<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.700> draw<00:00:42.700> over<00:00:43.110> uses<00:00:44.110> visual<00:00:44.350> reference

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
that to draw over uses visual reference

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.650 
that to draw over uses visual reference
however<00:00:45.100> I<00:00:45.399> might<00:00:45.700> need<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.149> be<00:00:46.239> able<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.450> use

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
however I might need to be able to use

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.229 
however I might need to be able to use
it<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.350> course<00:00:47.559> I<00:00:47.649> can<00:00:47.829> turn<00:00:48.010> off<00:00:48.250> we<00:00:49.120> have

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
it and of course I can turn off we have

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.229 
it and of course I can turn off we have
15<00:00:49.690> layer<00:00:50.020> at<00:00:50.230> any<00:00:50.379> time<00:00:50.829> that<00:00:51.070> I<00:00:51.100> want<00:00:54.239> another

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
15 layer at any time that I want another

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.200 
15 layer at any time that I want another
cool<00:00:55.600> thing<00:00:55.629> even<00:00:56.440> though<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:57.430> drawing<00:00:57.850> tools

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
cool thing even though the drawing tools

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.900 
cool thing even though the drawing tools
are<00:00:58.570> vector<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.379> this<00:00:59.620> is<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.770> bitmap<00:01:00.010> photo<00:01:00.609> of

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
are vector and this is a bitmap photo of

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.510 
are vector and this is a bitmap photo of
via<00:01:01.390> 15<00:01:01.840> that<00:01:01.989> I<00:01:02.050> just<00:01:02.260> brought<00:01:02.469> in<00:01:02.620> and<00:01:03.340> go

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
via 15 that I just brought in and go

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.399 
via 15 that I just brought in and go
here<00:01:03.760> my<00:01:03.940> eraser<00:01:04.300> tool<00:01:04.539> I<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:05.830> still<00:01:06.070> erase

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
here my eraser tool I can still erase

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.490 
here my eraser tool I can still erase
part<00:01:08.409> of<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:08.650> bitmap<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.950> very<00:01:12.310> cool<00:01:13.500> now

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
part of that bitmap that's very cool now

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.670 
part of that bitmap that's very cool now
if<00:01:14.680> I<00:01:14.770> don't<00:01:15.040> want<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.310> do<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.610> I<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:17.380> save

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
if I don't want to do that I can save

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.539 
if I don't want to do that I can save
this<00:01:17.920> for<00:01:18.159> later

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
this for later

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.340 
this for later
later<00:01:18.759> I<00:01:18.880> can<00:01:19.119> go<00:01:19.210> over<00:01:19.240> here<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.600> my<00:01:19.750> library

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
later I can go over here to my library

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.950 
later I can go over here to my library
tab<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.920> have<00:01:21.640> local<00:01:22.270> select<00:01:22.600> it's<00:01:22.750> in<00:01:22.869> the

tab I have local select it's in the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960 
tab I have local select it's in the
local<00:01:23.229> library<00:01:23.409> I<00:01:23.830> can<00:01:24.220> actually<00:01:24.580> take<00:01:24.939> that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
local library I can actually take that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.910 
local library I can actually take that
layer<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.659> drag<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.770> right<00:01:27.729> in<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:29.710> on

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
layer and drag it right in your on

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.890 
layer and drag it right in your on
thumbnails<00:01:30.220> it's<00:01:30.909> going<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.180> create<00:01:31.810> a

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
thumbnails it's going to create a

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.450 
thumbnails it's going to create a
thumbnail<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.350> have<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.680> set<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:32.890> up<00:01:33.040> once

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
thumbnail you have to set that up once

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.560 
thumbnail you have to set that up once
in<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.150> library<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:35.650> I<00:01:35.680> can<00:01:36.040> anytime<00:01:36.880> if<00:01:37.450> I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
in the library now I can anytime if I

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.060 
in the library now I can anytime if I
need<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:37.990> over<00:01:38.229> here<00:01:38.439> I<00:01:38.470> just<00:01:38.560> go<00:01:38.860> into<00:01:38.979> my

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
need it over here I just go into my

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.560 
need it over here I just go into my
library<00:01:39.549> and<00:01:39.700> I<00:01:39.729> can<00:01:39.909> drag<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:40.119> right<00:01:40.390> back

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
library and I can drag it right back

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.039 
library and I can drag it right back
into<00:01:41.110> another<00:01:41.259> frame<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.420> can<00:01:43.600> do<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> same

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
into another frame but I can do the same

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.020 
into another frame but I can do the same
thing<00:01:44.320> with<00:01:44.500> layers<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:44.860> panels<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.759> can

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
thing with layers and panels so I can

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.389 
thing with layers and panels so I can
come<00:01:46.270> in<00:01:46.420> here<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:47.140> can<00:01:47.380> select<00:01:47.770> this<00:01:48.070> layer

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
come in here and I can select this layer

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.149 
come in here and I can select this layer
I<00:01:48.700> can<00:01:49.630> drag<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.439> as<00:01:50.710> well<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:54.040> it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
I can drag that in as well and there it

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.020 
I can drag that in as well and there it
is<00:01:54.280> now<00:01:54.579> I<00:01:55.450> can<00:01:55.750> reuse<00:01:56.079> this<00:01:56.729> open<00:01:57.729> up<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.909> new

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
is now I can reuse this open up a new

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.209 
is now I can reuse this open up a new
blank<00:01:58.180> one<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:58.600> can<00:01:59.110> drag<00:01:59.259> that<00:01:59.320> layer<00:01:59.649> back<00:01:59.979> in

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
blank one I can drag that layer back in

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.130 
blank one I can drag that layer back in
and<00:02:00.490> reuse<00:02:00.880> it<00:02:01.030> over<00:02:01.119> and<00:02:01.360> over<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:01.930> if<00:02:01.990> you've

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
and reuse it over and over so if you've

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.870 
and reuse it over and over so if you've
