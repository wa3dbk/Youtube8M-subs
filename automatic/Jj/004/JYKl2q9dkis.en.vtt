totally didn't just take like two
thousand<00:02:29.820> steps<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.870> maybe<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.470> be

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
thousand steps so maybe that have to be

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.950 
thousand steps so maybe that have to be
altered<00:02:31.740> it<00:02:31.980> slightly<00:02:32.150> but<00:02:33.150> that's<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.780> that's
