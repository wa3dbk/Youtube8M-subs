structure will fail at its weakest link

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.440 
structure will fail at its weakest link
and<00:00:19.540> it's<00:00:20.500> very<00:00:20.740> complex<00:00:21.250> analysis<00:00:22.030> to<00:00:22.210> find

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
and it's very complex analysis to find

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.930 
and it's very complex analysis to find
out<00:00:22.750> why<00:00:23.350> has<00:00:23.530> structure<00:00:24.010> breaks<00:00:24.160> with<00:00:24.610> us<00:00:24.760> and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
out why has structure breaks with us and

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.290 
out why has structure breaks with us and

I'm Lionel Walford I teach civil
engineering<00:00:30.820> it<00:00:31.150> topically<00:00:31.570> and<00:00:32.169> I've<00:00:32.829> been

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
engineering it topically and I've been

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.799 
engineering it topically and I've been
doing<00:00:33.249> that<00:00:33.339> for<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.579> past<00:00:33.640> 20<00:00:34.239> years<00:00:34.390> you

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
doing that for the past 20 years you

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.209 
doing that for the past 20 years you
brought<00:00:35.079> lots<00:00:35.289> of<00:00:35.499> weight<00:00:35.649> I've<00:00:35.980> got<00:00:36.190> a

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
brought lots of weight I've got a

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.540 
brought lots of weight I've got a
hundred<00:00:36.489> kilos<00:00:37.059> so<00:00:37.949> doesn't<00:00:38.949> wear<00:00:39.069> this<00:00:39.219> it

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
hundred kilos so doesn't wear this it

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.950 
hundred kilos so doesn't wear this it
doesn't<00:00:39.999> go<00:00:40.179> if<00:00:40.809> you<00:00:41.050> can<00:00:41.260> take<00:00:41.469> honor<00:00:41.859> kilos

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
doesn't go if you can take honor kilos

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.930 
doesn't go if you can take honor kilos
they're<00:00:43.960> likely<00:00:44.620> ever<00:00:44.769> allowed<00:00:45.129> because<00:00:45.429> they

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
they're likely ever allowed because they

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.360 
they're likely ever allowed because they
I'm<00:00:46.059> impressed<00:00:46.479> I<00:00:46.839> get<00:00:47.229> to<00:00:47.589> build<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:48.010> models

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
I'm impressed I get to build the models

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.969 
I'm impressed I get to build the models
to<00:00:48.789> show<00:00:49.300> them<00:00:49.539> how<00:00:49.749> structures<00:00:50.499> behave

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
to show them how structures behave

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.309 
to show them how structures behave
physically<00:00:51.729> now<00:00:52.449> you<00:00:52.600> can<00:00:52.690> do<00:00:52.839> a<00:00:52.870> lot<00:00:53.049> on<00:00:53.229> the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
physically now you can do a lot on the

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.369 
physically now you can do a lot on the
blackboard<00:00:53.859> training<00:00:54.329> calculation<00:00:55.329> but<00:00:56.109> when

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
blackboard training calculation but when

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.619 
blackboard training calculation but when
you<00:00:56.499> actually<00:00:56.649> build<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.339> physical<00:00:57.879> model<00:00:58.030> it

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
you actually build a physical model it

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.629 
you actually build a physical model it
really<00:00:59.079> shows<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.409> impaler<00:01:00.039> action<00:01:00.549> of

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
really shows the impaler action of

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:02.610 
really shows the impaler action of
behave<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.209> generates<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.289> lot<00:01:02.589> of

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
behave and generates a lot of

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:20.960 
behave and generates a lot of
interesting<00:01:08.789> kilos

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.179 

there<00:01:21.970> was<00:01:22.180> always<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.750> frittata<00:01:23.229> ok<00:01:23.710> I<00:01:23.950> take

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
there was always a frittata ok I take

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:27.690 
there was always a frittata ok I take
them<00:01:24.640> force<00:01:24.880> as<00:01:25.330> print<00:01:26.020> material<00:01:26.920> structural

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
them force as print material structural

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.060 
them force as print material structural
analysis<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.899> evolved<00:01:29.289> models<00:01:29.710> in<00:01:29.890> those

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
analysis and evolved models in those

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.969 
analysis and evolved models in those
courses<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.970> it's<00:01:31.689> amazing<00:01:31.960> how<00:01:32.350> creative

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
courses and it's amazing how creative

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.039 
courses and it's amazing how creative
they<00:01:33.009> are<00:01:33.310> involving<00:01:33.970> those<00:01:34.149> models<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:34.869> what

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
they are involving those models and what

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.890 
they are involving those models and what
they<00:01:35.229> learn<00:01:35.470> by<00:01:35.710> using

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.030 

it's<00:01:41.900> interesting<00:01:42.080> how<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.530> look<00:01:42.799> at<00:01:42.950> the

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
it's interesting how you look at the

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.100 
it's interesting how you look at the
world<00:01:43.130> differently<00:01:43.280> after<00:01:44.000> learning<00:01:44.900> about

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
world differently after learning about

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.500 
world differently after learning about
civil<00:01:45.530> engineering<00:01:45.920> or<00:01:46.210> surveying<00:01:47.210> for

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
civil engineering or surveying for

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.999 
civil engineering or surveying for
instance<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:47.990> sort<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.229> see<00:01:48.409> how<00:01:48.560> things<00:01:48.860> are

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
instance you sort of see how things are

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.460 
instance you sort of see how things are
interacting<00:01:49.580> with<00:01:49.700> each<00:01:49.729> other<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:51.350> can

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
interacting with each other and you can

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.880 
interacting with each other and you can
just<00:01:51.619> get<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.220> idea<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.610> what<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.900> do<00:01:54.110> from

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
just get the idea of what to do from

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.570 
just get the idea of what to do from
things<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:55.520> see<00:01:55.670> around<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:56.119> what<00:01:56.540> works<00:01:56.840> for

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
things you see around you what works for

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:08.469 
things you see around you what works for
for<00:01:58.580> supporting<00:01:59.090> more<00:01:59.240> ways<00:02:07.390> there's<00:02:08.390> a

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
for supporting more ways there's a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.150 
for supporting more ways there's a
couple<00:02:08.600> example<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.289> joint<00:02:09.530> fail<00:02:09.800> it's

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
couple example of the joint fail it's

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.460 
couple example of the joint fail it's
really<00:02:10.369> great<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.150> see<00:02:11.390> how<00:02:11.750> actually<00:02:12.440> our

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
really great to see how actually our

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.430 
really great to see how actually our
tribal<00:02:13.070> symbol<00:02:13.340> coming<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.700> play<00:02:14.260> doing<00:02:15.260> that

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
tribal symbol coming to play doing that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:42.500 
tribal symbol coming to play doing that
and<00:02:15.709> yeah<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.030> what<00:02:17.540> we're<00:02:17.660> all<00:02:17.810> pretty<00:02:17.959> good

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.569 

you
