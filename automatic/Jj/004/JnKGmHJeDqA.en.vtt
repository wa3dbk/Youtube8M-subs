00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:15.700
 how come to a new place review on 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.980
 second advent and this time we are 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.010
 faster than snow, too 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.170
 is again a nice situation to stop 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.620
 at the right time at the right place 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.720
 his 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.100
 but this time it's about murder and 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.900
 Although the dubstep can 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.309
 many may know them from saints 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.750
 make row 44 because now comes here 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.540
 first nice dubstep pure what you guys 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.040
 is probably dropped and i can 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.320
 First of all, I'll tell you in advance 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.820
 I do not have powers on the side of 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.850
 the developer unfortunately no pictures or 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.870
 seen crafting recipes and that's why 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.760
 I do not even know if you can do it 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.250
 that's why there can be problems at all 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.510
 the whole in game mode and so is 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.160
 Once again a little fan makes me 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.260
 we want to introduce you to catch 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.800
 the first step entirely from the description 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.200
 there are no explosive and grew 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.619
 Worrying that polo emina and you 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.689
 Hold a maximum ammo of 100 so 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.280
 hamann 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.689
 if we start the whole topic with 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.889
 Right click of the pathology and substance 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.179
 I'll make sure of that quieter 

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:21.909
 I have to know the number of places 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.229
 you already get it going in you this 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.969
 small box and if you run over it 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.709
 then you get a little high 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.479
 hurled and they stop too 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:29.920
 no exclusive damage is always there 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.579
 not yet in loud that one time 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.389
 quieter again if you 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.299
 right click makes in any case 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:39.299
 activates the whole and you could stop 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.439
 to jump around and listen to this music 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.399
 further told her you will 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.679
 highly taxed if you have something like that 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.389
 but that's not true yet 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.619
 everything from mods and I could now then 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.709
 also disable it again 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.749
 then there are the exclusive so the 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.130
 I think for exclusive shadow I 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.770
 Just tax a bit that does me 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.509
 Of course very sorry so not so 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.240
 bad but now it comes to the 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:06.459
 next and the exclusive one has 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.890
 exclusive at the same time sebastian i so 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.329
 is a zombie and bastian i and us 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.580
 can start it very important 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.220
 you can see 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.780
 it all explodes a bit 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.030
 away after the time actually quite 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.060
 it's cool so you can really do it with it 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.570
 very nice hello andi like in the ground 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.740
 bust 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.050
 and there are always where you go 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.060
 shows where you point there will then go 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.410
 So that really blows up to no 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.810
 Not that bad when you are 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.100
 yes, every block and so on 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.510
 you can also quiet times as small 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.030
 gulches 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.350
 but if you show it, the hole comes 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.240
 Then I think I 'm going to run 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.200
 I think the music is loud can 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.970
 for example simply times by the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.800
 bus jump or what forest or what 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.709
 but I do not decide 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.010
 still with dubstep can and that is the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.440
 series style and she is not exclusive 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.680
 but has a remix of one 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.920
 record and that you can here 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.209
 with the title retrieve yes one can think 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.530
 that something is this normal 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.760
 to have a record all of a sudden 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.770
 short with jukebox so that you all 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.920
 listen again you can that again 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.020
 Sounds and that's just the remix 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.940
 that is the remix so the normal and 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.970
 now comes the remix many know 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.950
 maybe and that sounds quite different 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.000
 different 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.170
 what is very cool if you think so 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.880
 you can not see the package you will too 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.989
 after this little remix and poses 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.480
 this little explosion 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.980
 yes i would say and that was it from 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.820
 the motto we make an old one again 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.050
 on the record 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.420
 I mean we live a bit 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.850
 more stone age you and if it is you 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.959
 I liked the thumb upwards 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.980
 if the other mods see like that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.530
 then write it in the comments 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.530
 See you in the next video bye
