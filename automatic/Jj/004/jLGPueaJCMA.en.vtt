like make it slower for building and all

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.590 
like make it slower for building and all
that<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.310> actually<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> uninstall<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600

ravine and we're just not related to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.940 
ravine and we're just not related to
this<00:01:55.829> video<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.670> some<00:01:56.880> gold<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.740> let's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
this video and I see some gold so let's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.510 
this video and I see some gold so let's
go<00:01:59.340> ahead<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.670> fly<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.899> you're<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:02.100> here

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
go ahead and fly up so you're up here

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.490 
go ahead and fly up so you're up here
and<00:02:02.899> yeah<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.200> it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
and yeah that is it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.730 
and yeah that is it
so<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.450> how<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.659> use<00:02:06.780> no<00:02:07.049> clip<00:02:07.290> no<00:02:07.469> clip

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
so that is how you use no clip no clip

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.889 
so that is how you use no clip no clip
allows<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.220> fly<00:02:08.459> through<00:02:08.670> objects<00:02:09.149> so

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
allows you to fly through objects so

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.949 
allows you to fly through objects so
yeah

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
yeah

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.839 
yeah
um<00:02:12.510> turn<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.780> terms<00:02:14.019> of<00:02:14.459> simplicity<00:02:15.459> I'll

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
um turn in terms of simplicity I'll

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.479 
um turn in terms of simplicity I'll
choose<00:02:16.349> zombies<00:02:17.349> fly<00:02:17.590> ma<00:02:17.799> because<00:02:18.099> it's<00:02:18.280> much

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
choose zombies fly ma because it's much

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.860 
choose zombies fly ma because it's much
more<00:02:18.670> easier<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.060> can<00:02:19.209> choose<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.690> can

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
more easier you can choose you can

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.990 
more easier you can choose you can
change<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.440> buttons<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.400> whatever<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.819> want

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
so let's you're building you can change

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.339 
so let's you're building you can change
it<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.129> one<00:03:06.430> or<00:03:06.459> two<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.060> if<00:03:07.510> you're<00:03:07.659> exploring

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
it to one or two and if you're exploring

it to one or two and if you're exploring
can<00:03:08.650> change<00:03:08.859> it<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.040> 10<00:03:09.870> 10<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.019> max<00:03:11.319> I

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
can change it to 10 10 is the max I
