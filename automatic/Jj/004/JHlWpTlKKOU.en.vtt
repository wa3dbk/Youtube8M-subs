00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.490
 For the permanent resident and the vehicle, 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.250
 If the GNP is sold to God, 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 It's time to get it. 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.659
 Nongshim Love Sharing Steven 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.049
 To prepare for that step, I will throw 606 pieces. 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.220
 Venter is just being driven with a certain level of goal 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.320
 Bush was busy in the sunshine and bright outdoors as well. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.700
 Come back 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.860
 It's just the next 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.920
 Once upon a time 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.300
 Coughing starts in front of me, 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.380
 It can be solved from the moment 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 But when a company gets a First Lady, 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.240
 During the time it is determined that the camera was right 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.380
 The municipality is moving or the index is different. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.090
 Your photos will be your business 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.090
 If so, how fast is the neat speed 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.590
 Could I do that? 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.880
 In general, non-shake-free photos 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.550
 To take 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.600
 Cheonan 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.340
 So peaches in the lcd 1. 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.759
 First test 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.980
 6 I like a tenth of a second. 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.090
 In the stairwell, as you can see, 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.410
 Because shutter speeds are coming out, never getting a picture constantly 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.190
 I do not want to 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.790
 Could it be to prevent this coldness? 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.290
 First, the recognition of the ability to prevent camera shake 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 I get it in a direct car. 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.770
 View the 20 minute car from Kuwait 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.930
 You can get the effect of shooting at the same speed 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.690
 It has become a basic function for related organizations such as Ministry of Environment 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.270
 However, in moving subjects, 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.520
 That there is no 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.999
 The effect he has in his room is minimal. 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
 So it is necessary to be. Federal government 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.230
 The Grand National Party (GNP) easily accepts light. 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.839
 Lee Hyung-tack set a high limit, 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:15.519
 Citizens 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.459
 You can secure 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.609
 One of lung cancer. 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.259
 The article is in progress enough to make Song Il Song. 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.569
 The personal one is not a 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.060
 The right side is going back 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.390
 I can see that ismined in the second is the highest 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.309
 What about the one is not 800m section? 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.710
 500,000 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.680
 is connected from Justin Luzia since the woman was removed 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 It shows speed. 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:52.049
 If you add the camera shake correction function here, you can minimize 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.519
 I will. 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.040
 However, with simple office, 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.419
 I can not help it. 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.399
 Maybe I'll move on. 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.909
 when the disarmec and the right iso800 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:07.719
 is not it 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.179
 iso 800 1 Loss of swamp is much better 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.179
 But do not you go back 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.209
 But I do not know what to do. 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:21.619
 And what happens next? 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.009
 I was in Busan once. 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.059
 This development is to take pictures in a stable posture 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:32.699
 Watching, and stretching your arms like this, 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.559
 I hear and recognize, but the national improvement wave bus and taxi 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.259
 If you are born, you can cancel the deep echo 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.709
 However, 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.109
 It's a wrinkle. 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.629
 If it was not Mirae Asset's full-time shutter button 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.560
 You can shoot with no need to press 8243 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:54.809
 My heart may not be there 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:58.769
 With a good idea to shoot in dancing ms pediatrics 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:03:59.719
 I am. 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.409
 If so, please use the comment 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.409
 I bought it with reflection of mass production. 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:06.519
 Culturing in short
