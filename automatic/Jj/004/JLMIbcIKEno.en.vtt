00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.810
 hello to all guys welcome back here set 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.580
 with you we are going to examine today 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.430
 sm1 ekf 5 we will see what theirs are 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.910
 particularity a challenge between smg and ea 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.419
 understand which at the end of the video is 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.880
 be the best then let's start right away 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.920
 stage f5s m1 which are two weapons like 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.739
 see from the graphics that have the damage 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.520
 very similar also in regards to 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.559
 the accrual is more or less the same 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.670
 level even if there is a small one 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.520
 difference and ultimately the scope is 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.390
 slightly higher than that of sm 1 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.239
 but even in this case there are not 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.489
 so many differences then in practice 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.520
 the peculiarity however enters these two 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.470
 weapons as you are seeing is that the kf 5 from 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.930
 any distance other than that 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.509
 very close together where it kills in three 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.070
 shots kills in four practically 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:17.150
 because with the first five shots the kf 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:19.580
 5a more damage and in this way manages aa 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.220
 inflict in short with only four 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.390
 obviously the opponent's love hits 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.850
 however this is practically impossible 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.159
 in a game take with the first ones 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.690
 four shots from the charger then 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.369
 happens that at the end the blows that you 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.320
 will always serve 5 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.170
 as regards the sm 1 the speech 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.299
 it is more or less the same from very close 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.920
 the shots are three as he walks away 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:45.619
 arrive arrive arrive at 5 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.560
 we can see from this screen now 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.360
 the rose of the blows practically are more 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.840
 whether or not more or less similar we remember that 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.509
 however the shot rose is always 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.830
 variable is a bit random let's say then 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.740
 it is not a value to be taken extremely 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.230
 however, they prove to be good from the tests 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.690
 two excellent machine gun nyt files we see 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.320
 finally the precision in short 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.360
 recoil shooting up on these targets e 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.400
 we see that they both have a recoil 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.280
 upwards and strokes going to 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.950
 make mistakes are the last recharger 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.630
 in last guys trying them for 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.890
 I can tell you a lot of time that I do 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.960
 the council together to an absolutely 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.860
 they are really both really strong 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.420
 but the second is definitely 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.000
 surely the best is in the scenes 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.640
 because public and private 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.740
 in short , you will find the competitive ones 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.400
 definitely better with sm a 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.320
 loader larger than the damage that a 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.980
 part for my first anti-complication 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.959
 because 5,000 said before is better and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.610
 most definitely told us to do a lot 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.510
 more massacre with the latter 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.650
 machine gun especially after the patch 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.209
 gentlemen, with this video, we're done 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.250
 with the next video we will see to examine 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.810
 other weapons please write me in the comments 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.950
 the ones you prefer and we'll see each other 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.950
 with the next hello video
