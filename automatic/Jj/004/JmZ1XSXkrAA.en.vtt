00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 I don't know what to say to you in 3 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.870
 minutes 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.630
 the most brutal fight for all of our 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.089
 professional life today will be decided 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:23.490
 everything 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:27.720
 or we again command or break give 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.790
 moment by moment and when the end we are in 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:37.100
 hell jackman and believe we can 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.100
 come to terms with this and then let us 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:46.290
 everyone wipe their feet or else we will give battle and 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.010
 break out 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.010
 soot and fearing 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.149
 i can't do it for you i'm old 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:04.650
 I see your young faces and I think that myself 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:10.979
 I did all the stupid things in life 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:16.590
 only was it possible I skipped all my 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.300
 money can you believe I drove everyone away 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.110
 once loved me 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.640
 and now 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.640
 I'd rather not look in the mirror 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.330
 over the years a person loses a lot but 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:41.040
 this is this is life and you understand it 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.940
 when you lose you understand that life is 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:49.119
 such a game where every day is important and 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:52.360
 football also because you are games and in 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:57.250
 life, the price of a mistake is too high 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:01.420
 you took a step a little earlier or a little later 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.759
 and you did not leave hurried or late 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.660
 for half a second left a beggar 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.780
 the inches we need always choke 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:16.690
 they are in every gaming moment in any 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:20.350
 minute and second and our team will 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.860
 fight for them she will fight for 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.670
 every inch we regret neither ourselves nor 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.310
 others in this game we cling to this 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.190
 inch teeth 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.940
 chains msk because we know the sum of these 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.010
 inches there is a difference 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:44.420
 between victory and defeat yes victory 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:48.630
 between life and death 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.920
 crayfish the one who is ready to give 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.920
 life for this
