00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.309
 generations of video will be interesting just 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.099
 for those who have a choice to take 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.259
 or don't take the car ahead 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.570
 I will say right away that the car to take 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.400
 Car possess simply gorgeous 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 whole year and you know just no 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.410
 complaints 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.750
 what is service what is plastic what is convenient 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.560
 the seat is all just everything is simple 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.290
 fine 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 took citroen and was not at all upset 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:40.260
 many friends said it was kind of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 the Frenchman and all the cases on the service stopped 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.230
 once great service all 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.750
 I like it thanks to the dealer 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.649
 small of course minus and here for example 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.260
 rights and rights screen here with an indicator 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.640
 fuel level where I have written 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.020
 one hundred seventy five kilometers that is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.879
 more fuel enough for one hundred seventy five 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.430
 kilometers 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.570
 very uncomfortable computer takes this figure 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.000
 from their there any considerations like 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.650
 use the gas pedal there 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.479
 accelerates average speed all this 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.030
 calculate and calculate this figure 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.509
 constantly changing very much i think is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.130
 uncomfortable but you can get used to it 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.070
 massive racks massive racks i 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.390
 I think also limit greatly 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 will be limited to review and how to this 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 too everything is easy pretty easy 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.890
 you get used to there was one problem replacing 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.460
 thermostat in the whole car series and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.710
 its this brand page 4 has been replaced 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.729
 rheostat but now this problem 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.899
 the thermostat was removed was replaced and 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.720
 the whole problem is fixed so 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.450
 this problem is no longer chic chic 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.600
 just the smartest soft plastic already 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.000
 repeatedly talked about him comfortable 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.000
 the steering wheel has become and here is already moving hub 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.370
 volume control toggle there 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:16.130
 aux output radio stations and disk and sheet 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.220
 myself that is a list of radio stations all this 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.560
 easy to search for a radio 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.920
 naturally massive this signal 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.030
 tears of this side cruise and limit control 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.680
 everything is just like limit control is not 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.360
 allows you to exceed the target 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.239
 whose speed is set with 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.530
 Now using this and the pros and cons 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.360
 cruise control speed that will 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.600
 constantly maintained but also the inclusion 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.760
 Turning off this key is convenient 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.989
 adjustable mirrors heated mirrors 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.319
 I have an automatic box 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.870
 on the automatic box sports 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.090
 mode winter mode and here is tiptronic 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.250
 plus or minus 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.190
 shift gears up and down too 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.060
 if you are a fan by the way 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.250
 a few words about the box here is the same r4 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.829
 I even to be honest, since they donâ€™t 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.260
 reworked this box something not there 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:16.250
 replaced they again upgraded and 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.530
 and once again but I don't know just yes 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.620
 on a cold car there are any 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.880
 pushes from 1 to 2 gear and but not more 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.160
 that here the hydraulic unit is completely replaced 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.230
 to the zf company here the hydraulic unit to deliver 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.600
 now on this box 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.420
 very famous company very good 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.060
 the company and you know the heated box 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.620
 just makes me happy no jolts when 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.329
 everything is quite nice to switch 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.489
 sport mode well sport mode 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:51.019
 especially frankly melon is different 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.750
 the only thing that he allows there is 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.359
 unwind more that is on large 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.920
 turnovers switch and braking 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.290
 engine sensible braking 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.180
 engine winter mode that we have here 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.680
 such a 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.319
 transmission gear is more stretched and 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.700
 gets out of place instead of first 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.060
 transfers start immediately 2 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.889
 but the box has become very clever chooses 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.850
 she is descending 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:17.400
 everything is convenient 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.330
 I really liked the box 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.700
 us here radio control buttons 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.130
 Naturally the channels of the radio station, but with 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.570
 1 to 6 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.340
 radio station here volume on 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.260
 shutdown 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.440
 some information if there is a radio too 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.250
 this button also turns on and 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.800
 here, in principle, switching between 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.660
 radio there aux output and disk well and 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.230
 setting on-board computers all the same 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:51.000
 very simple everything is convenient to enter the menu there 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.800
 exit escape and reset there here too 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.360
 these buttons are used in the radio station 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.530
 enable search and scroll through the menu in 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.360
 next generations 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.580
 not the generations of the following ones 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.830
 cars this is mine was one of 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.130
 first and here is the English language menu 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:14.030
 Russified here are the following in by car 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.030
 drove 8745 kilometers
