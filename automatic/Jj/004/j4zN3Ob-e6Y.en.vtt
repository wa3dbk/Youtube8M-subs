personal<00:01:08.640> pet<00:01:08.880> peeve<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> mine<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.780> believe

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
personal pet peeve of mine I believe

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130 
personal pet peeve of mine I believe
that<00:01:10.860> every<00:01:11.280> book<00:01:11.520> should<00:01:11.939> work<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.600> its<00:01:12.930> own

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that every book should work on its own

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.130 
that every book should work on its own
and<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:14.010> whole<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:14.939> complete<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:16.049> itself

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and just be whole and complete in itself

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.980 
and just be whole and complete in itself
now<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.250> notable<00:01:18.030> exceptions<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
now there are notable exceptions to this

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.039 
now there are notable exceptions to this
that<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:19.979> cliffhangers<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.210> ended<00:01:21.990> up

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that are cliffhangers that I ended up

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.440 
that are cliffhangers that I ended up
liking<00:01:22.369> obviously<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> hunger<00:01:23.850> games<00:01:23.880> are

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
liking obviously the hunger games are

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.679 
liking obviously the hunger games are
all<00:01:24.570> cliffhanger<00:01:25.439> books<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:27.090> think<00:01:27.540> they

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
all cliffhanger books but I think they

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.289 
all cliffhanger books but I think they
work<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.200> yes<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.100> do<00:01:29.159> think<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.700> part<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
work and yes I do think that part of it

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.910 
work and yes I do think that part of it
is<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> little<00:01:30.630> bit<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> working<00:01:31.290> marketing

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
is a little bit of a working marketing

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.609 
is a little bit of a working marketing
strategy<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:33.270> more<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
strategy but more so I think that it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.999 
strategy but more so I think that it
just<00:01:34.939> worked<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> ominous<00:01:36.720> tone<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
just worked for the ominous tone of the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
just worked for the ominous tone of the
story<00:01:38.280> another<00:01:39.180> series<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.780> has<00:01:39.900> clipping

can<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.110> why<00:01:52.350> they<00:01:52.530> would<00:01:52.680> irritate<00:01:53.040> people<00:01:53.479> i

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
can see why they would irritate people i

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.990 
can see why they would irritate people i
really<00:01:55.020> liked<00:01:55.229> them<00:01:55.500> i<00:01:55.800> just<00:01:56.400> finished<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.880> book

books in this series the lunar
Chronicles<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.430> case<00:02:05.760> I<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
Chronicles and in this case I like the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
Chronicles and in this case I like the
cliffhanger<00:02:07.789> apparently<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.119> know

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
cliffhanger apparently because I know

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.760 
cliffhanger apparently because I know
that<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.720> four<00:02:09.929> stories<00:02:10.320> are<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> be

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
that the four stories are going to be

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.360 
that the four stories are going to be
one<00:02:11.360> overarching<00:02:12.360> story<00:02:12.930> each<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:13.890> focusing

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
one overarching story each one focusing

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.460 
one overarching story each one focusing
on<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.520> different<00:02:14.610> fairy<00:02:15.209> tale<00:02:15.480> being<00:02:16.080> retold

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
on a different fairy tale being retold

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.770 
on a different fairy tale being retold
but<00:02:17.220> they're<00:02:17.370> all<00:02:17.520> interconnected<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.600> so

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
but they're all interconnected and so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.880 
but they're all interconnected and so
there's<00:02:18.989> no<00:02:19.110> way<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.440> could<00:02:19.590> really

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
there's no way that you could really

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.590 
there's no way that you could really
wrap<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.430> without<00:02:22.520> making<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> seem<00:02:23.880> lesser

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
wrap it up without making it seem lesser

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.370 
wrap it up without making it seem lesser
a<00:02:24.630> part<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.530> whole<00:02:25.739> story<00:02:26.959> but<00:02:27.959> books<00:02:28.200> like

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
a part of the whole story but books like

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.320 
a part of the whole story but books like
that<00:02:28.560> or<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.800> exception<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.459> think<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.150> lot<00:02:30.300> of

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
that or the exception I think a lot of

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.360 
that or the exception I think a lot of
times<00:02:30.600> cliffhanger<00:02:31.170> endings<00:02:31.500> really<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.070> just

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
times cliffhanger endings really do just

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.860 
times cliffhanger endings really do just
seem<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.790> gimmick<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.300> they<00:02:33.420> seem<00:02:33.660> like

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
seem like a gimmick and they seem like

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.620 
seem like a gimmick and they seem like
they<00:02:34.140> are<00:02:34.520> pandering<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.970> maybe<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.570> a

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
they are pandering or maybe it's a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.170 
they are pandering or maybe it's a
product<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.320> all<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.280> people<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.000> have

grown up on TV series that all have

grown up on TV series that all have
cliffhanger<00:02:42.420> ending<00:02:43.489> I'm<00:02:44.489> not<00:02:44.760> sure<00:02:44.910> what<00:02:45.090> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
cliffhanger ending I'm not sure what it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.300 
cliffhanger ending I'm not sure what it
is<00:02:45.209> but<00:02:45.330> whatever<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> huge<00:02:47.190> fan

might have a cliffhanger here there but

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.430 
might have a cliffhanger here there but
for<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.480> most<00:03:09.600> part<00:03:09.780> you're<00:03:10.049> just<00:03:10.260> going<00:03:10.380> to

and you know that going in and I think

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.590 
and you know that going in and I think

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
established story and then of course you

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
necessarily series but they all are

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.330 
necessarily series but they all are
connected<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.320> some<00:03:29.620> way<00:03:29.650> they're<00:03:30.010> all<00:03:30.130> in<00:03:30.250> the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.060 
world so do you call those stand-alones
or<00:03:45.580> do<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.760> call<00:03:45.970> those<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.210> series<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:47.070> call

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
or do you call those a series I call

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.980 
or do you call those a series I call
them<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.280> series<00:03:48.520> but<00:03:48.940> they<00:03:49.420> are<00:03:49.540> technically

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
them a series but they are technically

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.680 
them a series but they are technically
stand-alones<00:03:50.560> and<00:03:50.800> I<00:03:50.890> think<00:03:51.160> as<00:03:51.520> far<00:03:52.390> as<00:03:52.510> I'm

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
stand-alones and I think as far as I'm

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.910 
stand-alones and I think as far as I'm
concerned<00:03:52.720> that's<00:03:53.170> sort<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.530> how<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.680> would

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
concerned that's sort of how I would

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.790 
concerned that's sort of how I would
prefer<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.310> series<00:03:54.790> because<00:03:55.270> it's<00:03:55.510> all

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
prefer a series because it's all

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.560 
prefer a series because it's all
complete<00:03:56.800> it's<00:03:57.100> contained<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:57.910> can<00:03:58.120> read<00:03:58.360> one

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
complete it's contained I can read one

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.180 
complete it's contained I can read one
book<00:03:58.780> without<00:03:58.990> having<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.650> read<00:03:59.770> the<00:03:59.920> others

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
book without having to read the others

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.420 
book without having to read the others
and<00:04:00.430> that's<00:04:00.490> nice<00:04:00.820> but<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.570> really<00:04:01.990> do<00:04:02.170> respect

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
and that's nice but I really do respect

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.330 
and that's nice but I really do respect
stand-alones<00:04:03.750> partly<00:04:04.750> because<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:06.190> much

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
stand-alones partly because so much

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.280 
stand-alones partly because so much
attention<00:04:06.730> has<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:07.330> be<00:04:07.360> focused<00:04:07.900> by<00:04:08.230> the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
attention has to be focused by the

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.660 
attention has to be focused by the
author<00:04:08.500> they<00:04:08.830> really<00:04:09.070> do<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.520> have<00:04:09.640> a

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
author they really do have to have a

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.960 
author they really do have to have a
complete<00:04:10.030> story<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:10.690> have<00:04:11.290> everything

complete story and have everything

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.570 
complete story and have everything
thought<00:04:12.970> out<00:04:13.210> and<00:04:13.570> all<00:04:13.780> of<00:04:13.960> their<00:04:14.110> ends<00:04:14.650> ready

thought out and all of their ends ready
to<00:04:15.850> wrap<00:04:16.060> up<00:04:16.270> or<00:04:17.110> they<00:04:17.410> have<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.680> make<00:04:17.830> that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
to wrap up or they have to make that

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.039 
to wrap up or they have to make that
concrete<00:04:18.190> decision<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:19.090> not<00:04:19.330> wrap<00:04:19.720> everything

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
concrete decision to not wrap everything

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.630 
concrete decision to not wrap everything
up<00:04:20.290> because<00:04:20.799> there's<00:04:21.130> not<00:04:21.310> going<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.549> be

up because there's not going to be

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.240

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.899 
enjoyed writing it but now I'm moving on
I<00:05:35.349> think<00:05:35.770> partly<00:05:36.099> you<00:05:36.310> tend<00:05:36.520> to<00:05:36.580> think<00:05:36.789> of

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
I think partly you tend to think of

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.820 
I think partly you tend to think of
series<00:05:37.300> as<00:05:37.629> a<00:05:38.199> little<00:05:38.529> fluffier<00:05:40.620> because<00:05:41.620> they

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
series as a little fluffier because they

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.040 
series as a little fluffier because they
are<00:05:42.009> drawn<00:05:42.759> out<00:05:42.969> and<00:05:43.270> because<00:05:43.599> there<00:05:43.810> is<00:05:43.900> going

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
are drawn out and because there is going

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.809 
are drawn out and because there is going
to<00:05:44.139> be<00:05:44.199> an<00:05:44.319> opportunity<00:05:44.740> in<00:05:45.069> the<00:05:45.159> future<00:05:45.189> to

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
to be an opportunity in the future to

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.320 
to be an opportunity in the future to
explain<00:05:46.389> any<00:05:46.719> plot<00:05:47.020> holes<00:05:47.259> in<00:05:47.409> the<00:05:47.469> past<00:05:48.330> you

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
explain any plot holes in the past you

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.230 
explain any plot holes in the past you
don't<00:05:49.539> necessarily<00:05:50.379> always<00:05:50.409> get<00:05:51.240> the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
don't necessarily always get the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.079 
don't necessarily always get the
strongest<00:05:53.190> storytelling<00:05:54.190> also<00:05:54.759> because

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:55.089 
strongest storytelling also because

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:58.529 
strongest storytelling also because
things<00:05:55.330> tend<00:05:55.629> to<00:05:55.719> be<00:05:56.580> pulpy<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:57.759> series<00:05:58.210> things

just depends on which way you go is that

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.520 
just depends on which way you go is that
I<00:06:24.939> guess<00:06:25.120> and<00:06:25.389> I<00:06:25.840> guess<00:06:26.020> when<00:06:26.229> you<00:06:26.319> really

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.339 
I guess and I guess when you really
think<00:06:26.560> about<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:27.009> even<00:06:27.699> standalone<00:06:28.599> books<00:06:28.930> by

think about it even standalone books by

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.260 
think about it even standalone books by
certain<00:06:29.770> authors<00:06:29.889> can<00:06:30.460> tend<00:06:30.699> to<00:06:30.849> feel<00:06:31.030> like<00:06:31.210> a

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
certain authors can tend to feel like a

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.929 
certain authors can tend to feel like a
series<00:06:31.689> I'm<00:06:31.930> pretty<00:06:32.800> sure<00:06:33.069> every<00:06:33.520> book<00:06:33.759> the
