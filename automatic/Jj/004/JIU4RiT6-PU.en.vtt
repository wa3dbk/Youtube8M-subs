00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.029
 between martín and asia de barcelona 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.039

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.929
 Iberian prey 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.999
 and cocoa for that we're going to need 75% cocoa 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.759

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.880

 chopped and the prey 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.490
 Iberian 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.490
 let's laugh at the squid we have here 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.210
 Now let's prepare the filling with which we are going 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.110
 apparently the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.350
 calamari or solve 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.120
 the pan is very hot 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.030
 a push of sesame 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730
 I can suffer 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.730
 a little bit of pepper 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.240
 a little bit of segovia 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 a little bit of green chile 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.010
 sexologists that was fine 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
 until it is golden 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.060
 the aggregates 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.910
 the dam 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.910
 there we have sofrito with the press 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 he posed with a little pepper 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.040
 if we are going to leave 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.110
 apart from ceará we will proceed to prepare the cocoa sauce 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.320
 for sanz has highlighted 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.809
 hot pan 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:10.589
 oil 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.589
 normal a little ctc is love 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.149
 for safety 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.319
 Red pepper 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.939
 flowers all of them are accessible 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.059
 no goals in san luis potosí 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:36.059
 if it is if the Mexican society 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.469
 all projects 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:41.729
 all suffer a lot 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.729
 a little basil 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.989
 many suffer for the 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.989
 big pieces because all this said wolves to shred 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.559
 simply what we do is to give it some flavor 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.139
 at the end we will finish with the grass 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.439
 efecom 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.669
 to give freshness the bases have been laid 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.569
 we only have the sofrito and anne 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.279
 prepared 15 20 minutes 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.009
 to fire but returning 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.009
 a little pepper 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:17.739
 little bit of almonds 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.739
 toasted bonilla 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.309
 cocoa 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.309
 I know it gets cacao 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.059
 It is also very happy everyone 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.059
 c 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.409
 the chicken broth 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.499
 this we are going to see it just leave 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.669
 boil for a few minutes 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.339
 had too many necessary 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.969
 come on and it's over as I said before 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.509
 with a little bit of fresh basil 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.889
 cristina profr 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:08.939
 when we have 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.279
 already in this frame 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:13.219
 simply what we do 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.009
 write it 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:16.799
 when we finish percent 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.999
 debate we passed the preparation for the Chinese 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:21.779
 he said what he gives 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.270
 this sauce 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.169
 with a little bit of this sauce 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.379
 everything finishes the filling since we had 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:31.379
 jones or fried or over the announcer in to flirt 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.309
 and let's laugh at the colors 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.910
 for oxfam will prosper 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.630
 Fill 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.870
 the squid with the previous preparation 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.639
 We put a first sleeve with a spoon with whatever seems good or 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.090
 three 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.039
 it's a little stuffing 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.039
 put red stick 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.849
 I recommend the four calamari per serving more or less 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.819
 his face more than small 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:19.620
 you have to make sure they are tender squids 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.659
 obviously I know in my time the season 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:25.839
 and squid 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.889
 the market is the best option 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.610
 stood young 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.319
 pass it jarama has been by the iron 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.289
 let's remember that soon, just what we have to do is 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.199
 heat it 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.199
 the carabassí that has to be tender is that it is a 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.599
 one round trip 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.669
 they were the recipe is very simple 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.150
 Good general good to prune a touch of oven 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.069
 we created a little bit of law 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.069
 and we finish it that they give us well-known 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.999
 so the quality of the fruit is maintained 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.300
 It's very important 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.589
 take it out 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.589
 your new home 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.819
 the fried squids 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.819
 cocoa 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.719
 and here we have a reduction of five squid that is then finished 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.650
 a little bit of sense 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.639
 very cool security
