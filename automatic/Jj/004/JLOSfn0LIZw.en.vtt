00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 today it's about a very simple one 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.820
 Quicktipp and you learned how to do it all 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.860
 simple can make a free tree or 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.860
 also leaves now much fun with the video 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.449
 okay in photoshop I'll show you now 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.850
 how to make it simple and easy 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.150
 Tree can crop still short 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.910
 photographic part important he should 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.969
 I already look that we are from one 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.620
 deep point out of photographed and when 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.100
 of course it is now like here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.469
 Example picture have a blue sky 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.379
 as a background works better 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.620
 the trick is the whole again 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.719
 be a little quick and dirty okay you 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.969
 really does not need anything 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.210
 special or original picture opens 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.910
 you have to choose a subject as a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.219
 first set a tolerance 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.789
 So with me now fits best 15 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.199
 until 20 and then you go to the panel 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.680
 with the plus sign 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.420
 Now you go back to original picture 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.450
 and actually drives only in the area 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.850
 that you are actually outsourcing 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.659
 So we want up here 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.490
 because the white ones wanted to come down here 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.549
 I was still here in the blue sky 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.069
 a little bit around and up here 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.250
 depending on the tolerance you can now 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:33.369
 here in this black and white thumbnail 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.909
 already see a result with me as that 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.459
 now not so much to get it done simply 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.429
 also okay so many a choice 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:45.700
 now has this still needs 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:49.329
 invert control and switch 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.720
 the one with the combination you can one 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:57.640
 invert selection and now best 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:00.680
 put a plane mask and I have 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 An action has been created for me now 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.880
 and then have one here 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.039
 color area to just the exemption too 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.420
 check and possibly correct 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.250
 push the down and see now 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.150
 well, the tree trunk I have to, of course 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.950
 still change 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:25.130
 That's why I'm going to go to an industry 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:31.470
 in the plane mask change to the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:36.050
 White hue or white color so far 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.489
 one more would have 70-80 size 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.140
 would be less seen little 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.440
 you okay be even harder now 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.720
 I'm basically just in principle 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.130
 restore the tree trunks 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.739
 where I want to have speak only the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.959
 main tree trunk if up there at eat 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.830
 or so changing interests me 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:05.420
 actually a little bit 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.270
 okay but i say it's so quick and 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.860
 dirty and sometimes with the result I can 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:15.440
 one already live because that bit now 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.110
 correct it out here yes that is 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.110
 a matter of maximum minute 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.490
 ok i mean it is clear that now 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.810
 not a super perfect freistelle though 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.630
 You have to look like that now if you are 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.030
 this year composer takes the tree trunk 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.060
 then the tree may come this way 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.240
 big more and you have to calculate then 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.860
 then you better calculate it 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.530
 have you not there just more red 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.850
 bright background color but 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.209
 maybe somehow, too 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.580
 landscape that disappears then there 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.830
 so that one no longer recognizes as that 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.200
 because not super duper was released 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.720
 the individual astern not with 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.910
 are released 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.030
 and the reason why I'm down here 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.090
 leave with the grass if I am now 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.980
 insert the tree trunk then I will 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.340
 Just do that again 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.530
 masked and just the left and right 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.769
 course of the field of course makes 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.200
 but here at the tree trunk try one more 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.390
 bit of the green stuff with too 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.669
 So that integrate simply a 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.830
 That's why I'm getting a better transition 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.940
 that always there and then it would have to 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.940
 actually can only save 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.850
 save it as a pst file or as 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.710
 png save then but would have to 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.990
 that was going to surface 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.580
 must switch off via test area and 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.110
 his team is going with a red area 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.940
 in it 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.860
 and yes that was me the whole trip 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.100
 I have prepared something else 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.990
 and just here in the foliage if 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.100
 one last tree in eg web painting 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.760
 created and next leafage 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.950
 just needs the same trick in principle 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.950
 Make safety lock off here 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.540
 again on pick father rich I read 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.250
 the tolerance fits here too 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.600
 Let's take the pipette with the 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.040
 plus sign above here in here 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.490
 the whole area and here 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:24.670
 ok again imitate plane mask then 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.300
 bring our check color area 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:31.600
 round push finished he could get one 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.280
 here's what the foliage is not 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.920
 it also belongs to the lower right corner 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.960
 like to do and then you can then the 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.770
 as for composing paste 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.620
 a little one and that no one diapers 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.900
 kind of a little bit awesome 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.530
 is released especially if you have it 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.520
 anyway do not know then yes and that is in 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.790
 principle the whole thing 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.310
 I hope we liked it and we did 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.220
 See us then escape like you 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.020
 is actually that 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.030
 Do not leave a tree hard 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.090
 it's just such a quick and or again 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:10.000
 did it and you can now in principle 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.580
 Click here above then you come to 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.610
 last video I show you like you 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.980
 Find out who is wrongful 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.720
 your pictures on the web uses if you are down 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.490
 then you can click to the last one 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.480
 quick tip come because it goes around pictures 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.090
 sharpen 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.190

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.990
 otherwise look at ours 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.700
 social platform over or on the 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.970
 website I wish you one more 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.970
 nice day
