was<00:00:13.460> for<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.820> course<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:16.760> retro<00:00:17.760> 14<00:00:19.310> however

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
was for of course the retro 14 however

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400 
was for of course the retro 14 however
when<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.760> went<00:00:20.910> back<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.240> all<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.779> stores<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
when I went back to all the stores I

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.500 
when I went back to all the stores I
noticed<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.769> they<00:00:22.859> didn't<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.160> sell<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:23.609> so

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
noticed that they didn't all sell out so

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.689 
noticed that they didn't all sell out so
I<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.800> probably<00:00:26.070> didn't<00:00:26.310> even<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
I really probably didn't even have to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.849 
I really probably didn't even have to
win<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> raffle<00:00:27.060> ticket<00:00:27.359> because<00:00:27.630> they<00:00:28.109> me<00:00:28.680> like

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
win a raffle ticket because they me like

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.890 
win a raffle ticket because they me like
a<00:00:28.890> whole<00:00:29.099> bunch<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.429> these<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.330> there's<00:00:30.750> like<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
a whole bunch of these so there's like a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.510 
a whole bunch of these so there's like a
million<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.470> these<00:00:31.560> still<00:00:31.890> logged<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.369> then

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
million of these still logged and then

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.310 
million of these still logged and then
maybe<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.030> not<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.360> popular<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
maybe they just not that popular but I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.810
