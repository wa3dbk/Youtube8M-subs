about<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.170> start<00:01:58.350> replacing<00:01:58.590> these<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.310> that's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
about to start replacing these if that's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.029 
about to start replacing these if that's
what<00:01:59.789> they<00:01:59.909> were<00:01:59.969> gonna<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:01.530> when<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> first

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
what they were gonna do so when I first

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.069 
what they were gonna do so when I first
set<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.399> brackish<00:02:02.789> tank<00:02:03.030> off<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.780> trying

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
set this brackish tank off I was trying

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.630 
set this brackish tank off I was trying
to<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.680> different<00:02:04.860> animals<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.460> could

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
to think of different animals I could

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.240 
to think of different animals I could
put<00:02:05.789> in<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.770> happened<00:02:08.160> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
put in here and it just so happened that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.099 
put in here and it just so happened that
most<00:02:08.519> rainbow<00:02:08.940> fish<00:02:09.149> not<00:02:09.329> all<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:09.899> most

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.109 
most rainbow fish not all but most

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.039 
most rainbow fish not all but most
Russian<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:10.799> a<00:02:10.829> lot<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.420> rainbow<00:02:12.420> fish<00:02:12.630> can<00:02:12.930> go

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
Russian see a lot of rainbow fish can go

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.220 
Russian see a lot of rainbow fish can go
in<00:02:13.200> brackish<00:02:13.500> water<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.540> thought<00:02:15.690> well<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
in brackish water and I thought well you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.990 
in brackish water and I thought well you
know<00:02:16.350> that's<00:02:16.500> fish<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:16.920> already<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> may

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
know that's fish I already have so I may

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.990 
know that's fish I already have so I may
as<00:02:18.090> well<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.359> that<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:20.160> at<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.519> point<00:02:20.670> I'm<00:02:20.850> so

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
as well do that and at that point I'm so

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.430 
as well do that and at that point I'm so
frustrated<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.600> honestly<00:02:21.900> didn't<00:02:22.170> care<00:02:22.320> if

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
frustrated I honestly didn't care if

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.720 
frustrated I honestly didn't care if
they<00:02:22.560> jumped<00:02:22.829> out<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.100> open-topped<00:02:23.489> tank

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
they jumped out of the open-topped tank

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.960 
they jumped out of the open-topped tank
and<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:25.440> assumed<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.220> since<00:02:26.579> they<00:02:26.820> were<00:02:26.940> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
and I assumed that since they were the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.640 
and I assumed that since they were the
only<00:02:27.180> two<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.630> had<00:02:27.720> not<00:02:27.840> committed<00:02:28.260> suicide

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
only two that had not committed suicide

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.340 
only two that had not committed suicide
by<00:02:28.859> jumping

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
by jumping

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.500 
by jumping
their<00:02:29.470> death<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> other<00:02:30.100> tank<00:02:30.450> they<00:02:31.450> were

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
their death in the other tank they were

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.720 
their death in the other tank they were
probably<00:02:32.110> okay<00:02:32.670> excuse<00:02:33.670> me<00:02:33.700> it's<00:02:33.970> been<00:02:34.180> I

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
probably okay excuse me it's been I

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.580 
probably okay excuse me it's been I
don't<00:02:36.730> know<00:02:36.880> six<00:02:37.360> or<00:02:37.450> seven<00:02:37.810> months<00:02:38.080> now<00:02:38.110> and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
don't know six or seven months now and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.830 
don't know six or seven months now and
they<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.640> as<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:40.240> see<00:02:40.300> here<00:02:40.540> swimming

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
they so as you can see here swimming

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.300 
they so as you can see here swimming
around<00:02:41.020> in<00:02:41.200> there

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
around in there

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.390 
around in there
absolutely<00:02:43.000> gorgeous<00:02:43.180> fish<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:44.100> with<00:02:45.100> most

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
absolutely gorgeous fish and with most

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.180 
absolutely gorgeous fish and with most
Yuri<00:02:46.390> hayleen<00:02:46.810> fish<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.920> is<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
Yuri hayleen fish and that is the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.190 
Yuri hayleen fish and that is the
correct<00:02:48.520> terminology<00:02:48.820> rather<00:02:49.540> than<00:02:49.810> brackish

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
correct terminology rather than brackish

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.930 
correct terminology rather than brackish
finish<00:02:50.560> there's<00:02:50.770> no<00:02:50.950> such<00:02:51.280> thing<00:02:51.700> as<00:02:51.730> an

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
finish there's no such thing as an

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.720 
finish there's no such thing as an
actual<00:02:52.150> brackish<00:02:52.600> animal<00:02:53.160> there<00:02:54.160> are<00:02:54.280> animals

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
actual brackish animal there are animals

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.940 
actual brackish animal there are animals
that<00:02:54.880> can<00:02:55.120> live<00:02:55.270> in<00:02:55.330> brackish<00:02:55.900> conditions<00:02:56.470> and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
that can live in brackish conditions and

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.890 
that can live in brackish conditions and
those<00:02:57.520> animals<00:02:57.970> are<00:02:58.090> called<00:02:58.210> Yuri<00:02:58.510> Helin

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
those animals are called Yuri Helin

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.020 
those animals are called Yuri Helin
animals<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.560> I'll<00:02:59.620> get<00:02:59.800> into<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.030> later

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
animals and I'll get into that later

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.540 
animals and I'll get into that later
when<00:03:01.330> I<00:03:01.360> talk<00:03:01.480> about<00:03:01.890> brackish<00:03:02.890> water<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
when I talk about brackish water and the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.340 
when I talk about brackish water and the
chemistry<00:03:03.910> going<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.690> how<00:03:04.780> fish<00:03:05.080> deal

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
chemistry going on and how fish deal

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.160 
chemistry going on and how fish deal
with<00:03:05.590> being<00:03:05.800> in<00:03:06.480> changing<00:03:07.480> conditions<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:08.020> so

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
with being in changing conditions and so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.420 
with being in changing conditions and so
on<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.470> forth<00:03:08.710> like<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.920> said<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.400> just

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
on and so forth like I said this is just

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.590 
on and so forth like I said this is just
going<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.670> be<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.820> little<00:03:10.000> introduction<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.480> my

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
going to be a little introduction to my

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.920 
going to be a little introduction to my
tank<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:12.760> had<00:03:12.910> these<00:03:13.060> animals<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.750> went

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
tank so I had these animals and I went

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.450 
tank so I had these animals and I went
ahead<00:03:13.990> and<00:03:14.170> put<00:03:14.290> them<00:03:14.410> in<00:03:14.500> there<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:15.010> being

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
ahead and put them in there and being

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.030 
ahead and put them in there and being
Geary<00:03:15.790> hayleen<00:03:16.150> animals<00:03:16.630> they<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.950> do

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
Geary hayleen animals they just do

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.880 
Geary hayleen animals they just do
better<00:03:18.190> when<00:03:18.580> they're<00:03:18.730> in<00:03:19.380> brackish<00:03:20.380> water<00:03:20.620> or

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
better when they're in brackish water or

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.890 
better when they're in brackish water or
at<00:03:21.040> least<00:03:21.190> very<00:03:21.340> hard<00:03:21.610> water<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.510> hard<00:03:22.720> water

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
at least very hard water and hard water

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.390 
at least very hard water and hard water
in<00:03:23.110> brackish<00:03:23.380> water<00:03:23.590> are<00:03:23.710> not<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:23.950> same<00:03:24.070> again

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
in brackish water are not the same again

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.140 
in brackish water are not the same again
I'll<00:03:24.520> get<00:03:24.640> into<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.470> later<00:03:26.470> as<00:03:26.950> well<00:03:27.160> this

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
I'll get into that later as well this

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.970 
I'll get into that later as well this
will<00:03:28.300> all<00:03:28.390> tie<00:03:28.600> into<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:29.080> series<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.560> videos<00:03:29.800> I'm

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
will all tie into a series of videos I'm

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.800 
will all tie into a series of videos I'm
going<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.220> do<00:03:30.370> about<00:03:30.670> water<00:03:31.090> hardness<00:03:31.390> total

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
going to do about water hardness total

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.040 
going to do about water hardness total
dissolved<00:03:32.170> solids<00:03:32.230> water<00:03:32.920> chemistry<00:03:33.220> etc<00:03:34.050> so

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
dissolved solids water chemistry etc so

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.330 
dissolved solids water chemistry etc so
we<00:03:35.140> will<00:03:35.290> get<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.470> all<00:03:35.500> that<00:03:35.620> kind<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:35.980> more

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
we will get to all that kind of more

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.820 
we will get to all that kind of more
complicated<00:03:36.580> stuff<00:03:36.940> later<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:38.530> I've<00:03:38.590> got<00:03:38.740> the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
complicated stuff later so I've got the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
most recent addition to this tank and

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.659 
most recent addition to this tank and
that<00:04:48.490> is<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> high<00:04:48.880> fin<00:04:49.919> platy<00:04:50.919> is<00:04:51.280> what<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.580> was

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
that is a high fin platy is what it was

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.450 
that is a high fin platy is what it was
sold<00:04:51.940> as<00:04:52.150> but<00:04:52.660> I'm<00:04:52.990> not<00:04:53.440> sure<00:04:53.830> whether<00:04:54.130> it's<00:04:54.400> a

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
sold as but I'm not sure whether it's a

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.890 
sold as but I'm not sure whether it's a
play<00:04:54.639> or<00:04:54.880> Miley<00:04:55.300> at<00:04:55.419> first<00:04:55.630> I<00:04:55.750> was<00:04:55.870> thinking

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
play or Miley at first I was thinking

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.050 
play or Miley at first I was thinking
maybe<00:04:56.289> it<00:04:56.470> was<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.620> Molly<00:04:56.889> but<00:04:57.340> now<00:04:57.490> I'm<00:04:57.669> tending

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
maybe it was a Molly but now I'm tending

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.310 
maybe it was a Molly but now I'm tending
to<00:04:58.180> think<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.479> does<00:04:58.600> look<00:04:58.750> more<00:04:58.900> like<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.050> platy

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
to think it does look more like a platy

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.379 
to think it does look more like a platy
they're<00:05:00.100> so<00:05:00.250> closely<00:05:00.490> related<00:05:00.669> it's<00:05:01.150> really

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
they're so closely related it's really

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.540 
they're so closely related it's really
hard<00:05:01.570> to<00:05:01.690> tell<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:02.169> got<00:05:02.949> it<00:05:03.039> at<00:05:03.130> a<00:05:03.160> big<00:05:03.310> chain

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
hard to tell I got it at a big chain

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.040 
hard to tell I got it at a big chain
store<00:05:03.820> so<00:05:04.090> who<00:05:04.210> knows<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.539> it<00:05:04.630> was<00:05:04.720> labeled

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
store so who knows that it was labeled

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.290 
store so who knows that it was labeled
accurately<00:05:05.530> so<00:05:06.220> again<00:05:06.460> I'm<00:05:06.639> just<00:05:06.669> gonna<00:05:07.030> kind

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
accurately so again I'm just gonna kind

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.879 
accurately so again I'm just gonna kind
of<00:05:07.389> go<00:05:07.510> with<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.750> idea<00:05:07.960> that<00:05:08.200> that's<00:05:08.470> a<00:05:08.590> mixed

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
of go with the idea that that's a mixed

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.320 
of go with the idea that that's a mixed
live<00:05:09.099> bearer<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.700> I'm<00:05:09.789> not<00:05:09.910> really<00:05:10.120> gonna

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
live bearer and I'm not really gonna

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.820 
live bearer and I'm not really gonna
worry<00:05:10.570> about<00:05:10.690> its<00:05:11.020> genetics<00:05:11.440> it's<00:05:11.590> just<00:05:11.740> a

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
worry about its genetics it's just a

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.730 
worry about its genetics it's just a
cool<00:05:11.979> fish<00:05:12.220> in<00:05:12.370> my<00:05:12.460> tank<00:05:12.639> I<00:05:12.820> like<00:05:13.030> it<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:14.560> other

that's just a little look at it I do
have<00:06:33.680> plants<00:06:34.040> in<00:06:34.100> there<00:06:34.280> as<00:06:34.370> you<00:06:34.430> can<00:06:34.520> see<00:06:34.640> I've

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
have plants in there as you can see I've

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.880 
have plants in there as you can see I've
had<00:06:35.090> some<00:06:35.240> questions<00:06:35.600> about<00:06:35.750> having<00:06:36.530> plants

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
had some questions about having plants

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.980 
had some questions about having plants
in<00:06:37.010> a<00:06:37.070> brackish<00:06:37.400> tank<00:06:37.640> that<00:06:38.300> obviously<00:06:38.780> can<00:06:38.960> be

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
in a brackish tank that obviously can be

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.690 
in a brackish tank that obviously can be
done<00:06:39.290> if<00:06:39.530> you<00:06:39.560> know<00:06:39.740> what<00:06:39.890> plans<00:06:40.100> to<00:06:40.310> use<00:06:40.490> and

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
done if you know what plans to use and

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.680 
done if you know what plans to use and
if<00:06:40.760> you<00:06:40.790> know<00:06:40.940> how<00:06:41.060> to<00:06:41.150> acclimate<00:06:41.540> them

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
if you know how to acclimate them

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.180 
if you know how to acclimate them
properly<00:06:42.050> that's<00:06:42.380> something<00:06:42.740> again<00:06:42.950> I<00:06:42.980> will

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
properly that's something again I will

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.770 
properly that's something again I will
go<00:06:43.280> into<00:06:43.630> in<00:06:44.630> more<00:06:44.690> detail<00:06:45.140> later<00:06:46.420> and<00:06:47.420> then<00:06:47.660> of

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
go into in more detail later and then of

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.890 
go into in more detail later and then of
course<00:06:47.810> I<00:06:48.050> have<00:06:48.200> the<00:06:48.380> ghost<00:06:49.190> rope<00:06:49.460> in<00:06:49.580> there

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
course I have the ghost rope in there

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.010 
course I have the ghost rope in there
and<00:06:50.900> I<00:06:51.050> am<00:06:51.260> working<00:06:51.500> when<00:06:51.800> I<00:06:51.830> am<00:06:52.010> breeding

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
and I am working when I am breeding

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.080 
and I am working when I am breeding
Gerry<00:06:54.020> shrimp<00:06:54.320> and<00:06:54.830> once<00:06:55.370> the<00:06:55.580> cherry<00:06:55.850> shrimp

Gerry shrimp and once the cherry shrimp

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.090 
Gerry shrimp and once the cherry shrimp
start<00:06:56.960> breeding<00:06:57.170> and<00:06:57.500> I've<00:06:57.560> got<00:06:57.740> enough<00:06:57.980> of

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
start breeding and I've got enough of

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
start breeding and I've got enough of
and<00:06:58.220> then<00:06:58.310> I<00:06:58.400> can<00:06:58.550> start<00:06:58.700> spreading<00:06:58.910> them

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
and then I can start spreading them

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.880 
and then I can start spreading them
around<00:06:59.330> I<00:06:59.720> will<00:07:00.200> be<00:07:00.320> throwing<00:07:00.500> some<00:07:00.650> cherry

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
around I will be throwing some cherry

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.260 
around I will be throwing some cherry
shrimp<00:07:01.040> in<00:07:01.250> there<00:07:01.340> too<00:07:01.550> and<00:07:01.790> I'll<00:07:01.880> see<00:07:02.060> how

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 
shrimp in there too and I'll see how

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.040 
shrimp in there too and I'll see how
they<00:07:02.720> can<00:07:02.780> evade

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.839 

or<00:07:06.169> we'll<00:07:06.620> see<00:07:06.770> how<00:07:06.919> long<00:07:07.069> it<00:07:07.280> takes<00:07:07.460> them<00:07:07.610> to

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:07.849 
or we'll see how long it takes them to

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:09.399 
or we'll see how long it takes them to
adapt<00:07:08.090> to<00:07:08.120> being<00:07:08.569> in<00:07:08.690> brackish<00:07:08.990> water<00:07:09.199> that'll

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:09.409 
adapt to being in brackish water that'll

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:11.200 
adapt to being in brackish water that'll
be<00:07:09.560> an<00:07:09.620> interesting<00:07:09.800> experiment<00:07:10.220> in<00:07:10.759> and<00:07:11.150> of

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.210 
be an interesting experiment in and of

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.960 
be an interesting experiment in and of
itself<00:07:11.770> I've<00:07:12.770> also<00:07:12.919> changed<00:07:13.190> the<00:07:13.490> filtration

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:13.970 
itself I've also changed the filtration

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.050 
itself I've also changed the filtration
on<00:07:14.479> this<00:07:14.720> tank<00:07:15.280> recently<00:07:16.280> gotten<00:07:16.759> it<00:07:16.849> cleaned

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
on this tank recently gotten it cleaned

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.909 
on this tank recently gotten it cleaned
up<00:07:17.210> made<00:07:17.449> a<00:07:17.479> few<00:07:17.659> adjustments<00:07:17.750> so<00:07:18.650> that's

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 
up made a few adjustments so that's

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:20.140 
up made a few adjustments so that's
something<00:07:19.159> I'll<00:07:19.340> go<00:07:19.460> over<00:07:19.580> later<00:07:19.729> I<00:07:19.940> want<00:07:20.090> to
