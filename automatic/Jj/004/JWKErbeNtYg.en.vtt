Shoni now I'm staying on the knife has

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.340 
Shoni now I'm staying on the knife has
the<00:01:58.920> retractable<00:01:59.670> landing<00:02:00.240> gear<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.229> can

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the retractable landing gear as you can

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469 
the retractable landing gear as you can
see<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:02.880> much<00:02:03.090> clips

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
see here so that just pretty much clips

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.380 
see here so that just pretty much clips
up<00:02:03.630> into<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.030> go

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
up into here and to get it out you go

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.869 
up into here and to get it out you go
just<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.869> thumbnail<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
just get your thumbnail in there and

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.640 
just get your thumbnail in there and
pull<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.560> that's<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:11.250> one

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.059 

next<00:02:14.250> feature<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:16.970> air<00:02:17.970> brakes<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.540> guess

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
next feature it's the air brakes I guess

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.150 
next feature it's the air brakes I guess
they<00:02:20.069> call<00:02:22.010> they<00:02:23.010> pop<00:02:23.250> out<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.890> is

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
they call they pop out like so this is

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.440 
they call they pop out like so this is
used<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.600> actually<00:02:27.810> slow<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.470> aircraft<00:02:28.830> down

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
used to actually slow the aircraft down

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.650 
used to actually slow the aircraft down
the<00:02:30.450> ship<00:02:30.660> down<00:02:31.190> or<00:02:32.190> even<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.700> they<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.420> one

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
the ship down or even if they have one

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.410 
the ship down or even if they have one
up<00:02:33.840> pretty<00:02:34.590> much<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.459> can<00:02:35.640> pitch<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
up pretty much so they can pitch the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.810 
up pretty much so they can pitch the
aircraft<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.110> bit<00:02:37.290> make<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.250> turn<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.610> bit

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
aircraft a bit make it turn a bit

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.780 
aircraft a bit make it turn a bit
quicker<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:41.510> now<00:02:42.510> I'm<00:02:43.489> number<00:02:44.489> little

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
quicker like so now I'm number little

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.360 
quicker like so now I'm number little
fetcher<00:02:45.239> taught<00:02:45.450> yes<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.260> removed<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.830> rear

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
fetcher taught yes you removed the rear

part<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> gun<00:02:48.090> if<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.290> want<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> set<00:02:49.680> up

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
part of the gun if you want to set up

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.650 
part of the gun if you want to set up
those<00:02:49.980> scenes<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.760> something<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.300> if<00:02:51.540> you

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
those scenes or something like if you

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.180 
those scenes or something like if you
had<00:02:51.750> too<00:02:51.870> few<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.230> these<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.650> actually<00:02:52.980> set<00:02:53.160> up

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
had too few of these you actually set up

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.300 
had too few of these you actually set up
a<00:02:53.310> hot<00:02:54.180> scene<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.380> hangar<00:02:55.680> bay<00:02:55.860> or<00:02:56.100> maybe

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
a hot scene and the hangar bay or maybe

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.880 
a hot scene and the hangar bay or maybe
and<00:02:56.610> have<00:02:56.820> these<00:02:57.000> off<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.440> ship<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.860> be

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
and have these off and the ship can be

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.490 
and have these off and the ship can be
actually<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.400> repaired<00:02:59.850> or<00:03:00.030> something<00:03:00.500> just

actually get repaired or something just
one<00:03:01.680> little<00:03:02.610> feature<00:03:02.910> has<00:03:03.300> broke<00:03:03.600> do<00:03:04.019> any<00:03:04.110> of

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
one little feature has broke do any of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.520 
one little feature has broke do any of
that<00:03:04.459> that<00:03:05.459> basically<00:03:06.209> basically<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:07.290> puts

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
that that basically basically just puts

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.020 
that that basically basically just puts
us<00:03:07.620> back<00:03:07.800> into<00:03:08.010> position<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.640> say<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:11.030> go

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
us back into position like I say and go

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.600 
us back into position like I say and go
to<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.480> toy<00:03:13.440> gun<00:03:14.150> re<00:03:15.150> gun<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.230> cable<00:03:16.650> gun<00:03:16.829> now

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
to the toy gun re gun so a cable gun now

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.400 
to the toy gun re gun so a cable gun now
this<00:03:17.760> is<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.090> small<00:03:18.360> version<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.079> now<00:03:19.350> you

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
this is the small version of it now you

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.960 
this is the small version of it now you
can<00:03:19.620> actually<00:03:19.769> interchange<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.549> with<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
can actually interchange it with the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.960 
can actually interchange it with the
larger<00:03:21.840> version<00:03:21.989> which<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.590> actually

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
larger version which you can actually

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.880 
larger version which you can actually
shoot<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.269> cable<00:03:24.750> off<00:03:25.079> but<00:03:25.320> I'll<00:03:25.440> show<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.709> that

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
shoot a cable off but I'll show you that

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.979 
shoot a cable off but I'll show you that
and<00:03:26.040> see<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:27.480> does<00:03:27.750> rotate<00:03:32.930> now<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
and see and that does rotate now the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.660 
and see and that does rotate now the
figures<00:03:34.500> in<00:03:34.709> here<00:03:34.920> fit<00:03:35.280> quite<00:03:35.610> nicely<00:03:37.489> open<00:03:38.489> up

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
figures in here fit quite nicely open up

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.520 
figures in here fit quite nicely open up
the<00:03:39.630> cockpit<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.590> canopy<00:03:40.890> opens<00:03:41.370> up

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
the cockpit and the canopy opens up

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.050 
the cockpit and the canopy opens up
enough<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.829> gives<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.160> room<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.430> place

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
enough so it gives you room to place

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.270 
enough so it gives you room to place
your<00:03:45.209> figures<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.690> as<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.799> can<00:03:46.920> see<00:03:47.070> I've<00:03:47.160> got

a<00:04:18.180> very<00:04:18.870> nicely<00:04:19.169> detailed<00:04:19.620> ship<00:04:20.519> that<00:04:20.730> would

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
a very nicely detailed ship that would

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.600 
a very nicely detailed ship that would
have<00:04:21.090> done<00:04:22.880> so<00:04:23.880> it's<00:04:24.030> about<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.480> for<00:04:25.220> that

have done so it's about it for that
now<00:04:26.820> I'll<00:04:27.030> swap<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.960> around<00:04:27.990> with<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:29.180> firing

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
now I'll swap it around with the firing

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.200 
now I'll swap it around with the firing
guns<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:31.080> it<00:04:31.380> comes<00:04:32.220> with<00:04:32.340> two<00:04:32.639> of<00:04:32.669> them<00:04:32.940> and

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
guns so it comes with two of them and

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.990 
guns so it comes with two of them and
the<00:04:34.080> rear<00:04:34.880> tow<00:04:35.880> gun<00:04:36.200> cable<00:04:37.200> gun<00:04:37.580> all<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.790> got

the rear tow gun cable gun all you got

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.600 
the rear tow gun cable gun all you got
to<00:04:39.120> do<00:04:39.240> here<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.780> I'm<00:04:40.910> these<00:04:42.290> pull<00:04:43.290> out<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.860> say

little<00:05:51.430> hanging<00:05:51.700> around<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:53.260> then<00:05:53.440> you<00:05:53.560> just

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
little hanging around and then you just

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.400 
little hanging around and then you just
yeah<00:05:56.260> that's<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.620> bit<00:05:56.770> hard<00:05:56.980> to<00:05:57.930> just<00:05:58.930> shove<00:05:59.230> all

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
yeah that's a bit hard to just shove all

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:07.050 
yeah that's a bit hard to just shove all
that<00:05:59.620> inside<00:06:00.100> a<00:06:00.130> lot<00:06:00.460> so<00:06:02.460> neatly<00:06:03.460> though<00:06:06.060> you

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
that inside a lot so neatly though you

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.130 
that inside a lot so neatly though you
can<00:06:07.240> hide<00:06:07.480> it<00:06:07.660> a<00:06:07.690> little<00:06:07.810> bit<00:06:07.960> away<00:06:12.660> and<00:06:13.660> that

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
can hide it a little bit away and that

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.750 
can hide it a little bit away and that
just<00:06:14.380> clips<00:06:14.620> like<00:06:14.860> that<00:06:15.070> and<00:06:15.280> that<00:06:15.340> hides<00:06:15.550> it

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
just clips like that and that hides it

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.730 
just clips like that and that hides it
away<00:06:15.820> so<00:06:16.360> you<00:06:16.420> haven't<00:06:16.660> got<00:06:16.690> all<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.110> Tyco
