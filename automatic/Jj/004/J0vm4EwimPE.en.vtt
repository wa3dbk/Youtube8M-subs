00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:05.020
 so why do women live longer than men 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:24.560
 because so it is necessary so honestly so 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:30.079
 rightly rightly I will 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.859
 act for both logic and in general when 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:36.829
 nobody drips on your brain 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:39.039
 easy to live longer in my opinion very 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.149
 interesting but he's the wrong minus a little 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.609
 just up there is a theory 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.679
 if serious theory in general I consider 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:49.969
 that a woman here lives longer because 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:52.070
 they are stupid like that is women all 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.019
 they do it for a very long time, that is, they are very 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.649
 long going much longer than 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:00.350
 men eat very long for very long 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.570
 devote time to some kind of bullshit which 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.110
 river he does not need too and 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.060
 and live longer and that's the father they need them 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.579
 need more time for everything just 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.579
 man he finished doing and now he died 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.450
 this 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.710
 wait he is so i can't wait 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.960
 man die off some more time 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.160
 such types well soon you are here now 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.150
 now in paradise in the car waiting for me 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.150
 like let them come 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:44.939
 so before the mosquito I think this is something from 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.939
 genetics something related to exactly 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.340
 physical and internally physical 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.649
 properties of the body of women of a number 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.420
 so I'm on the right track and that means they live 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.470
 longer because they have cells and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:10.679
 neighboring healing body function 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:16.500
 that is, immunity is stronger and in principle 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:19.410
 everything inside them is also more powerful 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.860
 stop left this is the right answer 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.860
 this
