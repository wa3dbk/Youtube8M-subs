00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
My recent video about
Daniel Radcliffe’s attempts to speak German

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.280
has raised a few interesting questions.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.600
If you haven’t yet seen that video,
click here if you have annotations enabled,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.680
otherwise you’ll find a link
in the video description.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.000
Okay? Cool.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.360
Now, when I translated the German word “Besteck”,
I said that it was “cutlery”,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.280
or, for Americans, “flatware”.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.720
I did this in part because
a lot of you, my viewers,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.840
are actually Germans trying to learn English;

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.360
and so, whenever the script allows,
which isn’t very often,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.400
I like to give a few alternatives.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.280
But it turns out there are a quite a few Americans
who have never even heard of flatware.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.880
A few call it “silverware”,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.800
but it seems that “cutlery”
is very well understood in America.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.080
So, that’s good: I’ve learned something useful,
so thank you for your comments.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.520
There was a word that
I couldn’t positively identify.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.720
I said it was probably “Teufel”, but I’d never
heard a German actually use it in that way.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.880
And sure enough, one German said
that sometimes he did.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.520
I suggested that what might
have been intended was “Pfui Deiwel”,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.800
and was then asked if instead of “Deiwel”
I shouldn’t have said “Deibel” or “Deifel”.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.440
Well, all of those are actually
perfectly legitimate,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.680
and to a phoneticist they’re all very closely
related to each other and to the word “Teufel”.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.040
In fact, you can almost think of them as
different ways of pronouncing the same thing.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.560
They’re also all very closely related
to the English word “devil”.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.600
To the person who traced the word “devil” back to
a Proto-Indo-European word meaning “angel”:

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.760
I looked it up, and I’m afraid
I’m going to have to disappoint you.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.560
It comes from the Greek word “diabolos”,
which means “slanderer” or “accuser”.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.880
And that is a direct translation
of the Hebrew “Satan”,

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.680
who is the prosecutor in the heavenly court,
in which God is the presiding judge.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.720
However, one of you —
and thank you so much for this —

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880
suggested that it might have been a word
that I’d never even heard of:

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.440
“Töffel”, which means “fool” or “idiot”.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.840
This is listed in the German standard dictionary
“Duden” as a rural expression,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.160
which is basically Duden’s way of saying
that it only appears in certain dialects.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.680
Duden also has a long list of suggested synonyms,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.000
so take your pick.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.280
Remember you can always send me
a postcard at this address.
