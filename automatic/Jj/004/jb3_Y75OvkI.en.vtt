00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
computer we constructed a design that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.710 
computer we constructed a design that
one<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> will<00:01:17.280> eight<00:01:17.400> down<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.450> will<00:01:18.570> leave

one you will eight down it will leave
some<00:01:18.900> open<00:01:19.170> areas<00:01:19.470> which<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.860> why<00:01:20.009> spray<00:01:20.340> paint

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
some open areas which is why spray paint

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.850 
some open areas which is why spray paint
black<00:01:22.189> then<00:01:23.189> when<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> remove<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> vinyls

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
turns out like this after that you want

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.850 
turns out like this after that you want
to<00:01:34.770> put<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> grip<00:01:35.790> tape

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.609
