00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
forces are all working right through the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.859 
forces are all working right through the
hips<00:00:17.800> into<00:00:18.010> the<00:00:18.189> top<00:00:18.490> of<00:00:18.520> the<00:00:18.700> head<00:00:19.000> and<00:00:19.270> I'm

the foot down you don't want to think

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.549 
the foot down you don't want to think
quick<00:00:35.980> you<00:00:36.489> don't<00:00:36.640> want<00:00:36.820> to<00:00:36.910> think<00:00:37.090> low<00:00:37.559> okay

quick you don't want to think low okay

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.740 
quick you don't want to think low okay
if<00:00:38.649> you<00:00:38.770> look<00:00:38.890> at<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.129> diagram<00:00:39.600> you're<00:00:40.600> going

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
if you look at the diagram you're going

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.970 
if you look at the diagram you're going
to<00:00:40.809> see<00:00:40.930> that<00:00:41.079> they're<00:00:41.290> based<00:00:41.620> on<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.860> same

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
to see that they're based on the same

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.250 
to see that they're based on the same
position<00:00:42.640> we<00:00:42.879> sold<00:00:43.120> this<00:00:43.270> other<00:00:43.480> film<00:00:43.749> of<00:00:43.960> Carl

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
the years they're going to become

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.880 
the years they're going to become
sharing<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.609> same<00:00:48.820> position<00:00:49.420> I<00:00:49.570> mean<00:00:49.809> I<00:00:49.960> I<00:00:50.289> do

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
sharing the same position I mean I I do

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.250 
sharing the same position I mean I I do
this<00:00:51.640> is<00:00:51.789> the<00:00:51.879> one<00:00:52.059> thing<00:00:52.239> I<00:00:52.390> kind<00:00:52.629> of<00:00:52.780> did<00:00:52.989> is<00:00:53.170> I

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
this is the one thing I kind of did is I

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.809 
this is the one thing I kind of did is I
put<00:00:53.499> the<00:00:53.620> start<00:00:53.920> together<00:00:54.129> to<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.199> could

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:56.819 
put the start together to so I could

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:00.360 
put the start together to so I could
exploit<00:00:57.819> the<00:00:58.300> 64<00:00:58.960> percent<00:00:59.379> acceleration<00:01:00.159> work

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
exploit the 64 percent acceleration work

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.700 
exploit the 64 percent acceleration work
you<00:01:01.089> know<00:01:01.210> where<00:01:01.449> I<00:01:01.480> took<00:01:01.749> advantage<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.379> what

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
you know where I took advantage of what

the start position shoulders are right
over<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.390> hand<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:08.350> head<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:08.740> natural

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
over the hand the head is a natural

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.250 
over the hand the head is a natural
alignment<00:01:09.610> with<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.000> shoulders<00:01:10.450> if<00:01:11.050> you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
alignment with the shoulders if you

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.350 
alignment with the shoulders if you
watch<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.950> lead<00:01:12.159> knee<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.760> comes<00:01:13.030> through<00:01:13.210> the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
watch the lead knee it comes through the

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.249 
watch the lead knee it comes through the
midline<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:15.370> arms<00:01:15.729> midline<00:01:16.659> or<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:16.960> little

when that happened they came up to the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.569 
when that happened they came up to the
right<00:01:40.450> angle<00:01:40.840> okay<00:01:41.170> but<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.560> always<00:01:42.070> start<00:01:42.340> with

right angle okay but I always start with

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.639 
right angle okay but I always start with
this<00:01:42.909> position<00:01:43.119> head<00:01:43.869> and<00:01:44.140> ankle<00:01:44.530> alignment

degree angle in it to give you maximum
power<00:02:02.590> speed<00:02:03.159> ratio<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:04.329> don't<00:02:04.509> want<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.719> put

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
power speed ratio you don't want to put

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.380 
power speed ratio you don't want to put
them<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.560> strongest<00:02:06.520> lady<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.149> back

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
them the strongest lady in the back

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.029 
them the strongest lady in the back
because<00:02:07.840> that's<00:02:08.050> not<00:02:08.200> what<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.470> back<00:02:08.649> leg<00:02:08.890> is

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
because that's not what the back leg is

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.740 
because that's not what the back leg is
supposed<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.369> do<00:02:09.610> all<00:02:10.570> right

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
supposed to do all right

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.660 
supposed to do all right
so<00:02:11.050> see<00:02:11.410> how<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.620> shank<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.150> front<00:02:13.750> leg<00:02:13.960> is

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
so see how the shank of the front leg is

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.300 
so see how the shank of the front leg is
90<00:02:15.670> degrees<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.240> ground<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.780> right<00:02:17.020> here

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
90 degrees to the ground this right here

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.100 
90 degrees to the ground this right here
yes<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.610> mean<00:02:18.910> parallel<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.690> ground<00:02:19.870> that's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
yes I mean parallel to the ground that's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.670 
yes I mean parallel to the ground that's
a<00:02:20.230> good<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:22.239> know<00:02:22.269> if<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.629> look<00:02:22.900> at

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
a good you know if you look at

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.860 
a good you know if you look at
a<00:02:23.709> start<00:02:24.159> that's<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.849> good<00:02:25.030> indication<00:02:25.480> it's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
a start that's a good indication it's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.750 
a start that's a good indication it's
pretty<00:02:26.109> well<00:02:26.319> balanced<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.430> knee<00:02:27.609> of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
pretty well balanced and the knee of

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.009 
pretty well balanced and the knee of
this<00:02:27.939> thing<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.269> going<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.569> come<00:02:28.719> to<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
this thing is going to come to the

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.369 
this thing is going to come to the
midline<00:02:29.439> of<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:30.310> arm<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.900> have<00:02:32.079> to<00:02:32.230> adjust

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
midline of the arm you have to adjust

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.500 
midline of the arm you have to adjust
that<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.980> think<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> start<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.909> not<00:02:34.060> something

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
that I think the start is not something

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.920 
that I think the start is not something
that<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.780> say<00:02:35.019> okay<00:02:35.620> all<00:02:35.769> new<00:02:35.950> kids<00:02:36.219> do<00:02:36.400> this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
that you say okay all new kids do this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.410 
that you say okay all new kids do this
it's<00:02:37.930> better<00:02:38.250> every<00:02:39.250> kid<00:02:39.489> will<00:02:39.939> have<00:02:40.150> this

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
it's better every kid will have this

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720 
it's better every kid will have this
alignment<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.439> you<00:02:41.620> know<00:02:41.739> because<00:02:42.459> this

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
alignment but you know because this

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.240 
alignment but you know because this
torso<00:02:43.060> length<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.959> front<00:02:44.379> knee<00:02:44.469> will<00:02:44.829> be<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
torso length that front knee will be a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.720 
torso length that front knee will be a
little<00:02:45.579> bit<00:02:45.849> further<00:02:46.150> back<00:02:46.480> or<00:02:47.129> not<00:02:48.129> forward

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
little bit further back or not forward

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.830 
little bit further back or not forward
you<00:02:48.819> don't<00:02:49.000> want<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.269> poor<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.629> is<00:02:49.719> either

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
you don't want it poor it is either

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
going to be to the midline or it's going

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.770 
going to be to the midline or it's going
to<00:02:51.519> be<00:02:51.579> a<00:02:51.670> little<00:02:51.909> bit<00:02:52.030> further<00:02:52.299> back

to<00:03:46.840> get<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.079> better<00:03:47.349> angle<00:03:47.949> of<00:03:48.189> the<00:03:48.729> shank<00:03:49.260> at<00:03:50.260> a

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
to get a better angle of the shank at a

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.369 
to get a better angle of the shank at a
45<00:03:50.919> degree<00:03:51.099> angle<00:03:51.629> see<00:03:52.629> that<00:03:52.810> angle<00:03:53.229> right

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
45 degree angle see that angle right

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.020 
45 degree angle see that angle right
there<00:03:53.650> that's<00:03:53.859> the<00:03:54.040> angle<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:54.639> you're<00:03:54.849> going

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
there that's the angle that you're going

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.520 
there that's the angle that you're going
to<00:03:55.090> fire<00:03:55.329> it<00:03:55.359> out<00:03:55.540> if<00:03:55.720> you're<00:03:55.989> high<00:03:56.199> on<00:03:56.379> the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
to fire it out if you're high on the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.979 
to fire it out if you're high on the
block<00:03:56.799> then<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.669> angle<00:03:58.269> of<00:03:58.359> that<00:03:58.509> lay<00:03:58.720> the

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
block then that angle of that lay the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.530 
block then that angle of that lay the
shank<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.530> going<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.709> be<00:03:59.889> too<00:04:00.519> low<00:04:00.849> it's<00:04:01.449> going

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
shank is going to be too low it's going

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.280 
shank is going to be too low it's going
to<00:04:01.659> be<00:04:01.750> less<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.139> an<00:04:02.259> angle<00:04:02.909> so<00:04:03.909> we<00:04:04.120> come<00:04:04.389> up<00:04:04.569> to

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
to be less of an angle so we come up to

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.559 
to be less of an angle so we come up to
the<00:04:05.439> point<00:04:05.739> where<00:04:05.979> you<00:04:06.129> may<00:04:06.310> have<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.849> little

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
the point where you may have a little

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.390 
the point where you may have a little
bit<00:04:07.720> bored<00:04:08.019> now<00:04:08.290> you've<00:04:08.590> got<00:04:08.829> to<00:04:08.979> watch<00:04:09.370> your

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
bit bored now you've got to watch your

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.520 
bit bored now you've got to watch your
ease<00:04:09.759> a<00:04:09.790> little<00:04:10.060> bit<00:04:10.329> but<00:04:10.870> but<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.319> weight

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
ease a little bit but but the weight

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.189 
ease a little bit but but the weight
balance<00:04:12.069> is<00:04:12.220> between<00:04:12.419> between<00:04:13.419> the<00:04:13.720> hands

to this set you don't want him to lean

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.840 
to this set you don't want him to lean
forward<00:04:33.660> early<00:04:34.410> when<00:04:35.160> he<00:04:35.250> comes<00:04:35.520> up<00:04:35.700> to<00:04:35.730> the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
very top of the set position that

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.510 
very top of the set position that
weights<00:04:40.260> going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.590> go<00:04:40.710> forward<00:04:41.100> from<00:04:41.340> the

this<00:04:44.970> knuckle<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.690> little<00:04:46.320> bit<00:04:46.470> there<00:04:46.710> so<00:04:46.889> he

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
this knuckle a little bit there so he

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.430 
this knuckle a little bit there so he
has<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.790> little<00:04:48.210> bit<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.450> displacement<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.290> the

center of gravity in the direction he's

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.400 
center of gravity in the direction he's
going<00:04:51.150> but<00:04:51.480> you<00:04:51.600> don't<00:04:51.750> want<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:52.020> lot<00:04:52.230> of

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
going but you don't want a lot of

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.100 
going but you don't want a lot of
because<00:04:53.130> if<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.400> have<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.580> lot<00:04:53.880> of

because if you have a lot of

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
because if you have a lot of
displacement<00:04:55.110> he's<00:04:55.350> going<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.590> fall<00:04:55.889> out<00:04:56.100> of

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
displacement he's going to fall out of

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
the blocks and it's harder to get up at

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.100 
the blocks and it's harder to get up at
a<00:05:01.560> 45<00:05:02.190> degree<00:05:02.370> angle<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:03.480> find<00:05:03.840> there's<00:05:04.020> a

a 45 degree angle so find there's a
