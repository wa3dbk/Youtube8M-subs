warfare<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.330> know<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.659> game<00:01:33.930> plays<00:01:34.229> over

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
warfare and I know this game plays over

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.399 
warfare and I know this game plays over
black<00:01:34.770> ops<00:01:35.010> 2<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.540> were<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.080> left

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
black ops 2 and if you were if they left

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.990 
black ops 2 and if you were if they left
the<00:01:37.680> gameplay<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.190> be<00:01:38.340> over<00:01:38.520> black<00:01:38.700> ops<00:01:38.880> 2

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the gameplay would be over black ops 2

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.969 
the gameplay would be over black ops 2
you<00:01:39.120> think<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> would<00:01:39.840> remember<00:01:39.870> cups<00:01:40.740> 3

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
because black ops 3 isn't out yet and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.850

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.000 
and then the average would be about
30,000<00:03:47.470> at<00:03:47.620> 20,000<00:03:48.600> players<00:03:49.600> and<00:03:50.020> that's<00:03:50.800> if

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
30,000 at 20,000 players and that's if

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.770 
30,000 at 20,000 players and that's if
they're<00:03:51.190> not<00:03:51.340> all<00:03:51.490> trihard<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.270> you<00:03:52.330> know<00:03:52.570> I

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
they're not all trihard so you know I

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.070 
they're not all trihard so you know I
mean<00:03:53.610> other<00:03:54.610> consoles<00:03:55.120> obviously<00:03:55.690> are<00:03:55.840> at<00:03:56.020> a

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
mean other consoles obviously are at a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.220 
mean other consoles obviously are at a
disadvantage<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.890> ps3<00:03:57.280> in<00:03:57.820> my<00:03:58.230> opinion

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
disadvantage in ps3 in my opinion

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.590 
disadvantage in ps3 in my opinion
because<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.770> own<00:04:00.100> one<00:04:00.130> I<00:04:00.550> play<00:04:00.820> is<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.210> bit<00:04:01.570> easier

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
because I own one I play is a bit easier

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.620 
because I own one I play is a bit easier
on<00:04:02.050> some<00:04:02.650> certain<00:04:03.310> games<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:03.850> believe<00:04:04.600> that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
on some certain games I believe that

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.170 
on some certain games I believe that
monomer<00:04:05.200> 43<00:04:05.500> was<00:04:05.650> easier<00:04:05.980> on<00:04:06.100> xbox<00:04:06.580> but<00:04:06.910> you

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
monomer 43 was easier on xbox but you

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.420 
monomer 43 was easier on xbox but you
know<00:04:07.300> that's<00:04:07.510> just<00:04:07.540> my<00:04:07.750> personal<00:04:08.230> opinion<00:04:08.440> and

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
know that's just my personal opinion and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.920 
know that's just my personal opinion and
that's<00:04:10.030> not<00:04:10.150> we're<00:04:10.360> really<00:04:10.540> talking<00:04:10.750> about

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
that's not we're really talking about

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.010 
that's not we're really talking about
what<00:04:11.200> we're<00:04:11.380> gonna<00:04:11.500> go<00:04:11.890> back<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.430> talking<00:04:12.610> to

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
what we're gonna go back to talking to

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.900 
what we're gonna go back to talking to
we're<00:04:14.020> gonna<00:04:14.140> go<00:04:14.530> back<00:04:14.800> to<00:04:15.070> talking<00:04:15.250> about<00:04:15.670> is

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
we're gonna go back to talking about is

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.949 
we're gonna go back to talking about is
um<00:04:16.859> advanced<00:04:17.859> warfare<00:04:17.980> and<00:04:18.609> like<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.480> said<00:04:19.540> I

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
um advanced warfare and like I said I

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.950 
um advanced warfare and like I said I
really<00:04:20.290> can't<00:04:21.040> wait<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.760> see<00:04:21.970> if<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:22.420> classic

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
really can't wait to see if this classic

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.860 
really can't wait to see if this classic
mode<00:04:23.170> /<00:04:23.620> endo<00:04:23.890> EXO<00:04:24.060> ability<00:04:25.060> mode<00:04:25.270> is<00:04:25.570> real

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
mode / endo EXO ability mode is real

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.790 
mode / endo EXO ability mode is real
because<00:04:26.410> if<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.540> I'll<00:04:28.540> actually<00:04:29.140> be

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
because if it is I'll actually be

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.660 
because if it is I'll actually be
tempted<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.430> buy

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
tempted to buy

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.300 
tempted to buy
this<00:04:30.880> game<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.480> grind<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.410> out<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:33.160> know

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
this game and grind it out and you know

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.200 
this game and grind it out and you know
stuff<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.670> that<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.790> this<00:04:36.790> gameplay<00:04:37.000> is

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
stuff like that so this gameplay is

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.200 
stuff like that so this gameplay is
actually<00:04:37.540> coming<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.900> close<00:04:39.180> one<00:04:40.180> more

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210
