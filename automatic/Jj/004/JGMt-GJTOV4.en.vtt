00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
scissors or a very sharp knife and the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.180 
scissors or a very sharp knife and the
idea<00:00:54.670> behind<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:55.149> is<00:00:55.210> to<00:00:55.570> cut<00:00:55.839> along<00:00:56.800> inside

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
idea behind it is to cut along inside

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.220 
idea behind it is to cut along inside
the<00:00:57.370> backbone<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.940> chicken<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.449> you<00:00:58.510> can

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
the backbone of the chicken and you can

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.259 
the backbone of the chicken and you can
kind<00:00:59.440> of<00:00:59.499> see<00:00:59.769> it<00:00:59.859> to<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.070> skin<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:00.670> that's

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
kind of see it to the skin and that's

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:13.179 
kind of see it to the skin and that's
what<00:01:01.449> we're<00:01:01.539> gonna<00:01:01.629> do<00:01:01.780> right<00:01:01.809> now

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.929 

and<00:01:13.610> again<00:01:13.820> as<00:01:13.969> I<00:01:14.090> said<00:01:14.149> just<00:01:14.390> save<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.939> back

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
and again as I said just save the back

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.240 
and again as I said just save the back
water<00:01:17.899> chicken<00:01:18.350> stock<00:01:20.259> makes<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.590> really<00:01:22.070> good

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
set that aside and you can start from

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.070 
set that aside and you can start from
here<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.240> flip<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.570> over<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.020> that's

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
here and just flip it over and that's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.810

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
but what I like doing is so I can get

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.040 
but what I like doing is so I can get
two<00:01:44.670> separate<00:01:45.000> halves<00:01:45.210> when<00:01:45.510> I<00:01:45.570> throw<00:01:45.900> it<00:01:45.960> on

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050
