of<00:00:29.220> asterisks<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.080> have<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.380> imagine

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
of asterisks there and I have to imagine

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.319 
of asterisks there and I have to imagine
the<00:00:32.099> reason<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.880> there's<00:00:33.210> no

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the reason for that is that there's no

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
the reason for that is that there's no
scientific<00:00:33.570> evidence<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.500> any<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
scientific evidence that any of that is

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.830 
scientific evidence that any of that is
true<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.550> love<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> packaging<00:00:36.600> looks

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
true I love that the packaging looks

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
just like a Sharpie package like Apple

95 milligrams which is like a Red Bull I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300 
95 milligrams which is like a Red Bull I
think<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.630> herbs<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.140> ginkgo<00:01:10.530> leaf<00:01:10.860> powder

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
think and herbs like ginkgo leaf powder

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
think and herbs like ginkgo leaf powder
uh<00:01:11.520> whenever<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> get<00:01:12.330> into<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> herbs<00:01:12.840> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
uh whenever you get into the herbs and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.450 
uh whenever you get into the herbs and
products<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> feeling<00:01:13.979> it's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
products like this I have a feeling it's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
products like this I have a feeling it's
probably<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:14.970> gonna<00:01:15.090> help<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.570> yeah

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
probably not gonna help that much yeah

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
probably not gonna help that much yeah
but<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.500> caffeine<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.549> thing<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.909> there's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
but it's caffeine the thing is there's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
but it's caffeine the thing is there's
really<00:01:18.299> no<00:01:18.810> reason<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.500> believe<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
really no reason to believe that this is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.190 
really no reason to believe that this is
any<00:01:20.580> better<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.509> than<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.930> taking

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
any better for you than just taking

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.499 
any better for you than just taking
vitamins<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.070> caffeine<00:01:23.490> normally<00:01:23.970> exactly<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
vitamins and caffeine normally exactly I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.539 
vitamins and caffeine normally exactly I
think<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> bit<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> placebo<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.920> if

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
think it's a bit of a placebo and if

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.280 
think it's a bit of a placebo and if
that<00:01:26.729> helps<00:01:27.000> some<00:01:27.119> people<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.689> more<00:01:28.110> power

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that helps some people then more power

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
that helps some people then more power
to<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> think<00:01:29.100> obviously<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.759> taking

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to you and I think obviously at taking

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
to you and I think obviously at taking
one<00:01:30.479> straight<00:01:30.750> dose<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.200> amount<00:01:31.500> of

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
one straight dose of that amount of

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.660 
one straight dose of that amount of
caffeine<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
caffeine I think it was like the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.649 
caffeine I think it was like the
equivalent<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.090> three<00:01:33.329> cups<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.600> coffee

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
equivalent of three cups of coffee

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
equivalent of three cups of coffee

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
being and waiting for to kick in you're

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.420 
being and waiting for to kick in you're
taking<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.350> once<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.070> you're

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
taking it all at once and then you're

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
taking it all at once and then you're
thinking<00:01:41.490> about<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.659> these<00:01:42.810> things<00:01:43.439> that

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
thinking about all all these things that

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.620 
thinking about all all these things that
are<00:01:43.710> working<00:01:43.860> my<00:01:44.100> system<00:01:44.430> yeah<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.149> study

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
are working my system yeah this study

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.760 
are working my system yeah this study
when<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.320> could<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.590> take<00:01:46.740> your

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
when really you could just take your

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.649 
when really you could just take your
vitamins<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> morning<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
vitamins in the morning and just to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.350 
vitamins in the morning and just to
drink<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> lot<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> healthy<00:01:49.829> yet<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
drink a lot a healthy yet and so and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
drink a lot a healthy yet and so and
that's<00:01:51.540> why<00:01:51.720> we're<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.020> bringing<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.680> up

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that's why we're really bringing it up

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
that's why we're really bringing it up
is<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> potential<00:01:54.000> danger<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.570> okay

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
is is the potential danger like okay

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.569 
is is the potential danger like okay
you're<00:01:55.229> probably<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:56.040> okay<00:01:56.369> it's

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
you're probably going to be okay it's

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.190 
you're probably going to be okay it's
caffeine<00:01:56.850> its<00:01:57.270> vitamins<00:01:57.570> most<00:01:57.899> people<00:01:58.140> in

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
caffeine its vitamins most people in

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.569 
caffeine its vitamins most people in
college<00:01:58.439> take<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> lot<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.890> caffeine<00:01:59.009> anyway

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
college take a lot of caffeine anyway

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.850 
college take a lot of caffeine anyway
but<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> difference<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.350> you're<00:02:01.590> it's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
but the difference is when you're it's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.950 
but the difference is when you're it's
the<00:02:02.040> time<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.700> Mickey<00:02:02.969> said<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.479> also<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the time as Mickey said but also the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.230 
the time as Mickey said but also the
fullness<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.710> comes<00:02:04.920> from<00:02:05.100> drinking<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.700> lot

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
fullness that comes from drinking a lot

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.670 
fullness that comes from drinking a lot
of<00:02:06.299> coffee<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.930> stuff<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.439> there's<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
of coffee and stuff like that there's a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.199 
of coffee and stuff like that there's a
limit<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.069> how<00:02:08.099> much<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.429> can<00:02:08.520> drink<00:02:08.580> because

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
limit to how much you can drink because

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.820 
limit to how much you can drink because
you<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.110> full<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.679> gives

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
you just get so full and it gives

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440 
you just get so full and it gives
indications<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:11.610> through<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:12.150> much<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
indications like through how much you

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.230 
indications like through how much you
have<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.569> urinate

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
have to urinate

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.880 
have to urinate
everything<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.960> makes<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.290> think<00:02:14.440> about<00:02:14.740> it

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
everything it makes you think about it

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.250 
everything it makes you think about it
if<00:02:15.100> you're<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.490> popping<00:02:15.670> pills<00:02:16.090> okay<00:02:16.690> two

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
if you're just popping pills okay two

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.600 
if you're just popping pills okay two
may<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:17.980> fine

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
may be fine

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.430 
may be fine
but<00:02:18.910> maybe<00:02:19.090> take<00:02:19.480> eight<00:02:19.690> because<00:02:19.930> man<00:02:20.260> I've

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
but maybe take eight because man I've

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.900 
but maybe take eight because man I've
really<00:02:20.800> got<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> study<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.490> that's<00:02:21.580> where<00:02:21.790> you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
really got a study and that's where you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.640 
really got a study and that's where you
get<00:02:22.000> potentially<00:02:22.420> dangerous<00:02:22.570> not<00:02:23.500> that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
get potentially dangerous not that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.260 
get potentially dangerous not that
you're<00:02:23.800> gonna<00:02:23.860> OD<00:02:24.100> on<00:02:24.580> caffeine<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.180> would

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
you're gonna OD on caffeine it would

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.300 
you're gonna OD on caffeine it would
take<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.420> crazy<00:02:25.750> amount<00:02:26.140> but<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.800> could<00:02:27.040> really

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
take a crazy amount but you could really

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.100 
take a crazy amount but you could really
wreak<00:02:27.700> your<00:02:27.910> ability<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.330> remember<00:02:28.720> things

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
wreak your ability to remember things

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.710 
wreak your ability to remember things
and<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.530> ready<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.190> get<00:02:30.400> Chris<00:02:31.330> and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
and to be ready and to get Chris and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.080 
and to be ready and to get Chris and
exactly<00:02:32.350> feeling<00:02:32.620> crazy<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.460> know<00:02:33.550> when

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
exactly feeling crazy and I know when

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.820 
exactly feeling crazy and I know when
I'm<00:02:34.240> super<00:02:34.630> caffeinated<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.350> just<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.800> a

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
I'm super caffeinated I just get a

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.920 
I'm super caffeinated I just get a
little<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.340> panicky<00:02:36.970> I'm<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.300> no<00:02:37.420> am<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.900> on

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
little like panicky I'm like no am I on

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.750 
little like panicky I'm like no am I on
in<00:02:38.170> my<00:02:38.230> body<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:39.190> think<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.520> there's<00:02:39.700> a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
in my body and I think that there's a

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.910 
in my body and I think that there's a
real<00:02:39.910> potential<00:02:40.240> for<00:02:40.360> people<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.810> be<00:02:40.960> to<00:02:41.410> take

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
real potential for people to be to take

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.410 
real potential for people to be to take
too<00:02:42.160> many<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.460> these<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.850> remember<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.390> college

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
too many of these I remember in college

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.350 
too many of these I remember in college
when<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.440> was<00:02:44.620> red<00:02:44.860> line<00:02:45.130> came<00:02:45.730> out<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.120> was<00:02:46.210> one

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
when it was red line came out it was one

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.910 
when it was red line came out it was one
of<00:02:46.390> those<00:02:46.540> really<00:02:46.750> intense<00:02:47.140> energy<00:02:47.620> drinks

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
of those really intense energy drinks

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.980 
of those really intense energy drinks
that<00:02:48.100> as<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.580> certain<00:02:48.850> point<00:02:49.030> did<00:02:49.300> cause

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
that as a certain point did cause

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.170 
that as a certain point did cause
someone<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.560> have<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.800> heart<00:02:51.160> attack<00:02:51.250> well<00:02:51.760> too

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
someone to have a heart attack well too

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.030 
someone to have a heart attack well too
many<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.990> was<00:02:53.110> because<00:02:53.590> they<00:02:53.710> were<00:02:53.740> so

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
many and it was because they were so

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.040 
many and it was because they were so
intense<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:55.240> don't<00:02:55.300> think<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:55.930> is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
intense and I don't think that this is

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.510 
intense and I don't think that this is
going<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.500> don't<00:02:56.710> think<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:56.950> any<00:02:57.190> worse

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
going to I don't think this is any worse

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.430 
going to I don't think this is any worse
than<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:57.910> but<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.600> also<00:02:58.840> think<00:02:58.990> it's<00:02:59.260> way

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
than that but I also think it's way

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.500 
than that but I also think it's way
better<00:02:59.680> than<00:02:59.980> people<00:03:00.160> popping<00:03:00.610> adderall<00:03:01.270> or

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
better than people popping adderall or

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.530 
better than people popping adderall or
medical<00:03:02.290> pills<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.860> they<00:03:03.190> aren't<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.450> know

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
medical pills that they aren't you know

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.180 
medical pills that they aren't you know
yes<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:05.050> is<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.410> better<00:03:05.770> than<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:05.980> think<00:03:06.100> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
yes it is it is better than I think the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.920 
yes it is it is better than I think the
better<00:03:06.370> alternative<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.360> still<00:03:07.780> think

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
better alternative to that I still think

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.710 
better alternative to that I still think
it's<00:03:08.050> kind<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:09.760> expensive<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.450> buy

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
it's kind of it's so expensive to buy

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.900 
it's kind of it's so expensive to buy
this<00:03:10.780> be<00:03:11.680> way<00:03:11.920> cheaper<00:03:11.950> just<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.460> drink<00:03:12.730> coffee

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
this be way cheaper just to drink coffee

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.300 
this be way cheaper just to drink coffee
