00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.220 
to take a clip I prefer to use a clip
rather<00:02:28.400> than<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.790> bobby<00:02:29.030> pins<00:02:29.390> because<00:02:29.630> it's

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
rather than the bobby pins because it's

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.340 
rather than the bobby pins because it's
more<00:02:30.950> stable<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.610> then<00:02:31.820> we'll<00:02:31.970> let<00:02:32.180> them<00:02:32.450> last

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
more stable and then we'll let them last

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.510 
more stable and then we'll let them last
longer<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.640> clip<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:37.910> tight<00:02:39.520> after

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
longer so I just clip it tight after

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.940 
longer so I just clip it tight after
you're<00:02:41.420> finished<00:02:41.470> clipping<00:02:42.470> into<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.770> back

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
you're finished clipping into the back

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.510 
you're finished clipping into the back
on<00:02:43.280> what<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.150> can<00:02:44.330> do<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.920> pull<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.250> braids

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
on what you can do is pull on the braids

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.810 
on what you can do is pull on the braids
a<00:02:46.730> little<00:02:47.120> bit<00:02:47.270> on<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.600> front<00:02:47.840> right<00:02:47.960> here

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
a little bit on the front right here

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.700 
a little bit on the front right here
because<00:02:49.820> sometimes<00:02:50.240> they<00:02:50.840> just<00:02:50.870> turn<00:02:51.380> out<00:02:51.530> to

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
because sometimes they just turn out to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.850 
because sometimes they just turn out to
tie<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.400> looks<00:02:52.670> weird<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:54.470> can<00:02:54.620> pull

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
tie and it looks weird so you can pull

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.120 
tie and it looks weird so you can pull
on<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.070> little<00:02:55.250> bit<00:02:55.460> little<00:02:55.640> um<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:57.230> hope<00:02:57.950> this

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
on this little bit little um I hope this

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.410
