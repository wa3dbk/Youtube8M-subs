00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.050
 Walk back and pull the thread back 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.430

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.820

 I put it in this tied-up part when I made a half- 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:51.319

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:19.580
 I'm going to turn around and go back to the part again. 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:25.400
 When the first spot is short , 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:26.420

 Likewise, between the knotted knots in the middle , in the middle of the center like this 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.010
 I'm going to put a short cut 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:14.660

 Doing so immediately after the knot's at a next to perfect. Oh right next to 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.570
