you'd really prefer a double bed well

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
you'd really prefer a double bed well
for<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> rest<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.789> week<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.840> room

with queen-size beds available well I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
with queen-size beds available well I
guess<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.539> okay<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.050> if<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
guess that is okay but if that is the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.340 
guess that is okay but if that is the
best<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:51.719> could<00:00:51.870> always<00:00:52.050> check
