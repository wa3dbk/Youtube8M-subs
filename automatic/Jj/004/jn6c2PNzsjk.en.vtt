00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.650
 today was the start of a new one 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.200
 million the trajectory of 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.950
 as musica bach speaking and bach 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.989
 speaking 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.960
 goes out of the church music by bach van 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.130
 bach cantatas from the theme 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.080
 that cantata 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.120
 look for lines to other composers 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.400
 to other times and to a new one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.980
 composition that has been composed for us 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.070
 and that all together forms one 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.170
 program that you could constantly do 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.680
 mention what is also liturgical with that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.420
 so we have thought about staging 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.400
 where are we going to stand 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.390

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.390
 how can we do it differently? 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.770

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.090
