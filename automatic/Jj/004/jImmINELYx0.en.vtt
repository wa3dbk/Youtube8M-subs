Tannehill the quarterback 4am has just

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.630 
Tannehill the quarterback 4am has just
played<00:00:19.470> four<00:00:19.740> games<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.310> them<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.520> he's

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
played four games for them and he's

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.220 
played four games for them and he's
transformed<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> attitude<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
transformed the attitude in the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.900 
transformed the attitude in the
production<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.220> offense<00:00:23.609> he's<00:00:23.760> done

production of that offense he's done

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.400 
production of that offense he's done
exceptionally<00:00:24.630> well<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.170> thing<00:00:25.350> about

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
exceptionally well the thing about

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.689 
exceptionally well the thing about
Nebraska's<00:00:25.980> defense<00:00:26.369> though<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.670> that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
Nebraska's defense though is that

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.830 
Nebraska's defense though is that
they've<00:00:26.910> made<00:00:26.939> some<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.630> good

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
they've made some really good

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200 
they've made some really good
quarterbacks<00:00:28.500> look<00:00:28.740> really<00:00:29.189> silly<00:00:29.519> jake

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.729 
walker from Washington Blaine Gabbert
from<00:00:32.610> Missouri<00:00:32.940> both<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> others<00:00:34.140> did<00:00:34.559> very

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
from Missouri both and others did very

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
from Missouri both and others did very
poorly<00:00:34.770> against<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> secondary<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> so

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
poorly against the secondary and so

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720 
poorly against the secondary and so
while<00:00:36.890> Nebraska<00:00:37.890> doesn't<00:00:38.190> really<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.489> lot

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
while Nebraska doesn't really get a lot

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.490 
while Nebraska doesn't really get a lot
of<00:00:38.790> pressure<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.390> quarterback<00:00:39.570> there's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
of pressure on the quarterback there's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.229 
of pressure on the quarterback there's
not<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> lot<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> room<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.309> back<00:00:41.520> seven<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> throw

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
not a lot of room in back seven to throw

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.970 
not a lot of room in back seven to throw
the<00:00:42.390> ball<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> think<00:00:43.200> Tannehill<00:00:43.710> will<00:00:43.860> be

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the ball so I think Tannehill will be

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.979 
the ball so I think Tannehill will be
slowed<00:00:44.280> down<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.120> don't<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
slowed down and I don't think that this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.930 
slowed down and I don't think that this
defense<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.860> am<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.550> technically

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
defense of am which is technically

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.340 
defense of am which is technically
ranked<00:00:48.270> number<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> conference<00:00:49.260> in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
ranked number one in the conference in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.139 
ranked number one in the conference in
rushing<00:00:49.590> defense<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.640> real<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
rushing defense is for real in that

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
rushing defense is for real in that
regard<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:51.600> Nebraska<00:00:51.930> will<00:00:52.620> run<00:00:52.860> wild<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
regard I think Nebraska will run wild I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.389 
regard I think Nebraska will run wild I
think<00:00:53.489> Nebraska<00:00:53.610> was<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.239> game<00:00:54.390> 31<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.199> 24<00:00:55.710> by

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
think Nebraska was this game 31 to 24 by

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
think Nebraska was this game 31 to 24 by
the<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:56.670> oklahoma<00:00:57.210> state's<00:00:57.420> brandon<00:00:57.840> weeden

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the way oklahoma state's brandon weeden

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.439 
the way oklahoma state's brandon weeden
put<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.620> 41<00:00:59.070> points<00:00:59.579> against<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.940> Nebraska

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
put up 41 points against that Nebraska

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.849 
put up 41 points against that Nebraska
defense<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.989> through<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.260> pretty<00:01:01.410> well<00:01:01.680> in

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
defense and through it pretty well in

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.830 
defense and through it pretty well in
him<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.129> he<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.730> exception<00:01:03.120> good<00:01:03.660> boy

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
him so he was the one exception good boy

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.050 
him so he was the one exception good boy
rule<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.979> he<00:01:05.040> only<00:01:05.129> completed<00:01:05.580> about<00:01:05.760> fifty

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
rule but he only completed about fifty

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
rule but he only completed about fifty
percent<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.390> his<00:01:06.540> passes<00:01:06.869> he<00:01:06.930> had<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> couple<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
percent of his passes he had a couple of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.399 
percent of his passes he had a couple of
big<00:01:07.680> plays<00:01:07.830> chucking<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.520> all<00:01:08.610> over<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> guys

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
big plays chucking it all over the guys

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.020 
big plays chucking it all over the guys
just<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.530> hunch<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.490> looks<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> me<00:01:11.909> like

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
just a hunch here it looks to me like

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.590 
just a hunch here it looks to me like
Taylor<00:01:12.689> Martinez<00:01:13.080> ankle<00:01:14.010> ain't<00:01:14.640> right<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.570> I

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
Taylor Martinez ankle ain't right now I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.730 
Taylor Martinez ankle ain't right now I
don't<00:01:15.689> think<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.259> right<00:01:16.530> for

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
don't think it's going to be right for

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.140 
don't think it's going to be right for
this<00:01:16.890> game<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.310> I'm<00:01:17.400> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.610> play<00:01:17.790> an<00:01:17.909> even

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
this game so I'm going to play an even

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.090 
this game so I'm going to play an even
bigger<00:01:18.360> hunch<00:01:18.630> I'm<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> play<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> home

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
bigger hunch I'm going to play the home

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.820 
bigger hunch I'm going to play the home
team<00:01:20.369> here<00:01:20.580> i'm<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.060> Texas<00:01:21.390> A&amp;M

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
team here i'm going with Texas A&amp;M

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.219 
team here i'm going with Texas A&amp;M
because<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.700> Ryan<00:01:24.000> Tannehill<00:01:24.479> factor

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
because of the Ryan Tannehill factor

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
because of the Ryan Tannehill factor
that<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.439> talked<00:01:25.770> about<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.250> team<00:01:26.520> has

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that you talked about this team has

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.410 
that you talked about this team has
ignited<00:01:27.270> around<00:01:27.840> him<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.850> draw<00:01:29.850> Johnson

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
ignited around him because draw Johnson

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.230 
ignited around him because draw Johnson
is<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> big<00:01:31.200> strong<00:01:31.740> talent<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> quarterback

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
is a big strong talent of a quarterback

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.330 
is a big strong talent of a quarterback
but<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.380> Oklahoma<00:01:34.770> State<00:01:34.799> he<00:01:35.130> throws

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
the injury well I think he's a lot

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.969 
the injury well I think he's a lot
closer<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.910> know<00:04:48.940> last<00:04:49.240> week<00:04:49.419> we<00:04:49.780> were<00:04:50.080> he<00:04:50.800> was

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
closer you know last week we were he was

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.339 
closer you know last week we were he was
pretty<00:04:51.190> guarded<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:51.910> start<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.360> game<00:04:52.389> and<00:04:52.900> we

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
pretty guarded to start the game and we

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.870 
pretty guarded to start the game and we
were<00:04:53.530> all<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:54.039> know<00:04:54.070> we<00:04:54.310> weren't<00:04:54.430> sure<00:04:54.669> where

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
were all you know we weren't sure where

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.520 
were all you know we weren't sure where
he<00:04:54.970> was<00:04:55.210> and<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.599> think<00:04:55.840> being<00:04:56.050> able<00:04:56.260> to<00:04:56.349> play

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
he was and I think being able to play

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.159 
he was and I think being able to play
last<00:04:56.740> week<00:04:56.950> helps<00:04:57.430> him<00:04:57.610> but<00:04:57.849> he<00:04:58.630> had<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.780> heck<00:04:59.020> of

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
last week helps him but he had a heck of

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.900 
last week helps him but he had a heck of
a<00:04:59.260> lot<00:04:59.380> better<00:04:59.440> week<00:04:59.860> of<00:05:00.010> practice<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.639> think

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
a lot better week of practice I think

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.969 
a lot better week of practice I think
the<00:05:01.000> confidence<00:05:01.539> on<00:05:01.690> its<00:05:01.900> grown<00:05:02.229> but<00:05:02.500> you

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
the confidence on its grown but you

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.140 
the confidence on its grown but you
never<00:05:03.160> really<00:05:03.400> know<00:05:03.580> until<00:05:03.610> you<00:05:04.090> start

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
never really know until you start
