00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Good people, I 'm here to tell you one. 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.970
 little chevrolet cross 2013 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:13.620
 the 2014 I bought now in November 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:18.359
 The car today is already in the month of 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.330
 January the November of January was 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.500
 two months I bought the two car 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.500
 times and took the car to the dealership. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 to talk about a very serious problem 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.250
 that the rain system problem 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.170
 But I'll talk about the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.680
 sound I 'll talk about the car and if I had one 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.239
 excellent latest car product with 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.530
 city road 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.690
 if you step you have the consumption 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.629
 really a little high to understand 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.120
 nothing out of the reality the car that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.800
 has 144 horsepower alcohol engines 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.530
 but so some things left 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.260
 wish you to the car 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.430
 in the category of separating 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.430
 almost 70 thousand reais 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.320
 It's logical that you want the best. 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.370
 quality in all aspects 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.350
 of the v 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:12.530
 comfort and dignity without end the tone but the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.020
 gm car sound system has sinned much 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.729
 in relation to that I'll show you 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.550
 You how it works 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.150
 understood even being a sound system 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.310
 simple and has a very nice nice sound 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.640
 but the gm sound system left the 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.100
 want and even more the service of 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.890
 maintenance is not that, I want to make it well 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.670
 of course a person formed in some 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.800
 areas in the electrical electrical area 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.470
 sound climate understood'm 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.210
 formed in various institutes and audio and 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.149
 I'll make a very simple comparison 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.670
 for you to understand my book my 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.250
 degree of dissatisfaction and what is 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.300
 happening then I'm going to change here 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.610
 you 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.080
 the radio sound system 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:06.270
 etock I moved here with auxiliary cd where 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:09.149
 it disappears to pay hotel cd as tc 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.280
 it is worth nothing auxiliary as it is not 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.220
 You're welcome, it's worthless, I 'm not going. 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.130
 put here for you to see the pen drive 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.840
 who is my son is filming pendrive 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:25.709
 I'm going to put a law enforcement 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:29.760
 to play it is very cool everything and I will 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:33.750
 leave a device here it does not 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:39.209
 nothing appears so blank 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:42.540
 if I want the cd that I often 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.239
 I select the phone through the phone output 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.860
 earphone to work with the cable and 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:53.700
 2002 also does not work then you 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.610
 the sun system the car is very good but 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.290
 in terms of technology left to be desired 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.060
 the car was authorized twice in the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.970
 two times that the computer that has 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.730
 put the cable was worth the errors of what 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.400
 it's happening they said that before it was 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.530
 a problem of the system where own 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.540
 computer was able to correct and 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.910
 degree of dissatisfaction I'm doing 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.760
 this video from here everyone on the net 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.680
 on the internet on youtube 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.870
 It's not quite what's happening. 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.989
 The comparative I'll make you 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.209
 here wants to have a sound box costs 15 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.430
 real at most one box that does not have 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.690
 Marta the technology that comes from Paraguay 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.680
 I understand, I'll call you. 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.769
 first game and I'll get the pen 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.769
 drive 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.060
 the pen drive and I'll put it here in the box 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:59.650
 put pen drive already plays or whatever 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.050
 car stereo system 70000 is very 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.060
 lower in the sound system a box 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:10.360
 that comes from the paraguay that costs 15 is like this 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:17.640
 I come here way to help world 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:17.640
 fm the box works on drive 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.060
 already independent of the pen drive that 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:30.520
 I put it was 4gb 8gb and 16gb 32gb 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.900
 and if it will work when I went 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.390
 technical assistance 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.580
 The technician came and told me that there is more 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.220
 a pen drive can not be more than four 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.580
 gigas then because if not then this pen 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.500
 drive here is is a four day period 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.690
 two-day lockout also gives the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.250
 same problem of eight gigas also the 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.200
 same problem of four days to the same 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.620
 ie the problem anthony the sector 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.560
 gm technology needs to improve greatly 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.900
 and a lot because it is a box of $ 15 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.450
 it works the sound system of yours that 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.030
 have in the case of 70 thousand does not work then 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.850
 I would like you to think a lot about 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.370
 relation to that understood I did not like 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.740
 to pay $ 5 in the multimedia kit and place 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.480
 right here because I already work with 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.550
 does not interest me to have a system of 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.710
 modern sound understood touched on another 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.040
 place I want to hear a simple and 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.890
 nice neat and our lot 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.690
 of dvd and so on from such then 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.650
 never again that I wanted the system of 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.630
 sound staff 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.650
 so I'm making this video for 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.990
 everybody knows it's a failure 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.790
 understood that the sound is more 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.580
 in terms of sound system technology 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.040
 overcome to achieve neither a 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.310
 device called pendrive understood 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.860
 which is a thing that is a box of 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.380
 sound that comes from Paraguay works and you 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.040
 does not spend more than $ 15 good relationships 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.420
 folks 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.790
 I leave here my hug to everyone 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.320
 watching this video and that you guys stay 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.510
 knowing Pedro that I'm passing 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.590
 going through a problem and has 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.760
 more when take the sound system to 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.280
 take to pack 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.430
 I will stay 20 to 30 days with a 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.890
 hole in the panel or the 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.340
 air conditioners that appear here as 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.560
 increases and decreases the temperature and this 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:21.220
 it will disappear because it will stay 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.900
 a hole in my panel and where the GM does not 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.370
 has the ability to detect the problem 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.720
 and talk like that, let's not change the 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.050
 sir's equipment sees what goes 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.730
 happening from now on is a problem 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.940
 the company that made the system 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.800
 of Sun 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.030
 they want to take the device off 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.220
 send for maintenance 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.560
 I must stay 30 days with a hole in the 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.840
 panel without knowing what is happening 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.430
 so this is my dissatisfaction with 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.060
 This is what I'm doing this video, I 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.880
 I think it's not fair to stay 30 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.940
 days with the hole in the panel because of 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.370
 a defect is a technical problem that is a 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.100
 common sense that in terms of 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.220
 gm technology should be ready 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.560
 in a car of the size that is the 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.250
 chevrolet cross understand what I think 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:10.450
 fantastic but got a sound system 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.450
 Thank you very much and a hug to everyone.
