00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.550
 Which 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.510
 I'm overseeing the football hour 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.859
 f was really moved 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.999
 Though it is work called s1 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.999
 Well on the highlight 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:16.630
 various 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.060
 That is the intention 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 It is said variously that it is an environmental problem 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.509
 What is the true eco? 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.649
 Such a place 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.310
 Such a work that I want to retake 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.450
 I do it but 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.960
 While saying so 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 Lol 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.160
 Because it is not a difficult movie 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.240
 s 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.010
 If you laugh 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 Before I think that it would be hard to go around on weekends Yoshimoto Yoshimoto 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.540
 In each region 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.950
 Mana who Mr. talent has said or do a new play 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.460
 Say 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.710
 An example in the park 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.220
 Before that, this movie 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.120
 It has been distilled but it is screened in a certain area 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 It's been around 30 minutes already. 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.810
 It just became a heavy body called Torch Ranke 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.810
 To people 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.700
 I decided to continue my work 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.990
 Well if there is a south river if you can get out at the first half of the run 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.280
 It is a work that you can enjoy 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.760
 It is the first time this time to do the king supervision but 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.210
 various 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.060
 Though it is interesting in the good point 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.990
 The high school side 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.870
 In the picture 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.910
 It's great that I have never done advanced editing 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.720
 There is instruction after difficult day 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.750
 I answered 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.640
 Che 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 The other day 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.740
 Please try this movie 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.430
 really 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.420
 Picotto 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.870
 Saw ufo peloton 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.740
 But not at all 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.870
 yesterday 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.520
 I went to a movie I can enjoy normally 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.190
 Although I also explained the story that I had you see and also explained 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.540
 It's not interesting if you say it all 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.730
 Please take a look from 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.489
 Until the end of the high 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.819
 Thank you
