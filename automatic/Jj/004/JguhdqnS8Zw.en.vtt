your<00:01:20.490> family<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:20.909> friends<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
your family and friends so I think is

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.649 
your family and friends so I think is
better<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> kids<00:01:23.299> but<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.509> get

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
better for the kids but they get

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.200 
better for the kids but they get
educated<00:01:25.369> not<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> think

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
educated not just because I think

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.429 
educated not just because I think
education<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.840> good<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.140> India<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> think

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
education is not good in India I think

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
education is not good in India I think
it's<00:01:28.680> awesome<00:01:29.000> especially<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.329> Dubai<00:01:30.630> of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it's awesome especially in Dubai of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.810 
it's awesome especially in Dubai of
money<00:01:30.900> school<00:01:31.229> where<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.860> kids<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.340> I've

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
money school where the kids are and I've

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.160 
money school where the kids are and I've
experienced<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.420> firsthand<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.990> can't

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
experienced that firsthand so I can't

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.109 
experienced that firsthand so I can't
talk<00:01:34.259> about<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> think<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.759> important

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
talk about it but I think it's important

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.910 
talk about it but I think it's important
that<00:01:36.150> they<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.689> spread<00:01:37.229> their<00:01:37.409> wings<00:01:37.530> far

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that they go and spread their wings far

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.700 
that they go and spread their wings far
and<00:01:38.070> wide<00:01:38.250> away<00:01:38.610> from

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and wide away from

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.760 
and wide away from
the<00:01:41.040> positives<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:41.640> negatives<00:01:41.730> of<00:01:42.300> being

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
the positives and negatives of being

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.050 
the positives and negatives of being
movie<00:01:43.770> stars<00:01:44.040> son<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.610> India
