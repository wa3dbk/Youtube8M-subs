00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
fancy style shall we let's begin already

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:08.609 
fancy style shall we let's begin already
begin

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.730 

okay<00:01:09.609> so<00:01:09.670> these<00:01:09.939> are<00:01:10.000> all<00:01:10.179> peeled<00:01:10.869> basically

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
okay so these are all peeled basically

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.889 
okay so these are all peeled basically
and<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.549> rinsed<00:01:12.789> them<00:01:12.850> off<00:01:13.000> just<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.719> get<00:01:13.840> a

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
and I rinsed them off just to get a

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.450 
and I rinsed them off just to get a
little<00:01:14.200> dirt<00:01:14.350> off<00:01:14.530> I'm<00:01:14.679> gonna<00:01:14.770> when<00:01:15.159> I<00:01:15.250> cut

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
little dirt off I'm gonna when I cut

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.249 
little dirt off I'm gonna when I cut
them<00:01:15.579> into<00:01:15.700> chunks<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:17.770> yay<00:01:18.700> big<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.229> that

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
them into chunks about yay big so that

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.469 
them into chunks about yay big so that
they<00:01:20.649> cook<00:01:20.829> a<00:01:20.859> little<00:01:21.039> bit<00:01:21.130> faster<00:01:21.219> and<00:01:21.939> just

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
they cook a little bit faster and just

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.999 
they cook a little bit faster and just
to<00:01:22.600> kind<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.899> even<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:25.509> sizing<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.200> then

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
to kind of even out the sizing and then

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.949 
to kind of even out the sizing and then
I've<00:01:27.130> got<00:01:27.369> pot<00:01:27.880> of<00:01:28.030> water<00:01:28.179> here<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.869> I'm

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:28.959 
I've got pot of water here that I'm

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.929 
I've got pot of water here that I'm
gonna<00:01:29.049> just<00:01:29.439> cold<00:01:30.280> water<00:01:30.340> start<00:01:30.759> with<00:01:30.850> them

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
gonna just cold water start with them

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.969 
gonna just cold water start with them
cold<00:01:31.149> so<00:01:31.929> they<00:01:32.079> cook<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.439> little<00:01:32.560> more<00:01:32.649> evenly

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
cold so they cook a little more evenly

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.949 
cold so they cook a little more evenly
if<00:01:33.189> you<00:01:33.310> drop<00:01:33.909> them<00:01:33.969> into<00:01:34.149> hot<00:01:34.329> water<00:01:34.359> like<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
if you drop them into hot water like the

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.050 
if you drop them into hot water like the
outside<00:01:35.350> will<00:01:36.130> kind<00:01:36.310> of<00:01:36.399> start<00:01:36.609> to<00:01:36.640> crumble

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
outside will kind of start to crumble

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.699 
outside will kind of start to crumble
apart<00:01:37.329> before<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.929> inside<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.289> really<00:01:38.500> soft

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
apart before the inside is really soft

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.160 
apart before the inside is really soft
and<00:01:39.009> then<00:01:39.700> I'm<00:01:39.939> just<00:01:40.060> gonna<00:01:40.179> peel<00:01:40.780> these<00:01:40.959> real

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
and then I'm just gonna peel these real

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.919 
and then I'm just gonna peel these real
quick<00:01:41.349> and<00:01:41.500> drop<00:01:41.709> them<00:01:41.890> into<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.659> we'll<00:01:43.780> do

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
quick and drop them into and we'll do

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.039 
quick and drop them into and we'll do
all<00:01:44.079> that<00:01:44.229> boil<00:01:44.770> them<00:01:44.920> all<00:01:45.009> together<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.640> I'll

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
all that boil them all together so I'll

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.109 
all that boil them all together so I'll
put<00:01:50.049> a<00:01:50.079> lid<00:01:50.289> on<00:01:50.319> it<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.739> a<00:01:50.950> boil<00:01:51.189> faster<00:01:51.459> and

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
put a lid on it and a boil faster and

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.300 
put a lid on it and a boil faster and
now<00:01:52.659> we<00:01:52.719> just<00:01:53.020> wait<00:01:53.379> for<00:01:53.590> him<00:01:53.679> to<00:01:53.829> cook<00:01:54.009> and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
now we just wait for him to cook and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.510 
now we just wait for him to cook and
then<00:01:54.429> we're<00:01:54.640> like<00:01:54.849> halfway<00:01:55.000> done<00:01:56.700> okay<00:01:57.700> so
