awful<00:02:37.079> things<00:02:37.290> actually<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.130> think<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.579> the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
awful things actually I think it is the

awful things actually I think it is the
most<00:02:39.420> awful<00:02:40.049> thing<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.440> break<00:02:40.829> in<00:02:41.250> your<00:02:41.400> body

most awful thing to break in your body

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.400 
most awful thing to break in your body
because<00:02:41.940> its<00:02:42.090> supposed<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.600> stop

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
because its supposed to like stop

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.740 
because its supposed to like stop
everything<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:44.610> your<00:02:44.850> body<00:02:44.910> from<00:02:45.239> working

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
everything in your body from working

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.569 
everything in your body from working
again<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.170> I'm<00:02:46.650> pretty<00:02:46.950> sure<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.220> feminine

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
again and I'm pretty sure it feminine

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.160 
again and I'm pretty sure it feminine
often<00:02:48.120> so<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.540> break<00:02:48.780> your<00:02:48.959> neck

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
often so if you break your neck

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.170 
often so if you break your neck
everything<00:02:49.860> else<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:50.310> your<00:02:50.459> body<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:50.970> your

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
everything else in your body like your

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.060 
everything else in your body like your
head<00:02:51.360> in<00:02:51.570> your<00:02:51.600> hands<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.290> your<00:02:52.799> shoulders

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
head in your hands and your shoulders

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.190 
head in your hands and your shoulders
and<00:02:53.579> everything<00:02:54.000> else<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:54.450> stops<00:02:54.959> working

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
and everything else just stops working

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.979 
and everything else just stops working
and<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.890> become<00:02:56.160> immobile<00:02:56.760> not<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.480> mobile

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
and you become immobile not a mobile

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.770 
and you become immobile not a mobile
like<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> phone<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.280> ear<00:02:59.609> mobile<00:03:00.150> which<00:03:00.540> means

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
like a phone but ear mobile which means

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.479 
like a phone but ear mobile which means
you<00:03:00.870> can't<00:03:01.109> move<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.680> think<00:03:01.890> that's<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.130> word<00:03:02.250> and

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
you can't move I think that's a word and

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.610 
you can't move I think that's a word and
I<00:03:02.579> think<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> word<00:03:03.329> in<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.780> immobile<00:03:04.380> ax

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
I think it's a word in the immobile ax

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.920 
I think it's a word in the immobile ax
mobile<00:03:05.070> immobile<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.790> never<00:03:06.090> got<00:03:06.299> about<00:03:06.510> really

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
mobile immobile I never got about really

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.910 
mobile immobile I never got about really
because<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.260> would<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.560> fought<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.859> the

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
because I would have fought it's the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.380 
because I would have fought it's the
same<00:03:08.100> with<00:03:08.220> any<00:03:08.340> other<00:03:08.700> part<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.359> body

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
same with any other part of the body

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.150 
same with any other part of the body
because<00:03:09.900> your<00:03:10.290> neck<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.680> supposed<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.070> be

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
because your neck is supposed to be

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.009 
because your neck is supposed to be
connected<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.970> every<00:03:12.359> part<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.690> your<00:03:12.840> body

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
features so it stops every one of them

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.000 
features so it stops every one of them
working<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:15.570> surely<00:03:15.959> every<00:03:16.350> part<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.859> your
