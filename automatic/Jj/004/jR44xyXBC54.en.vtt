00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.649
 current project a free-to-play arena 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.299
 shooter should be so one 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.700
 Balling the old school fast

 there are no pictures to the game 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.369
 So it is still quite early in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.929

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.150
