00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.150
 there are two types of belly here is there 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.440
 the thickness of fat and there is this 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.059
 muscle relaxation called 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.519
 a pause the lower belly 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.839
 the first thing is if you have 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.760
 muscle relaxation 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.350
 at the bottom there is a fundamental reason 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.300
 when you get older with 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.880
 Western food tales to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.859
 80% original lawless feeding 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 industrial you assault the intestines 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.369
 his intestines by being attacked by having 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.460
 an inflammatory reaction that 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.090
 get fat and they put on weight 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.059
 with gravity 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.899
 they go down to the pelvic floor 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.370
 if you are not rushing 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.940
 abdominals and even if you're muscular 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.200
 abdominals 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.550
 after a while they are so 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.010
 big that they lead to looseness 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.530
 muscle in the lower abdomen 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.980
 so before we start anything 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.840
 like exercise you have to get rid of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 this inflammatory reaction and empty 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.620
 the intestines and make sure that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.329
 big and heavy they become a little 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.289
 and light 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.289
 there it goes through a detox 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.830
 if we do that abdominals and tale to 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.690
 15 20 kg trip in the belly you will have 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.550
 always a big belly so from then on 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.440

 this is the abs of the show 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.700
 after there are the abs that are on the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.729
 oblique sides that allow you 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.680
 rotations and especially there are the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.360
