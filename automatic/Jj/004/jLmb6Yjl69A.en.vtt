okay<00:00:08.969> today<00:00:09.300> we<00:00:09.540> are<00:00:09.690> comparing<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.530> straight

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
okay today we are comparing the straight

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.169 
okay today we are comparing the straight
talk<00:00:11.400> ZTE<00:00:12.240> whirl<00:00:12.930> and<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.469> straight<00:00:14.309> talk<00:00:14.550> ZTE

valet<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.250> reason<00:00:17.400> we're<00:00:17.670> comparing

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
valet and the reason we're comparing

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.790 
valet and the reason we're comparing
these<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.480> because<00:00:18.779> they're<00:00:19.080> essentially<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
these is because they're essentially the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.359 
these is because they're essentially the
same<00:00:20.009> phone<00:00:21.439> you<00:00:22.439> might<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.890> these<00:00:23.099> on

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
same phone you might see these on

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.979 
same phone you might see these on
straight<00:00:23.730> talk<00:00:23.880> website<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.570> wonder<00:00:24.840> what

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
straight talk website and wonder what

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.080 
straight talk website and wonder what
the<00:00:25.110> difference<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.590> between<00:00:25.649> them<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the difference is between them and and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.030 
the difference is between them and and
really<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.869> main<00:00:28.140> difference<00:00:28.710> there<00:00:28.919> are

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
really the main difference there are

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.589 
really the main difference there are
some<00:00:29.250> slight<00:00:29.399> differences<00:00:29.759> which<00:00:30.239> I'll<00:00:30.419> show

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
some slight differences which I'll show

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900 
some slight differences which I'll show
you<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> main<00:00:31.140> difference<00:00:31.700> and<00:00:32.700> then

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
you about the main difference and then

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.549 
you about the main difference and then
and<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.600> main<00:00:33.750> difference<00:00:34.140> why<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.320> would

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
and the main difference why you would

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.030 
and the main difference why you would
pick<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.220> other<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.640> simply<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:37.040> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
pick one or the other is simply the the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.420 
pick one or the other is simply the the
calling<00:00:38.489> area<00:00:39.200> this<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.560> on<00:00:40.830> the<00:00:40.980> right<00:00:41.400> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
calling area this one on the right is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
calling area this one on the right is
the<00:00:41.970> ZTE<00:00:42.630> valet<00:00:43.280> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.490> cdma<00:00:45.210> phone<00:00:45.540> so

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the ZTE valet this is a cdma phone so

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
the ZTE valet this is a cdma phone so
straight<00:00:46.920> talk<00:00:47.100> would<00:00:47.340> activate<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.940> one

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
straight talk would activate this one

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.280 
straight talk would activate this one
with<00:00:48.420> either<00:00:48.630> verizon<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.560> sprint<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.960> one

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
with either verizon or sprint this one

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.630 
with either verizon or sprint this one
here<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.070> left<00:00:53.310> is<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.970> ZTE<00:00:54.960> world<00:00:55.640> this

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
here on the left is the ZTE world this

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.540 
here on the left is the ZTE world this
is<00:00:56.700> a<00:00:56.880> gsm<00:00:57.540> phone<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> straight<00:00:59.100> talk<00:00:59.340> would

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
is a gsm phone so straight talk would

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.880 
is a gsm phone so straight talk would
activate<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:00.900> either<00:01:02.060> AT&amp;T<00:01:03.060> or

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
activate this one with either AT&amp;T or

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.580 
activate this one with either AT&amp;T or
t-mobile<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> that's<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.409> main<00:01:07.560> difference

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
t-mobile so that's the main difference

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.580 
t-mobile so that's the main difference
off<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.399> bat<00:01:08.579> now<00:01:09.439> another<00:01:10.439> difference<00:01:10.860> which

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
off the bat now another difference which

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.210 
off the bat now another difference which
I<00:01:13.590> which<00:01:14.190> makes<00:01:14.490> me<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.380> valet<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I which makes me like the valet on the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.570 
I which makes me like the valet on the
right<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:19.050> can<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.770> screen<00:01:20.100> and

right here as you can see the screen and
I<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:20.909> know<00:01:20.970> why<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.930> as<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.200> can

here I've adjusted the brightness on
this<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.950> that's<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.369> what<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.150> I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
this one so that's not what it is so I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.480 
this one so that's not what it is so I
don't<00:01:57.330> know<00:01:57.510> why<00:01:57.689> why<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:59.159> keep

don't know why why that is but just keep

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.109 
don't know why why that is but just keep
that<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.880> mind<00:02:01.010> now<00:02:02.010> another<00:02:02.340> difference

that in mind now another difference

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.340 
that in mind now another difference
which<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.540> somewhat<00:02:05.180> considerable<00:02:06.350> depending

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
which is somewhat considerable depending

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.190 
which is somewhat considerable depending

the valet does have an LED flash and of
course<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.190> got<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.840> little<00:02:24.840> mirror<00:02:25.230> for

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
course it's got the little mirror for

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.670 
course it's got the little mirror for
for<00:02:25.980> your<00:02:26.100> selfies<00:02:26.990> well<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.140> one<00:02:28.319> does<00:02:28.530> not

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
for your selfies well this one does not

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.490 
for your selfies well this one does not
now<00:02:31.680> both<00:02:31.920> cameras<00:02:32.490> are<00:02:32.700> 3<00:02:33.540> megapixels<00:02:34.290> same

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
now both cameras are 3 megapixels same

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.660 
now both cameras are 3 megapixels same
resolution<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:35.520> so<00:02:37.310> that's<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.520> main

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
resolution on that so that's the main

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.020 
resolution on that so that's the main
difference<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.300> camera<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.440> next<00:02:40.770> thing

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
difference on the camera the next thing

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.210 
difference on the camera the next thing
the<00:02:42.030> next<00:02:42.440> notable<00:02:43.440> difference<00:02:43.830> on<00:02:44.010> these

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
the next notable difference on these

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.750 
the next notable difference on these
phones<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.600> design<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.459> find<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
phones is the design I find that the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.520 
phones is the design I find that the
design<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> valet<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> little<00:02:49.290> bit<00:02:49.380> more

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
design on the valet is a little bit more

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.410 
design on the valet is a little bit more
attractive<00:02:50.069> because<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.580> got<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.090> chrome

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
attractive because this got that chrome

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.949 
attractive because this got that chrome
look<00:02:51.800> trim<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:54.180> also<00:02:54.390> got<00:02:54.720> this

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
look trim on it it's also got this

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.430 
look trim on it it's also got this
little<00:02:55.350> indentation<00:02:56.130> here<00:02:57.080> which<00:02:58.080> kind<00:02:58.290> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
little indentation here which kind of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.320 
little indentation here which kind of
makes<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.890> easier<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.630> grip<00:03:00.709> sort<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:02.330> whereas

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
makes it easier to grip sort of whereas

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.400 
makes it easier to grip sort of whereas
this<00:03:03.600> one<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:04.170> has<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> gloss<00:03:05.280> black<00:03:05.580> trim<00:03:06.410> so

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
this one just has a gloss black trim so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.600 
this one just has a gloss black trim so
it's<00:03:07.590> really<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:08.160> more<00:03:08.489> plain<00:03:09.330> looking<00:03:10.610> now

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
it's really it's more plain looking now

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.759 
it's really it's more plain looking now
some<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> buttons<00:03:12.330> aren't<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.500> same

button<00:03:51.120> both<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.110> these<00:03:52.230> phones<00:03:52.500> are<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.769> same

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
button both of these phones are the same

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.520 
button both of these phones are the same
price<00:03:53.190> by<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.549> way<00:03:53.760> they<00:03:54.420> both<00:03:54.660> will<00:03:54.900> go<00:03:55.260> for

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
price by the way they both will go for

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.319 
price by the way they both will go for
79<00:03:56.100> 99<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.860> think<00:03:59.160> that's<00:03:59.400> about<00:03:59.610> it<00:04:00.000> as<00:04:00.120> far

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
79 99 and I think that's about it as far

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.030 
79 99 and I think that's about it as far
as<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.959> difference<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.470> though<00:04:01.620> one<00:04:01.829> more

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
as the difference is though one more

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.130 
as the difference is though one more
thing<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.549> that's<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.060> backlight<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
thing and that's the backlight on the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.979 
thing and that's the backlight on the
bottom<00:04:05.390> they<00:04:06.390> both<00:04:06.600> have<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> light<00:04:07.110> sensor<00:04:07.410> but

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
bottom they both have a light sensor but

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.690 
bottom they both have a light sensor but
the<00:04:09.989> world<00:04:10.320> on<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.799> on<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.100> left<00:04:11.400> here<00:04:11.610> is

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
the world on the on the left here is

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.660 
the world on the on the left here is
brighter<00:04:12.120> as<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:13.350> can<00:04:13.530> see<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.130> brighter

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
brighter as you can see it is brighter

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.890 
brighter as you can see it is brighter
than<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.829> valet<00:04:19.760> now<00:04:20.760> as<00:04:20.970> far<00:04:21.209> as<00:04:21.419> Android

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
than the valet now as far as Android

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.810 
than the valet now as far as Android
versions<00:04:22.410> go<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:24.410> believe<00:04:25.410> they<00:04:25.830> both<00:04:26.039> have<00:04:26.400> the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
versions go I believe they both have the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:37.370 
versions go I believe they both have the
same<00:04:27.770> four<00:04:28.770> point<00:04:29.039> one<00:04:29.130> point

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.110 

so<00:04:38.380> as<00:04:38.560> you<00:04:38.710> can<00:04:38.830> see<00:04:39.040> both<00:04:39.250> have<00:04:39.550> android

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
so as you can see both have android

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.240 
so as you can see both have android
version<00:04:40.660> 4.1<00:04:41.290> point<00:04:41.740> one<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:43.450> said<00:04:44.250> there

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
version 4.1 point one that said there

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.290 
version 4.1 point one that said there
are<00:04:45.280> some<00:04:46.150> slight<00:04:46.360> differences<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:48.640> and

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
are some slight differences and the and

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.070 
are some slight differences and the and
the<00:04:49.680> uija<00:04:50.680> or<00:04:51.070> on<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.460> interface<00:04:51.910> so<00:04:52.900> as<00:04:52.960> you

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
the uija or on the interface so as you

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.530 
the uija or on the interface so as you
can<00:04:53.200> see<00:04:53.530> some<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.760> slight<00:04:55.030> differences

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
can see some of the slight differences

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.410 
can see some of the slight differences
between<00:04:55.750> them<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:57.460> icons<00:04:57.880> are<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> little<00:04:58.240> bit

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
between them the icons are a little bit

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.660 
between them the icons are a little bit
different<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.830> other<00:04:59.980> difference<00:05:00.190> is<00:05:00.610> that

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
different the other difference is that

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.000 
different the other difference is that
the<00:05:01.060> world<00:05:01.300> has<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:02.080> home<00:05:02.380> screens<00:05:02.800> are

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
the world has the home screens are

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.540 
the world has the home screens are
numbered<00:05:03.630> for<00:05:04.630> some<00:05:04.840> reason<00:05:05.260> whereas<00:05:06.220> on<00:05:06.520> the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
numbered for some reason whereas on the

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.240 
numbered for some reason whereas on the
valet<00:05:07.180> they<00:05:07.660> are<00:05:07.780> not<00:05:07.990> numbered<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:09.040> just

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
valet they are not numbered you just

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.170 
valet they are not numbered you just
have<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.610> slider<00:05:09.970> indicator<00:05:10.570> at<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:10.870> bottom

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.600

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
but as far as apps are concerned both

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.840 
but as far as apps are concerned both
phones<00:05:19.030> have<00:05:20.070> essentially<00:05:21.070> identical<00:05:21.190> apps

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
phones have essentially identical apps

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.850 
phones have essentially identical apps
they<00:05:22.180> all<00:05:22.360> have<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:22.840> regular<00:05:23.170> Google<00:05:23.770> to

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
they all have the regular Google to

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.990 
they all have the regular Google to
standard<00:05:24.310> Google<00:05:24.670> stuff<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:26.820> they<00:05:27.820> both

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
standard Google stuff and they both

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.820 
standard Google stuff and they both
perform<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:30.040> know<00:05:30.160> pretty<00:05:30.340> much<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.880> same

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
perform a you know pretty much the same

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.920 
perform a you know pretty much the same
on<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.190> dimensions<00:05:33.790> both<00:05:34.180> phones<00:05:34.540> are<00:05:34.900> pretty

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
on the dimensions both phones are pretty

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.310 
on the dimensions both phones are pretty
much<00:05:35.560> but<00:05:35.890> same<00:05:36.250> size<00:05:36.580> they<00:05:37.510> both<00:05:37.720> have<00:05:37.990> three

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
much but same size they both have three

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.190 
much but same size they both have three
and<00:05:38.440> a<00:05:38.470> half<00:05:38.500> inch<00:05:38.860> screens<00:05:41.160> they're<00:05:42.160> both<00:05:42.370> up

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
and a half inch screens they're both up

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.500 
and a half inch screens they're both up
pretty<00:05:44.200> compact<00:05:44.910> though<00:05:45.910> they<00:05:46.120> are<00:05:46.300> a<00:05:46.330> little

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
pretty compact though they are a little

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.300 
pretty compact though they are a little
bit<00:05:46.750> on<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:47.169> thicker<00:05:47.470> side<00:05:47.590> they're<00:05:48.100> about

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
bit on the thicker side they're about

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.050 
bit on the thicker side they're about
half<00:05:48.880> an<00:05:49.030> inch<00:05:49.120> thick<00:05:49.450> the<00:05:49.690> both<00:05:49.870> of<00:05:50.080> them<00:05:51.030> so<00:05:52.030> I

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
half an inch thick the both of them so I

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.960 
half an inch thick the both of them so I
think<00:05:52.480> that<00:05:52.630> about<00:05:52.660> wraps<00:05:52.930> this<00:05:53.350> video<00:05:53.710> up<00:05:53.980> if

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
think that about wraps this video up if

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.180 
think that about wraps this video up if
you<00:05:55.150> ask<00:05:55.300> my<00:05:55.570> opinion<00:05:55.690> as<00:05:56.320> to<00:05:56.380> which<00:05:56.710> one<00:05:56.980> you

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
you ask my opinion as to which one you

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.490 
you ask my opinion as to which one you
should<00:05:57.370> get<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.870> first<00:05:59.110> thing<00:05:59.290> to<00:05:59.380> consider

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
should get the first thing to consider

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.120 
should get the first thing to consider
is<00:05:59.860> whether<00:06:00.780> or<00:06:01.780> what<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.530> best<00:06:02.680> coverage

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
is whether or what the best coverage

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.659 
is whether or what the best coverage
area<00:06:03.550> is<00:06:03.760> in<00:06:03.970> your<00:06:04.120> area<00:06:04.540> if<00:06:04.840> it's<00:06:05.620> AT&amp;T<00:06:06.010> or

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
area is in your area if it's AT&amp;T or

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.060 
area is in your area if it's AT&amp;T or
t-mobile<00:06:07.140> then<00:06:08.140> you<00:06:08.380> want<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.680> go<00:06:08.800> with<00:06:08.830> the

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
t-mobile then you want to go with the

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.030 
t-mobile then you want to go with the
whorl<00:06:09.370> here<00:06:09.790> if<00:06:09.960> you<00:06:10.960> if<00:06:11.410> you<00:06:11.620> have<00:06:11.800> better

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
whorl here if you if you have better

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.580 
whorl here if you if you have better
Verizon<00:06:12.640> coverage<00:06:12.900> then<00:06:13.900> that<00:06:14.080> would<00:06:14.200> go<00:06:14.380> with

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
Verizon coverage then that would go with

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.870 
Verizon coverage then that would go with
the<00:06:14.800> ballet<00:06:15.990> now<00:06:16.990> if<00:06:17.169> you<00:06:17.320> have<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:17.860> if<00:06:18.550> you<00:06:18.730> have

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
the ballet now if you have I if you have

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.240 
the ballet now if you have I if you have
similar<00:06:19.390> coverage<00:06:19.660> on<00:06:20.140> both<00:06:20.410> that<00:06:20.919> is<00:06:21.070> to<00:06:21.220> say

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
similar coverage on both that is to say

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.370 
similar coverage on both that is to say
it<00:06:22.090> doesn't<00:06:22.300> really<00:06:22.510> matter<00:06:22.720> what<00:06:22.990> coverage

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
it doesn't really matter what coverage

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.170 
it doesn't really matter what coverage
you<00:06:23.530> get<00:06:23.680> to<00:06:23.950> you<00:06:24.070> then<00:06:24.760> I<00:06:24.880> would<00:06:25.030> definitely

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
you get to you then I would definitely

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.200 
you get to you then I would definitely
go<00:06:25.540> with<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:25.810> valet<00:06:26.669> because<00:06:27.669> you<00:06:27.820> get<00:06:27.940> some

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
go with the valet because you get some

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.010 
go with the valet because you get some
extras<00:06:28.900> like<00:06:29.350> the<00:06:29.800> LED<00:06:30.760> flash<00:06:31.060> and<00:06:31.390> the<00:06:31.660> little

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
extras like the LED flash and the little

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.280 
extras like the LED flash and the little
mirror<00:06:32.320> for<00:06:32.560> your<00:06:32.710> selfies<00:06:33.810> you<00:06:34.810> get<00:06:34.960> a<00:06:34.990> better

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
mirror for your selfies you get a better

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.559 
mirror for your selfies you get a better
design<00:06:35.890> I<00:06:36.190> think<00:06:36.930> more<00:06:37.930> attractive<00:06:38.380> design

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:39.569 
design I think more attractive design

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.189 
design I think more attractive design
and<00:06:39.659> the<00:06:40.619> screen<00:06:41.129> resolution<00:06:41.879> is<00:06:42.240> is<00:06:42.779> better

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
and the screen resolution is is better

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.589 
and the screen resolution is is better
not<00:06:44.189> the<00:06:44.339> resolution<00:06:44.939> but<00:06:45.089> at<00:06:45.240> least<00:06:45.389> the

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
not the resolution but at least the

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.779 
not the resolution but at least the
brightness<00:06:46.110> of<00:06:46.319> it<00:06:46.499> as<00:06:46.679> better<00:06:47.129> as<00:06:47.219> you<00:06:47.369> as<00:06:47.729> you

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 
brightness of it as better as you as you

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:51.850 
brightness of it as better as you as you
can<00:06:48.599> see<00:06:48.959> just<00:06:49.919> by<00:06:50.069> them<00:06:50.459> laying<00:06:50.759> side<00:06:51.209> by<00:06:51.240> side

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
can see just by them laying side by side

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.369 
can see just by them laying side by side
so<00:06:52.860> again<00:06:53.219> that's<00:06:53.939> that<00:06:54.509> that<00:06:54.779> about<00:06:54.959> wraps<00:06:55.139> it

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:55.379 
so again that's that that about wraps it

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.589 
so again that's that that about wraps it
up<00:06:55.469> on<00:06:55.679> this<00:06:55.860> video<00:06:56.189> both<00:06:56.819> of<00:06:56.999> these<00:06:57.119> retail
