so let's check out the tone of the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.830 
so let's check out the tone of the
guitar<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.729> we'll<00:01:04.970> start<00:01:05.360> with<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
guitar and we'll start with the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.919 
guitar and we'll start with the
humbucker<00:01:06.590> in<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.040> neck<00:01:07.939> position<00:01:08.119> nice

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929 
humbucker in the neck position nice

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:10.719 
humbucker in the neck position nice
clean<00:01:09.229> turn<00:01:09.409> on<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.649> amp<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.219> we're<00:01:10.549> not

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
clean turn on the amp and we're not

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.429 
clean turn on the amp and we're not
using<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.149> split<00:01:11.299> coil<00:01:11.600> of<00:01:11.749> course<00:01:11.960> just

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
using the split coil of course just

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.779 
using the split coil of course just
keeping<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:12.770> as<00:01:12.829> a<00:01:12.859> humbucker<00:01:13.249> so<00:01:13.429> here's<00:01:13.639> a

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
keeping it as a humbucker so here's a

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:20.359 
keeping it as a humbucker so here's a
couple<00:01:13.999> of<00:01:14.090> chords

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.859 

middle<00:01:21.369> position<00:01:21.789> which<00:01:22.000> is<00:01:22.119> both<00:01:22.359> humbuckers

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.370 

and<00:01:28.700> then<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> bridge<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.210> Booker

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.570 

so<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> middle<00:01:37.740> position<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.280> could<00:01:38.400> have

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
so in the middle position you could have

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.910 
so in the middle position you could have
changes<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.810> tone<00:01:40.080> control<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.710> both

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
changes in you tone control on both

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.280 
changes in you tone control on both
pickups<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.150> myriad<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> different

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
pickups and a myriad really of different

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.590 
pickups and a myriad really of different
volume<00:01:43.710> parameters<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:44.850> both<00:01:45.060> pickups<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
volume parameters with both pickups to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.910 
volume parameters with both pickups to
get<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> blend<00:01:46.080> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> tone<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.830> were

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
get a blend of the tone that you were

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
get a blend of the tone that you were
actually<00:01:47.009> looking<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.299> we'll<00:01:48.450> leave

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
actually looking for so we'll leave

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.210 
actually looking for so we'll leave
those<00:01:48.869> pretty<00:01:49.170> much<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> 10<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.130> get

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
those pretty much a 10 so you just get

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.010 
those pretty much a 10 so you just get
an<00:01:50.340> idea<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.420> we'll<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.869> we'll

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
an idea and what we'll do now is we'll

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
an idea and what we'll do now is we'll
run<00:01:52.229> through<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> pickups<00:01:52.860> again<00:01:53.190> but<00:01:53.850> we'll

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
run through the pickups again but we'll

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.999 
run through the pickups again but we'll
split<00:01:54.539> call<00:01:54.869> both<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> hit

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
split call both of them so when you hit

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.279 
split call both of them so when you hit
in<00:01:56.190> that<00:01:56.280> middle<00:01:56.549> position<00:01:56.940> it's<00:01:57.090> both<00:01:57.360> single

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
in that middle position it's both single

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.960 
in that middle position it's both single
calls<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.490> we'll<00:01:59.640> start<00:01:59.880> with

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
calls if you like so we'll start with

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:10.290 
calls if you like so we'll start with
the<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.509> neck<00:02:00.810> single<00:02:01.590> call<00:02:01.799> now

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.450 

okay<00:02:11.290> middle<00:02:11.590> position<00:02:11.920> which<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.160> both

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
okay middle position which is both

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:21.610 
okay middle position which is both
single<00:02:12.970> cause

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.220 

okay<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.819> then<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> bridge<00:02:23.360> which<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.959> this

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
okay and then the bridge which is this

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:34.580 
okay and then the bridge which is this
single<00:02:24.500> call

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.930 

this<00:02:35.590> guitar<00:02:35.920> really<00:02:36.160> comes<00:02:36.490> into<00:02:36.640> its<00:02:36.850> own

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940
