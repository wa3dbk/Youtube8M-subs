so here I am replacing the wheel hub

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.390 
so here I am replacing the wheel hub
assembly<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:04.980> my<00:00:05.299> 2004<00:00:06.299> nissan<00:00:06.480> titan<00:00:07.370> but<00:00:08.370> i

do<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.580> quick<00:00:08.760> little<00:00:08.970> video<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.420> know<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.780> this

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
do a quick little video I know that this

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.169 
do a quick little video I know that this
hub<00:00:10.590> bearing<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.160> difficult<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.790> get<00:00:11.910> out<00:00:12.000> for

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
hub bearing is difficult to get out for

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.829 
hub bearing is difficult to get out for
a<00:00:12.240> lot<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> people<00:00:12.780> myself<00:00:13.530> included<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.839> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
a lot of people myself included and I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.140 
a lot of people myself included and I
thought<00:00:16.020> I'd<00:00:16.109> do<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.410> video<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.800> how<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
thought I'd do a little video on how I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.230 
thought I'd do a little video on how I
did<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.660> what<00:00:19.650> works<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.039> me<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.550> know<00:00:21.029> there's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
did it what works for me I know there's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.990 
did it what works for me I know there's
different<00:00:21.539> ways<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.840> doing<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:24.619> know<00:00:25.619> that

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
different ways of doing it I know that

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.460 
different ways of doing it I know that
for<00:00:27.000> some<00:00:27.029> people<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.720> slides<00:00:28.170> right<00:00:28.289> out

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
for some people it just slides right out

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429 
for some people it just slides right out
once<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> undo<00:00:29.099> these<00:00:29.670> bolts<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> live<00:00:31.410> in

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
once you undo these bolts but I live in

once you undo these bolts but I live in
New<00:00:31.560> England<00:00:31.590> there's<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> lot<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.610> salt<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
New England there's a lot of salt on the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.819 
New England there's a lot of salt on the
roads<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.880> therefore<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> case<00:00:37.430> I

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
roads and therefore it's not the case I

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.910 
roads and therefore it's not the case I
am<00:00:40.829> I'm<00:00:41.160> not<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.640> best<00:00:41.850> mechanic<00:00:42.329> going

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
am I'm not the best mechanic going

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.290 
am I'm not the best mechanic going
certainly<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> for<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> living<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.030> if

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
certainly don't do it for a living so if

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.510 
certainly don't do it for a living so if
you<00:00:45.899> do<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.620> you'll<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> heckle<00:00:47.399> me

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you do and if you'll need to heckle me

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
you do and if you'll need to heckle me
for<00:00:47.700> anything<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.030> got<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.840> it's

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
for anything I got going on here it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
for anything I got going on here it's
fine<00:00:49.910> with<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.090> lack<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.539> jack<00:00:51.780> stand<00:00:51.809> other

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
fine with my lack of a jack stand other

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.430 
fine with my lack of a jack stand other
there's<00:00:53.360> cause<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.660> concern<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:54.960> some<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
there's cause for concern for some of

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.189 
there's cause for concern for some of
you<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.120> what<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.539> alright

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
you but what are you going to do alright

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.520 
you but what are you going to do alright
so<00:00:58.320> anyway<00:00:59.059> I<00:01:00.059> had<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.199> hard<00:01:01.350> time

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so anyway I had a really hard time

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.270 
so anyway I had a really hard time
getting<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.890> thing<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.359> I<00:01:03.860> beat<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> for

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
getting this thing out I beat on it for

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.340 
getting this thing out I beat on it for
probably<00:01:05.909> an<00:01:06.090> hour<00:01:06.150> -<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> sledge<00:01:07.320> hammer

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
probably an hour - with a sledge hammer

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.890 
probably an hour - with a sledge hammer
and<00:01:07.770> tried<00:01:08.100> using<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.580> cold<00:01:09.330> chisel<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and tried using a cold chisel to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.640 
and tried using a cold chisel to
separate<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.890> hub<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> knuckle<00:01:12.530> but<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
separate the hub from the knuckle but it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.469 
separate the hub from the knuckle but it
didn't<00:01:13.830> work<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.810> what<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.840> did<00:01:16.130> was<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.369> used

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
didn't work so what I did was I used

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.340 
didn't work so what I did was I used
this<00:01:18.979> which<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.640> quarter<00:01:21.150> power<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
this which is a quarter power with the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
this which is a quarter power with the
spreader<00:01:23.340> attachment<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> did<00:01:26.970> with

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
spreader attachment and what I did with

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.569 
spreader attachment and what I did with
it<00:01:28.159> was<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.250> put<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:31.100> between<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.340> steering

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
it was I put it between the steering

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.410 
it was I put it between the steering
knuckle<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:34.350> flange<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.460> top<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
knuckle and the flange on the top and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.270 
knuckle and the flange on the top and
then<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.600> hit<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> bottom<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.350> few<00:01:37.799> times<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
then I hit the bottom a few times of the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
then I hit the bottom a few times of the
hammer<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.270> moved<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.140> spreader<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
hammer and I moved the spreader to the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.960 
hammer and I moved the spreader to the
bottom<00:01:41.130> again<00:01:41.670> between<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:43.610> flange<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
bottom again between the flange in the a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.660 
bottom again between the flange in the a
steering<00:01:45.420> knuckle<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.950> hit<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> top<00:01:47.490> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
steering knuckle and I hit the top of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.690 
steering knuckle and I hit the top of
the<00:01:48.329> flange<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> hammer<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.399> I<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.549> kind

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the flange with a hammer and I just kind

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.859 
the flange with a hammer and I just kind
of<00:01:50.729> worked<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> forth<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.720> that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
of worked it back and forth like that

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.399 
of worked it back and forth like that
for<00:01:53.390> seriously<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.570> two<00:01:54.899> or<00:01:55.049> three<00:01:55.079> minutes

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
for seriously about two or three minutes

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.730 
for seriously about two or three minutes
and<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.920> was<00:01:56.040> able<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> back<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> right<00:01:56.909> out

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
and I was able to back it right out

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.330 
and I was able to back it right out
a<00:01:59.119> lot<00:02:00.119> easier<00:02:00.450> than<00:02:00.600> hammering<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.200> or<00:02:01.470> no

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
a lot easier than hammering on it or no

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.510 
a lot easier than hammering on it or no
I've<00:02:02.520> seen<00:02:02.700> other<00:02:02.880> ways<00:02:03.150> we<00:02:03.390> put<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.720> bar<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
I've seen other ways we put a bar on the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.789 
I've seen other ways we put a bar on the
on<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.150> studs<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:06.990> smash<00:02:07.530> that

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
on the studs here and you smash that

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.150 
on the studs here and you smash that
with<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> hammer<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.369> whatever<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.149> I

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
with a hammer or whatever and I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.229 
with a hammer or whatever and I
generally<00:02:11.160> don't<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.640> hammering<00:02:12.030> on

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
