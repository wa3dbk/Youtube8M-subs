00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
one I'm gonna use the smallest probe and

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.749 
one I'm gonna use the smallest probe and
I've<00:00:31.260> already<00:00:31.410> dipped<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.070> some<00:00:32.279> lubricant

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
I've already dipped it in some lubricant

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.060 
I've already dipped it in some lubricant
I'm<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.510> using<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:34.079> Vaseline<00:00:34.559> right

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
I'm just using a little Vaseline right

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
there now you have to locate the snakes

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.580 
there now you have to locate the snakes
cloaca<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.879> protective<00:00:39.360> scale<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:40.170> here

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
cloaca the protective scale right here

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650 
cloaca the protective scale right here
is<00:00:40.739> called<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> anal<00:00:41.370> scale<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.390> snakes

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
is called the anal scale and some snakes

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540 
is called the anal scale and some snakes
it's<00:00:42.899> divided<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.620> hognose<00:00:44.040> snakes<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.430> can

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
it's divided and hognose snakes you can

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's divided and hognose snakes you can
see<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> divided<00:00:45.420> scale<00:00:45.750> some<00:00:46.710> snakes

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
see it's a divided scale some snakes

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
see it's a divided scale some snakes
it's<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.370> divided<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.120> looks<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
it's not divided it just looks like a

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.930 
it's not divided it just looks like a
fingernail<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.020> another<00:00:49.469> ventral<00:00:49.920> scale<00:00:50.219> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
fingernail or another ventral scale so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.779 
fingernail or another ventral scale so
we're<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.480> bring<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> snake's

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
we're going to do is bring the snake's

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.779 
we're going to do is bring the snake's
tail<00:00:53.789> back<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.920> go<00:00:56.100> gently<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.640> go

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
tail back and go gently and go

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.529 
tail back and go gently and go
underneath<00:00:57.149> its<00:00:57.329> cloaca<00:00:59.180> which<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.329> not

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
underneath its cloaca which it's not

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.750 
underneath its cloaca which it's not
gonna<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:07.500> it'd<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.650> very<00:01:07.770> very<00:01:08.100> gentle

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
gonna like and it'd be very very gentle

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.020 
gonna like and it'd be very very gentle
with<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:13.040> we're<00:01:14.040> gonna<00:01:14.159> put<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.549> probe<00:01:14.820> in

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
with it we're gonna put that probe in

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.120 
with it we're gonna put that probe in
there<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.630> some<00:01:16.140> snakes<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.560> easier<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.979> do

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
there on some snakes it's easier to do

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.179 
there on some snakes it's easier to do
than<00:01:17.280> others<00:01:17.700> obviously<00:01:18.479> smaller<00:01:18.990> snake<00:01:19.409> it's

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
than others obviously smaller snake it's

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.890 
than others obviously smaller snake it's
not<00:01:20.369> easy<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:23.840> there<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> goes<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.750> can

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
not easy to do there it goes so you can

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.679 
not easy to do there it goes so you can
see<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.439> probe<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.729> through

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
see that this probe is going through

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.830 
see that this probe is going through
some<00:01:30.990> distance<00:01:31.409> inside<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> cloaca<00:01:32.840> which

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
some distance inside the cloaca which

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.249 
some distance inside the cloaca which
means<00:01:35.360> it's<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> Hemi<00:01:37.350> peen<00:01:39.259> there

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
means it's going into a Hemi peen there

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.219 
means it's going into a Hemi peen there
it<00:01:40.350> goes

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
it goes

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.160 
it goes
so<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.439> how<00:01:43.530> far<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:45.170> it's

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
so this is how far it's going in it's

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740 
so this is how far it's going in it's
going<00:01:46.470> into<00:01:46.770> an<00:01:46.890> inverted<00:01:47.250> Hemi<00:01:47.610> penis<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
going into an inverted Hemi penis is a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.280 
going into an inverted Hemi penis is a
male<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.619> goes<00:01:49.799> going<00:01:50.189> half<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.270> distance<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
male it goes going half that distance it

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160 
male it goes going half that distance it
would<00:01:52.470> mean<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.070> female<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.880> male<00:01:54.720> snakes

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
would mean it's a female and male snakes

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.310 
would mean it's a female and male snakes
-<00:01:55.380> Hemi<00:01:55.590> teams<00:01:55.920> are<00:01:56.540> inside<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.780> tail<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
- Hemi teams are inside the tail and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.410 
- Hemi teams are inside the tail and
they're<00:01:59.009> inverted<00:01:59.640> when<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> snake<00:02:00.180> uses

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
they're inverted when the snake uses

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.170 
they're inverted when the snake uses
them<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> mate<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.259> copulate<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:02.549> pushes<00:02:03.000> blood

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
them to mate to copulate it pushes blood

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.459 
them to mate to copulate it pushes blood
through<00:02:03.540> them<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
through them and it's kind of the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.870 
through them and it's kind of the
equivalent<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.890> us<00:02:05.040> putting<00:02:05.369> our<00:02:05.460> hand<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
equivalent of us putting our hand in a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
equivalent of us putting our hand in a
tube<00:02:06.090> sock<00:02:06.329> grabbing<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.170> pulling<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.560> out
