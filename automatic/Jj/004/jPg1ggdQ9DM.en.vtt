surf and everything with flying

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.720 
surf and everything with flying
everywhere<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.150> made<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:16.260> totally

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
everywhere and made me totally

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.029 
everywhere and made me totally
reevaluate<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.970> way<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.480> do<00:00:19.109> my<00:00:19.350> kayak<00:00:19.680> crate

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
reevaluate the way I do my kayak crate

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.730 
reevaluate the way I do my kayak crate
and<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:21.420> here's<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.779> came<00:00:21.869> up<00:00:22.020> with

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
and so here's what I came up with

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.679 
and so here's what I came up with
it's<00:00:23.130> basically<00:00:23.519> took<00:00:23.670> everything<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
it's basically took everything for it

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.609 
it's basically took everything for it
redid<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.439> used<00:00:26.099> about<00:00:26.310> 50<00:00:26.730> zip<00:00:26.939> ties

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
redid it used about 50 zip ties

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.720 
redid it used about 50 zip ties
basically<00:00:28.619> set<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.920> up<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.160> where<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
basically set it up to where when you

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970 
basically set it up to where when you
roll<00:00:29.910> over<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.859> you<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
roll over you don't have you know a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.709 
roll over you don't have you know a
bunch<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.460> rods<00:00:32.880> sticking<00:00:33.059> straight<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
bunch of rods sticking straight up and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.569 
bunch of rods sticking straight up and
down<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.230> actually<00:00:34.680> straight<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
down that is actually straight up and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.220 
down that is actually straight up and
down<00:00:35.640> underneath<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.360> kayak<00:00:36.719> once<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.079> rolls

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
down underneath to kayak once it rolls

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
down underneath to kayak once it rolls
over<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.590> makes<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> lot<00:00:38.280> harder<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.700> roll

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
over and makes it a lot harder to roll

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.010 
over and makes it a lot harder to roll
over<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> check<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:42.420> basically<00:00:42.809> what

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
over so check it out it's basically what

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.750 
over so check it out it's basically what
I<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.309> wanted<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> make

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I got going on here is I wanted to make

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.950 
I got going on here is I wanted to make
sure<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:45.450> my<00:00:45.750> rods<00:00:46.020> are<00:00:46.500> facing<00:00:47.809> pretty<00:00:48.809> much

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
sure all my rods are facing pretty much

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.740 
sure all my rods are facing pretty much
straight<00:00:49.260> back<00:00:49.500> now<00:00:50.010> instead<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.600> we

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
straight back now instead of you know we

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
straight back now instead of you know we
put<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> rod<00:00:52.260> tube<00:00:52.530> from<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> kayak

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
put them in a rod tube from the kayak

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.869 
put them in a rod tube from the kayak
like<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.850> kayaks<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:55.039> this<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.219> back<00:00:56.489> when

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
like some kayaks have this out back when

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.520 
like some kayaks have this out back when
you<00:00:56.940> got<00:00:57.059> big<00:00:57.270> rods<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.170> hard<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you got big rods it's kind of hard to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.250 
you got big rods it's kind of hard to
find<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.280> way<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> put<00:01:00.180> them<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:01.170> know

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
find a way to put them all down you know

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.490 
find a way to put them all down you know
basically<00:01:01.649> just<00:01:03.140> stick<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.229> along<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
basically just stick them along the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.990 
basically just stick them along the
length<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.860> kayak<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> figured

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
length of your kayak so what I figured

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.340 
length of your kayak so what I figured
is<00:01:06.119> I'll<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.299> stick<00:01:06.540> them<00:01:06.750> all<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> way<00:01:07.020> back

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
is I'll just stick them all the way back

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.039 
is I'll just stick them all the way back
and<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:09.060> basically<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.020> angled<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.540> tubes<00:01:12.540> on

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and I basically just angled the tubes on

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.270 
and I basically just angled the tubes on
the<00:01:13.560> kayak<00:01:14.130> crate<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:16.500> PVC<00:01:16.920> pipe<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the kayak crate to go the PVC pipe in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
the kayak crate to go the PVC pipe in
the<00:01:17.340> kayak<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.759> Craig<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.330> goes<00:01:18.479> an<00:01:18.810> angle

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the kayak or Craig it goes an angle

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.999 
the kayak or Craig it goes an angle
straight<00:01:19.979> back<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> rolls<00:01:21.810> over<00:01:22.170> all

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
straight back so when it rolls over all

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.640 
straight back so when it rolls over all
the<00:01:23.310> rods<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:24.000> pointed<00:01:24.750> away<00:01:24.869> from<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the rods are pointed away from you and

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.649 
the rods are pointed away from you and
then<00:01:25.770> towards<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> back<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> kayak<00:01:27.150> makes

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
then towards the back of the kayak makes

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
then towards the back of the kayak makes
a<00:01:27.750> lot<00:01:27.869> easier<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> flip<00:01:28.470> over<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.920> you're<00:01:29.009> not

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
a lot easier to flip over and you're not

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.340 
a lot easier to flip over and you're not
gonna<00:01:29.250> break<00:01:29.460> your<00:01:29.610> rod<00:01:29.790> tips<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:31.290> were

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
gonna break your rod tips like they were

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
gonna break your rod tips like they were
standing<00:01:31.619> straight<00:01:31.920> up<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> down<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.000> check

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
standing straight up and down so check

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
standing straight up and down so check
it<00:01:33.479> out<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> basically<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:37.140> bungee<00:01:37.610> allows

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it out so basically this bungee allows

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.800 
it out so basically this bungee allows
me<00:01:39.110> to<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:41.040> throw<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> over<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.790> edge<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
me to just throw it over the edge of the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.039 
me to just throw it over the edge of the
reel<00:01:43.700> won't<00:01:44.700> come<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:44.909> same<00:01:45.720> way<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
reel won't come out same way on the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.520 
reel won't come out same way on the
other<00:01:46.079> side<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:46.770> throw<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.310> over<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.530> reel

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
other side just throw it over the reel

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.950 
other side just throw it over the reel
handle<00:01:49.950> won't<00:01:50.369> come<00:01:50.549> out<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:52.340> for<00:01:53.570> my<00:01:54.570> spear

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
handle won't come out and for my spear

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380 
handle won't come out and for my spear
gap<00:01:55.140> ice<00:01:56.070> made<00:01:56.280> another<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.149> slide

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
gap ice made another one for it to slide

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
gap ice made another one for it to slide
down<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> don't<00:01:59.549> have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> worry

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
down in and now I don't have to worry

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.639 
down in and now I don't have to worry
about<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.360> coming<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.810> sticking<00:02:01.140> me<00:02:01.350> when

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
about it coming out and sticking me when

about it coming out and sticking me when
I'm<00:02:01.740> coming<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> surf

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.330 

basically<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.500> main<00:02:06.650> thing<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:06.980> was<00:02:07.190> looking

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
basically the main thing I was looking

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.090 
basically the main thing I was looking
at<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:09.110> main<00:02:09.259> thing<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.530> was<00:02:09.680> thinking<00:02:09.740> about

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
at the main thing I was thinking about

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.980 
at the main thing I was thinking about
when<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:10.970> went<00:02:11.150> tumbling<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.600> other<00:02:11.720> day<00:02:11.870> and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
when I went tumbling the other day and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.160 
when I went tumbling the other day and
the<00:02:12.050> surf<00:02:12.260> was<00:02:12.590> we<00:02:13.490> were<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> hooks<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.300> where

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
the surf was we were the hooks and where

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.710 
the surf was we were the hooks and where
were<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.980> rods<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.700> they<00:02:17.270> were<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.420> little<00:02:17.540> too

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
were the rods and they were a little too

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.640 
were the rods and they were a little too
close<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.050> my<00:02:18.170> head

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
close to my head

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.530 
close to my head
so<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.130> wanted<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.550> get<00:02:19.700> on<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.820> far<00:02:20.150> back<00:02:20.390> in

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
so I wanted to get on the far back in

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.260 
so I wanted to get on the far back in
the<00:02:20.630> Kai<00:02:20.840> because<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.230> could<00:02:21.470> now<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.580> won't

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
the Kai because I could now I won't

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.120 
the Kai because I could now I won't
necessarily<00:02:23.390> fish<00:02:23.900> these<00:02:24.080> rods<00:02:24.590> like<00:02:24.740> this

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
necessarily fish these rods like this

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.470 
necessarily fish these rods like this
I'll<00:02:25.820> actually<00:02:25.970> put<00:02:26.300> these<00:02:26.420> rods<00:02:26.720> like<00:02:27.110> this

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
I'll actually put these rods like this

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.180 
I'll actually put these rods like this
while<00:02:29.480> I'm<00:02:29.600> fishing<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.710> know<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.980> write<00:02:31.100> it

while I'm fishing you know that write it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.280 
while I'm fishing you know that write it
behind<00:02:31.370> my<00:02:31.520> head<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.570> can<00:02:32.720> pull<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:32.900> out<00:02:33.050> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
behind my head and I can pull it out and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.160 
behind my head and I can pull it out and
fish<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.460> then<00:02:35.180> when<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.480> got<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.660> reenter<00:02:36.050> the

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
fish and then when I got a reenter the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.190 
fish and then when I got a reenter the
surf<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.890> just<00:02:37.550> take<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.120> stick<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.570> just

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
surf I just take it and stick it just

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.330 
surf I just take it and stick it just
like<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.830> these<00:02:39.950> rod<00:02:40.190> holders<00:02:40.720> so

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
like this and these rod holders so

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.590 
like this and these rod holders so
basically<00:02:43.340> there'll<00:02:43.670> be<00:02:43.700> nothing<00:02:44.180> right<00:02:44.360> next

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
basically there'll be nothing right next

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.960 
basically there'll be nothing right next
to<00:02:44.660> my<00:02:44.780> head<00:02:48.160> there's<00:02:49.160> nothing<00:02:49.550> right<00:02:49.670> next<00:02:49.910> to
