00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.030 
another idea is to get kids involved in
the<00:02:14.700> growing<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.240> vegetables<00:02:15.860> research<00:02:16.860> has

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the growing of vegetables research has

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.490 
the growing of vegetables research has
shown<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.370> when<00:02:17.730> children<00:02:17.790> see<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.230> growth

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
shown that when children see the growth

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.890 
shown that when children see the growth
of<00:02:19.530> vegetables<00:02:20.370> they're<00:02:20.940> more<00:02:21.209> likely<00:02:21.630> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
of vegetables they're more likely and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.010 
of vegetables they're more likely and
interested<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.650> trying<00:02:22.950> them<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.360> some<00:02:24.630> ideas

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
interested in trying them so some ideas

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.080 
interested in trying them so some ideas
would<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.349> be<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.770> start<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.520> vegetable<00:02:27.060> garden

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
would to be to start a vegetable garden

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.570 
would to be to start a vegetable garden
in<00:02:27.510> your<00:02:27.540> own<00:02:27.810> home<00:02:28.140> kids<00:02:28.950> could<00:02:29.190> participate

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
in your own home kids could participate

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.660 
in your own home kids could participate
in<00:02:30.120> watering<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.870> craps<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.530> then<00:02:31.800> picking

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
in watering the craps and then picking

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.990 
in watering the craps and then picking
them<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.209> eating<00:02:34.080> them<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> kitchen

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
them and eating them in the kitchen

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.570 
them and eating them in the kitchen
another<00:02:36.000> idea<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.200> don't<00:02:37.530> have<00:02:37.800> access<00:02:38.069> or
