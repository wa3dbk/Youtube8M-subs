00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 you 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.100
 Hello my dear friends with you 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.400
 ant and today we continue to do 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.640
 Minecraft mods reviews 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.130
 1.6.2 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.339
 and today we have on line the mod which 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.529
 called amber mod naturally who 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.430
 knows a little English, but I am to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.829
 I do not belong I googled enter it amber 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.180
 and let's see what it is. 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.920
 here is such here 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.950
 An insert, that is, here is an ember mode and 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.470
 here we see strange cups for 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.040
 what is not all necessary nobody ever 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.670
 will find out 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.150
 but if we take this block here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.990
 this block is this block and let's say here 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.420
 this resident and this block and that's it 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.230
 enough and let me show the world 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.150
 minecraft we can meet amber but 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.659
 We meet about him with a big tube with 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.890
 a little bit more likely 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.380
 most likely my just will not meet 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.620
 also he can be mine anywhere but 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.480
 and what do you ask amber blog amber &amp; 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.250
 gods are these really the most 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.370
 simple models maykravt and which 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.409
 add block ore and no weapons this 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.030
 quite an interesting blog and we take 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.450
 amber that is amber 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 we put it here and we put amber on top 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:36.260
 device and started from this block of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.150
 Amber block sucked gas which 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.950
 spreads around and then this gas 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.930
 freezes and it turns out like this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.680
 crap and amber 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.799
 but we should not delude ourselves to this thing 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 no tools can not collect 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.270
 Well, I'm naturally creative, but guys 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.750
 even a diamond pick 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.240
 this will not contribute to us 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.640
 need to craft amber laser amber laser 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.650
 Dimber Well, no, no matter guys 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.830
 See Amber laser and right button 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.670
 mouse click and 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.910
 pass through amber but amber device 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.510
 dimber device we just remove immediately 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.390
 everything 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.160
 Here is such a thing and now let's 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.180
 look again you now understand what it is 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.160
 so this thing spreads it so 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.400
 she has several levels 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.190
 and so well, from 1 to 10 and let's us 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.470
 put 10 and all 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.200
 it started and we get out of here a little bit 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.690
 so that it will still be formed 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.270
 I'll tell you a little about other things 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.690
 so let's get here i hope 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.770
 this place is enough here stop here 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.459
 It also shows that there are several 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.820
 strips here let 's say here the first strip 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.770
 which immediately sucks us out and 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.870
 strip that sucks gas 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.390
 after about 30 seconds let's 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.180
 put and so here we put this on top 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.730
 nothing will happen but later well 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.760
 somewhere 30 seconds can be a little more 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.230
 a little less will begin the process of education 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.870
 amber let's 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.700
 look away again you remember that 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.519
 there is nothing and nothing yet 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.390
 started here we put here and go to 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:29.739
 next stripes we now have 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.260
 amber frets radio unlocker there is still 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.500
 one rim with these here with you 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.680
 witnessed gas but these suckers 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.709
 gas you see it started 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.540
 after about 30 seconds these suckers 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.000
 but beyond they can act at a distance 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.600
 well, let's put an ember put here 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 here this 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.720
 And not after 30 seconds, not immediately, it is not 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720
 triggered 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.959
 we come and remember everything 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.190
 Etel coordinates by right mouse button 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:02.720
 left 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:06.080
 here we press again and the process begins 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.390
 gas amber formation if such 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.930
 there is such a word and now let's 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:18.019
 go there and see what happened 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:21.709
 with our oh and someone and you feel nothing 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:26.570
 It did not happen no-no-no-no-no-no is 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:29.690
 let's go wrong let's go 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.430
 let's work here maybe because 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.760
 we left the chunk and he did not 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.930
 form but guys are so bad 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.880
 let me put records as soon as 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.130
 this is all formed i he we are actually 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.730
 the key 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.770
 then this damn our just like 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:51.740
 such crap we have formed from one 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.770
 small device but you see what 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.710
 it is solid then that is not a dome is not a vault 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.960
 some amber crown and actually 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.720
 from solid block and during formation 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.910
 no lag no lag no so 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.600
 that mod is very well optimized if 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.490
 there is such a word for modification 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.680
 optimization but here's all you actually 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.850
 understand what I am leading also you guys 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.680
 see what they supposedly grew in ontario 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.390
 cows and piglets 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.880
 they will not move from place but on 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.720
 the place is spinning 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.720
 also 66 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.440
 length as god all now vylez and i 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.240
 Iâ€™ll show you something else 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.680
 I will tell about this mod 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.650
 I hope you like him as much as I like 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.170
 like that around here as well but it Kiyan 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.480
 here you see she is like 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.800
 spread and in fact you by 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.880
 you understand what I mean 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.420
 right here is the ocean but it spreads and you 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:00.030
 see that he listened to water from him 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:02.340
 so here is such a thing here but well 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.000
 so in general, I do not know what about him 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.210
 can talk 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.830
 In principle, this mod has exhausted itself even 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.080
 Squidward nailed 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.090
