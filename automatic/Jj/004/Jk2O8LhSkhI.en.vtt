00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 so hold together and welcome 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.330
 to another small looks review 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.919
 finally again I have a lime cave there 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 I do not look at you for you 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:18.779
 would like to withhold and that looks yes 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:20.400
 right after the intro so we too 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.449
 home back welcome 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.850
 we are now pointing to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 single player and create a new one 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.740
 I just call it world here 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.289
 looks cool and we do one 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.079
 creative lab and that they do it all 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.390
 just keep testing and you see 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.250
 also what will happen then 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.980
 as the name implies 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.110
 it creates a survival map the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.760
 looks like this 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.730
 yes one has just one tree 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.559
 Sugar cane grass for wheat and one 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 gorge and in this gorge is to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.969
 for example coal and here 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.410
 I still have some iron on top 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.840
 Just now there is one more 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.579
 little iron and so on than that 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.469
 typical survival map and that should 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 actually something original on the water 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.949
 I find that cool, too 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.630
 it is not there at the beginning and then it works 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.340
 all of a sudden, anyway 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.049
 that looks pretty cool and here 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.979
 actually no land should come 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.460
 that I have not tried it yet 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.439
 but in any case you are here 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.390
 little foreclosed I say 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.240
 So I would say who ever has one 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.610
 wanted to have little survival with only 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.130
 a single tree is something like skype 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.650
 blog except that you just like more 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.119
 or just stop on an island and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.240
 of course you have the possibility 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.700
 Traveling coal and even diamonds 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.920
 drive if you are here anyway 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.020
 bottom penetration long does one 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.189
 Definitely in some mine yes 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.250
 otherwise there is nothing else 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.619
 special to say that I would 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.780
 simply times world say just once a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.659
 Give input looks and just enter yourself 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.090
 try out 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.859
 so that 's it again from 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.539
 this short looks review 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.039
 If you liked it I would 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.750
 happy about a thumbs up 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.310
 and if you have not done so yet 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.679
 Of course, I would also like one 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.049
 Absolutely happy if you any 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.100
 I also saw it for myself 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.929
 to introduce 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.160
 then you just write it 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.080
 in the comments 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.900
 and maybe we will find something there 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.000
 very cool, hopefully I'll make it 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.379
 we for this cool looks 15 likes 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.720
 I would be very happy 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.160
 and then I know that too 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.290
 to continue with it 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.910
 you can see me boys turning in a circle 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.620
 I'll just go outside 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.170
 because the weather is bad 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.920
 well, so have fun with yourself 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.840
 try out 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.670
 and, as I said, write your seat 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.040
 Just times in the comments would me 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.750
 very interested so that's it now 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.940
 So really, I'll say that until then 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.940
 stay when and thanks for seeing ciao
