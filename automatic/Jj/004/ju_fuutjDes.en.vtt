00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 let's see the 10 best animes of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.080
 fantasy the genre of fantasy is 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.059
 maybe one of the most used genres 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.860
 in general for both books and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.170
 for the cinema going through the series and 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.059
 the fantasy drawings allow them 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 create the world that you have in mind with 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.289
 the necessary skill are capable of 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.660
 imagine for a moment that he could or 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.939
 it could be real what we see is to say 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.949
 fantasy is saying a lot is not specific and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.660
 there are many series so I'm going to have 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.550
 the fact of not repeating series 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.940
 that they have already named in other lists and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.380
 from there to form this we begin 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.840
 already then this list in the post 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.250
 number 10 with spies and wolff the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.200
 story revolves around cra flowrence 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.280
 a traveling merchant traveling from a 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 town to another selling and buying 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.570
 various goods to make a living in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.760
 a medieval world where great guilds 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 they control trade between cities and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.020
 peoples your dream is to gather the money 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.570
 enough to be able to open their own 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.850
 shop one day like another meets with 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.920
 jor or a goddess with the shape of a girl of 15 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 years with ears and tail who decides 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 return since nobody believes in it anymore 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.460
 known for being the goddess that causes 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.750
 good harvests because of that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.580
 will accompany choir 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.230
 how the world has changed and where 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.540
 naturally they will have complications in 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.000
 the road a mixture of adventure and 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.410
 fantasy with touches of romance the part 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.580
 of the adventure is covered with the trip that 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.530
 they perform the two protagonists 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.110
 knowing new characters in each 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.640
 occasion the romance was also developed 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.830
 by the protagonists but without forcing 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 situations and an extra point for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.340
 strokes that is doing lawrence where 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.700
 a bad decision can end with 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.680
 all 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.600
 at number 9 we have the crazy 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.369
 horizon the story begins when 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.380
 30,000 Japanese players are left 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.530
 trapped in the fantasy world online 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.539
 the third block at the time was a 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.640
 escape route of the real world is now 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.500
 all the reality that you know homeless 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.030
 the protagonist tries to survive as 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.310
 can in this world next to his old 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.740
 friend naut sub and was precious killer 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.840
 akatsuki among all the series 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.460
 similar to this crazy horizon highlights 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.649
 for a more social approach and 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.630
 evolution the anime takes its time 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.490
 to boot and not only that but the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.590
 first episodes are pure cliches and 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.299
 hard something that makes up if we continue 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.709
 seeing it then as it goes 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.079
 we will see that it is unmarked in a way 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.000
 very different more than action you will see 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.739
 strategies but neither are they in plan 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.690
 like those of kira in the snow but 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.550
 small details 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.160
 at number 8 we have a wall 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.660
 frame in a post-apocalyptic world in the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.400
 that the great part of nature is 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.140
 most endangered human 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.660
 lives in absolute poverty and without 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.030
 But there are a few noblemen who 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.710
 can live like real kings the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.150
 scenario and the story itself is caught 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.830
 borrowed from the book of the moon which 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.510
 says that wolves are creatures 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.820
 mystics that came to earth from 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.770
 the paradise counting in addition that to achieve 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.500
 back together with the flower girl the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.210
 world would restart the series puts us 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.530
 initially in a desolate world in the 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.080
 that you breathe a deep air of 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.850
 disenchantment fear and uncertainty 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.710
 the protagonists are naturally wolves 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.840
 who pose as humans so that 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.520
 do not kill us hunters however 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.140
 your trip will not be easy since after 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.970
 I knew the girl and the others 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.800
 Wolves will be chased by a hunter 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.370
 who knows that they are really wolves 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.200
 at number 7 we have 60 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.820
 prequel of the anime faith stay night that 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.230
 takes place 10 years before the story 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.910
 that there is told so 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.530
 chronologically it should be seen in this 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.480
 order and not only that but in question 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.280
 to catch the viewer is what 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.050
 much better the argument tells us the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.760
 fourth war for the holy grail and 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.800
 that among all the most powerful magicians 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.210
 World 's only seven of them will 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.800
 invoke the seven spirits to 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.320
 start a fight to the death to 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.880
 get the grail here it is told that 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.640
 this relic is able to grant the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.990
 victor any desire the first thing that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.120
 the attention of this series is its 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.740
 awesome animation with what you already 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.810
 you can imagine the good scenes of 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.610
 action that the script leaves is paused and 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.350
 fairly measured do not present the story 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.880
 in a fast way which results in 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.940
 that the characters develop well 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.250
 as much as possible in the position 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.540
 number 6 we have mai and aladdin is a 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.130
 boy who has been exploring the world 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.650
 after having been locked in a 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.330
 room most of his life in 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.950
 shortly you will discover that it is a plus and 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.600
 who was born to choose kings who 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.160
 follow a fair path and fight 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.380
 against those who want to destroy the 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.150
 I usually talk about animes that 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.860
 hook at the beginning well in this 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.760
 case we have a series that accomplishes what 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.010
 same but during 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.299
 all the chapters the story then 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.040
 start that way with our 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.920
 main character to the dim of 10 years 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.840
 coming out to the surface for the first time 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.160
 at number 5 we have a high 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.360
 banner in mail 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.010
 begins in a way in which the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.050
 protagonist will be as confused as 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.210
 you and part of there precisely the grace 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.160
 of the series discover together with traca the 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.570
 world around you or part of it that 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.640
 when he goes abroad he discovers that 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.230
 can go beyond the walls 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.990
 known as all are the only 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.370
 able to leave and enter you can see 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.170
 as in the series they play themes something 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.870
 deep as the psychology philosophy 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.430
 religion and death in which in many 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.470
 cases you will have to give your own 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.940
 interpretation mystery and fantasy 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.650
 in the series is a constant if 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.450
 you enjoy with it is the best for you 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.040
 maybe I would not recommend it to those 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.660
 people who like it all 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.490
 explained 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.890
 in position number 4 we have the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.020
 guardian of the sacred spirit once 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.100
 every 100 years an aquatic demon puts 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.270
 an egg on a person who 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.190
 will become the guardian of the 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.900
 demons this time the 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.730
 responsibility falls on sahagun the 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.590
 second prince of the empire but 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.650
 naturally the journey and the life of 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.090
 chacun will not be easy depending on the 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.040
 way that you like the speed in 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.990
 the development of the plot you will find 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.370
 that this anime is slow the funny thing is 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.080
 that although the series has a lot of action 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.330
 stands out more in the moments where 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.590
 we know more about the other characters 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.180
 point to highlight is the amount of 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.950
 details and cultural references that 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.290
 provoke a very realistic atmosphere despite 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.970
 the amount of fantasy in which in addition 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.620
 It is not complicated to immerse yourself in 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.510
 history 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.290
 in position number 3 we have the no 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.880
 steel in 1972 a portal is discovered in 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.410
 the surface of the moon thanks to which 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.570
 humanity comes in contact with the 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.490
 inhabitants of Mars after a first 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.990
 conflict the moon partially ended 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.970
 devastated and with a lot of 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.860
 dead event that was called heaven 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.320
 the world what it gives that things are 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.030
 very tense between Mars and Earth in 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.320
 marte the princess pensa lusia is engaged 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.389
 to the earth as ambassador of peace 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.010
 when the attack suffers the trigger 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.720
 perfect to break the calm between 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.449
 both sides and give rise to the first 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.090
 space war of humanity for 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.650
 many one of the best animes of 2014 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.180
 maybe not the best works of 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.070
 Cuchi genre and the story has 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.990
 important ups and downs but it saves 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.460
 pretty good thanks to the animation and 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.950
 that usually every chapter you 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.750
 will leave ready to see the next 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.330
 in position number 2 we have natsumi 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.950
 using show the story focuses on a 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.620
 orphan teenager called natsume 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.150
 takashi natsume in appearance alone is a 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.280
 normal boy but has the ability to 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.620
 see spirits a power that he inherited from his 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.150
 grandmother reiko after his death 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.740
 rayco bequeaths to her grandson 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.240
 book of friends a book that 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.490
 contains the names of the spirits 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.600
