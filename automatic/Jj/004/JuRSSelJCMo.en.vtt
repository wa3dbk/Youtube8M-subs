the free printable and lastly I actually
forgot<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.009> videotape<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.119> need

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
forgot to videotape this but you need

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.710 
forgot to videotape this but you need
plastic<00:01:54.750> wrap

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.210 

so<00:01:58.720> I'm<00:01:58.960> just<00:01:59.140> going<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.409> start<00:01:59.650> by<00:01:59.800> taking<00:01:59.920> a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
so I'm just going to start by taking a

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.399 
so I'm just going to start by taking a
big<00:02:00.460> square<00:02:00.909> piece<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.270> aluminum<00:02:01.960> foil<00:02:02.200> and

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
big square piece of aluminum foil and

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.219 
big square piece of aluminum foil and
placing<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:03.070> over<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.580> old<00:02:03.880> pan

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
placing this over the old pan

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.570 
placing this over the old pan
increasingly<00:02:05.229> at<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.590> edges<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.340> looks

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
increasingly at the edges so it looks

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.980 
increasingly at the edges so it looks
something<00:02:06.760> like<00:02:06.970> this<00:02:07.240> but<00:02:07.450> it<00:02:07.570> doesn't<00:02:07.900> have

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
something like this but it doesn't have

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.139 
something like this but it doesn't have
to<00:02:08.110> be<00:02:08.229> perfect<00:02:08.679> now<00:02:09.369> I'm<00:02:09.580> going<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.850> take<00:02:10.000> my

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
to be perfect now I'm going to take my

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.760 
to be perfect now I'm going to take my
cooking<00:02:10.420> spray<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.899> just<00:02:10.929> spray<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.440> whole

cut that in half again to create a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.580 
cut that in half again to create a
rectangular<00:03:28.150> shape<00:03:28.570> and<00:03:28.870> now<00:03:29.230> I'm<00:03:29.320> going<00:03:29.530> to

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
rectangular shape and now I'm going to

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.110 
rectangular shape and now I'm going to
stick<00:03:29.769> my<00:03:29.799> fork<00:03:29.950> straight<00:03:30.459> into<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.760> center

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
of the rectangular of the rectangle so

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.039 
of the rectangular of the rectangle so
it<00:03:33.519> looks<00:03:33.730> something<00:03:33.970> like<00:03:34.150> this

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
it looks something like this

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.350 
it looks something like this
and<00:03:35.680> set<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.340> aside<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:36.910> that<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.120> can<00:03:37.239> go

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
square out of the plastic wrap but you

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.240 
square out of the plastic wrap but you
want<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.380> make<00:03:41.560> sure<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.860> little<00:03:42.100> bigger

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
want to make sure it's a little bigger

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.069

and<00:03:44.170> I<00:03:44.260> had<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.530> cut<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.709> bigger<00:03:44.950> one<00:03:45.190> later<00:03:45.519> but

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
and I had to cut a bigger one later but

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.420 
and I had to cut a bigger one later but
now<00:03:46.510> set<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:46.780> aside<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.440> cut<00:03:47.920> about<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.130> foot

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.270 
now set that aside and cut about a foot
long<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.880> twine<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.750> now<00:03:50.650> I'm<00:03:50.799> going<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.070> stick

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
long of twine and now I'm going to stick

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.949 
long of twine and now I'm going to stick
my<00:03:51.310> Rice<00:03:51.579> Krispie<00:03:51.940> stick<00:03:52.209> into<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.570> center<00:03:52.930> of

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
my Rice Krispie stick into the center of

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.860

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
the plastic wrap is right together so

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.030 
the plastic wrap is right together so
something<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.440> but<00:03:56.650> if<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.830> need<00:03:56.950> to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
something like this but if you need to

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.199 
something like this but if you need to
trim<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.400> then<00:03:57.519> you<00:03:57.610> can<00:03:57.730> go<00:03:57.849> ahead<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.120> do

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
trim it then you can go ahead and do
