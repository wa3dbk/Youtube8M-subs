this<00:01:58.549> time<00:01:58.759> around<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:59.180> aside<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.659> really<00:01:59.900> try

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
this time around it aside to really try

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.219 
this time around it aside to really try
out<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.470> shotgun<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.840> really

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
out the shotgun it's a really

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.719 
out the shotgun it's a really
devastating<00:02:03.560> weapon<00:02:04.250> like<00:02:04.369> i<00:02:04.399> said<00:02:04.640> before

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
devastating weapon like i said before

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.340 
devastating weapon like i said before
but<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.210> really<00:02:05.420> need<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.810> control<00:02:06.170> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
but you really need to control the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.139 
but you really need to control the
engagement<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.009> i'm<00:02:07.130> really<00:02:07.369> raft<00:02:07.790> like<00:02:08.119> a

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
engagement and i'm really raft like a

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.359 
engagement and i'm really raft like a
lot<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.479> meat<00:02:08.630> a<00:02:08.989> lot<00:02:09.319> of<00:02:09.470> these<00:02:09.560> deaths<00:02:09.950> and

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
lot of meat a lot of these deaths and

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.520 
lot of meat a lot of these deaths and
this<00:02:10.789> particular<00:02:11.120> match<00:02:11.480> could<00:02:12.170> have<00:02:12.380> been

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
this particular match could have been

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.160 
this particular match could have been
avoided<00:02:12.800> if<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.370> stuck<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.209> just<00:02:14.540> close<00:02:14.780> range

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
avoided if I stuck to just close range

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.729 
avoided if I stuck to just close range
and<00:02:15.530> in<00:02:16.280> these<00:02:16.489> tight<00:02:16.819> sort<00:02:17.209> of<00:02:17.300> hallways<00:02:17.780> but

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
and in these tight sort of hallways but

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.330 
and in these tight sort of hallways but
you<00:02:18.830> know<00:02:18.950> what<00:02:19.130> I<00:02:19.160> grew<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> bit<00:02:20.360> overzealous

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
you know what I grew a bit overzealous

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.740 
you know what I grew a bit overzealous
it<00:02:22.340> was<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:22.580> four<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> morning<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:23.540> I

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
it was like four in the morning so I

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.900 
it was like four in the morning so I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
didn't have a sort of coherent thought

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.660 
didn't have a sort of coherent thought
process<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:26.900> my<00:02:27.019> brain<00:02:27.260> like<00:02:27.530> oh<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.280> thought

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
process in my brain like oh I thought

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.509 
process in my brain like oh I thought

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
could get the spaz I would with it but

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.600 
could get the spaz I would with it but

okay<00:02:46.209> as<00:02:47.209> long<00:02:47.420> as<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.630> don't<00:02:47.780> face<00:02:48.110> against

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
okay as long as you don't face against

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.550 
okay as long as you don't face against
multiple<00:02:49.010> people<00:02:49.640> you're<00:02:50.569> really<00:02:50.810> safe<00:02:51.260> I

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
multiple people you're really safe I

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.920 
multiple people you're really safe I
mean<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.069> think<00:02:52.160> two<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.700> probably<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.360> max<00:02:53.660> you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
mean I think two is probably the max you

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.900 
mean I think two is probably the max you
want<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.200> fight<00:02:54.410> against<00:02:54.739> at<00:02:55.010> any<00:02:55.220> given<00:02:55.700> time

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
want to fight against at any given time

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.550 
want to fight against at any given time
since<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:57.200> can<00:02:57.380> pretty<00:02:57.680> much<00:02:57.769> kill<00:02:58.130> someone

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
since you can pretty much kill someone

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.069 
since you can pretty much kill someone
with<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> shotgun<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.250> one<00:03:01.430> blast<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:02.600> if<00:03:02.840> you

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
with a shotgun in one blast but if you

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.410 
with a shotgun in one blast but if you
do<00:03:03.290> end<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:04.070> in<00:03:04.250> an<00:03:04.340> engagement<00:03:04.700> against<00:03:05.209> like

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
do end up in an engagement against like

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.090 
do end up in an engagement against like
maybe<00:03:05.660> three<00:03:06.170> people<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.739> could<00:03:06.829> probably

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
maybe three people you could probably

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.759 
maybe three people you could probably
end<00:03:07.340> up<00:03:07.459> knifing<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.060> third<00:03:08.299> individual<00:03:08.900> if

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
end up knifing the third individual if

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.490 
end up knifing the third individual if
you're<00:03:10.609> savvy<00:03:10.940> like<00:03:11.239> me<00:03:11.420> or<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:11.810> other

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
you're savvy like me or like other

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.770

basically my general tips and strategies

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.690 
basically my general tips and strategies
are<00:03:25.459> using<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.940> shotgun<00:03:26.450> otherwise<00:03:27.640> if<00:03:28.640> you

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
are using the shotgun otherwise if you

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.340 
are using the shotgun otherwise if you
have<00:03:29.120> this<00:03:29.299> urge<00:03:29.600> just<00:03:30.140> rush<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.070> yes<00:03:32.350> and

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
have this urge just rush and yes and

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.400 
have this urge just rush and yes and
then<00:03:33.500> just<00:03:33.739> inflict<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.730> much<00:03:34.870> devastation<00:03:35.870> on

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
then just inflict so much devastation on

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.160 
then just inflict so much devastation on
to<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.160> enemy<00:03:37.519> team<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.000> advisee<00:03:38.540> these<00:03:38.930> two
