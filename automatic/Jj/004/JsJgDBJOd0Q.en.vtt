00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.439 
the day so let's see I have one fuel
point<00:00:59.589> on<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.100> black<00:01:00.370> one<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:02.309> still<00:01:03.309> 0<00:01:03.729> on

point on the black one and still 0 on
the<00:01:04.680> white<00:01:05.680> one<00:01:05.920> so<00:01:06.190> just<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.610> even<00:01:06.789> it<00:01:07.060> out

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
the white one so just to even it out

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.690 
the white one so just to even it out
let's<00:01:07.479> see<00:01:07.690> if<00:01:07.780> they<00:01:07.990> did<00:01:08.530> anything<00:01:08.770> there<00:01:09.580> we

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
go so I have one fuel point on both now

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.179 
go so I have one fuel point on both now
and<00:01:12.689> I'm<00:01:13.689> basically<00:01:13.869> going<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.560> test<00:01:14.979> these

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
and I'm basically going to test these

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.279 
and I'm basically going to test these
for<00:01:15.729> about<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:17.140> day<00:01:17.439> and<00:01:18.659> report<00:01:19.659> back<00:01:19.720> with<00:01:20.080> the

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
fuel numbers from deej hand all right

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.139 
fuel numbers from deej hand all right
take<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:23.979> easy

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.200 

the<00:01:29.149> beginning<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.539> the<00:01:29.630> word<00:01:29.780> come

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.730 

36<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.580> hand

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.980 

56

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.850 

these<00:01:46.320> days

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.220 

and<00:01:50.950> 56<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.200> just<00:01:53.470> finished<00:01:53.740> my<00:01:53.890> workout<00:01:54.280> and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
and 56 so just finished my workout and

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.060 
and 56 so just finished my workout and
left<00:01:55.380> hands<00:01:55.620> reading

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
left hands reading

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:07.849 
left hands reading
1836<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.679> right<00:02:01.859> hand<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:04.100> 1888<00:02:05.990> 1936<00:02:06.990> 1880s

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
1836 and I right hand is 1888 1936 1880s

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:12.650 
1836 and I right hand is 1888 1936 1880s
50<00:02:08.250> fuel<00:02:08.670> points<00:02:09.030> off<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:11.009> am<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> right-handed

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
50 fuel points off I am a right-handed

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.010 
50 fuel points off I am a right-handed
person<00:02:12.840> yet

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.150 

I<00:02:20.080> guess

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.940 

I<00:02:23.250> don't<00:02:23.820> think<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.240> worked<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.230> legs<00:02:25.530> today<00:02:25.800> so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
I don't think I worked out legs today so

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.800 
I don't think I worked out legs today so
I<00:02:26.160> don't<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:26.520> that

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
I don't think that

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.620 
I don't think that
favored<00:02:28.349> one<00:02:28.590> hand<00:02:28.860> over<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.250> other<00:02:29.370> but

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
favored one hand over the other but

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.530 
favored one hand over the other but
there's<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.720> results

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:44.410 

1836<00:02:40.480> 1889<00:02:41.950> take<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.040> easy<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.150> just

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
1836 1889 take it easy so I just

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.150 
1836 1889 take it easy so I just
finished<00:02:44.720> my<00:02:44.930> playing<00:02:45.920> ball<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:47.440> here<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.740> I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
finished my playing ball and here is I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.470 
finished my playing ball and here is I
feel<00:02:50.090> Ben<00:02:50.360> scores<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.990> I'm<00:02:51.050> right<00:02:51.410> handed<00:02:51.590> so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
feel Ben scores and I'm right handed so

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.550 
feel Ben scores and I'm right handed so
probably<00:02:53.480> my<00:02:53.660> right<00:02:53.900> hand<00:02:54.200> should<00:02:54.380> have<00:02:54.500> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
probably my right hand should have a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:15.230 
probably my right hand should have a
higher<00:02:54.770> score<00:02:55.720> let's<00:02:56.720> see

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:24.300 

3697<00:03:17.340> vs

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.670 

37<00:03:25.310> 46
