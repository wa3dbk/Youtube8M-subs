hi my name is Vince from mr. telephone

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.710 
hi my name is Vince from mr. telephone
and<00:00:05.740> town<00:00:05.890> I'm<00:00:06.130> going<00:00:06.340> to<00:00:06.399> talk<00:00:06.550> about<00:00:06.720> IR

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
and town I'm going to talk about IR

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.199 
and town I'm going to talk about IR
emitters<00:00:08.320> and<00:00:08.350> receivers<00:00:09.250> so<00:00:09.700> here's<00:00:10.150> a

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
emitters and receivers so here's a

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.779 
emitters and receivers so here's a
little<00:00:10.389> unit<00:00:10.840> we<00:00:10.959> have<00:00:11.199> the<00:00:11.440> IR<00:00:12.070> receivers<00:00:12.670> on

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:12.789 
little unit we have the IR receivers on

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:14.549 
little unit we have the IR receivers on
this<00:00:12.940> side<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.389> the<00:00:13.510> admittance<00:00:14.080> on<00:00:14.289> this

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
this side and the admittance on this

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.519 
this side and the admittance on this
side<00:00:14.799> and<00:00:15.039> this<00:00:15.520> one<00:00:16.000> here<00:00:16.240> is<00:00:16.270> the<00:00:16.690> adapter

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
side and this one here is the adapter

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.769 
side and this one here is the adapter
for<00:00:17.560> there<00:00:17.859> the<00:00:18.550> plug<00:00:19.060> to<00:00:19.210> give<00:00:19.359> the<00:00:19.480> unit

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
for there the plug to give the unit

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.349 
for there the plug to give the unit
power<00:00:20.050> now<00:00:20.769> we're<00:00:21.039> an<00:00:21.189> emitter<00:00:21.609> is<00:00:21.999> what<00:00:22.240> you

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
power now we're an emitter is what you

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.810 
power now we're an emitter is what you
would<00:00:22.480> place<00:00:22.779> on<00:00:23.140> your<00:00:23.650> piece<00:00:24.009> of<00:00:24.220> equipment

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
would place on your piece of equipment

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.810 
would place on your piece of equipment
and<00:00:25.089> you<00:00:26.050> would<00:00:26.230> put<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.560> receivers<00:00:27.249> on<00:00:27.460> your

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
and you would put the receivers on your

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.450 
and you would put the receivers on your
TV<00:00:28.329> so<00:00:28.839> for<00:00:29.109> example<00:00:29.529> you<00:00:29.650> would<00:00:29.769> use<00:00:29.980> this<00:00:30.220> if

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
TV so for example you would use this if

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.360 
TV so for example you would use this if
you<00:00:30.789> had<00:00:30.999> like<00:00:31.599> in<00:00:31.839> the<00:00:32.110> example<00:00:32.560> here<00:00:32.590> if<00:00:32.980> you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
you had like in the example here if you

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.100 
you had like in the example here if you
had<00:00:33.520> all<00:00:33.760> your<00:00:33.910> equipment<00:00:34.420> under<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.780> stairs

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
had all your equipment under the stairs

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.980 
had all your equipment under the stairs
and<00:00:35.470> your<00:00:36.310> TVs<00:00:36.820> are<00:00:37.120> all<00:00:37.270> dotted<00:00:37.630> around<00:00:37.750> the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
and your TVs are all dotted around the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.440 
and your TVs are all dotted around the
house<00:00:38.230> now<00:00:38.770> these<00:00:39.220> units<00:00:39.490> here<00:00:39.850> normally<00:00:40.270> come

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
house now these units here normally come

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.480 
house now these units here normally come
with<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.900> leads<00:00:41.320> might<00:00:41.560> be<00:00:41.770> five<00:00:42.070> or<00:00:42.100> ten

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:42.490 
with the leads might be five or ten

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.190 
with the leads might be five or ten
meters<00:00:42.850> but<00:00:43.090> they're<00:00:43.420> never<00:00:43.630> enough<00:00:43.870> to<00:00:44.050> get

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
meters but they're never enough to get

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.710 
meters but they're never enough to get
back<00:00:44.410> to<00:00:44.650> under<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.010> stairs<00:00:45.310> also<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:46.120> wires

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
back to under the stairs also the wires

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.060 
back to under the stairs also the wires
are<00:00:46.900> quite<00:00:47.080> fragile<00:00:47.290> so<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:47.770> won't<00:00:47.950> really

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
are quite fragile so you won't really

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.590 
are quite fragile so you won't really
want<00:00:48.310> to<00:00:48.370> be<00:00:48.430> running<00:00:48.580> them<00:00:48.820> under<00:00:49.480> the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
want to be running them under the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.990 
want to be running them under the
floorboards<00:00:50.470> and<00:00:50.590> under<00:00:50.740> the<00:00:50.830> carpet<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:51.610> what

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
floorboards and under the carpet so what

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.820 
floorboards and under the carpet so what
I've<00:00:52.090> done<00:00:52.240> here<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:52.870> I've<00:00:53.200> actually<00:00:53.350> run<00:00:53.680> it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
I've done here is I've actually run it

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.220 
I've done here is I've actually run it
all<00:00:53.980> down<00:00:54.310> my<00:00:54.520> network<00:00:54.970> wiring<00:00:55.300> so<00:00:55.750> my<00:00:55.930> my

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
all down my network wiring so my my

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.400 
all down my network wiring so my my
cat5e<00:00:56.830> network<00:00:57.820> wiring<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:58.840> basically<00:00:59.200> you've

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
cat5e network wiring so basically you've

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.080 
cat5e network wiring so basically you've
got<00:00:59.560> your<00:00:59.680> emitters<00:01:00.010> here<00:01:00.250> this<00:01:00.430> is<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.610> Virgin

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
got your emitters here this is a Virgin

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.360 
got your emitters here this is a Virgin
Media<00:01:01.330> set-top<00:01:01.750> box<00:01:02.020> now<00:01:02.650> I've<00:01:03.010> had<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.250> put

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
Media set-top box now I've had to put

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.979 
Media set-top box now I've had to put
two<00:01:03.550> on<00:01:03.580> here<00:01:03.880> because<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.089> couldn't<00:01:04.360> quite<00:01:04.689> get

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
two on here because I couldn't quite get

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.330 
two on here because I couldn't quite get
the<00:01:05.170> exact<00:01:05.860> points<00:01:06.340> for<00:01:07.149> to<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:09.009> pushes

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
the exact points for to that this pushes

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.310 
the exact points for to that this pushes
out<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.490> signal<00:01:09.909> exactly<00:01:10.420> find<00:01:10.659> it<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:10.899> I've

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
out a signal exactly find it so I've

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.620 
out a signal exactly find it so I've
used<00:01:11.380> two<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:12.100> them<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:12.670> works<00:01:13.119> it<00:01:13.450> works

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
used two of them and it works it works

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.179 
used two of them and it works it works
perfectly<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.380> basically<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.770> emitters<00:01:15.070> go

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
perfectly so basically the emitters go

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.340 
perfectly so basically the emitters go
over<00:01:15.429> here<00:01:15.609> into<00:01:15.909> here<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.749> now<00:01:17.049> on<00:01:17.229> the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
over here into here and now on the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.580 
over here into here and now on the
receiver<00:01:17.740> side<00:01:18.100> if<00:01:18.399> your<00:01:19.090> pieces<00:01:19.569> of<00:01:19.780> if<00:01:20.439> your

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
receiver side if your pieces of if your

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.440 
receiver side if your pieces of if your
TVs<00:01:20.950> were<00:01:21.159> right<00:01:21.399> next<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.759> this<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.240> could

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
TVs were right next to this you could

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.760 
TVs were right next to this you could
just<00:01:22.630> plug<00:01:23.079> them<00:01:23.229> straight<00:01:23.499> into<00:01:23.679> the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
just plug them straight into the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.830 
just plug them straight into the
receivers<00:01:24.249> but<00:01:24.399> in<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:25.060> instance<00:01:25.270> they're

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
receivers but in this instance they're

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.359 
receivers but in this instance they're
they're<00:01:26.319> not<00:01:26.530> so<00:01:26.740> what<00:01:26.859> I've<00:01:26.950> had<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.069> do<00:01:27.249> is

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
they're not so what I've had to do is

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.620 
they're not so what I've had to do is
I've<00:01:27.609> had<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:27.969> make<00:01:28.119> up<00:01:28.240> my<00:01:28.299> own<00:01:28.539> little<00:01:28.979> yeah

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I've had to make up my own little yeah

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.999 
I've had to make up my own little yeah
rj45<00:01:31.630> jacks<00:01:31.899> on<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.139> end<00:01:32.259> of<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.469> lead<00:01:32.649> so<00:01:32.859> if

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
rj45 jacks on the end of the lead so if

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.020 
rj45 jacks on the end of the lead so if
we<00:01:33.159> go<00:01:33.280> over<00:01:34.109> over<00:01:35.109> here<00:01:35.560> we<00:01:36.009> can<00:01:36.159> see<00:01:36.490> that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
we go over over here we can see that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.099 
we go over over here we can see that
this<00:01:37.600> one<00:01:37.840> here<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.619> di<00:01:38.829> our<00:01:39.130> receiver<00:01:39.579> so<00:01:40.389> if<00:01:40.869> I

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
this one here is di our receiver so if I

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.830 
this one here is di our receiver so if I
unplug<00:01:41.289> that<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:42.219> can<00:01:42.399> have<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> look<00:01:42.969> all<00:01:43.600> I've

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
unplug that you can have a look all I've

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.980 
unplug that you can have a look all I've
done<00:01:44.020> is<00:01:44.229> I've<00:01:44.799> cut<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.639> wires<00:01:46.179> off<00:01:46.479> and<00:01:46.780> I've

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.889 
done is I've cut the wires off and I've
put<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.469> the<00:01:48.249> ring<00:01:48.459> in<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.670> tip<00:01:48.939> two<00:01:49.209> pins<00:01:49.450> 4

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
put the the ring in the tip two pins 4

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:56.699 
put the the ring in the tip two pins 4
and<00:01:50.109> 5<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.179> can<00:01:52.389> see<00:01:52.569> that<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:56.259> two<00:01:56.469> pins

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:56.709 
and 5 and you can see that as two pins

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.319 
and 5 and you can see that as two pins
four<00:01:56.979> or<00:01:57.130> five<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.880> I've<00:01:58.149> put<00:01:58.359> the<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.969> shield

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
four or five and I've put the the shield

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.190 
four or five and I've put the the shield
in<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.779> ground<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.679> where<00:02:03.069> to<00:02:03.969> pin<00:02:04.270> eight<00:02:04.539> the

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
in the ground to where to pin eight the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.349 
in the ground to where to pin eight the
reason<00:02:05.469> that<00:02:05.560> it's<00:02:05.709> four<00:02:06.130> or<00:02:06.279> five<00:02:06.549> is<00:02:06.850> because

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
reason that it's four or five is because

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.270 
reason that it's four or five is because
it's<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.569> twisted<00:02:07.990> pair<00:02:08.229> on<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.800> network

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
it's a twisted pair on the network

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.809 
it's a twisted pair on the network
wiring<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.659> ends<00:02:10.899> up<00:02:10.959> pushing<00:02:11.349> down<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
wiring that it ends up pushing down the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.750 
wiring that it ends up pushing down the
blue<00:02:12.819> pair<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.299> wires<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.349> yes<00:02:15.310> if<00:02:15.519> you<00:02:15.610> just

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
blue pair of wires so yes if you just

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.200 
blue pair of wires so yes if you just
crimp<00:02:15.970> up

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
crimp up

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.820 
crimp up
I go<00:02:16.420> on<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> end<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.290> might<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.680> put

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
I go on to the end you might have to put

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.410 
I go on to the end you might have to put
a<00:02:17.860> little<00:02:18.010> bit<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.370> plastic<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.910> put<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> little

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
a little bit of plastic I put a little

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.130 
a little bit of plastic I put a little
bit<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:20.320> little<00:02:20.620> bit<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.920> sleeve<00:02:21.250> from<00:02:21.700> some

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
bit of a little bit of sleeve from some

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.900 
bit of a little bit of sleeve from some
telephone<00:02:23.140> cable<00:02:23.560> just<00:02:23.740> ran<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> there<00:02:24.190> too<00:02:24.430> to

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
telephone cable just ran it there too to

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.850 
telephone cable just ran it there too to
make<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.330> a<00:02:25.360> little<00:02:25.840> bit<00:02:25.960> wider<00:02:26.140> because<00:02:26.470> these

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
make it a little bit wider because these

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.920 
make it a little bit wider because these
plugs<00:02:27.220> are<00:02:27.370> really<00:02:27.580> only<00:02:27.700> use<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.420> cat5e

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
plugs are really only use for cat5e

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.660 
plugs are really only use for cat5e
wiring<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.010> obviously<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.910> little<00:02:31.030> 3.5<00:02:32.670> audio

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670

jack<00:02:33.910> cables<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.480> bit<00:02:34.630> small<00:02:34.900> when<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.140> goes

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
jack cables a bit small when it goes

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.780 
jack cables a bit small when it goes
into<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:35.800> by<00:02:36.070> doing<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.610> works

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
into it but by doing this it works

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.340 
into it but by doing this it works
absolute<00:02:37.210> treat<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.690> what<00:02:37.870> happens<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.230> it

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
absolute treat so what happens is it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.400 
absolute treat so what happens is it
goes<00:02:38.470> through<00:02:38.530> here<00:02:39.130> it<00:02:39.880> goes<00:02:40.030> down<00:02:40.300> my<00:02:40.570> cat<00:02:40.990> 5e

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
goes through here it goes down my cat 5e

goes through here it goes down my cat 5e
cable<00:02:41.440> in<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.550> comes<00:02:42.790> out<00:02:43.030> by<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.510> TV<00:02:43.780> in

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
cable in and it comes out by the TV in

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.290 
cable in and it comes out by the TV in
that<00:02:44.350> particular<00:02:44.650> room<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:45.670> there<00:02:46.060> I'll

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
that particular room and then there I'll

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.030 
that particular room and then there I'll
show<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:46.960> a<00:02:47.020> minute<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:47.440> yeah<00:02:47.890> I've

show you that in a minute so yeah I've
done<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.310> too<00:02:48.580> server<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.090> there's<00:02:49.270> one<00:02:49.510> this

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
done that too server so there's one this

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.660 
done that too server so there's one this
one<00:02:50.170> going<00:02:50.320> here<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.710> one<00:02:50.860> TV<00:02:51.250> there's<00:02:51.490> another

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
one going here to one TV there's another

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.790 
one going here to one TV there's another
going<00:02:51.880> here<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.240> another<00:02:52.480> TV<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.560> works

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
going here to another TV and it works

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.010 
going here to another TV and it works
that<00:02:54.100> works<00:02:54.310> absolutely<00:02:54.550> fine<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:55.330> said<00:02:55.600> this

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
that works absolutely fine I said this

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.570 
that works absolutely fine I said this
end<00:02:56.230> we're<00:02:56.350> at<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> TV<00:02:56.920> end<00:02:57.130> this<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.430> where

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
end we're at the TV end this is where

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.640 
end we're at the TV end this is where
the<00:02:57.640> IR<00:02:58.120> receiver<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.870> infrared<00:02:59.140> receiver

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the IR receiver is the infrared receiver

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.340 
the IR receiver is the infrared receiver
now<00:03:00.520> it's<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.480> mirror<00:03:01.690> image<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.080> what<00:03:02.140> you've

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
now it's a mirror image of what you've

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.450 
now it's a mirror image of what you've
just<00:03:02.380> seen<00:03:02.680> under<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> stairs

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
just seen under the stairs

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.130 
just seen under the stairs
so<00:03:03.970> I've<00:03:04.240> plugged<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.600> into<00:03:04.750> my<00:03:04.930> network

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
so I've plugged it into my network

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.410 
so I've plugged it into my network
wiring<00:03:05.770> here<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.220> I've<00:03:06.610> made<00:03:06.820> up<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.150> little

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
wiring here and I've made up this little

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.890 
wiring here and I've made up this little
lead<00:03:07.770> so<00:03:08.770> I<00:03:09.040> bought<00:03:09.460> myself<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.850> 3.5<00:03:10.450> stereo

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
lead so I bought myself a 3.5 stereo

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.490 
lead so I bought myself a 3.5 stereo
jack

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
jack

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.860 
jack
and<00:03:11.740> I've<00:03:12.010> crimped<00:03:12.460> on<00:03:12.550> an<00:03:12.670> rj45<00:03:13.150> plug<00:03:13.540> onto

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
and I've crimped on an rj45 plug onto

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.320 
and I've crimped on an rj45 plug onto
the<00:03:13.960> end<00:03:14.110> again<00:03:14.590> using<00:03:15.010> pins<00:03:15.310> four<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.060> five

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
the end again using pins four and five

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.930 
the end again using pins four and five
and<00:03:16.930> I've<00:03:17.290> put<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.620> sleeve<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.010> ground<00:03:18.610> on

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
and I've put the sleeve the ground on

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.200 
and I've put the sleeve the ground on
pin<00:03:19.510> eight<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:21.040> exactly<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.730> same<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:22.090> what

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
pin eight so exactly the same as what

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.850 
pin eight so exactly the same as what
you've<00:03:22.330> just<00:03:22.360> seen<00:03:22.630> under<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.930> stairs<00:03:23.290> but

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
you've just seen under the stairs but

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.400 
you've just seen under the stairs but
this<00:03:24.070> one<00:03:24.310> has<00:03:24.550> a<00:03:24.760> socket<00:03:25.150> on<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.540> end<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.900> not

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
this one has a socket on the end and not

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.820 
this one has a socket on the end and not
a<00:03:26.440> plug<00:03:26.830> so<00:03:27.070> when<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.000> plug<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.300> into<00:03:28.390> there

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
a plug so when you plug it into there

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.070 
a plug so when you plug it into there
plug<00:03:29.830> it<00:03:29.950> into<00:03:30.070> here<00:03:30.490> that<00:03:31.450> should<00:03:31.720> now<00:03:31.900> become

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
plug it into here that should now become
