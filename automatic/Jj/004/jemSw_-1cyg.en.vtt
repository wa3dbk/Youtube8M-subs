00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.290
 now here we have a product of 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.560
 Gemini 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.290
 it's very, very, very, very innovative 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.530
 it's a kind of all in one can not 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.800
 missing in the rack of any dj of the cmp 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.869
 1,400 professionals who have the 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.590
 particularity that is a rack unit 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.060
 very very young and allows us to read if it is 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.110
 mp3 audio 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.980
 so much 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:36.050
 in the traditional method I decided in the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.810
 pendrive has the usb switch if the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.920
 classic repeat time and zynga buttons 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.920
 It has remote control included and 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.420
 this is very very practical the issue that 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.399
 have a master in the module in the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.679
 compactera both audio output 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.059
 or for the microphone that can be 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:04.930
 connect from front or back 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:06.980
 and then we have in the back and the folder 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.900
 search 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:15.440
 in the show mode and the loop in out and the 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.980
 loop after the classic play and I want and 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:24.240
 pits 8 16 and 24 % 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:28.240
 with a pit friend and pitch designation 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.990
 analog in shock mode 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.990
 we light 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.380
 work as with a kind of check 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.320
 we are going to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.190
 to enter 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.190
 pendrive 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:52.000
 if we are going to try it 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:55.200
 the two methods in this case we have the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 usb selector 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.890
 i 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.570
 then we are going to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.950
 to put in mode 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.950
 we have the yes mode 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.430
 with the display it looks like this because it has the 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.430
 Factory protective finish 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.379
 good and the use is like any 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.240
 compactera I can look for the beginning of 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.990
 topic 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.990
 for example 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.550
 Now we have 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.550
 to be in 45 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.840
 he already said it although in the second 46 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.409
 then I light the punching 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.409
 and being able to change speed 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.730
 one of about 24 percent 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.730
 good 8 something more coherent 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.200
 but they also have to correct 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.040
 in light 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.040
 marcolÃ­n 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.909
 is blocked 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.209
 I can go out and see him and go back 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.209
 clock 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.510
 with this as to what it is if it is very 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:40.319
 very simple good let's spoil it and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.880
 we are going to know the all of usb if 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:47.930
 we go to pendrive 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.550
 is taking the power of joist in the 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.730
 track background we enter 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.030
 and we select track number 1 for 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.400
 example of that folder but charge 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.400
 so we handle it normally 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.320
 is blocked 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.280
 we go 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.049
 it responds super super normal 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.129
 let's go here 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.129
 we can look for the point 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.920
 and a little more direct 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.960
 good 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.310
 there we already mark the point 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:53.679
 an excellent product that can not 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:57.459
 missing in any ranking a dj with a 

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:59.330
 soundman is necessary 10 years before 

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:02.870
 but good 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.169
 and behind the good of this this 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.169
 team 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.550
 yes 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.830
 is that it has balanced output 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.350
 in rca 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.460
 and collection 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:28.120
 microphone input also from behind 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.440
 and fundamental 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.440
 a rack unit 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.300
 this very important 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.110
 that was it
