sticky camera mount that you get to go

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.190 
sticky camera mount that you get to go
on<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.920> flat<00:02:02.310> surface<00:02:02.360> and<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.079> he

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
on a flat surface and that's what he

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.190 
on a flat surface and that's what he
uses<00:02:04.469> I've<00:02:05.130> got<00:02:05.490> an<00:02:05.640> indicator<00:02:06.060> back<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.810> man

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
uses I've got an indicator back but man

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.559 
uses I've got an indicator back but man
that's<00:02:07.409> thin<00:02:07.740> metal<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.340> by<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> time<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.239> face

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
that's thin metal and by the time I face

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.559 
that's thin metal and by the time I face
that<00:02:09.599> off<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.550> just<00:02:11.550> really<00:02:11.940> wasn't<00:02:12.239> too

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
piece of angle iron that I found in the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.630 
piece of angle iron that I found in the
in<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.840> scrap<00:02:32.230> bucket<00:02:32.680> as<00:02:32.800> well<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.340> already

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
in the scrap bucket as well I already

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.510 
in the scrap bucket as well I already
had<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.120> hole<00:02:34.210> in<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.840> did<00:02:35.320> have<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.530> trim<00:02:36.400> it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
had the hole in it I did have to trim it

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.830 
had the hole in it I did have to trim it
down<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.700> little<00:02:36.850> bit<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.330> welded<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.780> a

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
down a little bit I just welded it a

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.200 
down a little bit I just welded it a
little<00:02:37.960> angle<00:02:38.380> piece<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:39.370> there<00:02:39.610> let<00:02:39.970> me<00:02:40.060> get<00:02:40.180> a

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
little angle piece on there let me get a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.580 
little angle piece on there let me get a
little<00:02:40.270> bit<00:02:40.480> closer<00:02:40.660> hopefully<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.260> can<00:02:41.380> see

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
little bit closer hopefully you can see

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.920 
little bit closer hopefully you can see
this<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.520> ain't<00:02:42.850> welded<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.390> little<00:02:43.630> angle

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
this so I ain't welded that little angle

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.800 
this so I ain't welded that little angle
on<00:02:44.050> there<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:45.430> put<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:45.940> little<00:02:46.180> sticky<00:02:46.570> mount

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
on there and I put a little sticky mount

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.110 
on there and I put a little sticky mount
on<00:02:46.960> there<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:47.350> now<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.560> can<00:02:47.710> put<00:02:48.520> this<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.940> my

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
on there so now I can put this on my

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.160 
on there so now I can put this on my
indicator<00:02:49.720> holder<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.380> camera<00:02:51.370> just

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
indicator holder and the camera just

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.560 
indicator holder and the camera just
mounts<00:02:53.170> right<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.590> there<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.070> now<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.390> put

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
mounts right on there and now I can put

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.810 
mounts right on there and now I can put
that<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.930> my<00:02:56.110> machines<00:02:56.910> also<00:02:59.100> on<00:03:00.100> my<00:03:00.310> camera<00:03:00.640> I

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
that on my machines also on my camera I

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.400

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.660 
c-clamp and i welded some quarter
actually<00:03:29.440> Braves<00:03:29.739> because<00:03:30.130> this<00:03:30.280> was<00:03:30.430> cast

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
actually Braves because this was cast

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.140 
actually Braves because this was cast
iron<00:03:30.970> but<00:03:31.540> i<00:03:31.660> braised<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.260> here<00:03:32.620> three<00:03:33.340> quarter

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150

twenty<00:03:34.510> bolts<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.709> different<00:03:36.190> places<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.709> now

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
twenty bolts in different places and now

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.740 
twenty bolts in different places and now
i<00:03:38.739> can<00:03:39.160> take<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.459> c-clamp<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.269> clamp<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.690> to

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
i can take the c-clamp and clamp it to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.800 
i can take the c-clamp and clamp it to
something<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.440> using<00:03:42.250> that<00:03:42.480> tripod<00:03:43.480> mount

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
something and using that tripod mount

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.229 
something and using that tripod mount
mount<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.440> camera<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:47.550> screw<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:48.700> on<00:03:48.850> here

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
mount the camera just screw it on here

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.830 
mount the camera just screw it on here
and<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:51.400> can<00:03:51.610> tighten<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.120> bolt<00:03:52.180> up<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.750> the

mount<00:05:00.750> right<00:05:00.960> here<00:05:01.020> and<00:05:01.710> uh<00:05:02.130> anyway<00:05:02.670> i<00:05:02.880> thought

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
mount right here and uh anyway i thought

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.820 
mount right here and uh anyway i thought
i<00:05:03.240> would<00:05:03.480> share<00:05:03.630> those<00:05:03.840> for<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.110> gopro<00:05:04.440> users

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
i would share those for the gopro users

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.070
