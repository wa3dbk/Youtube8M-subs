00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.190
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.470
 white posts in zombies is to go out 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.650
 of the trans map and well what is the mode 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.869
 trans and leave the map and good this 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.540
 trick you saw that we made a video myself 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.360
 and my child with the shield and with the 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.430
 fan or with the turbine and good already 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.320
 you know that you can leave the turbine and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.120
 well you have to be at least two 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.800
 players worth a friend have to leave 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 in the turbine and you have to have the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.780
 shield and then you go and well you put there 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.390
 just where is the turbine or the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.520
 fan and you give the square is worth 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.560
 to replace it with the shield then 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.840
 at that time you will take the turbine and 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.640
 you will leave the shield then it is 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.399
 try to just put us here in this 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.340
 piece of wall and that when we put the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.809
 shield was not thrown out of the map not 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.399
 well we were quite a while 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 testing first I was testing the mini 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.880
 He was not long enough and trying not 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.090
 there was way we were about to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.800
 leave it and leave let me put myself to 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.899
 try not to try to try the 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.180
 vinyl went to dinner and everything and good and 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.680
 when after a while she said I'm not going 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.380
 to leave already because it is 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.110
 very difficult and in the end I got out 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.180
 here as you can see I'm off the map and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.310
 well what we can do is create a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.580
 barrier the zombies will come to 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.350
 us and good what is in the typical 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.720
 barrier you can not move in everything 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.250
 is this piece of the corridor but to which 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.160
 leave a little outside the map 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 you will die so do not leave the map 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.390
 try to leave because you will die 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.580
 moment and well you can also relive 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.080
 people who are inside the map though 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
 you are outside there is no fair 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.009
 under the aisle is just the piece of 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.020
 that one there and one was just that 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.479
 ok you can leave the map in this piece 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.649
 from here you can make a barrier a little 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.610
 better so, well, I hope that you 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.710
