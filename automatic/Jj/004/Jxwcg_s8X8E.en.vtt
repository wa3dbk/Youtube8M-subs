00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
very unique in that sense and it is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.650 
very unique in that sense and it is
unique<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.950> terms<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.430> its<00:00:35.579> stats<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.059> well<00:00:36.090> but

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
c4 on naval strike so it's pretty simple

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729

dedicate your time to it you will be
able<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.230> unlock<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> very<00:00:59.309> quickly<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.120> let's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
able to unlock it very quickly so let's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.910 
able to unlock it very quickly so let's
get<00:01:00.449> into<00:01:00.690> my<00:01:00.809> thoughts<00:01:00.989> about<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.500> weapon

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
get into my thoughts about this weapon

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
get into my thoughts about this weapon
so<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> start<00:01:02.670> off<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> SR<00:01:03.270> 3<00:01:03.510> 3<00:01:03.750> 8<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.049> an

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
so to start off the SR 3 3 8 is an

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.820 
so to start off the SR 3 3 8 is an
absolute<00:01:04.949> monster<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:06.030> uses<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.810> 3<00:01:07.080> 3<00:01:07.380> 8<00:01:07.560> round

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
absolute monster it uses the 3 3 8 round

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.950 
absolute monster it uses the 3 3 8 round
which<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.130> completely<00:01:08.790> different<00:01:09.330> from<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
which is completely different from the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.899 
which is completely different from the
other<00:01:10.110> semi-automatic<00:01:10.590> sniper<00:01:11.100> rifles<00:01:11.700> which

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
other semi-automatic sniper rifles which

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.420 
other semi-automatic sniper rifles which
traditionally<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.350> nato<00:01:13.680> round<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
traditionally use the nato round and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.850 
traditionally use the nato round and
with<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> 3<00:01:15.150> 3<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.540> round<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.500> very

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
with that 3 3 out round you get a very

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.280 
with that 3 3 out round you get a very
powerful<00:01:17.159> weapon<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:18.030> fact<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.720> as<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> maximum

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
powerful weapon in fact it as a maximum

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.980 
powerful weapon in fact it as a maximum
damage<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.950> 50<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:21.150> 50<00:01:21.600> dropping

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
damage of 50 that's right 50 dropping

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530 
damage of 50 that's right 50 dropping
off<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> 38<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.100> long<00:01:23.310> range<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:24.119> means<00:01:24.390> if

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
off to 38 at long range which means if

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
off to 38 at long range which means if
you<00:01:24.659> hit<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.049> within<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.650> shots<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you hit them within two shots at the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.850 
you hit them within two shots at the
close<00:01:26.939> range<00:01:27.270> distances<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.380> going<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
close range distances you are going to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.230 
close range distances you are going to
kill<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.460> you'll<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:29.970> gameplay

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
kill them as you'll see in this gameplay

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.480 
kill them as you'll see in this gameplay
here<00:01:30.630> I'll<00:01:31.049> shoot<00:01:31.439> them<00:01:31.619> two<00:01:31.799> times<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.340> they

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
here I'll shoot them two times and they

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
here I'll shoot them two times and they
will<00:01:32.670> drop<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.540> very<00:01:33.810> unique<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
will drop and it's very unique in that

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.920 
will drop and it's very unique in that
sense<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:35.610> here's<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.000> kicker<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.689> has<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
sense but here's the kicker it has a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.429 
sense but here's the kicker it has a
rate<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> fire<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:38.270> 150<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.810> that's<00:01:40.200> more

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
rate of fire of 150 so that's more

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469 
rate of fire of 150 so that's more
comparable<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.189> shotgun<00:01:41.490> really<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.329> if

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
comparable to a shotgun really like if

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600 
comparable to a shotgun really like if
you<00:01:42.600> miss<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:42.990> shots<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.430> die

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
you miss your shots you are going to die

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
you miss your shots you are going to die
and<00:01:44.880> that's<00:01:45.090> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.479> how<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.899> use

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and that's kind of how you have to use

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
and that's kind of how you have to use
this<00:01:46.740> weapon<00:01:46.979> think<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> more<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
this weapon think of it more as a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.910 
this weapon think of it more as a
shotgun<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.659> anything<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> like<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
shotgun if anything the way I like to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.770 
shotgun if anything the way I like to
think<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.640> actually<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.659> was

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
think about it actually is if I was

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.139 
think about it actually is if I was
using<00:01:51.930> slugs<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> shotgun<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:54.060> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
using slugs on a shotgun that's kind of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.580 
using slugs on a shotgun that's kind of
how<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.390> compare<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.020> weapon<00:01:55.409> that's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
how I compare this weapon that's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
how I compare this weapon that's
probably<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.040> best<00:01:56.189> way<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.610> think<00:01:57.030> about<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
probably the best way to think about the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.319 
probably the best way to think about the
SR<00:01:57.810> 338<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.799> has<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> reload<00:01:59.369> time<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.820> 2.3

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
SR 338 it has a reload time of 2.3

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.090 
SR 338 it has a reload time of 2.3
seconds<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.290> there's<00:02:01.469> only<00:02:01.649> lift<00:02:01.950> in

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
seconds when there's only lift in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.399 
seconds when there's only lift in
magazine<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:03.060> ammo<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.479> completely<00:02:04.170> dry

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
magazine when ammo is completely dry

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.830 
magazine when ammo is completely dry
it's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.710> 2.6<00:02:05.549> seconds<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.390> pretty

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it's a 2.6 seconds so that is pretty

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's a 2.6 seconds so that is pretty
damn<00:02:07.140> fast<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.770> never<00:02:07.829> really<00:02:08.310> had<00:02:08.520> issues

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
damn fast I never really had issues

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.540 
damn fast I never really had issues
reloading<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> most<00:02:11.099> part<00:02:11.370> it

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
reloading and for the most part it

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.400 
reloading and for the most part it
seemed<00:02:11.849> pretty<00:02:12.450> good<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> never<00:02:12.870> got

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
seemed pretty good I never got

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.770 
seemed pretty good I never got
in<00:02:13.470> between<00:02:13.770> reloads<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.640> there's<00:02:15.420> no<00:02:15.540> issue

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
in between reloads so there's no issue

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.230 
in between reloads so there's no issue
there<00:02:15.960> as<00:02:16.440> for<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.800> magazine<00:02:17.250> size<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.970> 10

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
there as for the magazine size it's a 10

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.760 
there as for the magazine size it's a 10
which<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.510> pretty<00:02:18.810> much<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.170> standard<00:02:19.590> for

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
which is pretty much the standard for

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.410 
which is pretty much the standard for
the<00:02:19.890> semi-automatic<00:02:20.280> sniper<00:02:20.670> rifles<00:02:21.240> with

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the semi-automatic sniper rifles with

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.930 
the semi-automatic sniper rifles with
one<00:02:21.690> chambered<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.460> again<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.640> was<00:02:23.760> never

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
one chambered and again I was never

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.640 
one chambered and again I was never
really<00:02:24.180> having<00:02:24.540> issues<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.140> terms<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.470> running

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
really having issues in terms of running

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.430 
really having issues in terms of running
out<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.010> ammunition<00:02:26.250> without<00:02:26.940> 150<00:02:27.840> rpm<00:02:28.020> you're

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
out of ammunition without 150 rpm you're

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.080 
out of ammunition without 150 rpm you're
not<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.130> running<00:02:29.400> out<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.730> ammo<00:02:30.060> that

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
not going to be running out of ammo that

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.330 
not going to be running out of ammo that
much<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.230> do<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.950> means<00:02:32.190> you're

section below what your perfect setup is

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.490 
section below what your perfect setup is
but<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.270> best<00:03:06.540> setup<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.290> have

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
but this is the best setup that I have

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.950 
but this is the best setup that I have
found<00:03:07.740> so<00:03:08.100> far<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:08.700> my<00:03:09.030> opinion<00:03:09.060> muzzle<00:03:09.780> brake

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
found so far in my opinion muzzle brake

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.630 
found so far in my opinion muzzle brake
reduces<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> vertical<00:03:10.920> recoil<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
reduces the vertical recoil and the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.030 
reduces the vertical recoil and the
laser<00:03:12.330> sight<00:03:12.600> will<00:03:12.840> help<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.230> in<00:03:13.410> terms<00:03:13.770> of

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
bipod and that is just a no-go with me

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.310 
bipod and that is just a no-go with me
to<00:03:23.880> be<00:03:24.000> completely<00:03:24.510> honest<00:03:24.780> with<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.110> I'm

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.080 
to be completely honest with you I'm
using<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.770> thing<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.130> battle<00:03:26.430> rifle<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.970> I

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
using this thing as a battle rifle and I

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.120 
using this thing as a battle rifle and I
don't<00:03:27.330> want<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.600> be<00:03:27.690> getting<00:03:27.900> caught<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.980> know

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
don't want to be getting caught you know

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.130 
don't want to be getting caught you know
aiming<00:03:29.580> down<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.150> then<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.480> know<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.720> bipod

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
aiming down and then you know the bipod

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.230 
aiming down and then you know the bipod
automatically<00:03:31.950> deploys<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.640> all<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.910> stuff

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
automatically deploys and all that stuff

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.930 
automatically deploys and all that stuff
that's<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:34.110> not<00:03:34.260> gonna<00:03:34.380> work<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:34.650> me<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.310> for

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
that's just not gonna work for me so for

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.699 
that's just not gonna work for me so for
the<00:03:36.030> auxilary<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.570> went<00:03:36.990> with<00:03:37.200> nothing

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
the auxilary I went with nothing

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.440 
the auxilary I went with nothing

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
hopefully that explains it a little bit

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.000 
hopefully that explains it a little bit
better<00:03:39.660> because<00:03:39.900> I'm<00:03:40.170> sure<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.380> few<00:03:40.740> of<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.950> in
