00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.360
 today youtube people are example here not 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.009
 welcome to a new video and the day of 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.469
 I bring you a game very, very, very 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.360
 special and how is the title of this 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.090
 video is much more than a simple 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.530
 video game collection with king 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.820
 ripoll so that's the juice that we're 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.100
 watching below and I'm going to 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.500
 show in this video you're not just going to 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.070
 be able to remember more than 30 years of 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.930
 history 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.600
 but remember a lot of the old 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.790
 classics that maybe like me never before 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.190
 we had played and I also think that 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.070
 many fans in 64 try between 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.379
 other consoles really remember the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.570
 real company together with the collaboration of 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.909
 microsoft studios gives us this 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.190
 compilation that will not keep much 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.260
 entertaining times and really worth the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.690
 worth noting in terms of 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.870
 Price and quality comparison is a 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.100
 offer that many can not miss 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.929
 remember that this game is only 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.449
 available and exclusively for the 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.569
 platform of the box one and this game 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.969
 It has a cost of 30 dollars and includes 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.140
 a total of 30 video games so in 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.630
 average 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.770
 matching is worth a dollar and many 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.470
 search includes this collection 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.840
 I really believe that it is worth more than a 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.000
 dollar one of the main things that 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.920
 brings these compilations is the killer 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.050
 instinct gold and among other games 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.140
 we will also highlight the perfect dark 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.290
 band lucas uvi and also the counter bad 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.420
 day this game as I mentioned is a lot 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.850
 more than a compilation since it offers 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.710
 three game modes where yourselves 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.720
 they can observe each title offered 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.909
 this collection again I remember you 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.490
 which are a total of 30 many very 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.530
 different and make us remember 30 years 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.450
 history it's worth noting that this 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.030
 it is not a remastering no game 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.700
 star remastered and many these games 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.220
 since they are old they are adapted to the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.410
 resolution of 4-3 so we're going to 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.270
 see that many games have a framework 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.190
 identify everything they can leave or what 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.380
 can take that option can leave 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.990
 to your liking and also many forests 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.149
 they are more of this time on all 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.280
 those that are from xbox 360 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.100
 they will be adapted to resolution 16 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.800
 9 in hd just thanks to this 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.960
 detail we can already know what it is 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.180
 the retrocompatibility in the wok swan 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.310
 those titles that have come out for 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.140
 they 360 will not only be 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.170
 available from the same roy game 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.210
 replay but also on the outside so 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.460
 to gain time we can select it 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.440
 in the game menu so from this 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.630
 way we will be able to know what is 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.950
 treats the backward compatibility one of the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.440
 new functions that have been 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.020
 confirmed by microsoft in the e3 of 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.420
 this year 2015 that will be available 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.520
 for all around the end of 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.560
 this year also thanks to this detail 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.810
 of the retrocompatibility that in the case 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.340
 that you have an xbox 360 and some of 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.650
 the titles that are in this collection 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.840
 we will be able to continue all our 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.030
 progress that means that if we play 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.430
 to the last waltz or almost and that came out in the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.650
 2008 and we advance for example until the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.390
 level 3 directly if we 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.850
 we use the same account in the xbox 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.710
 one thanks to the cloud we will be able to 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.930
 continue with all our progress 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.210
 apart from playing each title by 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.760
 fun obviously each one of them 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.680
 has its own list of achievements so 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.130
 which will greatly encourage the 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.130
 replay 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.560
 and speaking of replayability in the 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.230
 second mode that this game offers that 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.390
 it's called snapshots or snapshots come on 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.430
 to be able to play a lot of challenges that 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.380
 are proposed and several challenges that 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.080
 we will have to complete to be able 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.180
 get stamps these stamps 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.520
 not only will they help us to get 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.960
 achievements but they will also give us many 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.030
 rewards as we go 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.530
 advancing level as 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.480
 let's progress we are going to leave 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.400
 unlocking a lot of videos that 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.620
 we can see in the third game mode 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.170
 where we can observe many things that 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.670
 have passed in these 30 years of network since 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.830
 how the idea originated for a 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.080
 videogame the development of it 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.150
 option but also see many of the 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.310
 projects that never came to light and 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.560
 also exclusive songs that never 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.760
 before the truth has come out that this 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.100
 collection will not entertain by 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.930
 a lot of time a lot of videogames 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.030
 to try and especially to remember 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.040
 many classics that the personal in 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.050
 the 90's many of them 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.400
 I was eager to prove them the truth 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.230
 client this collection is very 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.150
 recommended if they have a box which 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.830
 I recommend that they approve it 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.300
 so people any comment that 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.960
 they want to leave me about this game and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.610
 also some 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.660
 recommendation that they want to know me what 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.400
 you can ask in the box 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.440
 comments and people I hope you have them 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.699
