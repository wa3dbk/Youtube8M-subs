00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 here we have again here the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.840
 crisis module specializing in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.880
 new cars peugeot citroen 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.650
 talk about a very common defect 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:22.390
 in the vehicles are sharing 7 307 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:25.810
 the c4 all of them with motorization 2.0 16 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:31.329
 paulo and the following is the effect the car on 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:35.199
 sharing operation of failure 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.019
 flame bridle loses a little 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.780
 power and after they heat up 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:44.050
 Why then does this happen? 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.559
 in the series of valves at the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.220
 are the formation of deposits and 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.699
 this coal deposit he just part of 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:00.760
 of fuel in stages and inappropriate sipia 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:02.350
 the peugeot 407 2,000 engine 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.239
 dismounted collector and I'll show you 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.439
 you 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:13.650
 The fault is not you will not see if you can 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:17.680
 Catch that does not get here charred 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:21.159
 just a little bit then this thing 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.240
 black there is personal carbon deposit in 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.390
 outbreak 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:29.410
 You 're going to catch it, too, but this. 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.130
 here is what causes this failure in 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.130
 operating phase 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:44.370
 I will also try to improve them here and 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:48.220
 this is better then is this deposit in 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.180
 that causes this failure in these engines 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.260
 2.0 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.510
 during the previous phase with the 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.070
 is so that it has to be 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:00.909
 done is made clear decarbonisation 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.350
 all this dirt leave without receiving 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.640
 none like we've done here 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.640
 in one of the books here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.030
 This one is already clean. 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:20.319
 so it's very hard work we need 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.370
 take the collector off scrape a lot for 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:31.620
 putting product does not take enough time 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.620
 know view can vote 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.060
 so the people wanted to show 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.420
 this defect is a very good effect on 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.120
 outside and also does not just 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.230
 make the cleaning fit and functional, right? 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.870
 then cleaning is done 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.239
 do a process of initializing the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.910
 departure jump is done with the scanner 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.590
 with diagnostic equipment for 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.610
 comply with the parameters of the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.890
 injection 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.170
 otherwise it will not get 100% just make the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.659
 cleaning is not an electronic part 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.569
 It will not be so good either. 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.569
 shake up there 13 motors there 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.379
