00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
360 thumbstick configuration which I

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.370 
360 thumbstick configuration which I
found<00:03:01.519> very<00:03:01.670> interesting<00:03:01.970> now<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:02.840> never

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
found very interesting now I never

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.949 
found very interesting now I never
really<00:03:03.800> dug<00:03:04.220> on<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.700> ps3<00:03:05.030> thumbsticks

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
really dug on the ps3 thumbsticks

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.960 
really dug on the ps3 thumbsticks
because<00:03:06.769> they're<00:03:06.920> too<00:03:07.100> close<00:03:07.250> together<00:03:07.519> and

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
because they're too close together and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.940 
because they're too close together and
if<00:03:08.239> both<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.810> my<00:03:09.049> thumb's<00:03:09.320> went<00:03:09.560> toward<00:03:09.829> each

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
if both of my thumb's went toward each

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.620 
if both of my thumb's went toward each
other<00:03:10.100> they<00:03:10.640> would<00:03:10.670> actually<00:03:10.970> hit<00:03:11.360> each<00:03:11.480> other

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
other they would actually hit each other

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.229 
other they would actually hit each other
where<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.290> xbox<00:03:12.680> 360<00:03:13.310> with<00:03:13.519> their<00:03:13.730> offset

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
where the xbox 360 with their offset

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.479 
where the xbox 360 with their offset
configuration<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:14.930> wasn't<00:03:15.380> an<00:03:15.470> issue<00:03:15.620> other

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
configuration that wasn't an issue other

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.979 
configuration that wasn't an issue other
than<00:03:16.730> that<00:03:16.790> I'd<00:03:17.180> never<00:03:17.360> really<00:03:17.630> had<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> problem

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
than that I'd never really had a problem

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.500 
than that I'd never really had a problem
with<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.829> ps4<00:03:19.100> fixes<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.850> issue<00:03:19.910> for

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
with it and the ps4 fixes that issue for

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.180 
with it and the ps4 fixes that issue for
me<00:03:20.720> because<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.530> thumbsticks<00:03:21.860> are<00:03:22.040> just

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
me because the thumbsticks are just

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.670 
me because the thumbsticks are just
wider<00:03:22.400> apart<00:03:22.820> they<00:03:23.570> also<00:03:23.720> talked<00:03:24.110> about<00:03:24.230> maybe

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
wider apart they also talked about maybe

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.789 
wider apart they also talked about maybe
putting<00:03:24.829> a<00:03:25.430> screen<00:03:26.390> on<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.930> ps4<00:03:27.230> controller

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
putting a screen on the ps4 controller

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.440 
putting a screen on the ps4 controller
itself<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.489> lot<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:28.850> people<00:03:28.940> actually

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
itself so a lot of people actually

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.520 
itself so a lot of people actually
thought<00:03:29.690> that<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.049> was<00:03:30.170> going<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.380> be<00:03:30.440> a

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
thought that that was going to be a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.949 
thought that that was going to be a
touch<00:03:30.799> screen<00:03:31.120> in<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.180> middle<00:03:32.510> of<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.660> ps4

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
touch screen in the middle of the ps4

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.140 
touch screen in the middle of the ps4
controller<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:34.220> at<00:03:34.489> Sony's

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
controller and then at Sony's

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.060 
controller and then at Sony's
announcement<00:03:35.959> they<00:03:36.200> said<00:03:36.440> no<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:36.799> just<00:03:36.920> a

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
announcement they said no it's just a

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.460 
announcement they said no it's just a
touch<00:03:37.250> pad<00:03:37.579> I<00:03:38.329> think<00:03:39.019> that<00:03:39.200> would<00:03:39.320> have<00:03:39.410> been

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.750 
touch pad I think that would have been
interesting<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:40.040> have<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.190> screen<00:03:40.549> on<00:03:40.579> the

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
interesting to have a screen on the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.800 
interesting to have a screen on the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
controller I definitely want to raise

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.440

the<00:03:42.049> price<00:03:42.320> of<00:03:42.530> each<00:03:42.620> controller<00:03:43.130> up<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:44.269> Sony

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
the price of each controller up but Sony

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.970 
the price of each controller up but Sony
said<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:44.900> they<00:03:44.989> decided<00:03:45.350> not<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.650> do<00:03:45.769> it<00:03:45.860> just

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
said that they decided not to do it just

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.650 
said that they decided not to do it just
because<00:03:46.130> there's<00:03:46.790> really<00:03:46.970> no<00:03:47.150> point<00:03:47.420> to<00:03:47.630> it

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
because there's really no point to it

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.080 
because there's really no point to it
they<00:03:48.380> wanted<00:03:48.680> your<00:03:48.769> attention<00:03:49.250> focused<00:03:49.970> on

just<00:05:06.410> kind<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:07.250> about<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:08.410> reversals<00:05:09.410> of

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
just kind of about the reversals of

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.980 
just kind of about the reversals of
position<00:05:09.979> that<00:05:10.190> happened<00:05:10.550> after<00:05:10.820> e3<00:05:11.210> with<00:05:11.810> the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
position that happened after e3 with the

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.300 
position that happened after e3 with the
xbox<00:05:12.590> one's<00:05:12.860> DRM<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.880> so<00:05:14.360> forth<00:05:14.720> but<00:05:15.590> what<00:05:16.280> I

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
xbox one's DRM and so forth but what I

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.310 
xbox one's DRM and so forth but what I
found<00:05:16.520> interesting<00:05:16.789> was<00:05:17.210> that<00:05:17.330> need<00:05:17.810> for<00:05:18.110> to

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
found interesting was that need for to

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.870 
found interesting was that need for to
put<00:05:18.500> that<00:05:18.590> kind<00:05:18.740> of<00:05:18.830> language<00:05:19.070> into<00:05:19.729> an

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
put that kind of language into an

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.210 
put that kind of language into an
article<00:05:20.270> that<00:05:20.419> is<00:05:20.539> basically<00:05:21.050> just<00:05:21.199> you<00:05:22.099> know

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
article that is basically just you know

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.460 
article that is basically just you know
it's<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.580> factual<00:05:22.940> article<00:05:23.479> if<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.110> is<00:05:24.229> a<00:05:24.259> bit

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
it's a factual article if it is a bit

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.040
