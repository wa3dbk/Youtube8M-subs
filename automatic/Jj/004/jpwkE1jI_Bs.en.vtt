alcohol now this stove is actually

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
alcohol now this stove is actually
incredibly<00:01:59.189> wicked<00:01:59.610> because<00:01:59.819> I<00:02:00.000> managed<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
incredibly wicked because I managed to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.270 
incredibly wicked because I managed to
leave<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> out<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> garden<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.890> about<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
leave it out in the garden for about the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:20.789 
leave it out in the garden for about the
month<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:05.210> nothing's<00:02:06.210> happened<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.520 

although<00:02:21.819> my<00:02:22.819> one<00:02:23.629> of<00:02:23.659> my<00:02:23.780> tips<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.409> this

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
although my one of my tips like this

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.250 
although my one of my tips like this
will<00:02:24.769> be<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.159> put<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.579> bit<00:02:25.879> of<00:02:26.049> spirits<00:02:27.049> or<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
will be to put a bit of spirits or the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.160 
will be to put a bit of spirits or the
alcohol<00:02:27.670> over<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.790> edge<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.269> obviously<00:02:29.959> make

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
alcohol over the edge and obviously make

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.869 
alcohol over the edge and obviously make
thought<00:02:30.500> make<00:02:30.950> sure<00:02:31.159> your<00:02:31.340> bottles<00:02:34.930> Dan<00:02:36.879> take

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
thought make sure your bottles Dan take

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:47.349 
thought make sure your bottles Dan take
your<00:02:38.090> face<00:02:38.269> still<00:02:45.190> okay<00:02:46.190> you've<00:02:46.970> gotta<00:02:47.180> watch

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
your face still okay you've gotta watch

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.800 
your face still okay you've gotta watch
out<00:02:47.569> with<00:02:47.750> alcohol<00:02:48.200> service<00:02:48.769> guys<00:02:49.010> because

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
out with alcohol service guys because

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.059 
out with alcohol service guys because
basically<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.920> flame<00:02:52.220> band<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:52.940> very<00:02:53.180> clear

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
basically the flame band it's very clear

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.710 
basically the flame band it's very clear
the<00:02:55.069> reason<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.519> said<00:02:55.849> put<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.269> bit<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.540> alcohol

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
the reason I said put a bit of alcohol

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.920 
the reason I said put a bit of alcohol
on<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.379> side<00:02:57.790> it's<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.510> makes<00:02:59.750> it

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
on the side it's so that it makes it

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.860 
on the side it's so that it makes it
prime<00:03:00.200> faster<00:03:00.799> because<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:02.150> fumes<00:03:02.659> have

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
prime faster because the fumes have

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.830 
prime faster because the fumes have
actually<00:03:03.230> got<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:03.560> go<00:03:03.709> out<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.849> it<00:03:04.970> if<00:03:05.599> you

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
actually got to go out and it if you

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.259 
actually got to go out and it if you
don't<00:03:06.079> put<00:03:06.290> any<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.799> side<00:03:07.060> that's<00:03:08.060> why<00:03:08.239> I
