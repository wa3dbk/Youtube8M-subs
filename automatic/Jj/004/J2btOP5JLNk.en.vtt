00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
looks kind of like the moon but it was a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.750 
looks kind of like the moon but it was a
lot<00:00:33.690> smaller<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.710> then<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.460> started

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
lot smaller and then it just started

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.639 
lot smaller and then it just started
flashing<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.660> flashing<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:37.380> just

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
flashing and flashing and then just

winter<00:00:37.890> than<00:00:38.040> nothing<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.510> know<00:00:39.600> what

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
winter than nothing so I don't know what

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.350 
winter than nothing so I don't know what
it<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.370> what<00:00:41.370> when<00:00:41.730> we're<00:00:41.940> looking<00:00:42.030> at<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
it is what when we're looking at the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
it is what when we're looking at the
video<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:42.899> first<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.379> thought<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.829> was<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.610> moon

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
video at first I thought it was the moon

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.720 
video at first I thought it was the moon
as<00:00:45.090> well<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:45.960> maybe<00:00:46.430> maybe<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.610> was

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
as well and then maybe maybe it was

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
as well and then maybe maybe it was
clouded<00:00:48.180> out<00:00:48.300> by<00:00:48.480> clouds<00:00:48.930> were<00:00:49.170> there<00:00:49.350> any

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
clouded out by clouds were there any

00:00:49.440 --> 00:01:02.330 
clouded out by clouds were there any
clouds<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> skies<00:01:00.770> during<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.949> nighttime

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
clouds in the skies during the nighttime

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.270 
clouds in the skies during the nighttime
