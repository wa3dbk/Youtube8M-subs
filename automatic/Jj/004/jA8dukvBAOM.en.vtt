format the SD card and I said format and

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.550 
format the SD card and I said format and
now<00:01:34.070> it's<00:01:34.430> wasting<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.450> phone<00:01:35.719> storage<00:01:38.560> so

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
now it's wasting the phone storage so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.749 
now it's wasting the phone storage so
after<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.340> format<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.360> card<00:01:42.320> I'm<00:01:42.770> checking<00:01:43.610> the

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
after I format the card I'm checking the

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.569 
after I format the card I'm checking the
card<00:01:44.570> on<00:01:44.780> my<00:01:45.229> pc<00:01:45.789> to<00:01:46.789> see<00:01:47.200> in<00:01:48.200> what<00:01:48.710> file<00:01:49.039> system

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
card on my pc to see in what file system

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.990 
card on my pc to see in what file system
it<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.719> as<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.710> can<00:01:51.890> see<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.509> fat32<00:01:53.509> and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
it is and as you can see it's fat32 and

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.700 
it is and as you can see it's fat32 and
it's<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.600> 160<00:01:57.560> gigabyte<00:01:58.070> space<00:01:58.880> as<00:01:59.360> you<00:02:00.350> can<00:02:00.500> see

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
it's a 160 gigabyte space as you can see

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.120 
it's a 160 gigabyte space as you can see
when<00:02:01.219> I<00:02:01.250> format<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:02.030> card<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.890> made<00:02:03.890> some

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
when I format the card it made some

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.020 
when I format the card it made some
folders<00:02:04.579> on<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.789> car

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
folders on the car

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.230 
folders on the car
so<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:08.530> seems<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.920> work<00:02:11.400> before<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.640> did<00:02:12.970> this

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
so it seems to work before I did this

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.140 
so it seems to work before I did this
format<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.350> card<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.830> was<00:02:15.130> in<00:02:15.880> another

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
format of the card it was in another

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.699 
format of the card it was in another
format<00:02:16.600> called<00:02:16.990> X<00:02:17.459> fat<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.780> let's<00:02:23.080> take<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> look

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
format called X fat so let's take a look

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.550 
format called X fat so let's take a look
with<00:02:24.400> an<00:02:25.209> app<00:02:25.450> called<00:02:26.250> link2sd<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:28.630> have<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.380> use

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
with an app called link2sd I have to use

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.620 
with an app called link2sd I have to use
this<00:02:29.739> app<00:02:29.980> because<00:02:30.400> that's<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.270> only<00:02:31.300> app

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
this app because that's the only app

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.050 
this app because that's the only app
showing<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.380> wheel<00:02:32.620> storage<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.850> phone

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
showing the wheel storage on the phone

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.630 
showing the wheel storage on the phone
you<00:02:35.020> can<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.620> check<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.280> settings

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
you can just check in the settings

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.060 
you can just check in the settings
that's<00:02:37.360> fake<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:38.770> as<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.250> see<00:02:39.459> here<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.830> zoom

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
that's fake so as you see here to zoom

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.290 
that's fake so as you see here to zoom
in<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.730> focus<00:02:43.630> with<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.290> camera<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.300> should

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
in and focus with the camera I should

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.790 
in and focus with the camera I should
see<00:02:46.630> here<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.019> SD<00:02:47.860> card<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.430> near<00:02:49.300> 60<00:02:50.290> gigabyte

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
see here a SD card is near 60 gigabyte

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.430 
see here a SD card is near 60 gigabyte
and<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:56.130> expanded<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.310> internal<00:02:57.910> 25<00:02:58.810> gigabyte

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
and I expanded the internal 25 gigabyte

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.259 
and I expanded the internal 25 gigabyte
using<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.950> mod<00:03:00.160> from<00:03:00.970> Marco<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.830> SD<00:03:03.190> card<00:03:03.269> 0

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
using a mod from Marco and the SD card 0

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.170 
using a mod from Marco and the SD card 0
is<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:06.330> switched<00:03:07.330> with<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.900> SD<00:03:08.290> card<00:03:08.319> one

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
is the switched with the SD card one

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.340 
is the switched with the SD card one
using<00:03:10.180> another<00:03:10.480> mod<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.980> right<00:03:12.489> now<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.730> have

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
using another mod so right now I have

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.460 
using another mod so right now I have
five<00:03:14.350> gigabyte<00:03:14.860> internal<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.610> then<00:03:16.470> nearly

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
five gigabyte internal and then nearly

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.590 
five gigabyte internal and then nearly
60<00:03:18.040> gigabyte<00:03:19.290> SD<00:03:20.290> card<00:03:20.890> one<00:03:21.160> storage<00:03:21.600> internal

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
60 gigabyte SD card one storage internal

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.089 
60 gigabyte SD card one storage internal
on<00:03:22.750> phone

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.619 

so<00:03:28.099> here<00:03:28.459> I'm<00:03:28.700> using<00:03:29.090> would<00:03:29.989> explore<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.790> to

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
so here I'm using would explore and to

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.250 
so here I'm using would explore and to
check<00:03:32.870> with<00:03:33.590> another<00:03:33.890> app<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.930> as<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.080> can

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
check with another app and as you can

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.720 
check with another app and as you can
see<00:03:36.290> here<00:03:36.879> internal<00:03:37.879> sd<00:03:38.269> card<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:40.250> tells<00:03:40.489> me

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
see here internal sd card it tells me

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.199 
see here internal sd card it tells me
that<00:03:41.150> it's<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:42.349> same<00:03:42.620> nearly<00:03:43.130> 60<00:03:43.730> gigabyte

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
that it's the same nearly 60 gigabyte

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:51.900 
that it's the same nearly 60 gigabyte
free<00:03:46.660> so<00:03:47.660> as<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.680> can<00:03:48.950> conclude<00:03:49.489> from<00:03:49.700> this
