see it as a big mistake a common mistake

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.740 
see it as a big mistake a common mistake
that<00:00:59.430> beginners<00:00:59.880> make<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.630> up

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that beginners make and that's going up

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.560 
that beginners make and that's going up
one<00:01:01.110> arm<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:01.890> time<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.150> reason<00:01:03.450> why

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
one arm at a time and the reason why

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.000 
one arm at a time and the reason why
people<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.990> up<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.260> arm<00:01:04.440> at<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> time<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
people go up one arm at a time is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
people go up one arm at a time is
because<00:01:05.370> they're<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.330> comfortable<00:01:06.600> doing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
because they're not comfortable doing

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
because they're not comfortable doing
high<00:01:07.230> pull<00:01:07.470> ups<00:01:07.620> hi<00:01:08.040> fast<00:01:08.340> pull<00:01:08.580> ups<00:01:08.730> so

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
high pull ups hi fast pull ups so

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.390 
high pull ups hi fast pull ups so
they're<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.870> to<00:01:09.930> put<00:01:10.650> all<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.040> weight<00:01:11.220> on

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
they're going to put all the weight on

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.450 
they're going to put all the weight on
the<00:01:11.880> hanging<00:01:12.270> arm<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.690> then<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.100> arm<00:01:14.280> that's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the hanging arm and then the arm that's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.130 
the hanging arm and then the arm that's
free<00:01:14.880> they're<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.360> transition<00:01:15.780> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
free they're going to transition that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.330 
free they're going to transition that
and<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.400> hang<00:01:17.760> to<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> support<00:01:18.840> phase<00:01:19.340> because

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and to hang to the support phase because

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.920 
and to hang to the support phase because
all<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.760> is<00:01:20.910> in<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.210> hand<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.690> going

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
all the way is in this hand it's going

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.250 
all the way is in this hand it's going
to<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.080> easy<00:01:22.320> transition<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.140> don't<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.200> if

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
to be easy transition so I don't know if

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.390 
to be easy transition so I don't know if
you<00:01:25.320> guys<00:01:25.410> think<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.250> you're

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you guys think about that when you're

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.670 
you guys think about that when you're
doing<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.240> that's<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.600> common<00:01:28.440> reason

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
doing that but that's a common reason

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.650 
doing that but that's a common reason
why<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.920> happens<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.210> example<00:01:30.300> this

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
why that happens so for example this

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.540 
why that happens so for example this
demonstrate<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.890> all<00:01:32.010> my<00:01:32.130> weight<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.460> my

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
demonstrate so all my weight is in my

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.820 
demonstrate so all my weight is in my
right<00:01:32.729> hand<00:01:32.760> you<00:01:33.030> can't<00:01:33.240> tell<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:34.020> come<00:01:34.710> up

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
right hand you can't tell but come up

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.060 
right hand you can't tell but come up
here<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:36.470> then<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.619> weight<00:01:37.830> goes<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
here and then all the weight goes to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.859 
here and then all the weight goes to
your<00:01:38.190> left<00:01:38.340> hand<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.660> you<00:01:39.750> can

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
your left hand and then you can

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.350 
your left hand and then you can
transition<00:01:40.260> from<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.300> other

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
transition from that and to the other

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.570 
transition from that and to the other
hand<00:01:44.149> to<00:01:45.149> avoid<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.600> problem<00:01:46.369> what<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> guys

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
hand to avoid that problem what you guys

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.100 
hand to avoid that problem what you guys
have<00:01:47.789> to<00:01:47.880> work<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.539> those<00:01:48.690> fast<00:01:48.929> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
have to work on this on those fast I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
have to work on this on those fast I
pull<00:01:49.350> ups<00:01:49.470> again<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
pull ups again going back to that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.279 
pull ups again going back to that
otherwise<00:01:51.509> you're<00:01:51.660> gonna<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.899> struggling

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
otherwise you're gonna be struggling

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.169 
otherwise you're gonna be struggling
going<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.830> arm<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> time<00:01:53.160> it's<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.940> timing

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
going up one arm at a time it's a timing

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.999 
going up one arm at a time it's a timing
issue<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:54.929> it<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.050> so<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> think<00:01:55.710> about

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
issue that's what it is so I think about

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.650 
issue that's what it is so I think about
it's<00:01:56.160> all<00:01:56.250> physics<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:56.970> we're<00:01:57.300> going<00:01:57.450> up

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
it's all physics so as we're going up

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.870 
it's all physics so as we're going up
we're<00:01:58.229> pulling<00:01:58.470> we're<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.250> super<00:01:59.610> fast

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
we're pulling we're going to super fast

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.350 
we're pulling we're going to super fast
and<00:02:00.060> we're<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.420> high<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:02.179> good<00:02:03.179> exercise

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and we're going high so a good exercise

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.200 
and we're going high so a good exercise
we<00:02:03.570> can<00:02:03.720> think<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.990> for<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.410> transition<00:02:05.039> is

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
we can think of for the transition is

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.480 
we can think of for the transition is
right<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.479> want<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.690> feel<00:02:06.840> weightless

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
right here we want to feel weightless

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.559 
right here we want to feel weightless
because<00:02:08.490> if<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.729> feel<00:02:08.880> weightless<00:02:09.149> we<00:02:09.450> can

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
because if you feel weightless we can

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.140 
because if you feel weightless we can
easily<00:02:09.840> transition<00:02:10.380> we<00:02:11.250> don't<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.910> tight

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
easily transition we don't have a tight

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.150 
easily transition we don't have a tight
grip<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> bar<00:02:12.660> we<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:12.990> much<00:02:13.170> snap<00:02:14.010> our

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
grip on the bar we get much snap our

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.130 
grip on the bar we get much snap our
hands<00:02:14.370> up<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.210> good<00:02:15.390> exercise<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.960> is

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
hands up so a good exercise for that is

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.330 
hands up so a good exercise for that is
choking<00:02:16.440> pillars

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
choking pillars

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:29.710 
choking pillars
mark<00:02:19.340> Wiebe<00:02:20.269> late<00:02:20.569> this<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:21.379> split<00:02:22.280> second<00:02:28.660> do<00:02:29.660> a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
couple of those it will transfer over to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.089 
couple of those it will transfer over to
the<00:02:31.970> muscle-up<00:02:32.269> i<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.629> t<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:33.680> learn<00:02:33.830> more

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
the muscle-up i can t it to learn more

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.440 
the muscle-up i can t it to learn more
about<00:02:34.129> timing<00:02:34.549> we're<00:02:34.790> going<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:34.970> move<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.299> a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
about timing we're going to move on to a

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.539 
about timing we're going to move on to a
lower<00:02:35.720> bar<00:02:36.019> that's<00:02:36.709> about<00:02:36.890> head<00:02:37.129> height<00:02:37.160> or

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
lower bar that's about head height or

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.910 
lower bar that's about head height or
lower<00:02:37.760> or<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:38.569> can<00:02:38.690> even<00:02:38.750> use<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.989> stool<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:39.799> you

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
lower or we can even use a stool if you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.770 
lower or we can even use a stool if you
can't<00:02:40.160> find<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.430> low<00:02:40.580> bar<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.480> don't<00:02:41.690> be

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
can't find the low bar so don't be

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.660 
can't find the low bar so don't be
afraid<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:42.140> get<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.500> our<00:02:42.650> load<00:02:42.830> bar<00:02:43.010> there's

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
afraid to get on our load bar there's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.890 
afraid to get on our load bar there's
nothing<00:02:43.849> chicken<00:02:44.269> about<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.629> we're<00:02:44.750> just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
nothing chicken about it we're just

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.420 
nothing chicken about it we're just
learning<00:02:44.989> about<00:02:45.170> timing<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:46.220> we're<00:02:46.340> gonna

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
learning about timing so we're gonna

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.559 
learning about timing so we're gonna
start<00:02:46.549> on<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.730> ground<00:02:46.970> we're<00:02:47.239> gonna<00:02:47.330> utilize

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
start on the ground we're gonna utilize

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.809 
start on the ground we're gonna utilize
our<00:02:47.930> legs<00:02:48.140> here<00:02:48.379> we're<00:02:48.590> gonna<00:02:48.650> jump<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:51.819> that's

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
our legs here we're gonna jump up that's

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.420 
our legs here we're gonna jump up that's
the<00:02:52.940> muscle<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.239> right<00:02:53.450> there<00:02:54.099> just<00:02:55.099> work<00:02:55.280> on

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
the muscle of right there just work on

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.500 
the muscle of right there just work on
that<00:02:55.610> get<00:02:56.000> up<00:02:56.150> there<00:02:57.790> maybe<00:02:58.790> do<00:02:58.970> some<00:02:59.120> dips<00:02:59.329> if

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
that get up there maybe do some dips if

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.670 
that get up there maybe do some dips if
you<00:02:59.599> want<00:03:00.700> come<00:03:01.700> back<00:03:01.880> down<00:03:02.560> when<00:03:03.560> we're

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
you want come back down when we're

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.170 
you want come back down when we're
comfortable<00:03:03.980> with<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.250> let's<00:03:04.849> use<00:03:05.030> this

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
comfortable with that let's use this

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:14.630 
comfortable with that let's use this
tool<00:03:05.450> or<00:03:06.760> must<00:03:07.760> love<00:03:07.910> if<00:03:08.030> we<00:03:08.060> can

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.949 

and<00:03:15.640> we're<00:03:15.819> gonna<00:03:15.910> come<00:03:16.090> down<00:03:16.209> as<00:03:16.360> slow<00:03:16.660> as<00:03:16.690> we

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
and we're gonna come down as slow as we

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.590 
and we're gonna come down as slow as we
can<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.950> we're<00:03:18.100> doing<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> negative<00:03:18.730> phase<00:03:19.330> of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
can so we're doing the negative phase of

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.280 
can so we're doing the negative phase of
the<00:03:19.660> Muslim

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.800 

do<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.920> couple<00:03:27.219> of<00:03:27.280> those<00:03:27.420> so<00:03:28.420> really<00:03:28.629> guys

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
do a couple of those so really guys

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.750 
do a couple of those so really guys
that's<00:03:29.170> all<00:03:29.439> there<00:03:29.829> is<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.980> muscle<00:03:30.459> up<00:03:30.519> it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
that's all there is to muscle up it

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.300 
that's all there is to muscle up it
might<00:03:31.510> take<00:03:31.540> time<00:03:31.840> for<00:03:32.049> some<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:32.319> guys<00:03:32.439> if

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
might take time for some of you guys if

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.759 
might take time for some of you guys if
you're<00:03:33.489> shoveling<00:03:33.849> just<00:03:34.150> be<00:03:34.269> consistent

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
you're shoveling just be consistent

was<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.260> lot<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:47.500> fun<00:03:47.680> meet<00:03:47.859> on<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.040> channel<00:03:48.250> we

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
was a lot of fun meet on this channel we

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.339 
was a lot of fun meet on this channel we
had<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.670> lot<00:03:48.819> of<00:03:48.849> fun<00:03:49.120> it's<00:03:49.930> really<00:03:50.200> in<00:03:50.290> the

had a lot of fun it's really in the

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.809 
had a lot of fun it's really in the
morning<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:51.040> Muslim<00:03:51.370> might<00:03:51.489> have<00:03:51.579> been<00:03:51.700> a

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
morning so the Muslim might have been a

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.300
