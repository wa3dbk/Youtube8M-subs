00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
much narrowed down to emergency medicine

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.270 
much narrowed down to emergency medicine
or<00:04:44.020> internal<00:04:44.410> medicine<00:04:44.740> but<00:04:44.919> at<00:04:44.979> the<00:04:45.070> time<00:04:45.099> I

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
or internal medicine but at the time I

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.939 
or internal medicine but at the time I
was<00:04:45.580> also<00:04:45.699> thinking<00:04:45.820> me<00:04:46.150> pediatrics<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:47.860> know

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949

was also thinking me pediatrics you know
which<00:04:48.070> is<00:04:48.220> just<00:04:48.400> one<00:04:48.550> more<00:04:48.669> thing<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:49.000> consider

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
which is just one more thing to consider

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.779 
which is just one more thing to consider
or<00:04:49.800> there's<00:04:50.800> also<00:04:50.949> thinking<00:04:51.310> something<00:04:51.699> where

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
or there's also thinking something where

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.129 
or there's also thinking something where
you<00:04:51.849> can<00:04:51.970> do<00:04:52.090> internal<00:04:52.509> medicine<00:04:52.900> and

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
you can do internal medicine and

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.070 
you can do internal medicine and
pediatrics<00:04:53.830> together<00:04:54.599> so<00:04:55.599> that<00:04:55.630> was<00:04:55.840> also<00:04:55.960> a

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
pediatrics together so that was also a

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.230 
pediatrics together so that was also a
thing<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.500> was<00:04:56.680> considering<00:04:57.070> but<00:04:57.400> after

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
thing I was considering but after

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
done with my pedes rotation and I took

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.939 
done with my pedes rotation and I took
the<00:05:57.219> shelf<00:05:57.430> exam<00:05:57.820> last<00:05:58.090> week<00:05:58.770> everybody<00:05:59.770> told

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
the shelf exam last week everybody told

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.070 
the shelf exam last week everybody told
me<00:06:00.039> it<00:06:00.159> was<00:06:00.250> really<00:06:00.400> really<00:06:00.669> hard<00:06:01.000> but<00:06:01.360> that<00:06:01.960> it

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
me it was really really hard but that it

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.159 
me it was really really hard but that it
actually<00:06:02.580> really<00:06:03.580> wasn't<00:06:03.909> my<00:06:03.969> experience<00:06:04.570> um

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
actually really wasn't my experience um

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.490 
actually really wasn't my experience um
I<00:06:05.820> think<00:06:06.820> it<00:06:06.909> was<00:06:07.030> more<00:06:07.240> random<00:06:07.900> than<00:06:08.020> anything

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
I think it was more random than anything

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.380 
I think it was more random than anything
else<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:08.860> there<00:06:09.009> were

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
else and there were

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.540 
else and there were
things<00:06:09.630> on<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:09.870> test<00:06:10.110> that<00:06:10.290> weren't<00:06:10.560> pedes<00:06:10.830> so

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
things on the test that weren't pedes so

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.370 
things on the test that weren't pedes so
like<00:06:11.730> having<00:06:12.210> already<00:06:12.360> had<00:06:12.660> OB<00:06:12.930> guying<00:06:13.140> in

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
like having already had OB guying in

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.550 
like having already had OB guying in
particular<00:06:13.730> was<00:06:14.730> really<00:06:15.120> helpful<00:06:15.500> you<00:06:16.500> know

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
particular was really helpful you know

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.740 
particular was really helpful you know
they<00:06:16.710> had<00:06:16.830> a<00:06:16.860> lot<00:06:17.040> of<00:06:17.070> like<00:06:17.330> 14<00:06:18.330> year<00:06:18.450> olds<00:06:18.660> with

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
they had a lot of like 14 year olds with

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.080 
they had a lot of like 14 year olds with
vaginal<00:06:18.990> problems<00:06:19.800> which<00:06:20.160> you<00:06:20.460> know<00:06:20.550> a<00:06:20.580> 14

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
vaginal problems which you know a 14

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.910 
vaginal problems which you know a 14
year<00:06:21.240> old<00:06:21.360> with<00:06:21.450> the<00:06:21.540> vaginal<00:06:21.810> problem<00:06:22.230> not

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
year old with the vaginal problem not

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.680 
year old with the vaginal problem not
really<00:06:23.310> all<00:06:23.400> that<00:06:23.430> different<00:06:23.610> than<00:06:23.970> a<00:06:24.090> 19<00:06:24.540> year

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
really all that different than a 19 year

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.380 
really all that different than a 19 year
old<00:06:24.810> with<00:06:24.960> one<00:06:25.170> so<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.160> could<00:06:26.550> see<00:06:26.700> where<00:06:26.970> it

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390 
old with one so I could see where it

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.610 
old with one so I could see where it
would<00:06:27.510> be<00:06:27.660> difficult<00:06:27.810> for<00:06:28.080> people<00:06:28.440> who<00:06:28.530> out

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
would be difficult for people who out

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.830 
would be difficult for people who out
and<00:06:28.800> had<00:06:28.890> that<00:06:29.100> many<00:06:29.250> rotations<00:06:29.490> yet<00:06:30.030> anything

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
and had that many rotations yet anything

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.260 
and had that many rotations yet anything
that's<00:06:31.020> that's<00:06:31.920> kind<00:06:32.220> of<00:06:32.310> how<00:06:32.580> it<00:06:32.790> is<00:06:32.820> with<00:06:33.060> all

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
that's that's kind of how it is with all

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.720 
that's that's kind of how it is with all
the<00:06:33.300> shelf<00:06:33.600> exams<00:06:33.990> in<00:06:34.380> general<00:06:34.770> so<00:06:35.070> for<00:06:35.430> those

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
the shelf exams in general so for those

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.160 
the shelf exams in general so for those
of<00:06:35.790> you<00:06:36.030> who<00:06:36.150> are<00:06:36.210> going<00:06:36.480> on<00:06:36.630> to<00:06:36.780> third<00:06:36.960> year

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.170 
of you who are going on to third year

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.560 
of you who are going on to third year
next<00:06:37.380> year<00:06:37.640> don't<00:06:38.640> be<00:06:38.730> discouraged<00:06:39.060> if<00:06:39.420> your

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
next year don't be discouraged if your

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.540 
next year don't be discouraged if your
first<00:06:39.810> couple<00:06:40.050> exams<00:06:40.500> don't<00:06:41.040> go<00:06:41.220> as<00:06:41.370> well

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
first couple exams don't go as well

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.090 
first couple exams don't go as well
because<00:06:42.000> the<00:06:42.960> body<00:06:43.170> of<00:06:43.350> knowledge<00:06:43.500> that<00:06:43.740> you

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
because the body of knowledge that you

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.880 
because the body of knowledge that you
accumulate<00:06:45.000> across<00:06:45.690> rotations<00:06:46.230> really<00:06:46.440> helps

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
accumulate across rotations really helps

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.860 
accumulate across rotations really helps
for<00:06:47.160> with<00:06:47.370> future<00:06:47.670> shelf<00:06:47.910> exams<00:06:48.270> and<00:06:48.630> if

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
for with future shelf exams and if

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.780 
for with future shelf exams and if
that's<00:06:49.050> really<00:06:49.260> not<00:06:49.470> fair<00:06:49.740> and<00:06:50.040> like<00:06:50.610> I<00:06:50.730> said

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:50.790 
that's really not fair and like I said

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.580 
that's really not fair and like I said
they're<00:06:51.090> bad<00:06:51.450> tests<00:06:52.220> for<00:06:53.220> that<00:06:53.400> reason<00:06:53.580> so

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:54.590 
they're bad tests for that reason so

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.170 
they're bad tests for that reason so
don't<00:06:55.590> get<00:06:55.680> discouraged<00:06:55.800> if<00:06:56.490> the<00:06:56.760> first<00:06:56.940> few

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
don't get discouraged if the first few

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.140 
don't get discouraged if the first few
don't<00:06:57.450> go<00:06:57.630> exactly<00:06:57.840> how<00:06:58.170> you<00:06:58.230> want<00:06:58.500> them<00:06:58.620> to

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
don't go exactly how you want them to

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.380
