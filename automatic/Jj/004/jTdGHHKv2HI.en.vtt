you'd know that it just like all the
eight<00:02:35.220> pages<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:36.000> then<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.180> beat<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.480> game

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
eight pages and then you beat the game

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
eight pages and then you beat the game
but<00:02:36.959> he<00:02:37.019> said<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.380> there'd<00:02:37.680> be<00:02:37.799> more<00:02:38.070> than

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
but he said that there'd be more than

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.729 
but he said that there'd be more than
just<00:02:38.340> collecting<00:02:38.880> pages<00:02:39.299> in<00:02:39.480> Nevada<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.530> just

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
just collecting pages in Nevada is just

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.520 
just collecting pages in Nevada is just
a<00:02:40.890> data<00:02:41.070> eight<00:02:41.250> pages<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.940> um<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:43.110> there's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
a data eight pages and um so there's

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.810 
a data eight pages and um so there's
many<00:02:43.620> other<00:02:43.769> things<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.250> collect<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
many other things to collect in the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.390 
many other things to collect in the
podium<00:02:45.299> so<00:02:46.140> another<00:02:46.350> factor<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:46.920> was<00:02:47.220> said

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
podium so another factor that was said

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.230 
podium so another factor that was said
to<00:02:47.549> be<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.850> full<00:02:48.060> game<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.450> wasn't<00:02:48.750> true

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
to be in a full game that wasn't true

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.270 
to be in a full game that wasn't true
beta<00:02:49.450> was<00:02:49.780> more<00:02:49.990> detailed<00:02:50.440> maps<00:02:50.800> for

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
beta was more detailed maps for

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.000 
beta was more detailed maps for
separately<00:02:52.000> expected<00:02:52.540> since<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.530> Thunder

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
separately expected since the Thunder

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.520 
separately expected since the Thunder
arriving<00:02:54.460> home<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.720> beta<00:02:55.960> you'd<00:02:56.350> also

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
arriving home in the beta you'd also

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.160 
arriving home in the beta you'd also
notice<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.070> there<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> lot<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.170> elevations

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
notice that there is a lot of elevations

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.050 
notice that there is a lot of elevations
and<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> lot<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.650> space<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.100> run<00:03:00.400> around<00:03:00.460> it<00:03:00.850> so

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
and a lot of space to run around it so

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.880 
and a lot of space to run around it so
definitely<00:03:01.450> larger<00:03:01.810> map<00:03:02.020> professional<00:03:02.620> older

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
definitely larger map professional older

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.060 
definitely larger map professional older
maps<00:03:03.240> but<00:03:04.240> I<00:03:04.660> didn't<00:03:05.020> see<00:03:05.170> any<00:03:05.350> daytime<00:03:05.800> like

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
maps but I didn't see any daytime like

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.000 
maps but I didn't see any daytime like
it<00:03:06.190> showed<00:03:06.430> me<00:03:06.580> trailer<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:08.200> was<00:03:08.380> no<00:03:08.740> like

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
it showed me trailer and I was no like

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.650 
it showed me trailer and I was no like
in<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.250> trailers<00:03:09.640> mountains<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> lot<00:03:10.630> of

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
in the trailers mountains and a lot of

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.520 
in the trailers mountains and a lot of
forest<00:03:11.290> areas<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:13.660> didn't<00:03:14.110> really<00:03:14.200> show

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
forest areas and it didn't really show

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.200 
forest areas and it didn't really show
that<00:03:14.560> in<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.950> data<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.490> hopefully<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.000> full

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
that in the data so hopefully the full

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.610 
that in the data so hopefully the full
game<00:03:16.390> they're<00:03:16.660> also<00:03:16.780> be<00:03:17.050> showing<00:03:17.350> different

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
game they're also be showing different

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.040 
game they're also be showing different
levels<00:03:18.160> with<00:03:18.400> different<00:03:18.790> maps<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.480> every

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
levels with different maps and every

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.800 
levels with different maps and every
seeing<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.350> lot<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.530> different<00:03:21.390> terrains<00:03:22.390> might

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
seeing a lot of different terrains might

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.170 
seeing a lot of different terrains might
just<00:03:23.110> besides<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.130> old<00:03:24.280> slender<00:03:24.730> for<00:03:25.060> it

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
just besides the old slender for it

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.360 
just besides the old slender for it
alright<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:25.780> another<00:03:26.050> key<00:03:26.380> factor<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:27.160> we

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
alright so another key factor that we

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.310 
alright so another key factor that we
were<00:03:27.460> expecting<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.300> be<00:03:28.330> in<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:28.810> full<00:03:29.140> game

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
were expecting to be in the full game

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.870 
were expecting to be in the full game
but<00:03:29.560> wasn't<00:03:29.830> really<00:03:30.010> selling<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.460> beta<00:03:30.670> too

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
but wasn't really selling the beta too

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.700 
but wasn't really selling the beta too
much<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:31.810> slender<00:03:32.170> man<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.440> gonna<00:03:32.560> be

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
much but that slender man is gonna be

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.500 
much but that slender man is gonna be
the<00:03:32.830> only<00:03:32.860> enemy<00:03:33.250> tank<00:03:33.700> up<00:03:33.850> when<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.120> down<00:03:34.330> and

never really explained before it's like

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.560 
never really explained before it's like
a<00:03:44.020> fun<00:03:44.740> of<00:03:44.830> sluggers<00:03:45.160> minions<00:03:45.610> are<00:03:45.790> maybe<00:03:46.390> one

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
a fun of sluggers minions are maybe one

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.450 
a fun of sluggers minions are maybe one
of<00:03:46.600> its<00:03:46.720> victims<00:03:46.780> who<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:48.040> know<00:03:48.160> when<00:03:48.280> you<00:03:48.340> get

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
of its victims who you know when you get

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.130 
of its victims who you know when you get
a<00:03:48.490> test<00:03:48.910> whether<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.270> don't<00:03:49.360> see<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.840> happens

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
a test whether you don't see it happens

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.770 
a test whether you don't see it happens
after<00:03:50.740> you<00:03:50.920> catch<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:52.030> he<00:03:52.210> could<00:03:52.540> try<00:03:52.750> a

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
after you catch you and he could try a

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.510 
after you catch you and he could try a
show<00:03:52.960> like<00:03:53.110> that<00:03:53.170> you're<00:03:53.590> having<00:03:53.800> so<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.400> be

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
show like that you're having so that be

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.970 
show like that you're having so that be
calm<00:03:55.030> happen<00:03:55.450> you've<00:03:55.600> already<00:03:55.870> been<00:03:56.020> a<00:03:56.530> victim

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
calm happen you've already been a victim

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.100 
calm happen you've already been a victim
of<00:03:57.280> slider<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:57.970> that's<00:03:58.240> what<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.540> think<00:03:58.990> is

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
of slider so that's what I think is

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.950 
of slider so that's what I think is
going<00:03:59.350> on<00:03:59.470> with<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:00.520> in<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.120> full<00:04:01.780> game

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
going on with that and in the full game
