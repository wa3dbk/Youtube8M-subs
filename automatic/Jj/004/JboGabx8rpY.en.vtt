00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.369
 bio the gums justice i hope that 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.200
 you are all very very good at me in 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.239
 anyway I shape it and we end up 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.070
 today for a new video to 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.010
 load 26 refusal of 14 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.860
 and this time this trick will bring 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.790
 on stage chemistry cards so this 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.680
 what you are going to do is that in the 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.920
 level you go m money in the price 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.289
 maximum bids you put 350 and 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.120
 the technique is actually to do the 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.679
 auction search with all 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.710
 possible styles ie with the 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.929
 sniper style with finisher style 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.730
 vista engine maestro finally here it is with 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.789
 every possible style even with the 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.559
 guardians and so in fact it's technical 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.969
 after such is super simple in the sense 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.890
 where what are you going to do is that 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.640
 you will find a lot of players 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.720
 which were swayed to 150 or even 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.850
 less because there are a lot of people 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.710
 swinging their players to 150 years 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.080
 personally I do not find that this 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.210
 be a very good tip I prefer 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.410
 still put me the player to buy 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.300
 immediate to 100 or 200 less of less 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.560
 expensive but but in fact it's a 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.760
 technique which is super simple in the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.010
 field opens there it's players who 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.590
 are balanced like that on the market that 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.230
 in addition on a chemistry map and there is 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.300
 often often even all the time it's 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.810
 to say 90% of the average time to do 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.490
 good deals 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.220
 because all the players really 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.350
 very nice stats camp 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.120
 when you use this technique so 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.700
 that's the technique itself 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.460
 super simple I think there will be 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 a lot of people going against who are going 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.470
 so they will understand and I think that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.180
 everyone will understand this 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.180
 technique is what is good at home 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.190
 and so that's how I told you 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.420
 do you do share in a ride on 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.060
 all the sites there so here we go 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.140
 stop at corn too much and we go all of 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.220
 see what's left in our 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.420
 priority list so here you have 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.950
 swing everything in our list 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.640
 priority 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.590
 you'll see 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.420
 you will think so it's worth the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.980
 bidding or not so what you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.200
 do it's clogged up you look for his 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 immediate price on the market with the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.440
 map style of course and if you see 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.810
 that there is a way to make a deal 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.890
 that is to say in general there is the whole 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.950
 time means to make a case 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.900
 at least 95% of the time to tell you to 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.000
 how effective are these techniques and 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.740
 so here you are bidding there is 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.940
 really few people who use this 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.070
 technical finally I do not know if she has 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.600
 already been presented or see but there are 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.610
 really nobody on it ie 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.959
 that they go people do not even 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.880
 so much attention to the fact that they have 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.930
 a chemistry map I have the impression and 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.340
 so suddenly you can there you can 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.320
 to really grab the players for not 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.989
 dear at all so here I would like you 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.070
 give an example it's true that I had 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.690
 I had made a wave there is no 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.610
 a long time so I thought I'll 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.930
 the catching game is like that I'm going 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.519
 able to show you an example a 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.150
 example of a few players that I have 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.370
 already used 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.720
 so that's with most players 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.519
 in fact that you will do if you 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.140
 go grab him the player at auction 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.790
 as I told you and you go the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.410
 simply sell double the 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.750
 its price is to say that here you are 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.400
 to go grabbing for example I do not have the guy 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.810
 are ramirez for example I do not know if 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.370
 I have already put on sale two sous 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.470
 thornton you goin him at 500 you the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.519
 sell friend fernand not complicated from 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.440
 everything and more that can bring 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:25.000
 really a lot of strain or so 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.049
 i hope that cgi you are really enough 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.640
 clear in this video 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.049
 so it's me I need more 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.820
 explanations tell me that in the 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.930
 comments added month on skype if 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.700
 it's not already done if you have 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.019
 need to be for for the anti charge 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.820
 shove would be there no worries 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.990
 added less on xbox if you want 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.010
 or 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.570
 or why not to my twitter account that 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.460
 also in the description anyway 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.870
 so here I am repeating myself a little bit 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.900
 but I hope I was really pretty 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.550
 clear and that and that you will succeed 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.840
 all to use this technique 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.760
 me anyway I tell you to the 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.030
 next for new videos on 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.030
 toulon
