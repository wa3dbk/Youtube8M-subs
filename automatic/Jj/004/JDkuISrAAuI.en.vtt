00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
previously you have to look on the wiki

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.200 
previously you have to look on the wiki
in<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.200> bucket<00:00:45.559> page<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:45.980> if<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.730> list<00:00:47.000> it

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
in the bucket page so if you a list it

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.470 
in the bucket page so if you a list it

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
shows them so let's pick a sharpness and

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.100 
shows them so let's pick a sharpness and
then<00:00:51.469> go<00:00:51.649> for<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:51.920> number<00:00:52.280> say<00:00:52.489> 10<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.540> if<00:00:53.750> I<00:00:53.899> hit

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
then go for a number say 10 so if I hit

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.740 
then go for a number say 10 so if I hit
them<00:00:54.230> he'll<00:00:54.469> do<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:55.030> sharpness<00:00:56.030> 10<00:00:56.210> damage<00:00:56.540> but

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
them he'll do a sharpness 10 damage but

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.060 
them he'll do a sharpness 10 damage but
if<00:00:56.840> I<00:00:56.989> had<00:00:57.340> took<00:00:58.340> 10,000<00:00:59.239> it<00:00:59.989> will<00:01:00.200> do<00:01:00.320> 10,000

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
if I had took 10,000 it will do 10,000

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.270 
if I had took 10,000 it will do 10,000
worth<00:01:01.789> of<00:01:01.940> damage<00:01:02.270> which<00:01:02.450> is<00:01:02.570> why<00:01:02.750> it's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
worth of damage which is why it's

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.070 
worth of damage which is why it's
one-hit<00:01:04.280> kill<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:05.299> this<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.630> really<00:01:05.869> really

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
one-hit kill so this is really really

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.670 
one-hit kill so this is really really
useful<00:01:06.290> it<00:01:06.650> could<00:01:06.799> be<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.920> fun<00:01:07.250> donator<00:01:07.640> part

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680
