00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330 

I

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:03.340 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.120 

first<00:00:04.240> of<00:00:04.390> all<00:00:05.819> one<00:00:06.819> of<00:00:06.939> the<00:00:07.029> major<00:00:08.130> mechanisms

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
first of all one of the major mechanisms

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.960 
first of all one of the major mechanisms
of<00:00:09.990> pollution<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:12.790> what<00:00:13.059> we<00:00:13.180> eat<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.849> the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:15.970 
of pollution is what we eat but the

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.730 
of pollution is what we eat but the
problem<00:00:16.359> is<00:00:16.510> we're<00:00:17.170> not<00:00:17.199> sure<00:00:17.529> what<00:00:17.710> that

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
problem is we're not sure what that

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.470 
problem is we're not sure what that
pollution<00:00:18.130> is<00:00:18.429> there's<00:00:18.789> a<00:00:18.880> lot<00:00:19.029> of<00:00:19.060> confusion

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
pollution is there's a lot of confusion

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.529 
pollution is there's a lot of confusion
that<00:00:19.690> surrounds<00:00:20.230> diet<00:00:20.830> and<00:00:21.220> what<00:00:22.030> constitutes

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
that surrounds diet and what constitutes

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.240 
that surrounds diet and what constitutes
pollution<00:00:23.050> of<00:00:23.110> what<00:00:23.289> constitutes<00:00:23.590> health<00:00:24.039> and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
pollution of what constitutes health and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.200 
pollution of what constitutes health and
that's<00:00:27.250> what<00:00:27.430> I<00:00:27.460> really<00:00:27.760> want<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:27.970> talk<00:00:28.150> about

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
that's what I really want to talk about

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.000 
that's what I really want to talk about
one<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.430> sources<00:00:30.609> of<00:00:31.529> confusion<00:00:32.529> i<00:00:32.739> think

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
one of the sources of confusion i think

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.650 
one of the sources of confusion i think
is<00:00:33.100> illustrated<00:00:33.609> by<00:00:33.640> a<00:00:33.760> recent<00:00:34.149> study<00:00:34.329> that

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
is illustrated by a recent study that

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.810 
is illustrated by a recent study that
was<00:00:34.989> published<00:00:35.370> all<00:00:36.370> over<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.700> world

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
was published all over the world

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.660 
was published all over the world
actually<00:00:37.149> which<00:00:37.930> indicated<00:00:38.440> that<00:00:39.430> in<00:00:39.579> the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
actually which indicated that in the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.920 
actually which indicated that in the
united<00:00:39.970> states<00:00:42.690> populations<00:00:43.690> with<00:00:43.840> the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
united states populations with the

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.139 
united states populations with the
lowest<00:00:44.110> income<00:00:44.440> actually<00:00:45.370> had<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.940> longest

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
lowest income actually had the longest

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.220 
lowest income actually had the longest
lifespan<00:00:47.040> that's<00:00:48.040> very<00:00:48.190> surprising<00:00:49.230> nobody

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
lifespan that's very surprising nobody

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.840 
lifespan that's very surprising nobody
expected<00:00:50.770> that<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:53.110> at<00:00:53.230> least<00:00:53.620> is<00:00:53.980> an

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
expected that but at least is an

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.160 
expected that but at least is an
indication<00:00:55.270> that<00:00:55.450> perhaps<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:57.670> we<00:00:57.789> call

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
indication that perhaps what we call

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.100 
indication that perhaps what we call
great<00:00:59.170> health<00:00:59.710> care<00:01:00.270> isn't<00:01:01.270> so<00:01:01.570> great<00:01:01.750> because

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
great health care isn't so great because

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.990 
great health care isn't so great because
it's<00:01:02.500> well<00:01:02.770> known<00:01:02.949> that<00:01:03.010> people<00:01:03.670> in<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.850> lower

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
it's well known that people in the lower

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.910 
it's well known that people in the lower
income<00:01:04.239> brackets<00:01:04.780> supposedly<00:01:05.350> don't<00:01:05.680> get<00:01:05.799> the

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
income brackets supposedly don't get the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.789 
income brackets supposedly don't get the
best<00:01:06.100> health<00:01:06.369> care<00:01:07.259> perhaps<00:01:08.259> that<00:01:08.380> health

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
best health care perhaps that health

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.029 
best health care perhaps that health
care<00:01:09.009> isn't<00:01:10.289> increasing<00:01:11.289> lifespan<00:01:11.740> maybe

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
care isn't increasing lifespan maybe

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.849 
care isn't increasing lifespan maybe
it's<00:01:12.249> decreasing<00:01:13.179> it<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.990> why<00:01:17.139> is<00:01:17.170> there<00:01:17.619> so

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
it's decreasing it so why is there so

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:19.709 
it's decreasing it so why is there so
much<00:01:18.009> confusion<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.819> think<00:01:19.299> there's<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.539> lot<00:01:19.659> of

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
much confusion I think there's a lot of

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.440 
much confusion I think there's a lot of
reasons<00:01:22.349> one<00:01:23.349> reason<00:01:23.679> is<00:01:23.799> that<00:01:24.450> especially

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
reasons one reason is that especially

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.910 
reasons one reason is that especially
when<00:01:25.569> it<00:01:25.659> concerns<00:01:25.719> diet<00:01:26.259> I'm<00:01:26.529> asked<00:01:26.799> this

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
when it concerns diet I'm asked this

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.050 
when it concerns diet I'm asked this
diet<00:01:27.340> good<00:01:27.579> is<00:01:27.759> that<00:01:27.880> good<00:01:28.329> I<00:01:29.279> think<00:01:30.279> that<00:01:30.759> any

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
diet good is that good I think that any

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.909 
diet good is that good I think that any
change<00:01:31.479> in<00:01:32.759> traditional<00:01:34.649> American<00:01:35.649> eating

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:35.919 
change in traditional American eating

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:39.809 
change in traditional American eating
habits<00:01:36.219> will<00:01:36.399> lead<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.669> improvement<00:01:38.639> so<00:01:39.639> it

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
habits will lead to improvement so it

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.029 
habits will lead to improvement so it
doesn't<00:01:40.419> matter<00:01:40.659> you<00:01:41.139> know<00:01:41.229> when<00:01:41.740> you're<00:01:41.859> when

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
doesn't matter you know when you're when

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.999 
doesn't matter you know when you're when
you're<00:01:42.130> saying<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.549> this<00:01:42.849> a<00:01:43.119> good<00:01:43.689> diet

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
you're saying is this a good diet

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.589 
you're saying is this a good diet
compared<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.159> what<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.609> mean<00:01:46.090> compared<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.509> what

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
compared to what I mean compared to what

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:47.849 
compared to what I mean compared to what
you<00:01:46.689> started<00:01:46.929> out<00:01:47.020> with<00:01:47.139> it's<00:01:47.409> absolutely

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
you started out with it's absolutely

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.029 
you started out with it's absolutely
wonderful<00:01:47.950> but<00:01:48.819> is<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:50.200> optimal<00:01:50.709> well

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
wonderful but is it optimal well

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.839 
wonderful but is it optimal well
probably<00:01:51.249> not<00:01:51.639> another<00:01:52.389> reason<00:01:52.599> is<00:01:52.899> that

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849 
probably not another reason is that

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.339 
probably not another reason is that
medicine<00:01:54.849> is<00:01:54.969> controlled<00:01:55.659> by<00:01:55.779> corporations<00:01:56.319> I

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
medicine is controlled by corporations I

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.209 
medicine is controlled by corporations I
think<00:01:59.349> the<00:01:59.409> latest<00:01:59.709> statistic<00:02:00.099> was

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
think the latest statistic was

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.349 
think the latest statistic was
seventy-three<00:02:00.609> percent<00:02:00.669> of<00:02:00.999> all<00:02:01.059> published

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
seventy-three percent of all published

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.269 
seventy-three percent of all published
studies<00:02:04.359> in<00:02:04.630> medical<00:02:05.380> journals<00:02:05.409> are<00:02:05.889> financed

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:06.279 
studies in medical journals are financed

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.040 
studies in medical journals are financed
by<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.459> pharmaceutical<00:02:06.880> industry<00:02:07.149> and<00:02:07.569> their

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
by the pharmaceutical industry and their

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.330 
by the pharmaceutical industry and their
motive<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:09.009> wealth<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.759> not<00:02:09.880> health<00:02:11.159> so<00:02:12.159> there

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
motive is wealth and not health so there

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.020 
motive is wealth and not health so there
is<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> direct

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
is a direct

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.630 
is a direct
antagonism<00:02:16.030> between<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:17.290> two<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.770> two<00:02:18.370> do

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
antagonism between the two the two do

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.120 
antagonism between the two the two do
not<00:02:18.760> correlate<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.290> primary<00:02:20.770> reason<00:02:21.070> I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
not correlate but the primary reason I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.540 
not correlate but the primary reason I
think<00:02:21.340> there's<00:02:21.490> so<00:02:21.580> much<00:02:21.670> confusion<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.240> that

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
think there's so much confusion is that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.030 
think there's so much confusion is that
nobody<00:02:24.550> knows<00:02:24.850> or<00:02:25.630> at<00:02:25.750> least<00:02:25.780> everybody<00:02:26.470> has<00:02:26.680> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
nobody knows or at least everybody has a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.030 
nobody knows or at least everybody has a
different<00:02:27.280> definition<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:28.060> health<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:29.410> so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
different definition of health and so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.960 
different definition of health and so
you're<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.340> find<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.580> thousand

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
you're going to find a thousand

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.810 
you're going to find a thousand
different<00:02:31.030> ways<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:32.050> be<00:02:32.170> healthy<00:02:32.290> because

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
different ways to be healthy because

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.710 
different ways to be healthy because
everybody<00:02:33.820> is<00:02:33.910> giving<00:02:34.030> you<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.270> thousand

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
more hmm but that's a step in the right

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.760 
more hmm but that's a step in the right
direction<00:03:01.480> because<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.260> think<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.530> have<00:03:02.650> to

break long-held beliefs in health and

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.220 
break long-held beliefs in health and
then<00:03:06.550> we<00:03:06.640> can<00:03:06.760> start<00:03:06.940> over<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.420> sometimes<00:03:07.870> the

then we can start over and sometimes the

then we can start over and sometimes the
