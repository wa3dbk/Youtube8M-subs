00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.749
 commercial forest professional 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.409
 this demonstrates the strength and growth of the 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:22.929
 sector 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.119
 agrobusiness in brazil has been one of the

 sectors of the economy that most

 grown up that has more is represented 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.450
 growth in Brazil that is in line with 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.460
 the entire exchange rate part that has 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.139
 favored exports 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.109
 in the case of an extremely fair 

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:43.560
 the presence of the world leader in 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.299
 muscular strength equipment in the

 to participate in xbox is 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.889
 important for two reasons also a 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.289
 because it's a way to get close to 

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:55.090
 end consumer is a very 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.700
 professional market more and more 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.799
 very professional and is a way to 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.319
 people are close to the final consumer 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.320
 in case the professional to know the 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.770
 How does it work? 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.950
 the need for it in relation to the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.140
 market is, and second to have a 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.800
 important in this market 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.230
 the highlight of the 40 is more evident 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.480
 still in this event because it is a 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.550
 which brings several countries of the planet 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.820
 for us the hips with strength is a 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.160
 fair focused on the forest market 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.720
 professional and school has as a vocation 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.480
 focus on the professional market as well 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.280
 be it on the line of motorcycle saws on the line 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.410
 a good line 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.270
 that meets all the needs of 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.400
 of forest contractors is for the 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.410
 Brazilian market then it is clear 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.570
 world market but speaking of Brazil and 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.950
 for being a great showcase where we 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.140
 we can expose our products to 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.370
 that market is that we both 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.290
 we work and we devote ourselves to 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.860
 develop products to them in 2014 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.470
 let's complete 325th year in the world 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.050
 more than three centuries 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.450
 tradition of the brand that is known 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.140
 extreme technology that puts in their 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.489
 products 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.040
 work in a company with more than 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.890
 three centuries market is a great challenge 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.140
 because it's a company that's 325 years old 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.780
 renewing 325 years seeking perfection 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.829
 they are close to the market I think 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.030
 that our responsibility is 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.519
 exactly this understanding the market 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.410
 professional to bring into your 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.180
 companies to develop those needs 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.310
 and come back with what they expect the 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.560
 our goal is exactly to conquer 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.110
 customers and how we are quite 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.989
 announcing throughout this year the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.310
 325 years in the field and in the 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.620
 the field that makes our history and 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.670
 in this segment only the best if 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.820
 stand out 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.549
 since we are talking about consumers 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.860
 extremely demanding. 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.730
 specific technology campaigns are 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.980
 needed 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.940
 This is a great differential to davos. 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.530
 rope ne 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.600
 are the technologies that exist 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.280
 products is a 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.200
 It is a very great feeling wave 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.750
 that the company does in research and 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.000
 development then she has're today 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.230
 working research and development 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.060
 of what will be released in the coming 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.180
 five ten years, right? 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.980
 It's what we have today. 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.480
 pioneering technologies that oscar does not have 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:21.690
 one of them is the touch xis that is a form 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.130
 of you have a fuel consumption 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.140
 lower through better 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.600
 use of this fuel 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.790
 feedback from the expoforest audience is 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.210
 fundamental to the reliability of 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.710
 because they are professional users 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.010
 that use the equipment in such a way 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.780
 intensive and for several hours requiring the 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.000
 maximum of the forest market 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.740
 he has to wait and work and we 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.870
 For this to make more new ones. 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.780
 technologies such as chainsaws with 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.090
 a lower vibration systems or goes with 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.670
 lower fuel consumption is models 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.250
 stock and a whole range of chainsaws 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.470
 that will attend the professional sector a 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.290
 better ergonomics and safety than in 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.270
 the people like the portfolio of 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.700
 products is the whole portfolio of the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.260
 company but the main ones here without 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.510
 remote mountain because we are talking on 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.700
 forestry market and mainly motorcycles 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.130
 besides high displacements to the market 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.250
 forestry professional and I also 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.560
 would notice that she has a 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.980
 very large forest function as well. 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.190
 for thinning trees and 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.680
 also bother is between the streets and 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.050
 validation of this segment confirms the 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.570
 position of the Swedish giant at the 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.190
 through the experiences of the 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.980
 customers with their machines and 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.980
 equipment, which generates expectations for 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.630
 news for this fair I believe that the 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.660
 opportunity for the public to see our 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.370
 range of products and see how we 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.050
 we are well prepared in the segment of 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.790
 motorbike saws as we are well prepared 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.040
 segment including 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.920
 express that can be used in the 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.270
 cultivation of forests are products that 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.770
 are highlights and I'm sure it will 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.740
 fall into the taste of contractors in 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.190
 professional pregnant rice cane comes 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:09.350
 growing in the region 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:11.540
 is in the segment of forest despite adc 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.870
 The market may have dropped a bit 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.390
 people chainsaw has been growing and we are 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.860
 has been disputing a little more along with 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.130
 other brands 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.860
 in short, the event ratified us 40 in 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:29.260
 industry leadership determination 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:32.810
 security tradition reliability 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:37.390
 technology brands that make the rope ros 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.390
 the world leader in power equipment
