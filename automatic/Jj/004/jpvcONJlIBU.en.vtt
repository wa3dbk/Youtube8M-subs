 i 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.529
 good guys the materials we're going 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.740
 to be needing are aritos to tie 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.650
 our chain and obviously chain 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.230
 and the chain already brings these by brush 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.779
 wounds for this we can fasten the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.390
 collar back and I first thing I go 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.310
 to do then take the chain out of here and 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.800
 this chain cost me very cheap I think that 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.670
 like two dollars and I adjust for 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.350
 quite has many chains now what 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.570
 what I'm going to do is I'm going to be cutting 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.690
 chain chain bits 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.239
 simply this I the first one that I'm going to 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.679
 need is 19 inches you can 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.969
 make them 17 and you're going to stay 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.960
 perfect and you are going to cut 4 pieces of 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.579
 chains 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.129
 here I will leave you to what extent they are 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.860
 as I said the first one measures 19 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.960
 inches and that is going to be the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.810
 main with which we are going to give 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.970
 this necklace the second of 10 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.250
 inches the third of seven and the most 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.369
 small of three and I just those 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.740
 chunk pulling the string this comes very 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.380
 be very delicate that only 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.210
 control it with your hands can now 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.369
 the first step is the first one we're going to 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.619
 put in a vee and the biggest one is going to 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.920
 form as if it were our neck and 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.200
 now we're just going to be the tips 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.140
 on shore 9 are specific measures 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.840
 but you have no loses, you are going to stay very 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.270
 look nice as I was being 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.520
 accommodating only with the fingers no no 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.649
 I had no problem now you are going to do 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.340
 like this kind of little vibrator and it's going to jump 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.110
 twice is very easy to tie the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.880
 girls I only did it with the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.750
 fingers if you want you can help with 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.970
 scissors with tweezers now the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.640
 third chain we will accommodate it in 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.110
 the edges likewise with these habits we 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.940
 we are helping to accommodate them and the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.569
 we will take it upwards 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.239
 we'll just choke it with another arito 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.799
 and the last one the smallest we're going to 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.109
 do the same and it's just going to 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.049
 get a bow then we did like 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:26.139
 three arches two arcs and the last one as the 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.840
 small and stays with this kind of 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.760
 tissue and finally we will accommodate 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.099
 the rings to accommodate the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.590
 button up right to hang our 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.209
 necklace that looks pretty indeed this 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.459
