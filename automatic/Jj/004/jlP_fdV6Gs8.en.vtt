00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
so I want my hook point to be up so it

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.190 
so I want my hook point to be up so it
doesn't<00:02:20.000> hook<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.540> bottom<00:02:22.870> use<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.900> little

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
doesn't hook the bottom use a little

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:36.000 
doesn't hook the bottom use a little
crystal<00:02:24.410> flash<00:02:25.600> for<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.660> tail

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.820 
fly they say how come you tied the tail
in<00:02:52.580> wrong<00:02:52.820> well<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.750> answer<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.200> didn't<00:02:54.680> tie

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
in wrong well the answer is I didn't tie

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.400 
in wrong well the answer is I didn't tie
the<00:02:54.890> tail<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.430> wrong<00:02:56.020> because<00:02:57.020> I've

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the tail in wrong because I've

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.500 
the tail in wrong because I've
counterbalanced<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.460> hook<00:02:58.640> so<00:02:59.030> when<00:02:59.210> it's<00:02:59.360> in

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
counterbalanced the hook so when it's in

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.390 
counterbalanced the hook so when it's in
the<00:02:59.600> water<00:02:59.630> it's<00:03:00.140> actually<00:03:00.920> going<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.130> be<00:03:01.250> like

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
the water it's actually going to be like

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.710 
the water it's actually going to be like
that<00:03:05.560> bind<00:03:06.560> that<00:03:06.740> down<00:03:06.980> what<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:07.970> find<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.510> that

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
that bind that down what I find is that

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.020 
that bind that down what I find is that
if<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.930> don't<00:03:08.990> get<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.440> tail<00:03:09.620> down<00:03:09.830> tight<00:03:10.160> that

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
if I don't get the tail down tight that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.890 
if I don't get the tail down tight that
after<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.840> number<00:03:12.650> of<00:03:12.800> small<00:03:13.190> mouths<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:14.630> tails

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
after a number of small mouths the tails

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.090 
after a number of small mouths the tails
gone<00:03:16.540> alright<00:03:17.540> we're<00:03:17.960> going<00:03:18.050> to<00:03:18.140> use<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> black

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
gone alright we're going to use a black

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:28.300 
gone alright we're going to use a black
saddle

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:41.150 

mr.<00:03:29.310> parrot<00:03:30.980> strip<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.010> down<00:03:33.470> bind<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.620> in

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.020 

I<00:03:41.220> tie<00:03:42.230> probably<00:03:43.230> 25<00:03:43.710> different<00:03:44.030> smallmouth

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
I tie probably 25 different smallmouth

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.890 
I tie probably 25 different smallmouth
patterns<00:03:45.680> they're<00:03:46.680> all<00:03:46.860> simple<00:03:47.720> because<00:03:48.720> I

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
patterns they're all simple because I

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.740 
patterns they're all simple because I
would<00:03:49.170> rather<00:03:49.320> fish<00:03:49.830> then<00:03:50.790> tie<00:03:51.120> flies<00:03:53.750> and

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
would rather fish then tie flies and

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.730 
would rather fish then tie flies and
besides<00:03:56.690> they're<00:03:57.690> easy<00:03:57.870> for<00:03:58.110> other<00:03:58.260> people<00:03:58.620> to

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
besides they're easy for other people to

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.820 
besides they're easy for other people to
copy<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.700> they<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.660> go<00:04:00.810> catch<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.440> lot<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.620> fish

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
copy and they can go catch a lot of fish

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.240 
copy and they can go catch a lot of fish
too

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.190

one that has a UV olive they're all

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.870 
one that has a UV olive they're all
really<00:04:26.950> good

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
really good

smallmouth<00:04:28.650> patterns

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.790 

here<00:04:42.670> we<00:04:42.760> go<00:04:42.930> put<00:04:43.930> an<00:04:44.020> extra<00:04:44.290> wrap<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.650> there

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
here we go put an extra wrap in there

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.910 
here we go put an extra wrap in there
just<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.100> make<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:45.250> stays<00:04:45.550> down<00:04:46.710> bind<00:04:47.710> that

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
just to make it stays down bind that

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:56.070 
just to make it stays down bind that
forward<00:04:52.710> five<00:04:53.710> or<00:04:53.890> six<00:04:54.070> wraps<00:04:54.340> up<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.300> always

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
forward five or six wraps up that always

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.140 
forward five or six wraps up that always
looks<00:04:56.290> good<00:04:56.530> we<00:04:57.100> try<00:04:57.280> to<00:04:57.340> get<00:04:57.490> that<00:04:57.640> on<00:04:57.760> film<00:04:57.790> as

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
looks good we try to get that on film as

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.130 
looks good we try to get that on film as
much<00:04:58.300> as<00:04:58.480> possible<00:05:00.600> yeah<00:05:01.600> we'll<00:05:01.810> try<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:02.020> get

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
much as possible yeah we'll try to get

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.030 
much as possible yeah we'll try to get
that<00:05:02.290> on<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:05.050> number<00:05:05.350> of<00:05:05.500> wraps<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:05.890> not

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
that on the number of wraps is not

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.990 
that on the number of wraps is not
important<00:05:06.520> because<00:05:06.580> I<00:05:06.760> don't<00:05:06.790> think

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
important because I don't think

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:19.480 
important because I don't think
smallmouth<00:05:07.570> can<00:05:07.780> count

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
kind of a retarded looking fly but there

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:33.999 
kind of a retarded looking fly but there
you<00:05:21.919> go

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:40.550 

put<00:05:35.009> a<00:05:35.039> head<00:05:35.220> on<00:05:35.250> it
