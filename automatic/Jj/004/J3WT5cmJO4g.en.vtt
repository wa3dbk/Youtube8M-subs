a look at the iphone one first and let's
just<00:00:58.929> set<00:00:59.469> my<00:00:59.559> macbook<00:00:59.920> aside<00:01:02.309> okay<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:03.370> before

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:03.639 
just set my macbook aside okay so before

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:06.450 
just set my macbook aside okay so before
we<00:01:03.940> begin<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:05.409> guys<00:01:05.560> might<00:01:05.799> know<00:01:06.010> this<00:01:06.280> is

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
we begin as you guys might know this is

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.240 
we begin as you guys might know this is
a<00:01:06.490> 3m<00:01:07.119> paper<00:01:07.479> which<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:07.990> decals<00:01:08.830> come<00:01:09.100> on

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
a 3m paper which the decals come on

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.220 
a 3m paper which the decals come on
what's<00:01:09.940> great<00:01:10.090> about<00:01:10.210> this<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:10.630> that<00:01:10.870> they

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
what's great about this is that they

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.350 
what's great about this is that they
actually<00:01:11.280> reusable<00:01:12.280> which<00:01:12.370> means<00:01:12.640> if<00:01:12.940> you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
actually reusable which means if you

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.910 
actually reusable which means if you
ever<00:01:13.480> get<00:01:13.660> tired<00:01:13.870> of<00:01:14.050> them<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.350> can<00:01:14.470> just<00:01:14.680> take

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
ever get tired of them you can just take

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.200 
ever get tired of them you can just take
them<00:01:15.070> off<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.250> stick<00:01:15.670> them<00:01:15.760> back<00:01:15.820> on<00:01:16.090> this

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
them off and stick them back on this

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.420 
them off and stick them back on this
paper<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.750> then<00:01:17.440> you're<00:01:17.710> good<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.890> go<00:01:17.980> until

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
paper and then you're good to go until

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.490 
paper and then you're good to go until
you<00:01:18.940> want<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.300> use<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.540> again<00:01:19.720> so<00:01:20.110> these<00:01:20.440> are

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
you want to use it again so these are

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.690 
you want to use it again so these are
actually<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.920> ones<00:01:20.950> that<00:01:21.190> came<00:01:21.310> with<00:01:21.580> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
actually the ones that came with the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.610 
actually the ones that came with the
macbook<00:01:22.030> pro<00:01:22.060> but<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.050> iphone<00:01:23.320> ones<00:01:23.470> are

about that is that it just gives it a
different<00:02:10.360> color<00:02:10.659> than<00:02:10.929> black<00:02:11.080> carbon<00:02:11.560> fiber

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
iphone it's a smaller device and you can

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.110 
iphone it's a smaller device and you can
cover<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.469> whole<00:03:07.500> thing<00:03:07.680> at<00:03:08.219> once<00:03:08.280> but<00:03:09.000> in

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
cover the whole thing at once but in

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.539 
cover the whole thing at once but in
this<00:03:09.299> case<00:03:09.569> you<00:03:10.319> got<00:03:10.439> to<00:03:10.530> start<00:03:10.739> out<00:03:10.889> at<00:03:11.159> a

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
this case you got to start out at a

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.879 
this case you got to start out at a
corner<00:03:12.030> and<00:03:12.329> then<00:03:12.450> work<00:03:13.049> your<00:03:13.079> way<00:03:13.290> outwards

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
corner and then work your way outwards

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.830 
corner and then work your way outwards
not<00:03:14.669> only<00:03:14.790> does<00:03:14.909> that<00:03:15.060> mean<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.659> have<00:03:15.689> to

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
not only does that mean that you have to

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.039 
not only does that mean that you have to
work<00:03:16.769> out<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.129> air<00:03:17.250> bubbles<00:03:17.639> but<00:03:18.629> it<00:03:18.719> means<00:03:18.840> if

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
work out the air bubbles but it means if

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.140 
work out the air bubbles but it means if
you<00:03:19.200> make<00:03:19.349> a<00:03:19.379> tiny<00:03:19.680> mistake<00:03:20.129> you<00:03:20.969> have<00:03:21.120> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
you make a tiny mistake you have a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.699 
you make a tiny mistake you have a
crease<00:03:21.450> anywhere<00:03:21.959> then<00:03:22.169> you<00:03:22.230> got<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.409> remove

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
crease anywhere then you got to remove

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.430 
crease anywhere then you got to remove
the<00:03:22.919> whole<00:03:23.099> thing<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:24.329> as<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.109> can<00:03:25.229> see<00:03:25.409> I

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
the whole thing but as you can see I

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.879 
the whole thing but as you can see I
think<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.769> did<00:03:25.889> a<00:03:25.949> pretty<00:03:25.979> good<00:03:26.310> job<00:03:26.370> here<00:03:26.760> um

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
think I did a pretty good job here um

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.559 
think I did a pretty good job here um
let's<00:03:28.889> zoom<00:03:29.069> in<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.370> apple<00:03:29.609> logo<00:03:29.639> and

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
let's zoom in on the apple logo and

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.479 
let's zoom in on the apple logo and
basically<00:03:31.290> as<00:03:31.530> long<00:03:31.560> as<00:03:31.859> you<00:03:31.949> have<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.099> apple

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
basically as long as you have the apple

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.699 
basically as long as you have the apple
logo<00:03:32.519> lined<00:03:33.000> up<00:03:33.180> well<00:03:33.419> then<00:03:34.139> everything<00:03:34.590> else

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
logo lined up well then everything else

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.789 
logo lined up well then everything else
will<00:03:34.889> line<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.359> after<00:03:36.359> that<00:03:36.479> so<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:37.079> would

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
will line up after that so I would

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.490 
will line up after that so I would
obviously<00:03:38.189> say<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:39.120> recommend<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.989> to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
obviously say and recommend to you to

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.580 
obviously say and recommend to you to
start<00:03:41.430> off<00:03:41.579> by<00:03:42.019> lining<00:03:43.019> up<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.139> apple<00:03:43.560> logo

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
start off by lining up the apple logo

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.319 
start off by lining up the apple logo
and<00:03:44.069> then<00:03:44.310> working<00:03:44.549> your<00:03:44.699> way<00:03:44.879> outwards

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
and then working your way outwards

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.780 
and then working your way outwards
although<00:03:46.139> some<00:03:46.379> people<00:03:46.500> do<00:03:46.829> prefer<00:03:46.859> starting

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
although some people do prefer starting

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.409

off<00:03:47.879> in<00:03:47.909> the<00:03:48.090> corner<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:51.060> now<00:03:51.180> we'll<00:03:51.299> take<00:03:51.359> a

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
off in the corner so now we'll take a

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.360 
off in the corner so now we'll take a
look<00:03:51.540> at<00:03:51.659> the<00:03:51.780> inside<00:03:51.810> now<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.709> inside<00:03:53.159> is

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
look at the inside now the inside is

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.300 
look at the inside now the inside is
really<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:54.150> harder<00:03:54.930> part<00:03:55.109> about<00:03:55.319> this<00:03:55.560> I'm

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
really the harder part about this I'm

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.270 
really the harder part about this I'm
going<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.549> move<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.729> guys<00:03:56.849> up<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.359> little<00:03:57.689> bit

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
going to move you guys up a little bit

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.219 
going to move you guys up a little bit
so<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.430> take<00:03:59.699> a<00:03:59.909> better<00:04:00.780> look<00:04:00.840> at<00:04:01.079> that

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
so you can take a better look at that

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.429 
so you can take a better look at that
okay<00:04:02.189> so<00:04:02.250> as<00:04:02.699> you<00:04:03.209> can<00:04:03.299> see<00:04:03.479> this<00:04:03.870> actually

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
okay so as you can see this actually

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.339 
okay so as you can see this actually
covers<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:06.269> areas<00:04:06.659> that<00:04:06.870> are<00:04:07.139> not<00:04:07.169> the

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
covers the areas that are not the

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.839 
covers the areas that are not the
trackpad<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:08.040> keyboard<00:04:08.220> or<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.489> speaker

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
trackpad and the keyboard or the speaker

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.020 
trackpad and the keyboard or the speaker
so<00:04:09.060> basically<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.439> whole<00:04:10.759> inside<00:04:11.759> of<00:04:11.819> the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
so basically the whole inside of the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.890 
so basically the whole inside of the
macbook<00:04:12.229> except<00:04:13.229> for<00:04:13.379> that<00:04:13.500> now<00:04:14.689> this<00:04:15.689> was

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
macbook except for that now this was

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.420 
macbook except for that now this was
actually<00:04:16.019> hard<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.530> install<00:04:16.889> because<00:04:17.130> of

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
actually hard to install because of

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.180 
actually hard to install because of
these<00:04:17.549> little<00:04:17.849> strips<00:04:18.650> what<00:04:19.650> was<00:04:19.799> happening

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
these little strips what was happening

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.979 
these little strips what was happening
was<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:20.430> was<00:04:20.549> trying<00:04:20.759> to<00:04:20.849> put<00:04:21.030> this<00:04:21.180> down<00:04:21.419> and

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
was I was trying to put this down and

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.439 
was I was trying to put this down and
the<00:04:22.079> strips<00:04:22.380> would<00:04:22.500> get<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.770> way<00:04:22.860> now<00:04:23.639> I

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
the strips would get in the way now I

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.659 
the strips would get in the way now I
really<00:04:24.990> didn't<00:04:25.229> like<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.500> fact<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:26.070> wish<00:04:26.490> they

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
really didn't like that fact I wish they

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.879 
really didn't like that fact I wish they
would<00:04:26.820> have<00:04:26.909> given<00:04:27.779> you<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.080> top<00:04:28.380> separate

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
would have given you the top separate

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.250 
would have given you the top separate
from<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.159> bottom<00:04:29.460> but<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:30.180> know<00:04:30.300> what<00:04:31.050> can

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
from the bottom but you know what can

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.830 
from the bottom but you know what can
you<00:04:31.349> do

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
you do

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.290 
you do
as<00:04:32.230> you<00:04:32.320> can<00:04:32.440> see<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:33.460> button<00:04:33.760> right<00:04:33.910> here<00:04:33.940> is

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
as you can see the button right here is

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.540 
as you can see the button right here is
a<00:04:34.330> little<00:04:34.690> off<00:04:34.840> because<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.040> fact<00:04:36.220> that

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
a little off because of the fact that

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.050 
a little off because of the fact that
the<00:04:37.150> strips<00:04:37.449> were<00:04:37.570> so<00:04:37.750> hard<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.050> install<00:04:38.380> but

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
the strips were so hard to install but

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.650 
the strips were so hard to install but
overall<00:04:40.060> pretty<00:04:41.280> good<00:04:42.280> product<00:04:42.760> now<00:04:43.030> pricing

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
overall pretty good product now pricing

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.810 
overall pretty good product now pricing
options<00:04:44.050> for<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.500> macbook<00:04:44.680> pro<00:04:44.889> are<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.430> little

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
options for the macbook pro are a little

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.850 
options for the macbook pro are a little
bit<00:04:46.000> different<00:04:46.360> as<00:04:46.449> well<00:04:46.600> you<00:04:47.350> actually<00:04:47.530> have

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
bit different as well you actually have

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.280 
bit different as well you actually have
two<00:04:48.070> possible<00:04:48.520> combinations<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.419> can<00:04:49.900> choose

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
two possible combinations you can choose

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.790 
two possible combinations you can choose
this<00:04:50.680> back<00:04:50.949> only<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.639> that'll<00:04:52.120> go<00:04:52.270> for<00:04:52.800> 1996

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
this back only and that'll go for 1996

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.090 
this back only and that'll go for 1996
and<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.910> think<00:04:55.150> that<00:04:55.360> is<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.600> good<00:04:56.350> option<00:04:56.530> if<00:04:56.919> you

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
and I think that is a good option if you

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.980 
and I think that is a good option if you
don't<00:04:57.280> want<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:58.000> inside<00:04:58.389> protection<00:04:58.840> I

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
don't want the the inside protection I

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.680 
don't want the the inside protection I
would<00:04:59.169> say<00:04:59.350> just<00:04:59.560> go<00:04:59.889> for<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.130> back<00:05:00.340> it's<00:05:01.240> it's

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
would say just go for the back it's it's

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.300 
would say just go for the back it's it's
not<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.080> don't<00:05:02.139> like<00:05:02.380> that<00:05:02.620> it's<00:05:02.889> just<00:05:03.190> the

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
not that I don't like that it's just the

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.100 
not that I don't like that it's just the
fact<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.639> it's<00:05:03.970> such<00:05:04.180> a<00:05:04.210> pain<00:05:04.479> to<00:05:04.720> install

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
fact that it's such a pain to install

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.920 
fact that it's such a pain to install
and<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:06.220> 10<00:05:06.790> extra<00:05:07.030> bucks<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.540> would<00:05:07.690> really

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
and so 10 extra bucks I would really

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.650 
and so 10 extra bucks I would really
rather<00:05:08.169> just<00:05:08.560> make<00:05:09.490> your<00:05:09.729> outside<00:05:10.510> of<00:05:10.600> the

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
rather just make your outside of the

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.960 
rather just make your outside of the
macbook<00:05:10.840> look<00:05:11.200> badass<00:05:11.440> because<00:05:11.910> people<00:05:12.910> don't

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
macbook look badass because people don't

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.550 
macbook look badass because people don't
really<00:05:13.210> take<00:05:13.479> a<00:05:13.510> look<00:05:13.720> at<00:05:13.840> the<00:05:13.960> inside<00:05:13.990> of<00:05:14.290> it

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
really take a look at the inside of it

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.290 
really take a look at the inside of it
but<00:05:14.800> if<00:05:14.950> you<00:05:14.979> do<00:05:15.250> want<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.580> combo<00:05:15.970> which<00:05:16.150> is

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
but if you do want the combo which is

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.629 
but if you do want the combo which is
obviously<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.750> back<00:05:16.960> and<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.470> in<00:05:17.590> size<00:05:17.830> then

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
obviously the back and the in size then

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.950 
obviously the back and the in size then
that<00:05:18.850> will<00:05:19.000> be<00:05:19.380> 2995<00:05:20.380> so<00:05:21.419> overall<00:05:22.419> guys<00:05:22.720> I

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
that will be 2995 so overall guys I

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.540
