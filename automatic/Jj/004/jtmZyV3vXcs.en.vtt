00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.790
 how about friends autocosmos.com my name 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.710
 hector is greater and today within the best 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.330
 that we are testing this 2014 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:19.780
 We have the porsche targa 4s 2014 as 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.539
 come is a porsche 911 which is missing 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.439
 a piece of the awning is a version like 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.769
 intermediate between the career porsche and the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.080
 convertible let's say that nothing else we have 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.440
 lack of an awning awning in the party 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.890
 of the medium as did the first 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.680
 charge of 1966 to which he was appointed by 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.960
 race Targa Florio with him 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.739
 Over the years the porsche 911 targa 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.590
 it was changing and good until the last 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.719
 generation instead of removing the awning 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.190
 really nothing else was a piece of 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.480
 glass that slid on the part of 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.530
 back and now it has a mechanism 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.170
 quite complex and quite above all 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.480
 spectacular because the same awning is 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.610
 saved in the back is a part 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.250
 very beautiful and we also have now the 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.180
 classic targa arch we will handle it 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.060
 now yes 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:18.490
 and see all this porsche 911 has 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:22.150
 targa 4 s 2014 the porsche 911 targa nothing 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.120
 more is offered as load 4 and 4 s than in 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.770
 this time we are testing the 4s and 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.430
 Well the difference is the engine and a 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.430
 little equipment 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.890
 what it means to be charging 4 is that 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.890
 has the all-wheel drive 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.740
 and let's say that helps you have more 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.710
 grip we have a 6 cylinder engine 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.070
 as it is traditional in porsche boxster 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.030
 obviously 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.030
 3.8 liters 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.580
 400 horses good now we come to you 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.670
 let's say in the most relaxed way 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.550
 but if we press the button here of sport 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.850
 plus the car 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.850
 let's say it enters as a state 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.850
 altered 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.270
 and then that 's when you can visit 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.770
 best 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.770
 these 400 horses 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.100
 also 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.310
 we have the escape 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.500
 is an optional extra obviously and that 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.810
 it produces a much rougher sound and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.040
 let's say you feel much more 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.040
 sports in this way 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.280
 a pretty rich sound the porch 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.580
 very very very characteristic of the brand 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.580
 this six cylinders 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.670
 and good talking about performance we have 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.410
 an acceleration from 0 to 100 kilometers 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.240
 per hour of 4.2 seconds 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.560
 it's not too fast but 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.560
 it fails that is enough 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.060
 it's enough to get excited 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.470
 the suspension the truth is that it is with 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.240
 everything and that has the suspension 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.280
 adaptive 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.470
 it's pretty soft, they 're not 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.590
 as rigid as we would like to 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.410
 enjoy on the track 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.540
 but let's say that then we are 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.760
 speaking rather of one 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.760
 of a grand touring car that 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.190
 what is it to devour distances and 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.190
 enjoy the way 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.200
 the maximum speed 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.540
 are 295 kilometers per hour and if I believe it 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.080
 with everything and that is quite heavy 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.080
 thanks to 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.290
 the opening system Awning 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.290
 automatic 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.330
 and of course the traction system 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.330
 integral 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.770
 something that 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.140
 that we did not like so much is that the awning 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.980
 It can not be opened while you're walking 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.200
 but you have to wait 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.760
 to stop you shine on the road 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.760
 and then you can open or close it 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.620
 with the integral traction system 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.620
 you have a lot of grip 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.410
 and they forgive you a lot of things 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.130
 koch is well balanced with everything and that 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.130
 the engine is in the back 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.409
 it feels very well balanced the time 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.889
 maybe he 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:21.620
 the clue is not him 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.169
 in the ideal environment where they stand out 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.150
 all its qualities but rather 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.439
 on the road but good of all 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.439
 ways we have fun 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.289
 of course you can take control 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.289
 traction 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.519
 and in any case it is very difficult to be 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:05.519
 go 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.220
 it's like that let it move a little bit more 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.460
 the back 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.610
 but the truth is that 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.150
 the car is not told what it 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.150
 deactivate 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.150
 and you have a funny car if it's a 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.270
 Very luxurious car really feels 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.540
 special the interior has very good 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.250
 finishes the skin smells very rich 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.330
 and as we said it is rather for 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.330
 enjoy on the road 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.220
 what more can you ask for than a porch 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.120
 convertible 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.120
 until next time 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.340
 boxes
