00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
for this playing in the second level

for this playing in the second level
also<00:00:20.430> playing<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> assassin<00:00:22.070> have<00:00:23.070> for

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
also playing is the assassin have for

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.310 
also playing is the assassin have for
the<00:00:23.850> most<00:00:23.880> part<00:00:24.269> my<00:00:24.449> strategy<00:00:24.840> was<00:00:24.960> basically

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the most part my strategy was basically

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.570 
the most part my strategy was basically
just<00:00:25.529> stay<00:00:25.769> back<00:00:26.779> use<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:27.930> dagger<00:00:28.140> throw<00:00:28.500> to

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
just stay back use your dagger throw to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.939 
just stay back use your dagger throw to
range<00:00:29.580> kill<00:00:29.910> everything<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.630> things<00:00:31.619> got<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
range kill everything and things got a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.900 
range kill everything and things got a
little<00:00:32.160> crazy<00:00:33.079> user<00:00:34.079> stun<00:00:34.469> ability<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.250> keep

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
little crazy user stun ability to keep

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.959 
little crazy user stun ability to keep
things<00:00:36.180> some<00:00:36.480> runners<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
things some runners and this is one of

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.330 
things some runners and this is one of
the<00:00:42.030> shorter<00:00:42.390> levels<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.770> my<00:00:43.890> coming<00:00:44.219> up

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the shorter levels one on my coming up

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.790 
the shorter levels one on my coming up
five<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.059> six<00:00:45.300> minutes<00:00:45.360> long<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.230> rush

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
five to six minutes long if you rush

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.670 
five to six minutes long if you rush
through<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
through it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.770 
through it
and<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:51.680> hardest<00:00:51.830> part<00:00:52.190> for<00:00:52.490> me<00:00:53.270> was<00:00:53.420> the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
and the hardest part for me was the

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.490 
and the hardest part for me was the
language<00:00:54.470> Archer<00:00:55.280> skeletons<00:00:56.410> pretty<00:00:57.410> much

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
language Archer skeletons pretty much

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.229 
language Archer skeletons pretty much
anything<00:00:57.739> ranged<00:00:58.220> was<00:00:58.460> really<00:00:58.700> hard<00:00:58.880> for<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
anything ranged was really hard for the

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.810 
anything ranged was really hard for the
melee<00:00:59.510> classes<00:00:59.810> and<00:01:00.370> this<00:01:01.370> level<00:01:01.670> doesn't

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
melee classes and this level doesn't

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.010 
melee classes and this level doesn't
seem<00:01:02.120> to<00:01:02.210> have<00:01:02.300> too<00:01:02.420> many<00:01:02.540> of<00:01:02.720> them<00:01:02.810> there's

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
seem to have too many of them there's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.869 
seem to have too many of them there's
still<00:01:03.200> something<00:01:03.380> like<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.890> they're<00:01:04.699> pretty

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
still something like that they're pretty

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.430 
still something like that they're pretty
easy<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.300> get<00:01:05.630> around<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:07.869> this<00:01:08.869> achievements

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
easy to get around and this achievements

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.770 
easy to get around and this achievements
all<00:01:09.979> these<00:01:10.250> are<00:01:10.310> at<00:01:10.550> the<00:01:10.640> mage<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.630> walk

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
all these are at the mage and the walk

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.880 
all these are at the mage and the walk
harder<00:01:12.140> with<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.410> mercenary<00:01:14.590> but<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.740> is

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
harder with the mercenary but it is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.000 
harder with the mercenary but it is
doable<00:01:16.070> with<00:01:16.490> all<00:01:16.610> three<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:16.880> them<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:18.680> the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
doable with all three of them and the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.590 
doable with all three of them and the
fastest<00:01:19.430> way<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.670> build<00:01:19.910> up<00:01:20.000> your<00:01:20.030> multiplier

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
fastest way to build up your multiplier

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.790 
fastest way to build up your multiplier
is<00:01:21.580> by<00:01:22.580> doing<00:01:22.640> change<00:01:23.090> those<00:01:23.360> if<00:01:24.320> you<00:01:24.470> can<00:01:24.649> get

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
is by doing change those if you can get

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.410 
is by doing change those if you can get
double<00:01:25.160> killed<00:01:25.369> triple<00:01:25.850> kills<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.300> will

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
double killed triple kills that will

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.480 
double killed triple kills that will
give<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:26.899> more<00:01:27.050> points<00:01:27.290> which<00:01:27.560> will<00:01:27.740> add<00:01:27.920> your

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
give you more points which will add your

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.660 
give you more points which will add your
multiplier<00:01:28.940> faster<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.280> but<00:01:31.280> in<00:01:31.369> order<00:01:31.550> to

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
multiplier faster and but in order to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.749 
multiplier faster and but in order to
get<00:01:31.850> eight<00:01:32.090> times<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:32.840> requires<00:01:33.649> an<00:01:34.340> almost

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
get eight times it requires an almost

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.609 
get eight times it requires an almost
perfect<00:01:35.000> play<00:01:35.360> through<00:01:35.630> without<00:01:36.200> getting<00:01:36.470> hit

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
perfect play through without getting hit

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.450 
perfect play through without getting hit
in<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.369> entire<00:01:37.670> level

lock<00:02:25.560> down<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.830> archers<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.430> pretty<00:02:27.180> handy

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.210 

you<00:02:40.230> should<00:02:40.410> have<00:02:40.500> caught<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.710> explosive

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
you should have caught that explosive

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.730 
you should have caught that explosive
barrel<00:02:41.490> into<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.880> little<00:02:42.390> room<00:02:42.720> before<00:02:43.560> the
