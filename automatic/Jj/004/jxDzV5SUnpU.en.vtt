00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.700
 today we are going to make rice with milk but 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.230
 in a special way we will do it with the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.930
 caramelized sugar so that later 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 will be a color like cinnamon a very color 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.760
 nice and let's go there 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.660
 we cover 200 grams of sugar with 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.980
 Water 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.980
 and we take it to the fire 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.570
 and we keep it on fire very alive until 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.059
 point of candy we throw the milk but 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.059
 carefully 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.720
 after having made a milk with 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.730
 very careful and little by little because that 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.170
 it can go away and you can burn with 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.540
 very careful and little by little take the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.650

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.990
 after that we throw in that little ball that 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.370

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.370

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.940

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.940

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.470
