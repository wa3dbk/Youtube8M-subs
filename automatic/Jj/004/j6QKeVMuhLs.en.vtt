skates<00:00:21.310> the<00:00:21.550> new<00:00:21.850> game<00:00:22.060> from<00:00:22.330> EA<00:00:22.510> it's<00:00:23.170> really

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
skates the new game from EA it's really

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.590 
skates the new game from EA it's really
the<00:00:23.770> first<00:00:24.010> next<00:00:24.520> generation<00:00:25.029> skateboarding

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
the first next generation skateboarding

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.060 
the first next generation skateboarding
game<00:00:25.779> I<00:00:25.960> love<00:00:26.200> skateboarding<00:00:26.500> I<00:00:26.830> think<00:00:27.010> it

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
game I love skateboarding I think it

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.950 
game I love skateboarding I think it
feels<00:00:27.279> great<00:00:27.670> I<00:00:27.730> think<00:00:27.940> it's<00:00:28.210> cool<00:00:28.450> I<00:00:28.750> think

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
feels great I think it's cool I think

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.749 
feels great I think it's cool I think
bombing<00:00:29.320> down<00:00:29.410> hills<00:00:29.740> is<00:00:30.040> awesome<00:00:30.430> I<00:00:30.550> think

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
bombing down hills is awesome I think

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.190 
bombing down hills is awesome I think
the<00:00:30.849> feeling<00:00:31.180> of<00:00:31.270> crappy<00:00:31.599> and<00:00:31.869> all<00:00:31.990> he<00:00:32.169> just

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
the feeling of crappy and all he just

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.110 
the feeling of crappy and all he just
has<00:00:32.470> so<00:00:32.650> much<00:00:32.770> power<00:00:33.040> to<00:00:33.220> it<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:33.670> we<00:00:33.880> wanted<00:00:34.060> to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
has so much power to it and we wanted to

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.880 
has so much power to it and we wanted to
bring<00:00:34.300> that<00:00:34.360> experience<00:00:34.660> into<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.470> game<00:00:35.650> we

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
bring that experience into the game we

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.610 
bring that experience into the game we
really<00:00:36.010> started<00:00:36.520> with<00:00:36.700> the<00:00:37.180> physics<00:00:37.570> so<00:00:38.320> it's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
really started with the physics so it's

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.680 
really started with the physics so it's
driven<00:00:38.860> by<00:00:39.040> physics<00:00:39.579> it's<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:39.850> real<00:00:40.030> skateboard

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
driven by physics it's a real skateboard

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.330 
driven by physics it's a real skateboard
we<00:00:40.870> modeled<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.350> wheels<00:00:41.590> we<00:00:41.829> modeled<00:00:42.220> the

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
we modeled the wheels we modeled the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.340 
we modeled the wheels we modeled the
trucks<00:00:42.670> we<00:00:42.880> model<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.360> skateboard<00:00:43.870> deck<00:00:44.110> when

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
trucks we model the skateboard deck when

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.570 
trucks we model the skateboard deck when
you're<00:00:44.500> moving<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.950> left<00:00:45.160> stick<00:00:45.370> you're

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
you're moving the left stick you're

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.950 
you're moving the left stick you're
actually<00:00:45.700> putting<00:00:46.000> weight<00:00:46.330> on<00:00:46.360> one<00:00:46.570> side<00:00:46.930> of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
actually putting weight on one side of

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.750 
actually putting weight on one side of
the<00:00:47.140> board<00:00:47.380> or<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.620> other<00:00:47.800> so<00:00:48.130> it<00:00:48.250> just<00:00:48.460> moves

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
the board or the other so it just moves

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.490 
the board or the other so it just moves
like<00:00:49.060> it<00:00:49.210> should<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:49.720> it<00:00:49.810> just<00:00:49.960> looks<00:00:50.260> and

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
like it should so it just looks and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.200 
like it should so it just looks and
feels<00:00:50.800> right<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.460> right<00:00:51.670> stick<00:00:51.940> is<00:00:52.060> your

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
feels right the right stick is your

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.880 
feels right the right stick is your
board<00:00:52.420> control<00:00:52.840> we<00:00:53.200> call<00:00:53.410> it<00:00:53.440> flick<00:00:53.770> it

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
board control we call it flick it

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.350 
board control we call it flick it
because<00:00:54.130> that's<00:00:54.310> what<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.490> do<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:54.910> pull<00:00:55.210> back

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
because that's what you do you pull back

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.060 
because that's what you do you pull back
to<00:00:55.690> crouch<00:00:55.900> your<00:00:56.110> skater<00:00:56.380> and<00:00:56.530> then<00:00:56.650> flick<00:00:56.950> it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
to crouch your skater and then flick it

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.680 
to crouch your skater and then flick it
forward<00:00:57.430> and<00:00:57.520> that's<00:00:57.670> how<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:57.910> ollie<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.480> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
forward and that's how you ollie and the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.390 
forward and that's how you ollie and the
faster<00:00:58.960> you<00:00:59.260> flick<00:00:59.500> it<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.980> higher<00:01:00.190> they

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
faster you flick it the higher they

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.430 
faster you flick it the higher they
always<00:01:00.700> going<00:01:00.910> to<00:01:01.000> be<00:01:01.030> or<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.750> can<00:01:01.870> do<00:01:01.960> nice

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
always going to be or you can do nice

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.870 
always going to be or you can do nice
little<00:01:02.770> light<00:01:02.920> little<00:01:03.160> ones<00:01:03.370> if<00:01:03.550> that's<00:01:03.730> what

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
little light little ones if that's what

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.429 
little light little ones if that's what
you<00:01:04.000> want<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.449> it's<00:01:04.600> really<00:01:04.809> tying<00:01:05.229> that

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
you want so it's really tying that

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.350 
you want so it's really tying that
physics<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.070> feeling<00:01:06.460> from<00:01:06.729> what<00:01:06.939> you<00:01:07.060> do<00:01:07.210> on

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
physics and feeling from what you do on

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.999 
physics and feeling from what you do on
the<00:01:07.479> controls<00:01:07.869> into<00:01:08.170> what's<00:01:08.470> happening<00:01:08.530> in

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
the controls into what's happening in

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.770 
the controls into what's happening in
the<00:01:09.130> game<00:01:09.310> and<00:01:09.490> making<00:01:10.060> that<00:01:10.180> connection<00:01:10.479> as

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
the game and making that connection as

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.719 
the game and making that connection as
close<00:01:11.080> as<00:01:11.380> possible<00:01:11.439> and<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.130> analog<00:01:12.460> sticks

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
close as possible and the analog sticks

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.219 
close as possible and the analog sticks
very<00:01:13.000> important<00:01:13.509> we're<00:01:13.750> really<00:01:13.930> starting

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
very important we're really starting

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.080 
very important we're really starting
with<00:01:14.590> like<00:01:14.799> looking<00:01:15.189> at<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.430> controls<00:01:15.850> and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
with like looking at the controls and

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.639 
with like looking at the controls and
how<00:01:16.330> can<00:01:16.630> we<00:01:16.780> make<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.020> feel<00:01:17.469> like

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
how can we make this feel like

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.319 
how can we make this feel like
skateboarding<00:01:18.219> controllers<00:01:18.789> didn't<00:01:19.060> change

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
skateboarding controllers didn't change

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.690 
skateboarding controllers didn't change
for<00:01:19.749> the<00:01:19.840> next<00:01:20.079> generation<00:01:20.560> consoles<00:01:21.070> or<00:01:21.280> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
for the next generation consoles or the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.730 
for the next generation consoles or the
new<00:01:21.880> generation<00:01:22.509> consoles<00:01:22.960> they're<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.560> same

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
new generation consoles they're the same

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.800 
new generation consoles they're the same
so<00:01:24.340> I<00:01:24.369> was<00:01:24.429> really<00:01:24.700> looking<00:01:24.880> at<00:01:25.179> it<00:01:25.270> like<00:01:25.390> how

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
so I was really looking at it like how

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.569 
so I was really looking at it like how
can<00:01:26.049> we<00:01:26.170> make<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.409> feel<00:01:26.829> like<00:01:26.979> skateboarding

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
can we make this feel like skateboarding

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.669 
can we make this feel like skateboarding
and<00:01:27.759> we<00:01:28.179> sent<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.569> centered<00:01:29.049> in<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.439> this<00:01:29.530> is

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
and we sent to centered in and this is

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.739 
and we sent to centered in and this is
my<00:01:29.829> body<00:01:30.039> this<00:01:30.249> is<00:01:30.369> my<00:01:30.490> board<00:01:30.880> control<00:01:31.329> at<00:01:31.659> a

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
my body this is my board control at a

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.480 
my body this is my board control at a
left<00:01:31.929> hand<00:01:32.170> in<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:32.350> right<00:01:32.530> hand<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.100> two<00:01:33.219> feet

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
left hand in a right hand and two feet

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.429 
left hand in a right hand and two feet
and<00:01:33.759> that's<00:01:33.969> it<00:01:34.179> and<00:01:34.359> it's<00:01:34.719> worked<00:01:34.929> you<00:01:35.350> know

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
and that's it and it's worked you know

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.050 
and that's it and it's worked you know
we're<00:01:35.590> able<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.920> build<00:01:36.189> everything<00:01:36.490> we<00:01:36.729> wanted

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
we're able to build everything we wanted

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.209 
we're able to build everything we wanted
to<00:01:37.119> just<00:01:37.539> into<00:01:37.840> those<00:01:37.990> simple<00:01:38.350> controls<00:01:38.710> the

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
to just into those simple controls the

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:40.950 
to just into those simple controls the

to<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.140> master<00:03:09.620> them<00:03:09.769> so<00:03:10.069> they<00:03:10.190> always

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
to you to master them so they always

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.820 
to you to master them so they always
simple<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.269> kickflip<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:12.110> simple<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.560> is

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
simple the kickflip it's simple to is

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.770 
simple the kickflip it's simple to is
just<00:03:12.980> off<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.340> side<00:03:13.640> getting<00:03:14.390> into<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:14.750> a

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
just off to the side getting into like a

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.930 
just off to the side getting into like a
360<00:03:15.440> shuvit<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:16.069> got<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.280> get<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.400> nice<00:03:16.610> swing

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
360 shuvit you got to get a nice swing

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.090 
360 shuvit you got to get a nice swing
of<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.180> stick<00:03:17.480> or<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.959> 360<00:03:18.650> flip<00:03:18.680> which

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
of the stick or a 360 flip which

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.650 
of the stick or a 360 flip which
combines<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.760> two<00:03:19.790> of<00:03:20.000> them<00:03:20.150> it's<00:03:20.299> almost<00:03:20.480> a

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
combines the two of them it's almost a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.300 
combines the two of them it's almost a
check<00:03:20.900> mark<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.590> get<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.769> shove<00:03:22.069> and

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
check mark you have to get a shove and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.069 
check mark you have to get a shove and
then<00:03:22.459> add<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.730> kickflip<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.269> top<00:03:23.510> some<00:03:23.810> people

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
then add the kickflip on top some people

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.750 
then add the kickflip on top some people
might<00:03:24.230> do<00:03:24.410> it<00:03:24.530> by<00:03:24.650> accident<00:03:24.769> but<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:25.609> do<00:03:25.730> it

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
might do it by accident but to do it

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.490 
might do it by accident but to do it
every<00:03:26.120> time<00:03:26.150> when<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.780> really<00:03:27.109> want<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.380> you

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
every time when you really want to you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.009 
every time when you really want to you
have<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.829> master<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.459> controls<00:03:28.760> well<00:03:29.510> reality

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
have to master the controls well reality

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.690 
have to master the controls well reality
is<00:03:30.079> really<00:03:30.380> crazy<00:03:30.620> while<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:31.310> authentic

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
is really crazy while it is authentic

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.300 
is really crazy while it is authentic
skateboarding<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:33.680> feels<00:03:34.070> like

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
skateboarding and it feels like

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.190 
skateboarding and it feels like
skateboarding<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:35.090> it's<00:03:35.269> as<00:03:35.510> close<00:03:35.900> as<00:03:36.109> you

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
skateboarding and it's as close as you

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.229 
skateboarding and it's as close as you
ever<00:03:36.230> want<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.829> get<00:03:36.950> to<00:03:37.190> playing<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.670> simulation

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
ever want to get to playing a simulation

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.520 
ever want to get to playing a simulation
of<00:03:38.329> skateboarding<00:03:38.840> I've<00:03:39.109> been<00:03:39.260> skateboarding

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
of skateboarding I've been skateboarding

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.890 
of skateboarding I've been skateboarding
30<00:03:40.040> years<00:03:40.310> skateboarding's<00:03:41.150> art<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.690> don't

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
30 years skateboarding's art I don't

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.090 
30 years skateboarding's art I don't
want<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.140> game<00:03:42.350> that's<00:03:42.590> as<00:03:42.709> hard<00:03:42.950> as

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
want a game that's as hard as

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.330 
want a game that's as hard as
skateboarding<00:03:43.579> really

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
skateboarding really

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.220 
skateboarding really
so<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.879> actually<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.239> fairly<00:03:45.420> easy<00:03:45.840> game

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
so this is actually a fairly easy game

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.380 
so this is actually a fairly easy game
even<00:03:46.650> though<00:03:46.769> it's<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.160> simulation<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.209> but

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
even though it's a simulation of it but

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.360 
even though it's a simulation of it but
it's<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> simulation<00:03:48.780> at<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> pro<00:03:49.590> level<00:03:49.950> Danny

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
it's a simulation at a pro level Danny

things in the game and because they're

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.890 
things in the game and because they're
still<00:04:16.829> part<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.400> reality<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:18.419> get<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.780> it

not like perfect reality it's kind of
what<00:04:26.490> you'd<00:04:26.610> see<00:04:26.820> like<00:04:26.850> as<00:04:27.090> if<00:04:27.210> you're

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
what you'd see like as if you're

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.240
