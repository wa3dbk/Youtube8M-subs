00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
as nice as this just because they're a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.179 
as nice as this just because they're a
little<00:01:45.619> bit<00:01:45.740> older<00:01:46.130> like<00:01:47.380> looking<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.740> dashes

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
it has a digital tach the RPMs and

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.839

mile-per-hour<00:01:57.080> are<00:01:57.799> listed<00:01:58.640> right<00:01:58.670> there

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
mile-per-hour are listed right there

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.419 
mile-per-hour are listed right there
it's<00:01:59.780> really<00:01:59.990> easy<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.349> read<00:02:00.619> on<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.890> road<00:02:01.069> I

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
it's really easy to read on the road I

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.309 
it's really easy to read on the road I
actually<00:02:02.060> like<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.450> lot<00:02:02.569> better<00:02:02.899> than<00:02:03.170> the

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
actually like a lot better than the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.710 
actually like a lot better than the
traditional<00:02:03.799> tax<00:02:04.989> the<00:02:06.130> head<00:02:07.130> unit<00:02:07.369> is<00:02:07.720> hidden

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
traditional tax the head unit is hidden

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.229 
traditional tax the head unit is hidden
behind<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.200> little<00:02:09.470> flap<00:02:09.799> and<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.759> think<00:02:11.060> that

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
behind this little flap and I think that

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.300 
behind this little flap and I think that
makes<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.230> look<00:02:12.319> really<00:02:12.650> nice<00:02:12.769> because<00:02:13.190> it

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
makes it look really nice because it

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.449 
makes it look really nice because it
hides<00:02:13.519> it<00:02:13.870> there's<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.959> lot<00:02:15.049> of<00:02:15.290> storage<00:02:16.040> space

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
hides it there's a lot of storage space

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.520 
hides it there's a lot of storage space
in<00:02:16.880> this<00:02:17.299> car<00:02:19.150> there's<00:02:20.150> little<00:02:20.540> compartment

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
in this car there's little compartment
