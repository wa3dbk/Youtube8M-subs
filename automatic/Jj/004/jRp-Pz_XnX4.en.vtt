very very little

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.570 
very very little
this<00:02:08.789> will<00:02:09.170> procreate<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> very<00:02:10.709> very<00:02:11.220> tight

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
this will procreate a very very tight

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.460 
this will procreate a very very tight
cube<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.480> that's<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.230> is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
cube but that's it that is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
cube but that's it that is
exactly<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.100> you<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.460> because<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.240> can

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
exactly what you want because you can

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.690 
exactly what you want because you can
easily<00:02:15.750> get<00:02:16.080> all<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.410> them<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:17.100> be<00:02:17.220> about<00:02:17.400> this

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
easily get all of them to be about this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.880 
easily get all of them to be about this
size<00:02:17.760> as<00:02:18.330> soon<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.110> start<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.530> make<00:02:19.650> the

size as soon as you start to make the
gaps<00:02:20.100> bigger<00:02:20.460> it's<00:02:20.970> harder<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.600> judge<00:02:21.870> by<00:02:22.200> eye

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
gaps bigger it's harder to judge by eye

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.450 
gaps bigger it's harder to judge by eye
the<00:02:23.790> distance<00:02:24.540> between<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.380> piece<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
can get the camera to show it you can

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.630 
can get the camera to show it you can

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
get those two gaps the same move this a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.370 
get those two gaps the same move this a
little<00:02:56.820> bit

those<00:02:58.380> two<00:02:58.590> gaps<00:02:58.800> are<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.100> same<00:02:59.310> which<00:02:59.820> means

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
those two gaps are the same which means

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.290 
those two gaps are the same which means
that<00:03:00.390> these<00:03:00.630> two<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.260> these<00:03:01.770> two<00:03:01.830> all<00:03:02.790> four<00:03:03.270> of

that these two and these two all four of
these<00:03:03.540> are<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.810> same<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.680> do<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.040> with

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
these are the same then you do that with

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.810 
these are the same then you do that with
these<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.620> there<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.740> go<00:03:07.890> all<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.459> them<00:03:08.580> are

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
these and there you go all of them are

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.270 
these and there you go all of them are
at<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:08.970> same<00:03:09.270> tension<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.830> assemble

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
at the same tension and now you assemble

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.340 
at the same tension and now you assemble
your<00:03:11.310> cube<00:03:11.670> now<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.959> have<00:03:13.080> assembled

your cube you will you will probably

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.660 
your cube you will you will probably
find<00:03:16.080> out<00:03:16.320> while<00:03:16.650> you're<00:03:16.830> assembling<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.459> that

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
find out while you're assembling it that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.790 
find out while you're assembling it that
it<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.910> extremely<00:03:18.180> hard<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:19.200> get<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.380> few<00:03:19.560> pieces

screwdriver<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.470> put<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.040> into<00:03:53.430> a<00:03:53.459> screw<00:03:53.850> if

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
screwdriver and put it into a screw if

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.630 
screwdriver and put it into a screw if
you<00:03:54.780> do<00:03:55.250> 180<00:03:56.250> degrees<00:03:56.700> all<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.390> way<00:03:57.510> around<00:03:57.810> on

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
you do 180 degrees all the way around on

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.580 
you do 180 degrees all the way around on
every<00:03:59.640> side<00:03:59.910> then<00:04:00.450> all<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.780> them<00:04:01.110> will<00:04:01.350> still

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
every side then all of them will still

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.070 
every side then all of them will still
be<00:04:01.620> at<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.860> exact<00:04:02.280> same<00:04:02.519> tension<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.900> what<00:04:04.049> I

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
be at the exact same tension so what I

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.110 
be at the exact same tension so what I
do<00:04:04.230> from<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.769> stage<00:04:05.040> when<00:04:05.459> it's<00:04:05.580> extremely

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
do from this stage when it's extremely

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.910 
do from this stage when it's extremely
tight<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.750> can't<00:04:07.019> even<00:04:07.230> pop<00:04:07.440> out<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.650> piece

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
tight and I can't even pop out a piece

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.130 
tight and I can't even pop out a piece
without<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.250> screwdriver<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.570> go<00:04:09.720> around<00:04:09.989> to

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
without a screwdriver is I go around to

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.090 
without a screwdriver is I go around to
each<00:04:10.170> side<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.860> loosen<00:04:11.430> them<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.940> full<00:04:12.630> turn

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
each side and loosen them a full turn

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.840 
each side and loosen them a full turn
100<00:04:14.480> 360<00:04:15.480> degrees<00:04:16.340> do<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.519> on<00:04:17.669> every<00:04:17.910> side

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
100 360 degrees do that on every side

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.520 
100 360 degrees do that on every side
after<00:04:20.850> loosening<00:04:21.269> each<00:04:21.599> screw<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.289> same

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
after loosening each screw the same

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.510 
after loosening each screw the same
amount<00:04:23.030> 360<00:04:24.030> degrees<00:04:24.330> one<00:04:24.750> turn<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.979> can<00:04:26.190> tell

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
amount 360 degrees one turn you can tell

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.020 
amount 360 degrees one turn you can tell
the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
the

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.450 
the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
the cube is already a lot better you can

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.240 
the cube is already a lot better you can
finger<00:04:29.820> trick<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:31.110> can<00:04:31.320> cut<00:04:31.590> corners<00:04:31.889> with

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
finger trick it you can cut corners with

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.660 
finger trick it you can cut corners with
it

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
it

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.360 
it
press<00:04:33.510> not<00:04:33.900> necessarily<00:04:34.710> as<00:04:34.830> good<00:04:35.010> as<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.220> may

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
press not necessarily as good as you may

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.670 
press not necessarily as good as you may
want<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.700> but<00:04:36.450> it's<00:04:36.570> already<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:37.110> very<00:04:37.440> good

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
want to but it's already a very good

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.040 
want to but it's already a very good
cube<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.130> at<00:04:38.610> this<00:04:38.790> point<00:04:39.090> this<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.660> where<00:04:39.990> I

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
cube and at this point this is where I

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.129 
cube and at this point this is where I
would<00:04:40.560> pop<00:04:41.310> out<00:04:41.490> one<00:04:42.480> edge<00:04:42.720> two<00:04:43.410> corners<00:04:45.139> take

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
would pop out one edge two corners take

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.159 
would pop out one edge two corners take
my<00:04:46.320> silicon<00:04:46.770> spray<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.370> spray<00:04:48.240> three<00:04:48.840> squirts

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
my silicon spray and spray three squirts

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.560 
my silicon spray and spray three squirts
inside<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.980> jus<00:04:50.220> glue<00:04:50.430> or<00:04:50.700> as<00:04:51.150> much<00:04:51.330> as<00:04:51.389> you

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
inside of jus glue or as much as you

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.690 
inside of jus glue or as much as you
want<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.990> silicone<00:04:52.470> but<00:04:52.950> probably<00:04:53.370> about<00:04:53.520> the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
want of silicone but probably about the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.300 
want of silicone but probably about the
same<00:04:53.940> three<00:04:54.419> to<00:04:54.540> five<00:04:54.720> squirts<00:04:58.130> then<00:04:59.130> once

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
same three to five squirts then once

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.700 
same three to five squirts then once
you've<00:04:59.460> done<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.840> if<00:05:00.840> you<00:05:00.900> use<00:05:01.260> jus<00:05:01.500> glue

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
you've done that if you use jus glue

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.600 
you've done that if you use jus glue
quickly<00:05:02.700> put<00:05:02.910> the<00:05:03.060> corners<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.290> edge<00:05:05.010> back<00:05:05.370> in

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
quickly put the corners and edge back in

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.150 
quickly put the corners and edge back in
and<00:05:05.910> start<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.630> worked<00:05:06.780> in<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:08.000> usually<00:05:09.000> do<00:05:09.419> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
and start to worked in I usually do the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.030 
and start to worked in I usually do the
24<00:05:11.160> move<00:05:11.460> thing<00:05:11.790> which<00:05:12.690> is<00:05:12.870> twelve<00:05:13.260> sets<00:05:13.680> of

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
24 move thing which is twelve sets of

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.120 
24 move thing which is twelve sets of
the<00:05:14.760> double<00:05:15.150> finger<00:05:15.480> trick<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:19.500> work<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:19.950> into

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
the double finger trick to work it into

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.120 
the double finger trick to work it into
every<00:05:20.580> piece<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.710> then<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:22.800> can<00:05:22.950> start

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
every piece and then you can start

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.570 
every piece and then you can start
randomly<00:05:23.490> scrambling<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:28.160> now<00:05:29.160> as<00:05:29.340> you<00:05:29.430> can

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
randomly scrambling it now as you can

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.510 
randomly scrambling it now as you can
tell<00:05:29.820> this<00:05:30.600> cube<00:05:30.930> is<00:05:31.050> already<00:05:31.350> very<00:05:31.530> nice<00:05:31.830> but

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
tell this cube is already very nice but

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.219 
tell this cube is already very nice but
now<00:05:32.640> all<00:05:32.820> you<00:05:32.940> need<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.180> do<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.810> final

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
now all you need to do is the final

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.469 
now all you need to do is the final
adjustments<00:05:34.760> play<00:05:35.760> around<00:05:35.970> with<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.330> a<00:05:36.390> little

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
adjustments play around with it a little

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.060 
adjustments play around with it a little
bit<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.930> if<00:05:37.169> you<00:05:37.290> think<00:05:37.500> it's<00:05:37.620> too<00:05:37.800> tight

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
bit and if you think it's too tight

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.150 
bit and if you think it's too tight
loosen<00:05:38.790> all<00:05:39.030> of<00:05:39.240> them<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:39.810> same<00:05:40.050> amount<00:05:40.200> so

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
loosen all of them the same amount so

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.190 
loosen all of them the same amount so
for<00:05:41.430> me<00:05:41.520> a<00:05:41.550> route<00:05:41.820> about<00:05:42.120> now<00:05:42.450> I<00:05:42.720> would<00:05:42.990> loosen

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
for me a route about now I would loosen

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.790 
for me a route about now I would loosen
all<00:05:43.470> of<00:05:43.500> them<00:05:43.860> half<00:05:44.460> a<00:05:44.580> turn<00:05:45.080> which<00:05:46.080> is<00:05:46.110> 180

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
all of them half a turn which is 180

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.440 
all of them half a turn which is 180
degrees<00:05:47.160> and<00:05:48.110> there<00:05:49.110> is<00:05:49.380> your<00:05:49.650> final<00:05:50.130> product

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
degrees and there is your final product

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.570 
degrees and there is your final product
this<00:05:51.450> is<00:05:51.510> what<00:05:51.870> your<00:05:52.020> cube<00:05:52.350> tensions<00:05:53.160> will<00:05:53.400> be

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
this is what your cube tensions will be

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.340 
this is what your cube tensions will be
unless<00:05:54.270> you<00:05:54.330> change<00:05:54.720> them<00:05:54.930> obviously<00:05:57.350> but

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
unless you change them obviously but

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.260 
unless you change them obviously but
this<00:05:58.500> is<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.650> very<00:05:58.890> nice<00:05:59.039> cube<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.669> will<00:06:00.120> be

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
this is a very nice cube I will be

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.390 
this is a very nice cube I will be
adjusting<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.840> ever<00:06:01.050> so<00:06:01.320> slightly<00:06:01.620> after<00:06:02.100> I

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
adjusting it ever so slightly after I

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.730 
adjusting it ever so slightly after I
test<00:06:02.700> solve<00:06:02.910> it<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.060> couple<00:06:03.240> times<00:06:03.479> but<00:06:03.810> as<00:06:04.560> you

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
test solve it a couple times but as you

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.380 
test solve it a couple times but as you
can<00:06:04.890> see<00:06:05.070> from<00:06:05.250> this<00:06:05.460> tutorial<00:06:05.640> you<00:06:06.120> can<00:06:06.270> get

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
can see from this tutorial you can get
