numbers and everything else would show

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.250 
numbers and everything else would show
up<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.340> obviously<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.060> can't<00:03:00.390> have<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.630> and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
up and obviously I can't have that and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.980 
up and obviously I can't have that and
I'm<00:03:01.590> not<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.280> good<00:03:02.790> at<00:03:02.850> editing<00:03:03.150> out<00:03:03.600> videos

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
I'm not that good at editing out videos

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.780 
I'm not that good at editing out videos
to<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.350> point<00:03:04.590> where<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:04.830> could<00:03:05.040> after<00:03:05.220> how<00:03:05.459> or

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
to the point where I could after how or

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.010 
to the point where I could after how or
blur<00:03:06.090> out<00:03:06.270> phone<00:03:06.570> numbers<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.540> really

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
blur out phone numbers so it is a really

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.410 
blur out phone numbers so it is a really
really<00:03:10.500> nice<00:03:10.860> f<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.700> could<00:03:11.940> tell<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.270> they

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
really nice f and I could tell that they

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.840 
really nice f and I could tell that they
went<00:03:12.660> into<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.900> lot<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.110> detail<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:14.190> develop<00:03:14.700> it

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
went into a lot of detail to develop it

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.850 
went into a lot of detail to develop it
so<00:03:15.030> that's<00:03:15.270> why<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.780> not<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.440> free

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
so that's why it is not a free

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.699 
so that's why it is not a free
application<00:03:17.209> but<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.300> does<00:03:18.570> hook<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.110> up<00:03:19.170> with

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
application but it does hook you up with

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.949 
application but it does hook you up with
a<00:03:19.739> free<00:03:20.310> three-day<00:03:20.820> trial<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.810> would
