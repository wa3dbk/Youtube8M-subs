I was a duck run cowboy you might say

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.789 
I was a duck run cowboy you might say
because<00:00:03.179> I<00:00:03.330> had<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> little<00:00:04.350> horse<00:00:04.560> from<00:00:04.740> the

because I had a little horse from the
time<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.040> was<00:00:05.310> well<00:00:05.640> first<00:00:05.910> my<00:00:06.089> first<00:00:06.299> horse<00:00:06.569> was

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
time I was well first my first horse was

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.309 
time I was well first my first horse was
a<00:00:06.810> mule

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
a mule

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.339 
a mule
and<00:00:07.770> then<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.970> dad<00:00:09.179> bought<00:00:09.389> me<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.599> little<00:00:09.809> EXO

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
and then my dad bought me a little EXO

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.789 
and then my dad bought me a little EXO
key<00:00:10.590> racer<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.190> she<00:00:11.790> was<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> terrific<00:00:12.620> horses

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
key racer and she was a terrific horses

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.919 
key racer and she was a terrific horses
her<00:00:14.070> name<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.429> babe<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.059> wrote<00:00:15.630> her<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
her name was babe and I wrote her to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.870 
her name was babe and I wrote her to
school<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.410> church<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.039> different<00:00:17.640> places

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
school on church and different places

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
school on church and different places
and<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.990> that's<00:00:19.199> why<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.439> learned<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.740> ride<00:00:19.920> I

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and so that's why I learned to ride I

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.529 
and so that's why I learned to ride I
learned<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.369> ride<00:00:20.550> bareback<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.150> never<00:00:21.330> had<00:00:21.510> a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
learned to ride bareback I never had a

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
learned to ride bareback I never had a
saddle<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.769> that's<00:00:22.949> probably<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
saddle but I think that's probably the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
saddle but I think that's probably the
best<00:00:23.550> way<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.850> learn<00:00:24.119> because<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.960> get

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
best way to learn because you you get

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
best way to learn because you you get
the<00:00:25.199> rhythm<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.619> horse<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.890> lot<00:00:26.010> quicker<00:00:26.250> is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the rhythm of the horse a lot quicker is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.700 
the rhythm of the horse a lot quicker is
that<00:00:27.390> tough<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.750> mean<00:00:27.779> I'd<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.019> afraid<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that tough I mean I'd be afraid that the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470 
that tough I mean I'd be afraid that the
horse<00:00:28.890> would<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.099> falling<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.670> top<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
horse would be falling on top of me I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.179 
horse would be falling on top of me I
mean<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.810> very<00:00:30.990> picture<00:00:31.320> wearing<00:00:31.679> thick<00:00:31.980> well

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
mean the very picture wearing thick well

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.650 
mean the very picture wearing thick well
not<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.969> horse<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.360> trigger
