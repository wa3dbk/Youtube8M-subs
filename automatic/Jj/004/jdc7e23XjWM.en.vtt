may not look good on my head but they're

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.370 
may not look good on my head but they're
awesome<00:01:58.890> by<00:01:59.159> themselves<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.960> whatever

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
awesome by themselves but it's whatever

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.330 
awesome by themselves but it's whatever
um<00:02:01.680> next<00:02:02.430> thing<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.180> benq<00:02:03.869> monitor<00:02:04.340> it's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
um next thing is the benq monitor it's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.910 
um next thing is the benq monitor it's
the<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:07.170> official<00:02:07.560> one<00:02:07.680> for

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the one that was on the official one for

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.969 
the one that was on the official one for
the<00:02:07.979> circuit<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.700> 2013<00:02:09.690> it's<00:02:10.649> about<00:02:10.709> two

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the circuit for 2013 it's about two

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.190 
the circuit for 2013 it's about two
hundred<00:02:11.069> dollars<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:12.090> millisecond<00:02:12.629> response

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
hundred dollars to millisecond response

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.780 
hundred dollars to millisecond response
time<00:02:13.580> 1080hd<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.170> pretty<00:02:16.349> nice

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
time 1080hd so it's it's a pretty nice

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
time 1080hd so it's it's a pretty nice
monitor<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:17.940> got<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> nice<00:02:18.239> little<00:02:18.450> stand

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
monitor it's got a nice little stand

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.259 
monitor it's got a nice little stand
that<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.110> comes<00:02:19.319> with<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.680> everything<00:02:20.269> so

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
that it comes with and everything so

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.570 
that it comes with and everything so
yeah<00:02:21.629> it's<00:02:21.840> pretty<00:02:21.989> nice<00:02:22.200> ah<00:02:22.530> next<00:02:23.400> thing<00:02:23.550> is

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
yeah it's pretty nice ah next thing is

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.320 
yeah it's pretty nice ah next thing is
my<00:02:24.120> xbox<00:02:24.330> 360<00:02:25.019> soon<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:25.950> an<00:02:26.069> xbox<00:02:26.459> one<00:02:26.730> once

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
my xbox 360 soon to be an xbox one once

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.119 
my xbox 360 soon to be an xbox one once
you<00:02:27.720> know<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.840> save<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.290> money<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
you know I save up money and it's on the

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.059 
you know I save up money and it's on the
circuit<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.550> everything<00:02:30.470> next<00:02:31.470> thing<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.680> my

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
circuit and everything next thing is my

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.250 
circuit and everything next thing is my
mixamp<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.410> Astro<00:02:35.420> 2013<00:02:36.420> edition<00:02:36.750> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
mixamp it's the Astro 2013 edition I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.479 
mixamp it's the Astro 2013 edition I
can't<00:02:37.470> really<00:02:37.560> bring<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:37.890> closer<00:02:38.130> because<00:02:38.340> I

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
can't really bring it closer because I

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.120 
can't really bring it closer because I
still<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.849> plugged<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:40.140> um<00:02:40.319> there's

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
still have it plugged in but um there's

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.500 
still have it plugged in but um there's
two<00:02:41.250> problems<00:02:41.400> with<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.880> number<00:02:42.060> one<00:02:42.239> it

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
two problems with it number one it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.039 
two problems with it number one it
doesn't<00:02:42.870> turn<00:02:43.530> off<00:02:43.769> ever<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.849> also<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
doesn't turn off ever and also the

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.539 
doesn't turn off ever and also the
optical<00:02:46.500> cable<00:02:46.799> is<00:02:46.890> really<00:02:47.130> loose<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.489> it

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
optical cable is really loose and it

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.420 
optical cable is really loose and it
just<00:02:47.700> comes<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.209> out<00:02:48.269> really<00:02:48.569> easy<00:02:49.069> but<00:02:50.069> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
just comes in and out really easy but it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.030 
just comes in and out really easy but it
still<00:02:50.819> works<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.810> problem<00:02:52.200> was<00:02:52.650> probably

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
still works the problem was probably

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.620 
still works the problem was probably
caused<00:02:53.340> by<00:02:53.340> my<00:02:53.819> brother<00:02:54.030> dropping<00:02:54.480> it

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
caused by my brother dropping it

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.380 
caused by my brother dropping it
multiple<00:02:55.620> times<00:02:55.680> while<00:02:56.549> he<00:02:56.730> was<00:02:56.790> using<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
multiple times while he was using the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.509 
multiple times while he was using the
xbox<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.140> all<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.590> my<00:02:58.650> equipment<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.430> he

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
xbox and all of my equipment that he

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.960 
xbox and all of my equipment that he
never<00:02:59.730> paid<00:02:59.910> for<00:02:59.940> um<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:01.049> anyway<00:03:01.910> next<00:03:02.910> thing

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
never paid for um but anyway next thing

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.780 
never paid for um but anyway next thing
I<00:03:03.360> guess<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.840> games<00:03:04.049> I've<00:03:04.260> got<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.980> only

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
I guess is the games I've got so only

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.530 
I guess is the games I've got so only
three<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.329> these<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.480> mine<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:09.209> ghosts

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
three of these are mine so I have ghosts

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.870 
three of these are mine so I have ghosts
I<00:03:09.870> know<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:10.920> kind<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.099> hard<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.310> see<00:03:11.549> with<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
I know it's kind of hard to see with the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.780 
I know it's kind of hard to see with the
brightness<00:03:12.390> settings<00:03:12.840> I've<00:03:13.019> goes<00:03:13.549> black<00:03:14.549> ops

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
brightness settings I've goes black ops

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.590 
brightness settings I've goes black ops
2<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.440> then<00:03:16.440> MW<00:03:16.980> 3<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.549> 3<00:03:17.790> call<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.060> duties<00:03:18.359> and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
2 and then MW 3 so 3 call of duties and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.620 
2 and then MW 3 so 3 call of duties and
then<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.870> next<00:03:18.959> ones<00:03:19.260> are<00:03:19.350> my<00:03:19.470> brothers<00:03:20.630> halo

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
then the next ones are my brothers halo

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:29.750 
then the next ones are my brothers halo
4<00:03:22.430> m<00:03:23.430> halo<00:03:24.329> reach<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:26.359> borderlands<00:03:27.359> 2<00:03:28.130> so<00:03:29.130> yeah

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
4 m halo reach and borderlands 2 so yeah

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.449 
4 m halo reach and borderlands 2 so yeah
we<00:03:29.910> have<00:03:30.319> one<00:03:31.319> two<00:03:31.620> three<00:03:31.650> four<00:03:32.220> five<00:03:32.400> six

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
we have one two three four five six

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.240 
we have one two three four five six
games<00:03:33.060> that's<00:03:33.870> all<00:03:34.019> we<00:03:34.109> have<00:03:34.230> for<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.500> 360<00:03:34.980> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
games that's all we have for the 360 and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.319 
games that's all we have for the 360 and
then<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.459> saw<00:03:35.639> that<00:03:35.850> there's<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.120> little

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
then you saw that there's a little

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.539 
then you saw that there's a little
notepad<00:03:36.540> over<00:03:36.930> here<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.079> write<00:03:37.380> down<00:03:38.340> any

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.039 
that I don't have to look at the

this<00:04:21.390> is<00:04:21.539> an<00:04:21.659> interesting<00:04:21.900> little<00:04:22.229> setup<00:04:22.470> I've

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
this is an interesting little setup I've

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.300 
this is an interesting little setup I've
unplugged<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.460> can<00:04:23.640> show<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:23.849> guys

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
unplugged it so I can show you guys

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.950 
unplugged it so I can show you guys
and<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.060> might<00:04:25.120> be<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.270> little<00:04:25.389> bit<00:04:25.570> hard<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.780> see

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
and it might be a little bit hard to see

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.280 
and it might be a little bit hard to see
because<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.350> bowl<00:04:26.530> is<00:04:26.740> white<00:04:27.010> but<00:04:28.290> basically

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
because the bowl is white but basically

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.870 
because the bowl is white but basically
it's<00:04:29.740> an<00:04:29.860> avermedia<00:04:30.340> live<00:04:30.520> gamer<00:04:30.760> portable

it's an avermedia live gamer portable

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
I've got some chopsticks propping him up

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.280 
I've got some chopsticks propping him up
on<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:33.460> bowl<00:04:33.669> and<00:04:34.210> what<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.419> probably<00:04:34.750> can't

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
on this bowl and what you probably can't

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.020 
on this bowl and what you probably can't
see<00:04:35.410> due<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.010> player<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.700> fact<00:04:36.910> that

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
see due to the player is the fact that

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.060 
see due to the player is the fact that
there<00:04:37.270> is<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.389> bag<00:04:37.660> of<00:04:37.900> water<00:04:37.950> normally<00:04:38.950> it

there is a bag of water normally it

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.530 
there is a bag of water normally it
would<00:04:39.160> be<00:04:39.280> ice<00:04:39.460> but<00:04:39.790> I'm<00:04:39.880> not<00:04:40.000> recording<00:04:40.150> right

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
would be ice but I'm not recording right

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.140 
would be ice but I'm not recording right
now<00:04:40.570> with<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:42.250> what<00:04:42.639> I've<00:04:42.760> been<00:04:42.790> doing<00:04:43.000> is

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
now with it and what I've been doing is

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.340 
now with it and what I've been doing is
I've<00:04:43.300> been<00:04:43.360> putting<00:04:43.600> my<00:04:43.750> capture<00:04:44.050> card<00:04:44.080> in<00:04:44.290> the

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
I've been putting my capture card in the

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.990 
I've been putting my capture card in the
freezer<00:04:44.560> for<00:04:44.680> 20<00:04:44.860> minutes<00:04:45.280> like<00:04:45.550> somebody

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
freezer for 20 minutes like somebody

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.610 
freezer for 20 minutes like somebody
recommended<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.630> me<00:04:46.660> and<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:46.990> was<00:04:47.110> working<00:04:47.440> and

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
recommended to me and it was working and

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.100 
recommended to me and it was working and
then<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.400> started<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.850> not<00:04:49.270> work<00:04:49.450> as<00:04:49.630> long<00:04:49.840> so

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
then it started to not work as long so

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.350 
then it started to not work as long so
I'd<00:04:50.200> put<00:04:50.470> so<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.340> did<00:04:51.580> this<00:04:51.700> little<00:04:51.850> setup<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.330> I

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
I'd put so I did this little setup and I

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.570 
I'd put so I did this little setup and I
put<00:04:52.570> I'd<00:04:52.990> put<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.320> bag<00:04:53.530> ice<00:04:53.800> underneath<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.430> and

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
put I'd put a bag ice underneath it and

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.480 
put I'd put a bag ice underneath it and
the<00:04:54.669> idea<00:04:54.910> behind<00:04:55.090> this<00:04:55.419> was<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.979> get<00:04:56.979> parents

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
the idea behind this was to get parents

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.280 
the idea behind this was to get parents
of<00:04:57.610> air<00:04:57.790> going<00:04:57.820> underneath<00:04:58.360> it<00:04:58.690> that<00:04:58.870> were

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
of air going underneath it that were

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.560 
of air going underneath it that were
cold<00:04:59.620> so<00:04:59.889> that<00:05:00.010> they<00:05:00.130> would<00:05:00.280> continue<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.820> cool

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
cold so that they would continue to cool

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.950 
cold so that they would continue to cool
the<00:05:01.690> capture<00:05:02.050> card<00:05:02.080> off<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:03.340> worked<00:05:03.580> and

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
the capture card off and it worked and

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.240 
the capture card off and it worked and
now<00:05:04.960> it's<00:05:05.139> not<00:05:05.200> working<00:05:05.350> anymore<00:05:05.800> it's<00:05:06.040> works

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
now it's not working anymore it's works

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.250 
now it's not working anymore it's works
for<00:05:06.460> like<00:05:06.580> one<00:05:07.270> or<00:05:07.300> two<00:05:07.450> minutes<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.050> then

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
for like one or two minutes and then

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.110 
for like one or two minutes and then
it's<00:05:08.290> done<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:08.950> doesn't<00:05:09.250> recognize<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.880> on<00:05:10.000> my

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
it's done it doesn't recognize it on my

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.550 
it's done it doesn't recognize it on my
computer<00:05:10.180> anymore<00:05:10.720> it<00:05:10.960> gives<00:05:11.110> me<00:05:11.229> that<00:05:11.350> blue

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
computer anymore it gives me that blue

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.940 
computer anymore it gives me that blue
ring<00:05:11.770> of<00:05:11.919> death<00:05:12.570> but<00:05:13.570> yeah<00:05:14.080> um<00:05:15.450> next<00:05:16.450> thing

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
ring of death but yeah um next thing

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.800 
ring of death but yeah um next thing
actually<00:05:17.950> last<00:05:18.250> couple<00:05:18.580> things<00:05:18.790> i<00:05:19.030> have<00:05:19.540> my

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.460 
actually last couple things i have my
router<00:05:20.169> back<00:05:20.500> here<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.270> then<00:05:22.270> i<00:05:22.630> think<00:05:23.229> this

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
router back here and then i think this

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.650 
router back here and then i think this
is<00:05:23.530> a<00:05:23.710> modem<00:05:24.190> it's<00:05:24.760> hard<00:05:25.000> to<00:05:25.060> see<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.210> that's<00:05:25.540> all

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
is a modem it's hard to see I that's all

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.150 
is a modem it's hard to see I that's all
plugged<00:05:25.900> in<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.260> stuff<00:05:26.530> I<00:05:26.740> can't<00:05:26.950> really<00:05:27.070> move

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
it I don't really know the difference

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
trying to record so yeah that's just a

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.310 
trying to record so yeah that's just a
little<00:05:50.110> black<00:05:50.289> table<00:05:50.770> fold-out<00:05:51.700> thing<00:05:52.320> it's

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
little black table fold-out thing it's

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.840 
little black table fold-out thing it's
real<00:05:53.500> inexpensive<00:05:53.950> and<00:05:54.370> everything<00:05:54.610> but<00:05:54.729> it

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
real inexpensive and everything but it

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.290 
real inexpensive and everything but it
works<00:05:55.030> so<00:05:55.539> that's<00:05:55.810> what<00:05:55.930> i've<00:05:56.020> been<00:05:56.080> using<00:05:56.350> and

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
works so that's what i've been using and

works so that's what i've been using and
a<00:05:58.320> last<00:05:59.320> thing<00:05:59.560> i<00:05:59.680> guess<00:05:59.860> i<00:06:00.039> should<00:06:00.220> point<00:06:00.370> out

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
a last thing i guess i should point out

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.310 
a last thing i guess i should point out
is<00:06:00.669> all<00:06:00.910> the<00:06:01.120> cables<00:06:01.690> back<00:06:01.840> there<00:06:02.080> I'm<00:06:02.229> gonna

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320
