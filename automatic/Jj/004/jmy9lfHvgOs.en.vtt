there's actually two that I saw that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.729 
there's actually two that I saw that
were<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.670> critical<00:00:39.180> condition<00:00:39.690> these<00:00:40.500> two

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
were in critical condition these two

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.869 
were in critical condition these two
were<00:00:43.739> pretty<00:00:44.550> much<00:00:44.780> pecked<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> death<00:00:45.960> I

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
were pretty much pecked to death I

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.700 
were pretty much pecked to death I
thought<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:48.030> were<00:00:48.090> dead<00:00:48.360> at<00:00:48.539> first<00:00:48.809> but<00:00:49.559> then

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
thought they were dead at first but then

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
thought they were dead at first but then
when<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> saw<00:00:50.100> them<00:00:50.250> breathing<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.879> realized

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
when I saw them breathing I realized

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.260 
when I saw them breathing I realized
that<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.600> needed<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.170> them<00:00:52.320> get<00:00:52.829> them<00:00:52.890> out

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
that I needed to get them get them out

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.760 
that I needed to get them get them out
as<00:00:54.270> soon<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.600> possible<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:55.469> there<00:00:55.680> were

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
as soon as possible because there were

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.189 
as soon as possible because there were
some<00:00:55.949> chickens<00:00:56.420> mixed<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.570> there<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
some chickens mixed in there with the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.729 
some chickens mixed in there with the
other<00:00:58.379> pigeons<00:00:58.879> when<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.940> first<00:01:00.210> saw<00:01:00.359> them<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
other pigeons when I first saw them I

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.799 
other pigeons when I first saw them I
wanted<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.399> take<00:01:02.579> these<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.090> but<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:03.719> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
wanted to just take these two but then I

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.750 
wanted to just take these two but then I
realized<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.799> other<00:01:04.979> ones<00:01:05.280> are

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
realized that the other ones are

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.609 
realized that the other ones are
probably<00:01:06.630> gonna<00:01:06.720> get<00:01:06.869> pecked<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> death<00:01:07.290> as

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
probably gonna get pecked to death as

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.270 
probably gonna get pecked to death as
well<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.610> decided<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.390> take<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:09.720> six<00:01:10.280> I'm
